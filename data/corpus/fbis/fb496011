<F P=106> [By Cao Min: "State Introduces Job Qualifications for All </F>
Employees"] 
  [Text] The government will introduce internationally- 
recognised qualifications for the blue and white collar 
employees to foster a skilled, flexible workforce. 
  Every worker in the country, Chinese or foreign, can apply 
for a professional certificate which identifies their skills and 
qualifications, under new regulations issued by the ministries 
of labour and personnel. 
  Government officials said professional certificates will 
help 
job-seekers to find positions for which they are qualified. 
  The rules aim to set professional standards and promote a 
competitive employment market for job-seekers, said the two 
ministries. 
  The new certificates will be mandatory for government and 
enterprise vacancies. 
  Applicants for the credentials will have to demonstrate 
their 
on- the-job skills and professional qualifications. 
  Private practice lawyers, doctors and accountants, will have 
to apply for professional licences under the new system. 
  The qualification certificate covers two parts: One is the 
rudimentary standard of the knowledge, skill and ability of a 
worker in certain profession; the other is the necessary skill 
and ability required for an individual to engage in a private 
professional practice, which is controlled by the government. 
  The labour and personnel departments of the State Council 
will assess workers' educational backgrounds, examination 
records and on- the-job performance for the paper qualification. 
  The new system will encourage employees to improve their 
skills and adapt themselves to a market economy, said the Labour 
Ministry. 
  And the certificates issued by the Chinese Government will 
be 
valid in other countries. 
  The Regulations on the Qualification of Professionals aim to 
promote professional standards, particularly among the young. 
However, quite a number of young workers today are indifferent 
to professional skills. 
  Almost 48 percent of the country's 120-million-strong urban 
workforce have no professional training. 
  Nearly 70 percent of them are manual labourers. 
  The unskilled workforce has hindered the efficiency and 
development of new and hi-tech enterprises. 
  Government concern led to last year's professional appraisal 
plan, which replaced the old eight-grade worker system. 
  Skilled workers were given technician or senior technician 
grades by the Labour Ministry. 
  And a million young workers took part in a nationwide 
professional training contest sponsored by several government 
departments. The certificate system would encourage more 
employees improving their quality to adapt themselves to market 
economy, according to officials.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 4 KYODO -- China has postponed the 
start of operations of its first interbank foreign exchange 
system for two weeks from the originally set schedule from 
Monday [4 April]. 
  Informed sources said the postponement is due to a delay in 
preparations. 
  The China foreign exchange trading center is the culmination 
of China's ongoing unification of its dual track exchange rate 
system. 
  It will enable the renminbi (Chinese yuan) to be freely 
convertible with other currencies within six years. 
  The system has so far been given a test-run, and will now 
formally start operations from April 18, the sources said.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "New Law Against Unfair Trade Is Being </F>
Weighed"] 
  [Text] China is considering drafting a new law against 
trade monopolies. 
  Such a law could help the government in shifting the country 
away from a centrally planned economy, said an official with the 
State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce. 
  China already has a law against unfair competition, which 
took effect in December, but the government acknowledges that it 
is not strong enough to suppress monopolistic practices, said Ma 
Yanling, an official of the administration's Economic Checking 
Department. 
  China's drive to build a market oriented economic system 
requires a legal structure to plug loopholes that allow fake 
products, false advertising, giveaway sales and contract 
kickbacks, she added. 
  The expected law against monopolistic practices is also in 
step with the country's efforts to restructure its business 
system to conform with fair-trade rules set down by the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which it hopes to rejoin. 
  The government intends the new law to ban regional 
restrictive business practices and unfair restraint of trade by 
public utilities such as cooking gas and electrical supply 
companies. 
  But, Ma noted, it will be at least another year before such 
a 
law gets final approval from the National People's Congress 
(NPC). 
  To prepare for drafting the legislation, legal officials are 
busily consulting foreign experts, especially those in developed 
countries. 
  Chinese efforts to draw on foreign experience and insight 
regarding laws against unfair competition were spotlighted by 
two major international seminars last month in Shanghai and 
Shenzhen. 
  The United Nations' Conference on Trade and Development 
(UNCTD) and the State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce 
jointly sponsored the seminars with more than 150 participants 
from Chinese and foreign agencies. 
  They were intended to provide an opportunity for Chinese 
legal officials to exchange their experiences on the 
implementation of the anti-unfair competition law. 
  They also were expected to help Chinese officials learn from 
foreign experiences in preparation for drafting the law against 
monopolies, said Wang Zhifang, another official with the State 
Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce. 
  Besides the United Nations officials, German and British 
officials also participated in the seminars, which were the 
first international meetings of their kind jointly sponsored by 
the UN and the administration. 
  Gan Guoping, Vice-Minister of the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce, told the meetings that the government was 
keen to strengthen co-operation with the UN and foreign legal 
officials to tighten restrictions against unfair competitive and 
restrictive business practices. 
  China will carry on the campaign against unfair competition 
and will work out new laws banning trade monopolies in its bids 
to bring about an orderly transition from central planning to a 
socialist market-oriented economy, he added. 
  Realization of this ambition requires closer co-operation 
and 
a frequent exchanges with foreign legal institutions, Gan noted. 
  According to official sources, illegal lotteries to promote 
sales, kickbacks in awarding contracts and regional restrictions 
on businesses designed to protect local industries are still 
widespread in China.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "New Rules To Police Foreign-Asset Cheats"] </F>
  [Text] Trade investigators will look into foreign 
companies that over-value their joint venture assets under new 
rules coming in next month. 
  The aim is to improve government checks on foreign fixed 
asset investment, said the State Administration for the 
Inspection of Import and Export Commodities. 
  Many joint venture investors have cheated their Chinese 
partners by supplying outdated, overvalued equipment and 
technology . 
  "By overvaluing their assets, some foreign investors have 
been claiming a disproportionately large share of profits, which 
are nailed down according to each sides' stated investment," the 
administration explained. 
  Some foreigners were taking the advantage of Chinese 
businessmen's lack of knowledge of world markets, the 
administration said. 
  The Ministry of Finance and trade investigators will 
determine responsibility for any false investments that they 
discover, under the new rules. 
  And the neglect of duty by government inspection officials 
will not go unpunished. 
  The regulations come under five headings. 
  They cover the activities of government assessors and the 
evaluation procedure. 
  They also provide guidelines on how to assess the real value 
of foreign business investments. 
  The rules aim to build up a legal system that will protect 
the interests of both Chinese and foreign investors, the trade 
administration said. 
  The rapid growth of overseas investment in the country in 
recent years has necessitated the new rules. 
  China has more than 170,000 foreign-invested ventures, with 
a 
gross investment of $60 billion, according to latest statistics. 
  More and more foreign investors have been using technology 
and equipment as part of their investment to joint ventures.

  [Text] Beijing, 23 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Since the 
beginning of this year, people have been reporting problems of 
exaggerating industrial output value which have emerged in some 
localities. Consequently, the State Statistical Bureau and the 
Ministry of Supervision dispatched investigative teams to 
various localities to investigate. The findings show that such 
situations indeed exist and are even quite widespread. In some 
localities, the problem is quite serious. As a result, the 
State Statistical Bureau and the Ministry of Supervision have 
issued a circular on the problem of exaggerating industrial 
output value in some localities. 
  Party and government leaders in some localities have 
exaggerated their achievements by falsely reporting their output 
value, but under pressure from the leadership, the local 
statistical departments, instead of upholding principle, have 
resorted to deception in violating the provisions of the 
"Statistical Law." The idea of blindly competing for growth 
rate among party and government leaders in some localities also 
has resulted in some towns, townships, and enterprises 
exaggerating their industrial output value. For example, the 
Taicang City petrochemical plant consistently exaggerated its 
output value between June 1992 and March this year, and it was 
not until the investigation team had arrived in that city to 
investigate that the practice was rectified. The plant's actual 
industrial output value was 115 million yuan last year, but it 
was reported to the city statistical bureau as 173 million yuan. 
This represents an exaggeration of 58.34 million yuan, 
accounting for 33.7 percent of the reported figure. In the 
city's Shaxi Township, the nine village-run industrial 
enterprises, which have comparatively large output values, 
exaggerated their output value by as much as 25.8 percent of the 
total output value of village-run enterprises in the whole 
township. 
  Moreover, some localities have changed the national unified 
method of calculation without authorization, causing a false 
increase in output value growth rate. 
  The circular points out: The practice of fraud in 
statistical work, in violation of the "Statistical Law," has 
deprived the state macroeconomic regulation and control of 
reliable, scientific figures. An erroneous policy decision made 
on the basis of erroneous information will cause major losses to 
the national economy.

<F P=106> [By Liu Weiling: "Response To Beijing's 1st Offering Is </F>
Just Tepid"] 
  [Text] Bankers in Beijing smiled last week as money flew 
into the city during its first public stock offering. 
  The three-day issuance, from March 27 to 29, raised 1.786 
billion yuan ($205.29 million). Investors had to deposit cash 
for receipts that will be used in a lottery to determine who can 
buy the shares. The money is being held in Beijing financial 
institutions. 
  However, the capital's first public offering did not meet 
the 
expectations of securities firms and the four companies floating 
the shares. The four companies are Beijing Department Store 
(Group) Co Ltd, Beiren Printing Machinery Co Ltd, Beijing Light 
Bus Co Ltd and Beijing Town County Trade Centre Co Ltd. 
  Although stock offerings are the subject of much street talk 
these days, masses of investors did not queue in Beijing as they 
have in many other cities. 
  According to underwriters of the flotation, the lottery 
rates 
for the four companies all surpassed 2.7 per cent. This means 
that the chances of a subscriber being able to buy shares are 27 
in 1,000. 
  Beiren had the highest lottery rate, 10.5679 per cent. In 
comparison, the rate for Tsingtao Beer was 0.06 per cent when it 
publicly floated shares last year. 
  Experts say the months-long contraction in the country's 
stock market dampened people's enthusiasm for the new issues. 
  In addition, the public has learned that new issues may not 
promise the easy fortunes they did several years ago when demand 
for stocks far out paced the supply. 
  Observers also point out that Beijing people are 
conservative 
investors. They prefer the lower risks of financial instruments 
such as treasury bonds to the higher risks of stocks. 
  The major challenger to the new stock issues is this year's 
treasury bonds, whose yields have lured many investors. 
  Of the four companies, investors preferred the two retail 
companies over the two industrial firms, although the former 
carry higher issuing prices. 
  The lottery rate for Beijing Department Store is 2.9384 per 
cent and for Beijing Town and County Trade Centre, 2.7721 per 
cent. For Beiren it is 10.5679 percent and for Beijing Light 
Bus, 6.3549 per cent.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Mar (XINHUA) -- It was learned recently 
from the office of the Three Gorges Project Construction 
Committee that large generating sets to be used in the Three 
Gorges Project shall be jointly designed and manufactured by 
Chinese enterprises and a foreign company that wins the 
international bid. 
  According to Li Shouren, chief engineer of the Ministry of 
Machine-Building Industry, the Three Gorges Project will need a 
total of 26 large generating sets, each with a 700,000 kw 
capacity. The design and manufacturing process for the hydraulic 
turbine -- one of the largest hydropower units in the world, 
each with a wheel about 9.85 meters in length -- require fairly 
high technical standards. In recent years, China's 
machine-building industry has made many attempts to solve major 
technical problems and other preparations for the manufacturing 
of such power units. As a result, it has been equipped 
basically with the ability to manufacture such large hydropower 
units. 
  In consideration of the possibility that foreign funds may 
be 
used in the Three Gorges Project, as well as for the purpose of 
guaranteeing that the technology and quality of such power units 
are of advanced-world levels and promoting China's standards in 
developing and manufacturing power-generating equipment, the 
state has made the following decision: The bid for the 26 large 
hydropower units will be open for foreign companies around 1996. 
The 12 generating sets, which are for the first-phase 
construction project, shall be jointly designed and manufactured 
by a foreign bid winner and the Harbin Electric Machine Plant 
and the Dongfang Electric Machine Plant. The foreign company 
shall be fully responsible to the China Three Gorges Project 
Development Cooperation for technology, quality, and time of 
delivery. The Chinese plants, in turn, shall be responsible to 
the foreign company. During the joint production process, the 
Chinese plants shall gradually increase the percentage of 
locally made products in an effort to master design and 
manufacturing ability. The other 14 units shall mainly be 
manufactured at home, with the Chinese plants becoming major 
suppliers of the goods. 
  It was learned that the 550,000 kw flow-type hydraulic 
generating set for the Ertan power station shall be jointly 
manufactured by the Dongfang Electric Machine Plant and the GE 
Canada Company soon in accordance with the above-mentioned 
method. Such a method shall be helpful in accumulating many 
experiences for Chinese plants in terms of jointly developing 
and manufacturing power generating units with foreign companies. 
The Harbin Electric Machine Plant and the Dongfang Electric 
Machine Plant, which are to be responsible for developing and 
manufacturing power generating units for the Three Gorges 
Project, are now making technical preparations.

  The trading center is China's first nationwide unified 
foreign currency market. It is linked up with trading centers 
in other big Chinese cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, 
Shenzhen and Guangzhou, the officials said. 
  The transactions today proved to be stable. The exchange 
rate of U.S. dollars against renminbi yuan opened at 1:8.681 and 
closed at 1:8.6908. 
  In its initial stage, the center will only deal with 
transactions in U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollars against 
renminbi. It will pair up sellers and buyers through an 
advanced communications and computer system. 
  Trading members at the center will include 13 domestic 
banks, 
more than 80 Sino-foreign joint banks and some other financial 
organs.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The valley of the 
Chang Jiang river, China's longest, has taken the lead in the 
country in trying out the joint-stock system. 
  The joint share-holding economy in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, 
Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai along the 
river has burgeoned since May 1992, when the central government 
announced the opening of this area further to the outside world. 
  By the end of March this year these areas had a total of 124 
companies that have listed their stocks on the market, 
accounting for half of the country's total. 
  These companies are involved in the fields of energy 
development, transportation, telecommunications and high-tech 
industry. They are leading local economic development and 
deepening the enterprise reform. 
  By issuing stocks to the public, the six provinces and 
Shanghai have collected more than 100 billion yuan in funds for 
local economic development. 
  The Pudong Development Bank, under the principle of 
management of both assets and liabilities, has loaned 3.57 
billion yuan and 160 million U.S. dollars to enterprises over 
the past year. 
  And the Gezhouba Hydroelectric Power Station on the middle 
reaches of the Chang Jiang is issuing stocks to collect funds 
for the construction of the giant Three Gorges dam project.

  [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- More than 540,000 
dropouts in poor rural areas have returned to school since the 
"Hope Project" to finance the education of children in 
poverty-stricken areas was launched nationwide four years ago. 
  Cao Zhigang, an 11-year-old boy living in the mountainous 
Jinggang area of Jiangxi Province recently wrote a letter of 
thanks to Fang Lue, a teacher at the Beijing-based Central 
Institute of Finance and Banking, who has been providing him 
with a stipend. 
  In the letter Cao said he had scored an average of 99 out of 
the possible 100 points in all subjects in his final exams last 
term. He also sent to Fang a parcel of sunflower seeds he had 
picked himself. 
  His letter was carried in advertisements for the "Hope 
Project" distributed in Beijing and other major cities all over 
China. 
  Specifically, the project involves mobilizing people from 
all 
walks of life to finance the re-entry to school of dropout 
students in poor rural areas. 
  New China has made great progress in education since its 
founding in 1949. However, owing to the uneven economic growth, 
insufficient funding for education in poor rural areas and the 
low incomes of many rural families, an estimated one million 
school-age children drop out each year throughout China. 
  Since the China Juvenile Development Fund initiated the 
"Hope 
Project" nationwide in October 1989, tens of millions of Chinese 
have donated a total of 200 million yuan to the fund. 
  Many Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, as well as 
Chinese nationals residing abroad, have also donated money to 
the project. 
  As a result, 200 "Hope Primary Schools" have been built in 
poor areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Qinghai and 
Gansu provinces in northwest China, as well as in Yunnan, 
Guizhou, Shanxi and Gansu provinces. 
  An official of the China Juvenile Development Fund said that 
China has about 70 million urban families, 50 million of which 
are relatively well off. 
  If one percent of the 50 million families support the "Hope 
Project," half a million children from poor families will be 
able to receive an education, he said. 
  The project is well known all over China, thanks to the 
showing of movies and TV series, and the publication of books in 
support of the project, as well as widespread reporting by the 
mass media. 
  Xu Yongguang, secretary-general of the fund, said that the 
fund has introduced a whole range of systems in such areas as 
accepting donations, deciding on who should receive financing 
and building primary schools. 
  He said that China currently has 10 million children who 
cannot afford an education. "The `Hope Project' has enabled 
540,000 students to receive an education. So we can only say 
that initial success has been scored," he said. 
  The amount of donations for the project in the first three 
months of this year far exceeds that for the same period in 
1993, he said. 
  The projects to be undertaken this year should finance the 
education of a half a million students and the construction of 
100 primary schools, he said. 
  He said that delegates to a conference on the project held 
earlier this year decided to basically solve the problem of 
dropouts within the remainder of the century and assist the 
Chinese Government in making nine-year compulsory education 
universal by the end of the century.

<F P=106> ["Provisions for Managing the Collection of Mineral Rights </F>
Fees" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Article 1 These regulations are formulated in 
accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Mineral 
Resources Law of the People's Republic of China" to safeguard 
and promote the prospecting, protection, and rational 
development of mineral resources, and safeguard the state's 
property rights and interests in mineral resources. 
  Article 2 Mineral rights fees [kuang chan zi yuan bu chang 
fei 4349 3934 6327 3293 6316] shall be paid in accordance with 
these regulations for the exploitation of mineral resources 
within the territory of the People's Republic of China and the 
waters under its jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided for by 
laws and administrative regulations. 
  Article 3 Mineral rights fees shall be collected based on a 
fixed percentage of the income from the sale of mineral 
products. Mineral rights fees paid by an enterprise shall be 
listed as operating expenses. 
  Where people with mining rights process mineral products by 
themselves, their income from the sale of mineral products shall 
be calculated based on the price set by the state; where there 
is no set state price for the mineral products, the income from 
the sale of the products shall be calculated based on the 
products' average local market price prevailing at the time of 
the collection of mineral rights fees. 
  Where people with mining rights sell their mineral products 
outside the country, the income from the sale shall be 
calculated based on the products' international market price. 
  The term mineral products used in these regulations refers 
to 
mineral products removed from their natural state through mining 
and dressing. 
  Article 4 Mineral rights fees shall be paid by people with 
mining rights. 
  Mineral rights fees shall be calculated in currency used in 
selling the mineral products; where people with mining rights 
process mineral products by themselves, the mineral rights fees 
shall be calculated in currency used in the sale of the end 
products. 
  Article 5 Mineral rights fees shall be calculated according 
to the following formula: 
  Amount of mineral rights fee equals income from sale of 
mineral products multiplied by the mineral rights fee rate 
multiplies by the coefficient of percentage of recovery 
  Coefficient of percentage of recovery multiplied by 
appraised 
percentage of recovery/actual percentage of recovery 
  Appraised percentage of recovery is based on the blueprint 
of 
the mine approved in accordance with relevant state regulations; 
where a mining enterprise is required to prepare only a mining 
plan instead of a blueprint, the percentage of recovery shall be 
determined by the department in charge of geology and mineral 
resources management under the local people's government at and 
above the county level together with other relevant departments. 
  Where mineral rights fees for certain minerals cannot be 
calculated in accordance with the provisions of the first and 
second paragraphs of this article, the department in charge of 
geology and mineral resources under the State Council shall 
develop separate formulas together with the State Council's 
finance department. 
  Article 6 Mineral rights fees shall be collected in 
accordance with the rates provided for in the appendix of these 
regulations. 
  Adjustment of mineral rights fees shall be made jointly by 
the State Council finance department and the State Council 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources and shall 
be implemented after it is submitted to and approved by the 
State Council. 
  Article 7 Mineral rights fees shall be collected jointly by 
the department in charge of geology and mineral resources and 
the finance department. 
  Where a mine is located in an administrative district at the 
county level, mineral rights fees shall be collected by the 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources under the 
people's government of the county where the mines are located. 
  Where the area of a mine extends beyond an administrative 
district above the county level, mineral rights fees shall be 
collected by the department in charge of geology and mineral 
resources of the people's government at the next higher level. 
  Where the area of a mine extends beyond an administrative 
district at the provincial level or is in the territorial waters 
of the People's Republic of China or waters under its 
jurisdiction, mineral rights fees shall be collected by the 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources of the 
provincial people's government authorized by the State Council 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources. 
  Article 8 People with mining rights shall pay mineral 
rights fees for the first half of the year by 31 July annually; 
and pay such fees for the second half by 31 January of the next 
year. 
  People with mining rights shall pay off their mineral rights 
fees when suspending or terminating mining. 
  Article 9 While paying mineral rights fees, people with 
mining rights shall also submit such information on varieties, 
output, sales volume, sales prices, and actual mining recovery 
ratio of the extracted mineral products. 
  Article 10 Collected mineral rights fees shall be turned 
over in full to the locality's state treasury immediately. At 
the end of the year, the account of the aforementioned fees 
shall be settled independently, in accordance with the ratios of 
fees between the central authorities and provinces, autonomous 
regions, or municipalities as described in the following 
sentence: 
  The ratio of mineral rights fees between the central 
authorities and provinces or municipalities is 5:5; and the 
ratio between the central authorities and autonomous regions is 
4:6. 
  Article 11 Mineral rights fees are included in the state 
budget and handled as a special account; and will be used mainly 
in exploring mineral resources. 
  The specific measures for using and managing mineral rights 
fees obtained by the central authorities are worked out jointly 
by the State Council departments in charge of finance, geology 
and mineral resources, and planning. 
  The specific measures for using and managing mineral rights 
fees obtained by localities are worked out by the provincial, 
autonomous regional, and municipal people's governments. 
  Article 12 With joint approval of the department in charge 
of geology and mineral resources under the provincial-level 
people's government and financial department at the same level, 
people with mining rights may be exempt from paying mineral 
rights fees if they meet one of the following: 
  (1) Recovering mineral products from waste rock; 
  (2) Extracting, with approval, the leftover ore body without 
safety protection from a closed mine, according to the state's 
relevant regulations; 
  (3) Other conditions recognized by the State Council's 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources and the 
financial department for fee exemptions. 
  Article 13 With joint approval of the department in charge 
of geology and mineral resources under the provincial-level 
people's government and financial department at the same level, 
people with mining rights may pay a smaller amount of mineral 
rights fees if they meet one of the following: 
  (1) Recovering mineral products from tailings; 
  (2) Extracting low-graded mineral resources that fail to 
reach the grade of industrial products or are of uncalculated 
reserves; 
  (3) Extracting mineral resources under a body of water, 
buildings, and vital communication lines; 
  (4) Incurring losses permitted by policy, as a result of 
implementing state-fixed prices; 
  (5) Other conditions recognized by the State Council's 
department in charge of geology and mineral resources and the 
financial department for reductions. 
  Provided that a reduction is over 50 percent of the payable 
mineral rights fees, it shall be approved by the people's 
governments at provincial level. 
  When reduction cases are approved, they shall be reported to 
the State Council's department in charge of geology and mineral 
resources and the financial department for the record. 
  Article 14 If the mine operator has not paid mineral 
rights fees within the time limit, the levying organization 
shall instruct the operator to pay the amount within a 
prescribed period plus 2 percent of the fees per day as a fine 
for delaying payment, starting the day after the time limit 
expires. 
  If the mine operator does not pay mineral rights fees and 
fines for delaying payment according to the stipulation in the 
above paragraph, the levying organization shall impose a fine of 
less than three times the amount of mineral resource 
compensation fees. In serious cases, the organization having 
the authority to issue mining permits shall withdraw the mine 
operator's permit. 
  Article 15 If the mine operator falsely reports types of 
minerals for mining, hides the mineral output, and conceals the 
quantities of mineral sales; if the operator makes a false 
report on sales prices and actual rate of recovery in mining 
operations; or if the operator refuses to pay or pays inadequate 
mineral rights fees, the levying organization shall instruct the 
operator to pay the due mineral rights fees plus a fine of less 
than five times the amount of mineral resource compensation 
fees. In serious cases, the organization having the authority 
to issue mining permits shall withdraw the mine operator's 
permit. 
  Article 16 If the mine operator does not report related 
information in accordance with the stipulations of Article 9 of 
these regulations, the levying organization shall instruct the 
mine operator to submit the report within a certain time limit. 
If the operator does not do so, a fine of less than 5,000 yuan 
shall be levied. If the operator still does not submit the 
related report, the organization having the authority to issue 
mining permits shall withdraw the mine operator's permit. 
  Article 17 The fines and money collected for delaying 
payments according to these regulations shall be delivered to 
the state treasury. 
  Article 18 If the concerned party disagrees with the 
decision on administrative punishment, the concerned party may 
appeal to a higher organization within 15 days after receiving 
notice of punishment. The concerned party may also directly 
request the people's court to try the case within 15 days after 
receiving the notice of punishment. 
  If the concerned party does not ask for reconsideration and 
does not request the people's court to try the case within the 
time limit but refuses to accept punishment, the organization 
which makes the punishment decisions may request the people's 
court to forcibly exercise punishment. 
  Article 19 If local laws and regulations, the rules 
promulgated by the local people's government and contents of 
administrative documents promulgated earlier run counter to 
these regulations, the stipulations of these regulations shall 
be applied. 
  Article 20 Various provincial, autonomous regional, and 
municipal people's governments may formulate procedures for 
implementing these regulations. 
  Article 21 The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 
shall be responsible for the explanation of these regulations. 
  Article 22 These regulations shall take effect on 1 April 
1994.

  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- China will establish 
grain risk funds to help promote sustained and steady 
development of grain production and to ensure a stable grain 
market, this reporter has learned from the National Conference 
on Grain Risk Funds that opened in Beijing today. 
  Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the State Planning Commission, 
gave an explanation on the general framework of the state grain 
risk funds system at the conference. He said: The grain risk 
fund is the first special macroeconomic regulation fund 
established specifically for a commodity that bears heavily on 
the state of the national economy and people's well-being. 
Starting from the 1994 grain year, the central government and 
the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly 
under the central government must establish well-stocked grain 
risk funds. Capital for the central grain risk fund will be 
supplied by the central treasury. Capital for local grain risk 
funds will come from subsidies from the central government and 
appropriations from local budgets. Capital needed for the funds 
must be raised within the year. He urged the localities to pool 
their limited financial resources so that grain risk funds at 
the central and provincial levels can be set up as quickly as 
possible, thus creating a rather effective means for exercise 
regulation and intervention. 
  Luo Zhiling emphasized that the grain risk fund is a 
special- 
purpose fund. It is forbidden to use grain risk funds for other 
purposes, like helping the poor or social welfare and relief. 
The funds should not be used to make up for regular operating 
losses of grain enterprises or to subsidize the expenses and 
interest incurred from regular stock turnover. Departments 
concerned at all levels must not withhold, divert, or pocket 
subsidies due the peasants.

  [Text] Beijing, April 4 (XINHUA) -- China's fodder 
industry has become important in the national economy. 
  According to a recent cross-Taiwan Straits seminar on grain 
and edible oil production, the total fodder output on the 
mainland has increased from less than one million tons per year 
in the late 1970s to 40 million tons now. 
  The annual growth rate of fodder output is 34.46 percent. 
  At present, there are more than 6,200 fodder enterprises and 
685 of them can turn out 46 million tons annually. 
  In the 1990s, the proportions of the fodder output changed 
remarkably. The feed for pigs accounts for 44 percent, the feed 
for chickens accounts for 48 percent, and that for dairy cows, 7 
percent. 
  Up to now, China has set up more than 180 Sino-foreign joint 
ventures in the fodder industry. 
  However, experts noted that at present, 75 percent of the 
fodder on the mainland comes from grain, but in developed 
countries, less than 20 percent of fodder involves grain.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yan Liqiang (0917 0500 1730) "It Is Necessary </F>
To Reinforce the Dynamics in Making Up Deficits and To Take 
Stopgap and Radical Measures Simultaneously"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 18 March Chen Xitong, secretary of 
the municipal party committee; Li Qiyan, mayor of the 
municipality, sponsored a forum with the responsible personnel 
from some enterprises that had suffered losses. During the 
forum, they discussed the plan for making up deficits and 
increasing profits and stressed that efforts should be made to 
emancipate minds; to seize the opportunity; to reinforce the 
dynamics; to take stopgap and radical measures simultaneously; 
and to accelerate the handling of the knotty problems of losses 
with greater boldness and determination. 
  The municipal party committee and the municipal people's 
government always attach great importance on the work undertaken 
by the state-owned industrial enterprises to make up their 
deficits and to increase their profits. Over the past few 
years, the municipality has scored certain achievements in this 
regard through the arduous efforts made by various social 
circles and achieved good progress each year. However, the 
number of money-losing enterprises is tending toward an increase 
due to a series of internal and external reasons, which have 
become knotty problems tolerating no neglect at present. 
  Yuan Zhenguo, manager of the Beibingyang Foodstuffs Company; 
Lin Shichang, director of the first knitwear mill; Zhang Kean, 
director of the printing and dyeing mill; Song Borao, director 
of the chemical briber plant; Qiao Guichen, director of the 
battery plant; Liu Zhizhan, director of the No.1 plastics plant; 
Chen Jianguo, director of the No.10 plastics plant; and Guo 
Zhaoshun, director of the No.2 electric wire and cable factory, 
spoke at the forum to report their business situation, their 
reasons for losses, their existing difficulties, and their plans 
for further switching their losses to profits. 
  Chen Xitong and Li Qiyan earnestly listened to the speeches 
made by these managers and directors and also joined in the 
discussion by frequently raising questions. 
  In his speech Li Qiyan said: Boosting the state-owned large 
and medium-sized enterprises represents the work emphasis of the 
municipality this year and the issue of how to have the 
money-losing enterprises switch their losses to profits 
represents the focal point of the work emphasis. The 
fundamental key to successfully conducting this work lies in 
emancipating minds and seizing the opportunity. Money-losing 
enterprises should work out every possible way and means by 
proceeding from their reality and according to their own 
conditions and adopt the methods suitable to their own work in 
this regard. We should note that in the transition from the 
planned economy to the socialist market one, enterprises will 
encounter pains -- some of them will survive and some will die 
out. As for enterprises that are hopeful for switching their 
losses to profits, we should actively support them and the 
municipal authorities should actively give a helping hand to the 
money-losing enterprises that deserve to receive their 
assistance. Enterprises should enhance their contingent of 
personnel in charge of scientific research and product sales. 
Only by successfully conducting technical renovations and 
overcoming the scientific and technological difficulties can 
enterprises obtain their vigor. Having the money-losing 
enterprises switch their losses to profits represents not only 
an economic matter but also a matter having a bearing on the 
people's lives and social peace. It is hoped that plant 
directors should set an example in emancipating minds, conduct 
more consultations with workers, explore methods, and work out 
their own way of switching losses to profits and achieving 
development. 
  In his speech Chen Xitong said: These money-losing 
enterprises have reflected the large number of contradictions 
cropping up among industries and the problems cropping up in the 
economic operation. The appearance of money-losing enterprises 
is inevitable. However, having too many of them is abnormal 
because they have a bearing on the people's lives, on 
maintaining stability, and on having the municipality 
overfulfill the plan of becoming better-off. Leadership at all 
levels must attach great importance on the work in this regard 
and earnestly deal with the problems in the work. "In doing 
everything in the world, all problems can be revolved through an 
earnest attitude and the Communist Party mostly stresses 
earnestness." Only by earnestly grasping the work can the 
leading personnel of party and government organs at all levels 
deal with the difficulties encountered by the money-losing 
enterprises. Chen Xitong said: Although we have dealt with some 
problems that have caused a large number of state-owned 
industrial enterprises to lose money, the dynamics used to deal 
with these problems has not been enough. It is imperative to 
reinforce the dynamics in this regard and to work out new 
methods by applying the basis of successful experience gained in 
this regard. Efforts should be made to put forward practical 
measures to accelerate the handling of these problems. Building 
the socialist market economy represents a great opportunity. 
Through the measures of regulating the markets, enterprises 
should carry out again the rational allocation of essential 
factors of production. There are so many ways to remove the 
difficulties, however, the key to this regard lies in finding 
out a way by deepening the reform. 
  Chen Xitong pointed out: In encouraging the money-losing 
enterprises to switch their losses to profits, we must take 
stopgap and radical measures simultaneously. By no means should 
we deal with the problems by treating symptoms but not the 
disease. As for some enterprises that have suffered production 
suspension or semisuspension at present, we should work out 
methods for enabling workers to have a job and certain income. 
This is the practice of dealing with the temporary problems on 
a long-term basis and of taking radical measures to let 
enterprises achieve prosperous development. Leadership should 
make early determination and vigorously readjust the structure 
of industries, enterprises, and products to emancipate the 
fettered productive forces. A good job should be done in 
closing the money-losing enterprises, suspending the production 
of them, merging their production with others, and transferring 
their production to others. Efforts should be made to 
popularize the experience gained by the first light industrial 
front in conducting comprehensively auxiliary reforms; to 
accelerate the utilization of foreign capital; to push forward 
the shareholding system; to make smaller units on the basis of 
cost accounting; and to enforce integration among technology, 
industry, and trade. 
  Chen Xitong stressed: In dealing with the problems caused by 
the money-losing enterprises, we must uphold the emancipation of 
minds and break away the fetters of idealism and metaphysics. 
By no means should we divorce from the reality and blame 
everyone and everything but ourselves. We should boldly face 
the fierce market competition and foster the lofty aspiration 
and great ideals of being the boss of our business. In 
readjusting the structure, we should resolutely overcome the 
"three bad habits" (overly stressing the famous trade mark, 
giving priority to the high position occupied by enterprises in 
the national economy, and being concerned about face-saving); 
and particularly overcome the fetter of "three ownerships" (such 
as the state, collective, and individual). We should encourage 
the enterprises of various industries and trades and under 
various departments to set up economic associations or to merge 
their production. 
  Chen Xitong urged leadership at all levels to show greater 
boldness and determination in having the money-losing 
enterprises switch their losses to profits. They should 
vigorously seize the opportunity and accelerate the pace, in 
addition to not putting off the work by giving up the decisions 
on enterprises that deserve to be made. By paying great 
attention to the interests of the state, enterprises, as well as 
staff members and workers, we should go ahead with the work as 
long as the targets have been fixed. Various departments, 
commissions, offices, and bureaus should work out methods for 
the money-losing enterprises to switch their losses to profits. 
As for things that cannot be decided by enterprises, they 
should help enterprises make determinations and do more 
practical deeds for enterprises. The plant directors and party 
secretaries of money-losing enterprises should heighten their 
spirit, boldly face the difficulties, and switch their losses to 
profits as soon as possible by relying on the masses. 
  Attending the forum were leading personnel from the 
municipal 
level organs, including Wang Baosen, Duan Bingren, Li Runwu, and 
Fan Yuanmou; as well as responsible persons form the relevant 
commissions, offices, bureaus, and banks.

  [Text] The enlarged Second Plenary Session of the Second 
Hainan Provincial CPC Committee was convened in Haikou yesterday. 
  The plenary session conscientiously summed up Hainan's work 
in 1993; discussed and outlined new reform, opening up, and 
modernization building tasks for 1994; and further mobilized the 
broad masses of party members, cadres, and people across the 
province to clearly view the current situation, enhance 
confidence, grasp each and every opportunity, brace up, and 
strive to push the Hainan Special Economic Zone's modernization 
drive to a new stage. 
  On behalf the Hainan Provincial CPC Committee, Secretary 
Ruan 
Chongwu delivered at the plenary session a work report entitled 
"Deepening Reform, Expanding Opening up, and Pushing ahead with 
Hainan's Modernization Drive." 
  The plenary session was presided over by Du Qinglin, 
provincial party committee deputy secretary, and attended by 
Wang Xiaofeng and Chen Yuyi, provincial party committee deputy 
secretaries, and Liu Xuebin, Cai Changsong, Wang Xueping, and 
Zhong Wen, provincial party committee standing committee members. 
  In reviewing the provincial party committee work in 1993, 
Secretary Ruan Chongwu stated: Over the past year, the party 
organizations at all levels across the province have 
conscientiously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and successfully guided the people of all nationalities 
across the province in respect of enhancing unity, forging ahead 
to score new achievements, deepening reform, expanding opening 
up, intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control, and 
building a socialist market economic structure, with the result 
that Hainan has successfully maintained and developed an 
excellent situation in reform, opening up, and the modernization 
drive and comprehensively pressed ahead with the development of 
national economic and social undertakings. 
  Speaking of the provincial party committee work in 1994, 
Secretary Ruan Chongwu noted: This year, the provincial party 
committee should conduct work under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as well as the party's basic line; 
comprehensively implement the spirit of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; and concentrate on further deepening reform, 
expanding opening up, building a socialist market economic 
structure at a faster pace, and bringing about a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic growth in the Hainan Special 
Economic Zone. To this end, we should make every possible 
endeavor to open up new vistas with a view to boosting Hainan's 
modernization drive. We should submit to and serve such overall 
interests as grasping each and every excellent opportunity to 
deepen reform, expand opening up, promote faster economic 
growth, and maintain stability. Moreover, we should also devote 
more energies to the following key aspects of work: 
  1. To strive for breakthroughs in various fields and 
comprehensively push forward all types of reform. To this end, 
we should deepen all types of reform by focusing on property 
rights transfer; rapidly build a property rights market; 
expeditiously establish and perfect a modern enterprise system; 
rationally readjust city and county financial structures; 
comprehensively implement a modern revenue collection and 
management system; rapidly build an integrated labor market in 
urban and rural areas so as to facilitate surplus rural labor 
transfer; continuously deepen social security system reform; 
comprehensively further urban housing system reform; 
continuously build projects aimed at collecting a fuel 
surcharge; quicken the pace of institutional reform within 
government organs; practically transform government functions; 
deepen the rural reform; expeditiously build a rural market 
economic structure; deepen the state-owned farms reform; and 
promote economic growth on the basis of more farmland 
reclamation. 
  2. To expand opening up; rapidly invite foreign capital and 
advanced foreign technology; and strengthen cooperation with the 
hinterland. To this end, we should rapidly build the Yangpu 
Economic Development Zone, the Haikou Bonded Zone, the Basuo 
Border Trade Center, and the Baimajing Border Trade Center; 
expand the existing avenues for and scale of foreign investment 
in the province in accordance with the principle of lifting 
market control and guaranteeing fair competition; grasp each and 
every excellent opportunity; invite foreign and domestic 
investment and raise funds for the province's key projects; give 
top priority to inviting foreign capital and advanced foreign 
technology as well as to cooperation with the hinterland; 
readjust the province's foreign trade policies and measures in a 
timely and proper manner; and conscientiously implement to the 
letter the central foreign trade reform measures. 
  3. To optimize the province's economic structure and strive 
to bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth 
in the Hainan Special Economic Zone. To this end, we should 
work out sound economic plans so as to carry out the province's 
development and construction in a planned way, step by step, as 
well as with clear-cut emphases; continue to adhere to the 
principle of building infrastructure facilities first and take 
real steps to build more infrastructure facilities across the 
province; vigorously develop tertiary industry by focusing on 
the tourism industry; accelerate industrial development with the 
stress on higher efficiency; and energetically develop a 
market-oriented high-yield, high-efficiency, and high-quality 
agriculture in the hope of increasing the income of the peasants. 
  4. To speed up legislative work relating to reform, 
opening up, and development. To this end, it is imperative to 
correctly handle relations between legislation on the one hand 
and reform and opening up on the other; clearly define a 
legislative guiding ideology; standardize government behavior 
with the help of legislative work; properly handle relations 
between improving macroeconomic regulation and control on the 
one hand and streamlining administration and delegating powers 
on the other; and waste no time in promulgating laws aimed at 
boosting the province's reform process. 
  5. To make unreserved efforts to build spiritual 
civilization. 
  6. To safeguard social stability and ensure smooth reform 
and construction. 
  7. To strengthen and improve party leadership in light of 
new circumstances. To this end, it is imperative to organize 
cadres and party members to conscientiously study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's economic theories; arm the mind with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics; improve work style; and build stronger 
grass-roots party organizations, including grass-roots party 
branches, with an eye to making them more capable of uniting and 
guiding the broad masses of people to wholeheartedly participate 
in Hainan's on-going modernization drive. In addition, it is 
imperative to deepen the current anticorruption struggle and 
successfully improve party style and build clean government. 
  During the panel discussions held at the current session, 
the 
participants unanimously praised Secretary Ruan Chongwu's work 
report as one that is feasible and capable of boosting morale as 
it offers a clear-cut guiding ideology and is of great guiding 
significance to Hainan's reform and modernization drive in 
future. 
  Secretary Ruan Chongwu's work report was unanimously adopted 
at the session at 1700. 
  Deputy Secretary Du Qinglin stated emphatically at the close 
of the session: The work report adopted at the current session 
is an important document that will guide Hainan's reform, 
opening up, and modernization drive in the years ahead. The 
party organizations at all levels across the province should 
conscientiously organize party members to study the work report; 
relay and implement the spirit of the current session without 
delay; ensure that the spirit of the current session is 
implemented to the letter at all levels across the province; and 
make concerted efforts to press ahead with all types of work in 
Hainan and strive for more successes. 
  The enlarged plenary session was also attended by 27 members 
and five alternate members of the provincial party committee. 
  A total of 72 people attended the enlarged plenary session 
as 
nonvoting delegates, including provincial discipline inspection 
commission standing committee members; provincial people's 
congress, people's government, and Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference committee leaders who are CPC members; 
persons in charge of party and government organs and people's 
organizations at all levels as well as the higher learning 
institutions directly under the provincial authorities; persons 
in charge of various locally based central units at the 
provincial department level; various prefectural, city, and 
county party committee secretaries; as well as the Xisha [Xisha 
Archipelago] CPC Work Committee secretary.

<F P=106> [Speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the Hebei Provincial </F>
CPC Committee, at the closing ceremony of the provincial work 
conference on improving rural areas, on 6 March] 
  [Text] The provincial work conference on making rural areas 
become fairly well-off was held according to the unified 
arrangement of the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government. I believe that through this conference a new 
situation in which the rural areas will become fairly well-off 
will emerge as soon as possible and good achievements will be 
made. I am going to put forward several opinions: 
  1. With many tasks to perform, the rural areas should 
persistently consider the overall situation in line with the 
target of being fairly well-off. I have three reasons for 
saying so: First, realizing the comfortably-off target by the 
end of this century is the second-step strategic goal of China's 
modernization as defined by the party Central Committee 
according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic ideas, a point to 
start with and end the work of the party and the government in 
the 1990's, and a fundamental task that we must do our best to 
fulfill. The majority of the province live in the rural areas. 
Therefore, the province should focus the realization of the 
comfortably-off target on the rural areas. Only when the rural 
areas accelerate the pace of becoming fairly well-off and make 
the peasants become fairly well-off as scheduled will there be 
prospects and guarantees for making the province as a whole 
become fairly well-off. Second, making the rural areas become 
comfortably-off is an integrated system with targets. This 
system not only is persistently dominated by economic targets, 
but also considers all aspects relating to social development. 
In reality, it involves rural work with economic construction 
as a key link. Grasping the work of making the rural areas 
become fairly well-off means grasping the "outline" of the rural 
work and the "halter" of the overall rural work. Third, the 
fundamental purpose of making the rural areas become fairly 
well-off is to make the broad masses of the peasants improve 
their living standard. This is directly related to the personal 
interests of the peasants and fully embodies the strong 
expectations of the peasants. Only when we firmly grasp the 
fulfillment of the target of making the rural areas become 
fairly well-off will we be able to fully mobilize the enthusiasm 
of the peasants and to concentrate energy on developing 
productive forces. Therefore, the failure in the work of making 
the rural areas become fairly well-off in the 1990's is the 
failure to grasp the essence of the rural work. The rural areas 
will not be able to comprehensively make economic and social 
development if this target cannot be fulfilled. The party 
committees and governments at various levels must approach from 
this high plane to understand this issue and persistently focus 
the rural work on making the rural areas become fairly well-off. 
  We must acknowledge that over the past few years, the 
majority of the local party committees and governments in the 
province have clear ideas and have done their work solidly and 
effectively in the aspect of focusing the rural work on making 
the rural areas become fairly well-off. However, some local 
party committees and governments still have no clear or firm 
ideas. Some even are seriously in the state of fearing 
difficulties and some are even ideologically satisfied at having 
sufficient food and clothing. The party and government leading 
bodies at various levels, particularly the party committees and 
governments at the county and township levels, should 
conscientiously review and examine their work, further seek 
unity of thinking, define the relationship between the work of 
making the rural areas become fairly well-off and the work in 
other spheres, further clearly define the work of the party 
committees and governments at various levels in the rural areas, 
further prominently define their work priorities, and have their 
energy further be concentrated and their measures become more 
forceful. We should also mobilize the broad masses of the 
peasants' enthusiasm and creativeness, make them actually become 
the main forces to promote the rural areas step toward the 
target of being fairly well-off. We should organize all 
departments and all trades and professions to better support, 
serve, and participate in the work of making the rural areas 
become fairly well-off; actually pool the joint efforts to 
promote the rural areas to step toward the target of being 
fairly well-off; and strive to create a brand new situation in 
making the rural areas become fairly well-off. 
  2. Making the rural areas well-off is a huge project in 
which we must make breakthroughs in key areas and carry them out 
in an all-around manner. The project of making the rural areas 
well-off will involve all aspects and involve much work. The 
crucial issue involved now is to accelerate economic 
development. Economic development is the precondition and basis 
on which we can rely to realize the objective of making the 
rural areas well-off. Without a rapid economic development, an 
increase in rural people's income, and enhancement of rural 
financial resources, enriching the material and spiritual life 
and developing the social welfare undertakings will be out of 
the question. Therefore, in the course of making the rural 
areas well-off, we must accelerate economic development and 
regard it as a matter of prime importance. The key to 
accelerating economic development is to conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress and the 
third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, persist 
in regarding reform as a motivation and conscientiously grasp 
three major tasks well. First, we should make strenuous efforts 
to develop "high-yield, fine-quality, and highly efficient" 
farming. On one hand, we should attend to the production of 
basic agricultural products, including grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing crops, in line with the demands of the domestic and 
foreign markets, readjust the agricultural structure, make full 
use of local agricultural resources, actively develop 
export-oriented products, such as melons, vegetables, fruits, 
medicinal herbs, and livestock, and aquatic products with fine 
quality and good efficiency, and, on the premise of guaranteeing 
a stable increase in the production of farm and sideline 
products, accelerate the optimization of agricultural structure, 
do a good job in the precision and intensive processing of farm 
and sideline products, realistically change the traditional 
farming of low efficiency into the "high-yield, fine-quality, 
and highly efficient" modern farming, and the small-scale 
farming with an unitary structure into large-scale farming with 
a comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal 
husbandry, sideline occupation, and fishery. In this way, we 
can steadily increase the income of the broad masses of peasants 
and lay a solid foundation for peasants to become well-off. 
Second, we should actively develop township enterprises. As far 
as the overall rural economy is concerned, to realize the 
objective of becoming well-off and to have conditions for 
marching towards prosperity, in a final analysis, we must 
vigorously develop township enterprises, actively promote the 
process of industrialization in the rural areas, and urge a 
batch of rural labor forces to engage in nonagricultural 
industry. The experiences of 20 counties advanced in marching 
towards the goal of prosperity across the province, which we 
summed up and popularized last year, and the experiences which 
we have exchanged during this conference have fully explained 
this. Therefore, while making efforts to grasp the "high-yield, 
fine-quality, and highly efficient" farming, we must concentrate 
greater energy on grasping the development of township 
enterprises. All cities, prefectures, counties, and townships 
should uphold the principle of persisting in promoting various 
ownerships and systems, and giving simultaneous attention to 
development and improvement, attend to input, development, and 
opening up, and strive to carry out a number of new projects 
every year, to establish a number of new enterprises and put 
them into operation, to enable a number of old enterprises to 
turn themselves into joint ventures or cooperative enterprises 
through grafting or transformation, to enter a batch of products 
in the international market, and to make a number of rural 
manpower engage in secondary and tertiary industries in an 
effort to make the rate and quality of Hebei's township 
enterprises attain or surpass the national average as quickly as 
possible. Third, we should do a good job in family planning 
work. It will be difficult to realize the objective of becoming 
well-off if we only pay attention to economic development and 
neglect the effective control of population growth. We should 
base ourselves on realizing the overall economic balance and 
simultaneously increasing the per capita share of things and the 
per capita income, and, in addition to pushing the economy 
forward, resolutely lower the natural population growth rate. 
We should always firmly grasp family planning work, unceasingly 
raise it to a new level, and guarantee the realization of the 
population control target. Only by simultaneously attending to 
production and family planning can we have guarantee for making 
the rural areas well-off. 
  Becoming fairly well-off involves not only the improvement 
of the people's material lives but also the enhancement of the 
people's spiritual lives and the overall social development. So, 
the realization of the target of becoming fairly well-off 
comprehensively reflects the overall improvement of the national 
strength, the population quality, and the living standards. 
Therefore, in the course of making the rural areas become fairly 
well-off, we must conscientiously implement the principle of 
grasping with two hands and being sure that both hands are 
tough. At present, the rural areas in the province, both 
economically good areas and backward areas, have many problems 
in the aspects of popularizing and improving scientific and 
cultural knowledge, strengthening and improving the ideological 
and educational work, comprehensively improving social order, 
purifying the social practice, improving the appearances of 
villages, and developing various social welfare undertakings. 
On the premise of persistently taking the economic construction 
as a key link, the party committees and governments at various 
levels should make a unified arrangement for making the rural 
areas become fairly well-off, comprehensively make development, 
conscientiously solve the problems one after another, and 
ceaselessly satisfy the broad masses of the peasants' increasing 
higher demands for material and cultural lives. 
  3. To accelerate the pace of making the rural areas become 
fairly well-off, we must strive to have the localities where 
conditions permit take the lead in becoming fairly well-off. 
The development of things is always uneven. It is impossible 
for all the rural areas to become fairly well-off at the same 
time. At the time of comprehensively promoting the rural areas 
to become fairly well-off, we should first have the localities 
with conditions accelerate the pace of development and take the 
lead in making a breakthrough. By so doing will we be able to 
gain experiences to better guide the work of the whole, bring 
into play the experimental and leading roles of the advanced 
models to rapidly promote the progress of other localities, and 
further form a vivid situation that the rural areas that become 
rich ahead of others help promote the work of the others and 
finally seek common wealth. To this end, in the course of 
promoting the rural areas to become fairly well-off, the party 
committees and governments at various levels should assume the 
responsibility for the work of the same levels and first have a 
number of counties, townships, and villages with good conditions 
become fairly well-off ahead of others. The province as well as 
all relevant cities and prefectures should first grasp the work 
that the counties (cities) of the first and second groups that 
should become fairly well-off by 1997 as defined in the 
"outlines of the Hebei Provincial plan for making the rural 
areas become fairly well-off" which was discussed and revised at 
this conference. These counties (cities) have not only good 
natural conditions and geographic positions but also 
considerably good economic foundations. Only when they base 
themselves on the existing advantages to make consistent efforts 
will they certainly become fairly well-off and be able to 
realize the target ahead of schedule. So, they should fully 
understand their positions and roles in making the province as a 
whole become fairly well-off, enhance the sense of 
responsibility and the sense of urgency, strive to make bigger 
strides for development, and ensure the fulfillment of the 
target of becoming fairly well-off on or ahead of schedule. The 
counties of the third and fourth groups that will not be able to 
realize the target of becoming fairly well-off by 1997 should 
define, according to the requirements of the 2000 plan, their 
economic development targets and per capita income levels that 
they should attain. Simultaneously, all cities, prefectures, and 
counties should proceed from actual conditions and annually 
organize groups of townships (towns) and villages to become rich 
ahead of others. We may determine that through the efforts in 
the next four years, about 50 percent of the counties (cities) 
and a large number of townships and villages in the province 
will be the first in becoming fairly well-off by 1997 and 
gigantic changes will take place in the appearances of the rural 
areas. Of course, at the time of grasping the work of the 
localities with conditions to become fairly well-off ahead of 
others, we must not ignore the work of the localities that do 
not have conditions temporarily. We should guide and encourage 
them to emancipate the mind, have firm confidence, overcome 
difficulties, work arduously, emulate and catch up with the 
advanced, make unremitting efforts to improve themselves, and 
have the localities with good conditions make bigger progress 
and the localities with poor conditions be unwilling to lag 
behind. By so doing will there be a situation that the vast 
rural areas in the province promote one another to step toward 
the target of becoming fairly well-off in an orderly and 
step-by-step manner. 
  4. The foundation for rural areas to achieve a fairly 
comfortable life lies in the village level, and, therefore, 
great efforts should be made to build a good party branch and 
select a good leader. Relying merely on peasant households, it 
is impossible for rural areas to achieve a fairly comfortable 
life. We should also give full play to the role of the 
organizations of a community. Villages are fairly stable 
communities in rural areas where unified operation and peasant 
households' independent operation are combined. Many things 
that peasant households cannot manage individually in their 
march toward a fairly comfortable life should be managed by 
villages. As villages are the most fundamental level to lead 
peasants to a fairly comfortable life, peasants will find it 
acceptable and compatible with their common economic interests 
to take villages as a unit in the endeavor to achieve a fairly 
comfortable life. This makes it easier to rally the forces of 
peasants and is also conducive to developing the role of the 
collective economy. Villages are also the lowest organizations 
to implement rural work, and only when they truly take action, 
can the endeavor of achieving a fairly comfortable life become 
concrete work. Therefore, to lead rural area to a fairly 
comfortable life more rapidly, we should place our work focus on 
villages, and county and township party committees and 
governments should exert efforts to build villages well, which 
are the foundation. To do so, the key is to build a good party 
branch and select a good leader. As has been proven by the 
experiences of many villages advanced in achieving a fairly 
comfortable life, a good leader with correct ideology and work 
styles who are capable of using the brain to work out ideas and 
exercising leadership and are willing to work hard will create a 
good party branch, find out a feasible road to affluence, and 
lead the entire village to a fairly comfortable life. Judging 
from Hebei's actual conditions in rural areas, however, many 
villages have yet to build such good party branches and select 
such good leaders. We should give particular attention to this 
issue. All party committees, especially those at the county and 
township levels, should regard it as the most important measure 
for achieving a fairly comfortable life to improve village-level 
party branches and select leaders well. At present, they should 
first rectify the party branches that are stagnant or half 
stagnant in doing work and successfully improve the backward 
leading bodies. They should adopt various measures to discover, 
select, and send some outstanding party members to work in 
backward villages. The mechanism of elimination through 
competition should be applied to the selection of village 
cadres, especially secretaries of party branches. Party 
branches which are stagnant in doing work, have many problems, 
and are incapable of leading peasants to a fairly comfortable 
life should be reshuffled in a timely manner. Town and township 
party committees have direct responsibility for the building of 
village party branches, and they should be held accountable 
first when party branches are not successfully built. 
  5. With a fairly comfortable life as the goal, we should 
apply the mechanism of incentives to county-, township-, and 
village-level cadres. Party committees and governments at the 
county and township levels are the key to whether rural areas 
can achieve a fairly comfortable life. The provincial party 
committee has decided and begun to formulate the methods to 
appraise county-level cadres and the mechanisms to encourage and 
restrain them in order to fully mobilize county-level leading 
bodies and leading cadres to work hard and compete for achieving 
a fairly comfortable life and to better perform their 
responsibilities. The organization department and the 
agriculture and industry department of the provincial party 
committee again invited comrades in charge from some cities, 
prefectures, and counties to discuss them at this conference. 
After being revised and screened by the standing committee of 
the provincial party committee, the methods and mechanisms will 
be issued for implementation. I will again emphasize two points 
here. First, we should keep the present leading bodies basically 
stable. Most of Hebei's county party committees and governments 
were reshuffled last year. Their five-year tenure is exactly 
the crucial period for achieving the fairly comfortable life. 
County party and government leading bodies should take it for 
granted to become ones to lead the masses to a fairly 
comfortable life. Before realizing the goal of becoming 
well-off in line with the "outlines," in principle, we will not 
transfer any county secretaries, county heads, or other 
important members of the leading bodies. People with mediocre 
work and limited ability to form a joint force and affect the 
realization of the objective of making the rural areas well-off 
must be promptly readjusted. They must not be transferred to a 
post of the same level, and must be demoted. Second, we must 
link the achievements of leading bodies in making the rural 
areas well-off with the immediate interests of cadres. In 
addition to giving relative political treatment to those who 
make prominent achievements in making the rural areas well-off 
within the set time limit, we should also give them necessary 
material awards. Those who basically fulfill the work target may 
be retained for continued use; and those who fail to fulfill the 
target must be demoted. The township level is also very 
important. Over the past years, some counties and cities in 
Hebei have formulated some encouraging measures for cadres and 
explored some effective methods. Though these measures and 
methods are different, they have all given prominence to the 
evaluation of the fulfillment of work tasks, awarding the good, 
and punishing the lazy, and played a very good role in 
encouraging and stimulating the people. All localities should 
further enrich and improve these methods in line with the demand 
of making the rural areas well-off, and strive to popularize 
them to all areas. Places without a township-level financial 
department must build one this year. Counties and cities 
without this kind of evaluation method should learn the 
successful experiences of the advanced counties and cities, step 
up efforts to formulate methods, and put them into practice. The 
rural work department of the provincial party committee should 
assume responsibility and supervise the implementation of this 
work. The township and town party committees and governments 
may use the principles and spirit of the county and township 
levels for reference, study, and decide on their own how to 
establish the mechanism of encouragement and restraint for 
villages. In short, through the establishment of effective 
mechanism of encouragement and restraint at all levels, we 
should make the leading bodies and cadres of the county and 
township levels form a strong motivation that "they must work 
hard and must not do sloppy work," and realistically concentrate 
the energy on thinking of, working for, and marching towards 
prosperity. 
  6. We should strengthen organizational guidance over the 
work 
of making the rural areas well-off, and let the broad masses of 
grass-roots cadres and people to have a goal and working 
enthusiasm. Making the rural areas well-off is a process of 
tangible practice. Leaders at all levels should successfully 
carry out all sorts of organizational leadership work with an 
enterprising spirit and a sense of responsibility. First, they 
must attend to the flexible methods on becoming well-off of 
counties, townships, and villages. The plans of counties and 
townships must be submitted to the people's congresses of a 
corresponding level for discussion and approval; villages should 
discuss their plans with villagers and let each and every 
household understand them. Second, they should regard 
accelerating the pace of making the rural areas well-off as 
their aim, act in line with market demands, organize and 
develop items and projects that help to make peasants rich in 
line with local conditions, and actively develop the commodity 
economy. Third, they should conduct timely investigation and 
evaluation, exchange experience, and promote this work. Fourth, 
they should strengthen public opinions and propaganda on 
becoming well-off, and form an atmosphere in which all rural 
households think of becoming well-off. 
  Comrades, counting from now to 2000, we have about six or 
seven years for making the rural areas well-off. The tasks 
facing us are very arduous. Comrades of all cities, 
prefectures, and counties should have a sense of urgency, exert 
strenuous efforts to accelerate all tasks on making the rural 
areas well-off, and strive to create a new situation in this 
aspect within a short period of time. This is not only the 
ardent hope of the provincial party committee and government but 
is also the urgent wish of the broad masses of rural cadres. I 
believe all of you will give a forceful answer to this with 
actual deeds.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of speech by Cheng Weigao, secretary of the </F>
Hebei Provincial CPC Committee, delivered on 24 January after 
concluding his investigation and study activities in 
Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities] 
  [Text] The major purpose of my current visits to the two 
cities Tangshan and Qinhuangdao is to investigate and study two 
issues. One is how we can accelerate the reform, opening up, and 
economic development of the areas around Bohai Sea. The other 
is how we can make cadres' work serve reform, opening up, and 
economic development more vigorously and effectively. Based on 
the investigation and study, I will speak on several opinions. 
  1. The reform, opening up, and economic construction of the 
three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou have made 
marked headway and have been further accelerated since the 
publication of the important speeches given by Comrade Xiaoping 
during his south China inspection tour. 
  With the guidance of the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress, leading bodies at all levels and the vast number of 
cadres and the masses of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, 
Tangshan, and Cangzhou have devoted plenty of painstaking 
efforts to the reform, opening up, and economic development of 
their own localities in the past few years and scored notable 
achievements. They have attained a fairly rapid economic 
development; substantially increased the input of fixed assets 
to further enhance their strengthen for sustained development; 
stabilized and improved agriculture and accelerated rural 
economic development; gradually deepened the reform in various 
fields focusing on establishing the modern enterprise system; 
and opened wider to the outside world. They are high-spirited 
and determined to attain still higher goals. All the work for 
reform and construction is making headway in a healthy manner, 
and the general development trend is good and encouraging. 
  However, judging from the expectations and demands of the 
provincial government and the people throughout the province, 
the positions of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou and the 
role they should play, the advantages and tremendous potential 
of these three cities, and a comparison with advanced coastal 
localities, we should realistically and frankly admit that the 
three cities have yet to achieve major breakthroughs in opening 
to the outside world and in economic development. First, they 
have yet to attain a big leap in economic development. Although 
the annual GNP growth rates of the three cities were higher than 
the provincial average in the past few years, not many of the 
overall indicators were higher than the provincial average, and 
some of them were even lower than the provincial average, making 
their gap from other advanced coastal open cities of the country 
still wider. Second, they have yet to make a bigger stride in 
both the range and quality of opening to the outside world. 
Among the first group of 14 coastal cities designated by the 
country to open to the outside world, Qinhuangdao ranks among 
the four at the bottom in terms of major economic indicators, 
effecting little change as compared with the early period for 
opening to the outside world. As Hebei's only national-level 
development zone, the Qinhuangdao Economic and Technological 
Development Zone has planned many projects, but few of them are 
enterprises that produce high- and new-tech products and that 
conduct business as conglomerates. Tangshan and Cangzhou are 
still in the initial stage in opening to the outside world. 
Third, some important measures for taking advantage of the 
position around Bohai Sea to achieve substantial development are 
still being prepared or in the initial stage. Major 
breakthroughs have yet to be made in seizing the opportunity and 
developing the advantages to develop large-scale association and 
cooperation with other provinces, municipalities, and regions, 
and to strengthen economic, technological, and trade exchanges 
with the various Northeast Asian countries. Fourth, many old 
enterprises have made slow progress in introducing funds from 
abroad to carry out technical transformation, in transforming 
their mechanisms and systems, and in achieving technological 
advance. Some large and medium-sized enterprises are half-dead, 
and some of the enterprises and products which used to rank 
"first" in the country have lost their "first" positions and are 
faced with the danger to be pushed behind. Fifth, some major 
work that should be made successful is not satisfactory. Among 
the 100 key projects of the three cities to be developed in the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan period, 26 are still lacking the 
conditions for starting construction or have not been planned; 
and some which have started also have many problems that require 
urgent solutions. 
  Correct understanding of our own deficiencies and 
shortcomings constitutes the prerequisite for continued 
advancement. Comrades of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou 
should not only fully affirm their already scored achievements 
but also fully understand their own deficiencies and 
shortcomings as well as their existing difficulties. Only by 
doing so can they set forth even more definite and feasible 
goals to be attained and can they do their work more 
realistically and purposefully. 
  In this new year, the fundamental principle for our work is: 
Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, by comprehensively 
implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress and the 
third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we 
should accelerate the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, maintain the sustained, rapid, and sound 
development of the national economy, safeguard political 
stability, and promote the all-round progress of society. We 
should conscientiously carry out this fundamental principle and 
resolutely subject and orient ourselves to the overall situation 
of the whole party work, that is to "seize the opportunity, 
deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and 
safeguard stability," in order to push forward reform, opening 
up, and economic construction in an even better way. 
  2. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities have 
conditions 
and are able to effect an even faster and even better 
development. 
  Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are in an 
important position and play an important role in Hebei Province. 
These three cities account for 18.7 percent of the province's 
total in terms of territory and 24.5 percent in terms of 
population. All of the 487 km of coastlines of the province are 
within these three cities. As early as ten years ago, 
Qinhuangdao city was approved by the state as one of the 14 
coastal open cities of China, and a state-level economic and 
technological development zone was established. And six years 
ago, 12 counties in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities 
were included in the coastal economic and technological zone. 
The practice from the decade of reform and opening up shows that 
Hebei's pace of reform, opening up, and economic construction 
should be accelerated further, and Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and 
Cangzhou cities should develop before others to serve as a 
window to promote the reform, opening up, and economic 
development of the whole province. 
  When viewed from the practical situation, Qinhuangdao, 
Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are completely provide with the 
condition for effecting an even faster and better development. 
First, these cities have geological advantages and are located 
in important position of strategic importance. Second, these 
cities are faced with the development opportunity that is hard 
to come by. To implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC 
Congress and to accelerate the opening up and development of the 
Around Bohai Sea Area, the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council have already done a series of work. Recently, the State 
Council has again held a seminar on economic planning for the 
Around Bohai Sea Area in Tangshan city to further research and 
define ideas, goals, and major measures to be adopted for 
accelerating the opening up and development of this area. Along 
with the gradual implementation of many major policy decisions 
of the state, the opening up and development of the Around Bohai 
Sea Area will certainly be accelerated. Third, natural 
resources are rich and economic foundation is solid in these 
three cities. Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities are 
extremely rich in land, mineral, agricultural, marine, and labor 
resources. These three cities account for more than 30 percent 
of the province's total in the number of industrial enterprises 
exercising independent accounting and in the original value of 
fixed assets. Large and medium-sized enterprises in these three 
cities also account for one third of the province's total, thus 
having considerably great industrial advantages. A large number 
of on- going key projects will be completed and commissioned one 
after another to display their efficiency. The comprehensive 
economic strength and the momentum for further development will 
be enhanced obviously. Fourth, the pattern of opening to all 
directions of the world has taken shape. Over the past several 
years, these three cities have all brought in many funds, 
technologies, and professional persons and have initiated a 
group of foreign-funded enterprises of three types, that are 
relatively good in product and efficiency. The projects at the 
beginning district of the Qinhuangdao City Economic and 
Technological Development Zone has already been arranged to the 
full, and the projects covered by the second stage of 
construction are about to begin. Beidaihe, Beijing-Tangshan 
Harbor, and Huanghua City economic and technological development 
areas and a number of other development areas of various 
categories tend to promise a good future. These areas will 
certainly play a guiding role in further accelerating opening 
up. Fifth, infrastructure facilities, such as energy, 
communications, and telecommunications, have been strengthened, 
the investment environment has been further improved, and the 
ability of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and 
Cangzhou to participate in the division of labor, coordination, 
and competition among various coastal cities around Bohai Sea 
will be greatly enhanced. Sixth, through the practice and tests 
of more than 10 years of reform and opening up, leading bodies 
at all levels of these three cities have unceasingly 
strengthened their ability to organize and develop the socialist 
market economy and enriched their experience every day. A batch 
of men of action who have upheld the party's basic line, reform, 
and opening up, have strong pioneering spirit, and are capable 
of undertaking major affairs have come to the fore. Seventh, a 
number of good examples on actively blazing new trials and 
seeking rapid development have emerged in these three cities. 
For instance, the rapid economic development in Fengnan County, 
the jumping economic development in Banbidian Village, the 
large-scale development of Haomen group, the rate of building 
the medium plate plant with the joint efforts of Qinhuangdao and 
Shoudu Iron and Steel Company, the pioneering spirit of 
technical workers of Qinhuangdao vehicle door manufacturing 
plant in creating first-grade products, and the efforts and 
determination of Haixing County to create favorable conditions 
and to end backwardness are all very encouraging and inspiring, 
and each of which has its own characteristics and played a 
pioneering and exemplary role. 
  With the needs of the objective situation and all essential 
conditions, the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and 
Cangzhou have no reason not to take the lead in development in 
the province. Therefore, the provincial party committee and the 
provincial government have called on these three cities to seize 
the opportunity during the last seven years of the 1990's, use 
export- oriented economy to bring along the whole economy, 
combine the efforts of places around Bohai Sea, Beijing, and 
Tianjin, proceed from establishing cooperation at home, and make 
breakthroughs in introducing foreign capital, rely on the 
existing economic foundation and natural resources advantages, 
develop places around Bohai Sea, Beijing, and Tianjin in an 
in-depth and down-to-earth manner, develop cooperation and 
coordination with Beijing and Tianjin and with advanced regions 
in China so as to bring along opening up and development, 
accurately aim at Northeast Asia and other countries, work 
purposefully, strive to make breakthroughs in selecting major 
clients for major development and cooperative projects, strive 
to make the major economic targets and the comprehensive 
strength of these cities enter a higher grade and move one place 
forward in places around Bohai Sea and coastal cities by the 
end of this century and to become one of the places in the 
province comprehensively linking with the international economic 
track, operating in line with market mechanism, and with a high 
degree of opening up, good market cultivation, rapid development 
rate, strong economic strength, prosperous life, and good 
spiritual civilization, and lay a good foundation for making 
these three cities take the lead in realizing modernization 
during the early period of next century. 
  3. To achieve a more rapid and better development, we must 
further emancipate the mind. 
  We must persist in meeting high standards in emancipating 
the 
mind. We should make the emancipating of mind meet the standard 
of strengthening reform, expanding opening up, and accelerating 
development and further renew our ideology and concepts to 
promote a rapid development in reform and opening up and to 
realize our set objectives. Comrade Xiaoping believed that 
poverty is not socialism and slow development is also not 
socialism, and that this is determined by the essence of 
socialism. To realistically show that socialism is better than 
capitalism, we must accelerate development. Otherwise, we cannot 
display the superiority of socialism if it always lags far 
behind capitalism, and the masses of people will not be 
satisfied with this. He also said: As long as the project 
yields economic efficiency and is export-oriented, we must not 
prevent people from doing it if they can do it more rapidly. 
With all the given objective conditions for accelerating 
development, these three cities should seize the opportunity 
actively, and take the lead in development and making 
breakthroughs. 
  Of course, stressing this never means that we can daydream 
in defiance of the objective reality, never means that we can 
blindly pursue high economic growth rates and define still 
higher targets. As early as 1985, Comrade Xiaoping emphasized 
that the development rate should withstand the test. In my 
understanding, withstanding the test means that the development 
rate should be based on reality and should stress efficiency. 
We must strive to avoid a high growth rate that is divorced 
from reality and brings no efficiency because it not only brings 
negative influence on the economic environment but also 
increases the pressure on reform and social stability. In 
carrying out economic work, we should both work according to our 
capacity and exert utmost efforts; and both refrain from 
pursuing merely high growth rates and strive for necessary and 
possible rapid development. Only this means unity between mind 
emancipation and truth-seeking. 
  To emancipate the mind, we should bear reality in mind. As 
far as Hebei is concerned, it should particularly address the 
following four problems. First is the slow reaction and a 
feeling of uncertainty toward the series of changes resulting 
from the development of the market economy and the series of 
reforms put forward by the party Central Committee and State 
Council based on the requirements of the market economy system 
and the lack of initiative in adapting oneself to them; or the 
fears of various kinds, helplessness, and passive attitude 
toward them. Second is a lack of dialectical understanding of 
the current opportunity for development, the failure to free 
oneself from the outdated concepts and ideas and "leftist" views 
that have taken shape under the planned economy system, and the 
practice of acknowledging the rare opportunity theoretically but 
attempting nothing in view of the numerous difficulties of one's 
own locality and unit. Third is the practice of paying lip 
service to the call for building an economically strong province 
but following the old road when organizing and arranging 
specific work and lacking the courage to achieve breakthroughs 
based on the advantages and conditions of a locality. Fourth is 
mechanically copying of the central line, principles, and 
policies, the lack of in-depth investigation and study, the lack 
of ability to work in a creative manner in line with one's 
actual conditions, and the failure to blaze a development road 
compatible with one's characteristics. Comrades at all levels 
and of all departments should bear reality in mind, 
conscientiously make analysis of the specific reflections of 
these problems in their thinking and work, and conscientiously 
solve the problems one by one in the practice of reform and 
opening up. By solving these problems, we should further 
enhance the awareness of reform, take the initiative in adapting 
ourselves to the changes resulting from the development of the 
market economy and the various reform measures put forward by 
the central authorities, and seize the current favorable 
opportunity for reform to accelerate our own reform and 
development. We should further enhance the awareness of 
opportunity, be determined to overcome all difficulties, and 
truly seize and use well the favorable opportunity for 
accelerating development. We should enhance the awareness of 
"breakthrough" and make the best of our favorable conditions to 
achieve faster development in economic construction. We should 
enhance the awareness of innovation, study the new ideas for 
development, and strive to successfully blaze our own road of 
development. 
  In emancipating the mind, leading bodies and leading cadres 
should take the lead. Party committees, governments, and 
leading cadres at all levels, especially city, prefectural, and 
county party secretaries, mayors, and county heads, should 
regard themselves as the first to emancipate the mind and 
address well the problems in their thinking and concepts. 
  4. We should adopt every means to organize, discover, and 
develop new growing points of the economy and increase total 
supply and total demand and the per capita share. 
  Accelerated reform and opening up and faster economic 
development should ultimately be reflected in the increase of 
the total supply and total demand and the increase of per capita 
GNP and per capita income. For this reason, Qinhuangdao, 
Tangshan, and Cangzhou cities should implement "one strategy," 
build well the "two projects," strengthen the "three 
foundations," develop the "five major industries," and 
facilitate the growth of the "six economic factors." The "one 
strategy" means the strategy of promotion through the 
export-oriented economy. Guided by the world market, the cities 
should pay attention to and promote foreign capital, foreign 
trade, and foreign economic relations simultaneously. The "two 
projects" are the Shenmu-Huanghua Railway and Jingtang Harbor 
construction projects. Strengthening the "three foundations" 
means to strengthen the position of agriculture as the 
foundation, to achieve success in building infrastructural 
facilities (including railways, highways, harbors, airports, and 
telecommunications facilities), and to accelerate the 
development of basic industries (energy and power industries). 
The "five major industries" are the metallurgical, building 
materials, chemical, machinery and electronic, and light and 
textile industries. Facilitating the growth of the "six 
economic factors" means 1) to further increase the input of 
fixed assets and strive to develop a number of key capital 
construction projects and technical transformation projects of 
which the investment exceeds the stipulated norms and which 
conform to the state's industrial policy, produce readily 
marketable products, and yield good economic efficiency, 2) to 
transform the enterprise operating mechanism more rapidly, 
establish a modern enterprise system, invigorate enterprises, 
and expand the scale and improve the quality and level of 
state-own enterprises, especially large and medium-sized ones, 
through renovation with foreign capital and technical 
transformation projects, 3) to bring in and use more foreign 
capital, introduce more investment from abroad and expand 
lateral economic ties at home, build and develop the various 
categories of development zones with great efforts, give full 
play to their role, establish a large number of three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises and enterprises that have lateral 
ties at home every year, and continuously develop foreign 
economic relations and trade, 4) to do a better job in 
restructuring the agricultural sector of the economy, continue 
to ensure the growth in the production of basic farm products, 
such as grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, and accelerate the 
development of forestry and fruit production, vegetable 
production, animal husbandry, and aquiculture; and to greatly 
develop township enterprises, especially township industrial 
enterprises, transfer large numbers of labor forces to township 
industrial enterprises, and substantially increase GNP and 
peasants' income, 5) to actively develop urban collective, 
individual, and private economies, and 6) to further facilitate 
the development of the tertiary industry and the development of 
transportation, post and telecommunication, commercial and 
catering service, and markets for consumer goods and essential 
elements of production and, in particular, attach importance to 
the development of a number of commodity and material markets 
that have their own characteristics and are geared to the whole 
country. 
  To ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development of the three cities of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and 
Cangzhou, we should handle well the relationship in five aspects 
when organizing and arranging reform and development. First, 
while attaching importance to the development of the secondary 
and tertiary industries, we should never neglect or slacken 
efforts in agriculture. Farming focusing on the production of 
grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, forestry and fruit 
production, aquiculture, and animal husbandry are both the 
foundation for rural stability and the important prerequisites 
for peasants to achieve a fairly comfortable life. Therefore, 
while accelerating the development of the secondary and tertiary 
industries, we must put agriculture in the first place and 
greatly develop the high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient 
agriculture on the premise that the rural reform is deepened, 
the material as well as scientific and technological input in 
agriculture is increased, and grain and cotton production grows 
steadily. Only when we have the steady growth of the primary 
industry can we have a reliable guarantee for the faster 
development of the secondary and tertiary industries. 
  Second, we should not only plan for the future but also 
grasp the present well. Now, all of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and 
Cangzhou cities have their own long-term key development 
projects. These key development projects not only have a bearing 
on the interests of these three cities but also have a bearing 
on the overall situation of the reform, opening up, and economic 
construction of the whole province. Therefore, not only these 
three cities should regard the construction of these projects as 
the most important task, the provincial party committee, the 
provincial government, and various pertinent departments of the 
province should also put these projects in a prominent position 
and give great support to them. Realistically speaking, 
however, these projects cannot truly play a major and promoting 
role until 2000. At present, to accelerate development and make 
the people better-off, we must primarily depend on down-to-earth 
efforts, including the effort to use the influence of these 
projects to vigorously expand international and domestic 
markets, the effort to build a large number of foreign-invested 
projects and key capital construction projects, the effort to 
tap potential and renovate existing enterprises, large and 
medium-sized state-owned projects in particular, the effort to 
readjust agricultural structure, and the effort to develop 
township and town enterprises. Third, we should not set the 
enhancement of the levels and grades of products against the 
development of the ordinary labor-intensive products and 
industries. Spreading the strategy of promoting the entire 
economy through export-oriented economy, developing new 
high-technology industries, and developing the products with 
high added value are the necessary choice to accelerate economic 
development, improve economic quality, and enhance market 
competitiveness and are always the orientation of our endeavor 
of development. The more tight we grasp this work, the better; 
and the greater results we achieve in this work, the better. It 
must be noted, however, the shift of numerous rural labor forces 
from farming to industry cannot be effectively resolved through 
the development of the export-oriented economy, the formation of 
the new and high technology industries, and the development of 
the products with high added value. And, without the shift of 
large number of peasants from farming to non-agricultural 
industries, it is impossible to make peasants become better-off. 
Therefore, we should not only engage in fund- and 
technology-intensive industries and enterprises as more as 
possible, but also try every possible means to develop some 
labor-intensive industries and enterprises in order to make even 
more rural laborers shift from farming to industry. Fourth, we 
should pay attention to not only investment but also reform. 
Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou as well as the province as 
a whole have the long-standing problem of insufficient 
investment. Although such a situation has changed somewhat over 
the past several years, the change is not nearly enough if 
compared with advanced provinces. We should continue to 
strengthen the work in this aspect and try our best to ensure a 
sufficient investment to promote economic development. However, 
we cannot merely depend on investment to promote development. 
We must primarily depend on reform. Changing the 
administrative function of the government, changing the 
operational mechanism of enterprises, establishing modern 
enterprise system, strengthening the internal management of 
enterprises, increasing the vitality of enterprises, 
implementing all preferential policies of the party towards 
rural areas, and popularizing on a large scale the shareholding 
cooperative system among township and town enterprises are the 
essential ways to emancipate and develop productive forces and 
are the fundamental measures to tap the potential of existing 
assets and accelerating economic development. All these should 
be grasped firmly by party committees and governments at all 
levels by listing them as an item on their daily agenda. Fifth, 
in addition to actively promoting reform and development, we 
must also strive to maintain social stability. We should 
correctly handle the relations of reform, development, and 
stability, and, in addition to maintaining a rapid and good 
economic development, guarantee the implementation of all 
central reform policies and measures, not hesitate or waver in 
this work, and pay great attention to safeguarding social 
stability. We should pay special attention to studying with 
grert concentration all one-sided and incorrect understanding, 
new contradictions, and problems, particularly the influence in 
the immediate interests of the masses of people which may 
possibly emerge in reforms. We should adopt purposeful measures 
in a timely manner, strengthen propaganda and explanation, 
properly handle all contradictions and friction, and create a 
good social environment for smoothly carrying out reform. 
  5. The key to accelerating development is to install good 
leading bodies and make a good choice and use of cadres. 
  During this investigation and study activity, we have given 
priority to conducting an inspection to get an initial 
understanding of the party and government leading bodies of the 
cities and counties of Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou 
(city, prefecture). Generally, we notice the following three 
points: First, most of the leading bodies and leading cadres 
are good or fairly good, and a considerable number of cadres, 
particularly the top party and government leaders, are in the 
prime of life, full of vitality, and have skills and 
achievements in their work. Second, places where reform, 
opening up, and economic construction are good, have leading 
bodies of higher quality, enjoy greater stability, and have 
stronger fighting strength; on the contrary, problems of one 
kind or another may exist in varying degrees. Third, a general 
comparison of the county leading bodies and leading cadres of 
these three cities shows that Tangshan city's leading bodies are 
better and stronger in general. 
  However, if we set high demands on these cities, we notice 
that the leading cadres of Qinhuangdao, Cangzhou, or Tangshan 
all have problems of varying degrees which are in compatible 
with the new situation and the new tasks. The main 
manifestations are: They are easily content with their existing 
achievements and present situation, and lack the spirit of 
daring to surpass other localities and to create first-grade 
achievements; some are willing to do something and to create 
some achievements, but they fail to broaden their views and lack 
resourcefulness and courage to plan their act and to seek 
development; some have good work ideas and measures, but they 
fear hardships, fail to stand the difficulties they encounter 
and to cope with the changes in economic environment, and lack 
an indomitable spirit; a small number of cadres are poor in 
character and have unhealthy work style and poor work 
performance; and a small number of leading bodies are knotty and 
ununited, bringing unfavorable influence to their work. We 
must pay full attention to these problems. On the one hand, we 
must unceasingly attend to education and the ideology and work 
style of leading bodies; and other the other hand, we must 
establish a mechanism which combines incentive with restraints 
for cadres as quickly as possible in an effort to accelerate and 
improve the quality and ability of cadres in the course of 
competition. 
  The fundamental purpose of establishing an effective 
mechanism of incentive and restraints for cadres is to better 
mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and urge 
them to do their work earnestly and wholeheartedly. Here, we 
have a key issue which we must resolved first. That is, our 
party committees and organizational departments at all levels 
must judge cadres in line with party spirit and use cadres 
according to their actual achievements. To uphold and enhance 
party spirit, the most fundamental thing we should do is to 
persist in taking Comrade Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guidance and to 
comprehensively and correctly implement the party's basic line. 
Specifically speaking, attention should be paid to the 
following several points in implementing the party's basic line: 
1) We should always act highly in unison with the CPC Central 
Committee ideologically and politically, resolutely implement 
various principles and policies of the party and country, and 
ensure the smooth circulation of the party and government 
orders. 2) We should uphold reform and opening up, proceed from 
the principle of three advantages, as well as boldly pioneer the 
road of advance and boldly think or act in doing what we have 
fixed. 3) We should uphold the principle of development being 
an essential criterion and exert all-out efforts to 
wholeheartedly make contributions to developing the local 
economy and to helping local people become better-off. 4) We 
should uphold the party's democratic centralism, consciously 
safeguard the solidarity and unification in the party and among 
leading bodies. 5) We should set strict demands for ourselves, 
perform official duties honestly, and tighten the ties with the 
mass. All party-member cadres including leading cadres at all 
levels, who have possessed conditions conforming with the 
aforementioned points, should be regarded as being better in the 
party spirit. Party committees and organizational departments 
at all levels, which have truly been able to check their cadres 
in line with these points should be basically regarded as being 
insightful, impartial, and upright in appraisal. As for leading 
cadres, we should not, of course, simply regard their party 
spirit as being equal to their official achievements. Generally 
speaking, personnel who have been strong in party spirit are 
often able to score official achievements and the party spirit 
of those who have scored prominent official achievements is also 
often stronger. However, there are cases in which personnel who 
are good in party spirit have not scored prominent official 
achievements because they have shortcomings relating to ability 
and educational levels. Therefore, while making personnel 
arrangements for leading bodies and employing cadres, emphasis 
should be placed on examining their achievements on the premise 
of upholding the principle of party spirit. Only cadres who are 
strong in the party spirit, capable, and able to score official 
achievements, are needed by us. Thus, the official achievements 
of leading cadres should embody the following six aspects put 
forward by Secretary Cheng Weigao at the seventh plenum of the 
fourth provincial party committee: 1) Conducting reform and 
opening up. 2) Achieving economic development. 3)Performing 
official duties honestly. 4) Maintaining the public security. 5) 
Increasing the per capita income. 6) Enhancing the family 
planning work. Of these aspects, the most important one is 
economic development that includes the task of increasing per 
capita income and the total supply and demand. The party's 
fundamental task for the new historic period is to develop 
productive forces. The key to implementing the party's basic 
line lies in persistently regarding economic construction as a 
center. The fundamental duty of leading cadres is to lead the 
people to push reform and opening up forward and to accelerate 
the economic development. If personnel who have worked in the 
locality for three or five years and even longer are unable to 
have the locality achieve great economic development, bring 
about great changes to its outlook, and greatly improve its 
people's lives, how can we regard them as being prominent in 
their official achievements? There was an erroneous tendency in 
some localities in employing cadres, in which the party spirit 
was stressed without attention paid to official achievements and 
perfection was demanded while stressing the party spirit. As a 
result, a large number of cadres who are capable, had scored 
official achievements, and had had some shortcomings, were not 
promoted or employed for important posts. Hereafter, in 
promoting and employing cadres, we should uphold and pay 
attention to official achievements on the premise of strong 
party spirit and good morality. We should protect or support 
cadres whose official achievements have been openly acknowledged 
by the most majority of people and the main parts of their 
achievements have been good though they have one shortcoming or 
another. We should promote them to important posts as long as 
they deserve to be promoted. We should be determined to 
readjust the posts occupied by cadres who have no or no 
prominent official achievements though they have got along well 
with the locality in other fields. Readjustment does not mean 
that they should be handled but means to let them do the work 
suitable to their capability. 
  In establishing the mechanisms for encouraging and 
restricting cadres, the general demand is to institutionalize, 
through the mechanisms, the appraisal, reward and punishment, 
and use of leading cadres and to implement them conscientiously 
so that there will be clear rewards to those who are diligent 
and clear punishments to those who are lazy, leading cadres at 
all levels will be encouraged to pioneer the way forward and vie 
to be the best, and the targets and tasks of building an 
economically strong province will be implemented at every level. 
The provincial party committee tentatively considered to 
establish the mechanisms first in the leading bodies and leading 
cadres at the county (city, district) level. In establishing 
the mechanisms, the following principles should be reflected and 
mastered. 1) The principle of attaching importance to true 
performance. Based on this principle, we should set both 
qualitative and quantitative requirements in appraising cadres, 
quantify as many requirements as possible, and make the targets 
scientific and reasonable as much as possible so as to stimulate 
the enthusiasm of cadres and make the systems more operable. 2) 
The principle of treating different cases in different ways. As 
the basic conditions are different for the work of coastal open 
areas, the areas around Beijing and Tianjin, the areas along 
railways and highways that enjoy good transport service, 
ordinary plain areas, mountainous areas, and upland areas, the 
targets and requirements in appraising them should also be 
different. We should determine their categories and levels in a 
reasonable manner and put forward targets and requirements 
accordingly to avoid uniformity. 3) The principle of strict 
appraisal. Cadres should be appraised at regular intervals 
based on the stipulated targets and requirements, the 
requirements should not be made higher or lower at will, and no 
perfunctory work or accommodation is allowed. Appraisals should 
be led by organization departments and participated in by 
discipline inspection departments, auditing departments, 
planning commissions, economic and trade, family planning, 
public security, procuratorial, judicial, and other relevant 
departments. We should also pay attention to the opinions of 
various quarters and organize the masses to participate in the 
appraisals at regular intervals or when necessary. 4) The 
principle of selecting the superior and eliminating the 
inferior. We should distinguish two situations. One is to see 
whether the cadres are qualified to their leading posts. If 
they fail to fulfill even the basic targets, we should consider 
their reshuffle. The other is to see whether their performance 
is remarkable. Those with remarkable performance should be 
promoted on a priority basis or granted with proper political 
rights or material rewards. 5) The principle of persistently 
keeping promise. We should see to it that cadres are rewarded, 
punished, put in important places, reshuffled, or dismissed as 
required, and that no personal relations or the feelings of the 
cadres concerned are considered. We may conduct study to see 
whether these principles are correct or should be supplemented. 
Specific matters related to this work should be carried out by 
the organization department of the provincial party committee, 
and specific methods for implementation should be formulated 
after in-depth investigation and study. 
  6. We should work hard and in a down-to-earth manner to 
ensure the attainment of the target of faster development. 
  Practice shows that in addition to the numerous objective 
reasons, an important reason for some localities to fail to open 
up a new prospect or successfully carry out some work for a long 
period is some leading cadres' lack of the idea of painstaking 
efforts and lack of painstaking work and painstaking work styles. 
  Judging from the situation of the entire province, we should 
pay great attention to the way of thinking and work styles of a 
small number of leading cadres. First are leaders who give only 
vague, general directions, rest content with things as they are, 
do not use their brains, and lack characteristics, 
breakthroughs, and innovation in doing work, which is merely 
mediocre. Second are leaders who exercise leadership by giving 
principles. They are used to explaining major truth, 
principles, and concepts but lack thorough analysis when 
studying issues and lack penetrating judgment and 
countermeasures when giving guidance to work. Third are leaders 
who wait for instructions to exercise leadership. They wait for 
instructions form higher levels in doing everything, do whatever 
the higher-ups say, do not conduct investigation and study, lack 
opinions of their own, consider a task finished after it is 
explained, and lack the initiative in performing work and 
solving problems. Fourth are leaders who pass the buck. They 
shirk to others the responsibility for their own work and find 
excuses and objective reasons and blame others for the failure 
or problems in their work. Fifth are leaders who are weak. They 
always try to be good men to ensure votes and lack the courage 
to tackle difficulties, hold responsibility, face up to 
contradictions, and solve knotty problems. Sixth are leaders 
who exercise amateur leadership. When the situation changes, 
instead of taking the initiative in learning new knowledge and 
new skills, they carry out work according to their old 
experiences, old propositions, and old methods and even feel 
proud for this, considering themselves in the right. Seventh 
are leaders who indulge themselves in formalism. They do work 
for show, pursue "sensation," write articles and spin 
experiences to praise themselves, and disregard realistic 
results. Eighth are leaders who carry out routine work only. 
They are busy attending welcome and farewell activities, 
meetings, parties, and foundation-lay and ribbon-cutting 
ceremonies, and reading speeches all day, waste much energy on 
this, and miss the essentials of work. Ninth are leaders who do 
work at random. To keep up appearances and satisfy the higher 
levels, they give empty talk, tell lies, make false accounts and 
false reports on achievements, and make promises they do not 
have the intention to keep. Tenth are leaders who curry favor 
with others. They are enthusiastic in establishing personal 
ties, strive for fame and profits, and even openly ask for 
official posts and powers. The above-mentioned cadres, although 
small in number, have created very bad influence. They have not 
only delayed plenty of work in some localities, lost many 
opportunities, and impeded better and faster development in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction but also damaged 
the image of the party and government and arouse dissatisfaction 
among the masses. 
  The nationwide general situation in deepened reform and 
accelerated development has provided us a new opportunity for 
development and many new conditions and new issues that need 
urgent study and solution. Leading cadres at all levels must 
pay great attention to and be determined to avoid and correct 
the above- mentioned numerous unhealthy phenomena, step up 
efforts to study and to train and improve themselves, and strive 
to make their way of thinking and leadership more suitable to 
the needs of the new situation. We should greatly advocate 
throughout the province the work style of more study, more 
thinking, and industrious work, the work style of painstaking 
and down-to-earth work, the work style of carrying out work 
vigorously and speedily through to the end, the work style of 
courage to tackle difficulties, and the work style of plain 
living, arduous struggle, and selfless devotion so that our 
cadres will speedily suit their way of thinking and work to the 
new situation and new conditions and will gain the initiative in 
creating a new situation in reform, opening up, and development. 
  During the investigation and study activities, we, together 
with the leaders of the three cities, listed the major work that 
should be carried out in 1994 and 1995. Leaders of these three 
cities must pay close attention to the work, carefully plan for 
it, and carefully organize its implementation to ensure that the 
work is completed on schedule. Based on the lists of work of 
various localities, pertinent departments of the province should 
actively render service and coordinate with each other to 
support and help the various localities in fulfilling their 
work. Leading cadres at all levels should have clear knowledge 
of their responsibility, fully estimate the arduous tasks to 
accelerate development and build an economically strong 
province, and further enhance their confidence in attaining our 
targets. In this way, we will have the good mindset and work 
styles to promote our undertakings continuously and attain our 
target of building an economically strong province at an early 
date.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wang Dongjin, director of the provincial </F>
commission for restructuring of the economy, on the priorities 
of Hebei's economic reform for 1994 by unidentified reporter; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Reporter] The year 1994 is a crucial year for 
implementing the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 
14th party Central Committee and the endeavor of promoting 
package reform while achieving breakthroughs in key areas. What 
are the guiding thoughts for Hebei to deepen reform this year? 
  [Wang Dongjin] This year, Hebei should adhere to the basic 
idea of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider 
to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability, firmly aim at establishing the socialist market 
economy system and building an economically strong province, and 
emphasize the further transformation of the operating mechanism 
of state-own enterprises and the exploration of effective ways 
to establish the modern enterprises system. It should 
accelerate the reform of the fiscal and tax, banking, foreign 
trade and foreign exchange, planning, investment and money 
lending, and state asset management systems and make a 
substantial step in establishing a new-type macroeconomic 
regulating and controlling system. It should promote 
correspondingly the establishment of the market system focusing 
on the markets for the essential elements of production; add 
impetus to the reform of the social security and housing 
systems; and continue to deepen the rural reform, carry out the 
reform of the scientific and technological system and 
educational system correspondingly, give a free hand to the 
development of the nonstate economies, coordinate reform, 
development, and stability, realistically address the 
conspicuous contradictions and problems in economic activities, 
and facilitate Hebei's sustained, rapid, and healthy economic 
development. 
  [Reporter] As deepening the enterprise reform is the central 
link of the entire economic structural reform, what are Hebei's 
major measures for it? 
  [Wang Dongjin] The basic orientation for enterprise reform 
is 
establishing a modern enterprise system under which the property 
rights as well as the rights and responsibilities of enterprises 
are clearly defined, government administration and enterprise 
management are separated, and scientific management is 
established. Based on our specific conditions, this system 
should be promoted step by step by closely coordinating it with 
the transformation of the operating mechanism after experiences 
are accumulated and favorable conditions created. Focusing on 
the transformation of large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises into shareholding ones and the reorganization and 
flow of the property rights of difficult small and medium-sized 
enterprises, we should carry out in a down-to-earth manner the 
various basic work for establishing the modern enterprise 
system. There are five major measures: First, we should 
thoroughly enforce the "PRC law on the industrial enterprises 
owned by the whole people" and the "regulations on 
transformation of the operating mechanism of the industrial 
enterprises owned by the whole people," resolve well the 
difficulties in delegating power to enterprises, and grand 
enterprises all the rights and responsibilities they are 
entitled to. Second, we should continue exploring the specific 
ways to effectively transform the operating mechanism of 
enterprises, pay attention to the various measures for 
enterprises to manage their property, and provide favorable 
conditions for establishing the modern enterprise system more 
rapidly. Third, we should follow the law governing the market 
economy and the state's industrial policy to greatly facilitate 
the restructuring of the organization of enterprises and enliven 
the existing property. Fourth, we should deepen the supporting 
reform within enterprises in line with the requirements for 
establishing the modern enterprise system. Fifth, we should 
realistically reduce the burdens on enterprises and provide an 
environment for enterprises to compete on an equal footing. 
  [Reporter] All circles in society are deeply concerned about 
the work to bring the relations in property rights into better 
balance and to establish the modern enterprise system. Please 
give us more specific details about it. 
  [Wang Dongjin] Based on state's unified arrangements and 
Hebei's reality, we will focus on the implementation of the 
following six measures for property management this year in our 
effort to probe into establishment of the modern enterprise 
system. First, based on the stipulations of the "PRC corporation 
law," we will speed up transforming large and medium-sized 
state-owned enterprises along the direction of the corporation 
system. 1) Based on requirements, we will transform the 
following enterprises into limited liability companies or 
limited liability stock companies in line with their different 
conditions: state-owned enterprises provided with the necessary 
conditions for the transformation, whose products conform to the 
industrial policy and which are highly competitive and create 
good economic efficiency, especially the large- and medium-sized 
enterprises listed in the "dragon and tiger plan;" enterprises 
that develop high and new technology and new industries; real 
estate enterprises engaged in large-area renovation of old city 
proper; enterprises that expand exports to earn more foreign 
exchange and draw in foreign capital; and nucleus enterprises 
that help improve the property right relations of enterprise 
groups. In coordination with the reform of the investment 
system, we will organize the key enterprises approved by the 
state and the province in line with the shareholding system as 
long as they are provided with the necessary conditions so that 
new enterprises will implement new mechanisms. 2) We will select 
30 enterprises which possess the necessary conditions and which 
are invested exclusively by the state (mainly the state-owned 
enterprises in the competitive trades which cannot be 
transformed into shareholding enterprises for the time being and 
the enterprises and construction projects in some monopolizing 
trades, basic industries, and public welfare industries) to 
experiment with the system of exclusively state-invested 
companies and gradually disseminate this system after 
experiences are gained. We will strengthen the standardized 
management of the pilot enterprises experimenting with the 
corporation system so that they will fully perform the function 
of transforming mechanisms. 3) We will actively recommend the 
limited liability stock companies with necessary conditions and 
outstanding business performance for listing their shares and 
strive to win approval for about five enterprises to issue A and 
B shares and list their shares outside the border. We will 
continue exploring the ways for legal persons to list their 
shares. Second, enterprises under contracted management which 
do not have the necessary conditions to transform along the 
direction of the corporation system for the time being may renew 
their contracts to last until the end of the Eighth Five-year 
Plan period. They should conscientiously enforce the "general 
rules on financial affairs of enterprises" and the "business 
accounting standards" and successfully link them with the 
policies for the new fiscal and tax systems. Policies for the 
enterprises operated under the overall input and output 
contracts as approved by the provincial government will last 
until 1995. The investment of these enterprises should be 
properly restructured, and efforts should be concentrated on key 
projects so that they can yield output as soon as possible. 
Third, when transplanting and renovating state-owned 
enterprises with foreign capital, we should pay particular 
attention to the coordination of mechanisms, tie the capital of 
foreign firms in with the property of state-owned enterprises to 
cultivate the operating mechanism compatible with international 
practice so that the numerous purposes of clarifying the 
property right relations, effectively using foreign capital, 
delegating import and export authority, and exploring the world 
market can be attained. Cities and prefectures should select a 
number of projects to be transplanted and renovated, adopt 
various measures to invite investment, and aim at the large 
corporations, consortia, and companies with substantial economic 
and technological strength in the world to develop large-scale 
development. Some enterprises may try out the operating 
mechanism of the three types of foreign-funded enterprises, 
gradually suit their mechanism to the international practice, 
and open up the channels for using foreign capital. Fourth, 
regarding the small and medium-sized enterprises that earn 
little profits or lose money, some may continue the contract 
system, and others may adopt various measures for property 
management which are characterized by state ownership and 
management by the people, such as contracting or leasing out an 
entire enterprise to a natural person who brings in funds, 
leasing out branch plants (workshops), production lines, single 
machines, or whole sets of equipment, and entrusting households 
to produce the products which require simple techniques or are 
more suitable for manual operation but letting the enterprises 
to conduct the accounting. Fifth, enterprises suffering long 
deficits may be put under the management of the large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, scientific research units, 
township enterprises, or foreign firms, which then get 
reimbursement from this. Sixth, while actively promoting the 
public-owned economies, we will encourage the development of 
individual, private, and foreign-funded economies and create 
favorable conditions for the economies of various ownerships to 
participate in the market competition on an equal footing. We 
will speed up reforming the property right system of collective 
enterprises and actively promote the shareholding system. Urban 
and rural collective enterprises and nongovernmental scientific 
and technological enterprises may be transformed into 
shareholding enterprises, shareholding cooperatives, or 
enterprises instituting the partnership system in line with 
their specific conditions. When building new collective 
enterprises, we should strive to adopt the shareholding 
cooperative system from the very beginning and operate them 
under new mechanisms. Small state-owned enterprises may also be 
turned into shareholding cooperatives. 
  [Reporter] The state has issued fairly many measures for 
reform of the macroeconomic system. How will Hebei implement 
them? 
  [Wang Dongjin] The state has issued an unprecedentedly large 
number of measures for reform of the macroeconomic system and 
pressed ahead with them to an unprecedentedly large extent. In 
line with the principle of doing active and prudent work and 
ensuring their implementation, we will emphasize seven aspects. 
  First, in line with the requirement for establishing the 
socialist market economy system, the principle of separating 
government administration from enterprise management, and the 
principle of simplification, unity, and efficiency, we will 
accelerate the organizational reform at governments at all 
levels, change their functions, bring the relations between 
various sectors into better balance, streamline their 
organizations, and divert their personnel so that government 
departments will truly change their habitual direct management 
of the production and operation of enterprises into management 
mainly through economic, legal, and necessary administrative 
means and will provide favorable conditions for enterprises to 
transform mechanisms and establish new ones. 
  Second, we will promote reform of the fiscal and tax systems 
in an active and prudent manner. We will further rationalize 
the relations between the central and the local governments in 
the distribution of revenues and change the current system of 
progressive increase in the revenues to be turned over by 
provincial governments to the central government into the 
revenue-sharing system. We will ensure the smooth transition to 
the revenue-sharing system in line with the principles and 
targets defined by the central authorities and, at the same 
time, carefully formulate and implement the policies for the 
province to reform the fiscal and tax systems of cities and 
prefectures, stimulate their enthusiasm, and facilitate economic 
development. To coordinate with the institution of the 
revenue-sharing system, local tax organizations should be 
established as soon as possible. We will reform and improve the 
tax collection system in line with the principle of "unifying 
the tax laws, levying taxes fairly, simplifying tax systems, and 
dividing power in a reasonable manner." We will extend the 
indirect tax system based mainly on the value-added tax, cancel 
the tax on raw materials and the industrial and commercial 
integrated tax levied from the three types of foreign-funded 
enterprises, and implement the new value-added tax system. We 
will improve the methods for collecting value-added tax and 
implement the system whereby the amount of tax to be levied is 
written in the dispatch lists and the tax is collected according 
to the dispatch lists. Meanwhile, the consumption tax, in 
addition to the value-added tax, will be collected from some 
special commodities during their production and marketing. The 
business tax will continue in the noncommodity businesses from 
which the original business tax levied does not include the new 
value-added tax. A unified tax rate will be applied to the 
income tax levied from state-owned enterprises, collective 
enterprises, shareholding enterprises, and the enterprises 
exercising various forms of joint management; and the new 
personal income tax law will be enforced to strengthen the 
collection and management of personal income tax. Collection of 
the resources tax will be expanded to promote the effective 
utilization of resources. Real estate value-added tax will be 
levied in the trade of real estate. 
  Third, we will facilitate the reform of the banking system. 
We will accelerate the transformation of the functions of the 
People's Bank of China at the provincial level and below to 
strengthen their responsibilities for monetary supervision and 
management, investigation and statistical analysis, regulation 
of lateral money supply, management of the state treasury's cash 
allocation, foreign exchange management, and joint accounting. 
Various specialized banks will be transformed into commercial 
banks and will carry out management of the proportions of assets 
and liabilities and management of property risks. We will 
strive for establishment of agencies of various state 
policy-lending banks in Hebei; rural credit cooperatives will be 
separated from agricultural banks and will carry out management 
of the proportions of assets and liabilities based on the 
evaluation of the remaining sum to provide favorable conditions 
for establishing rural cooperative banks; and transformation of 
urban credit cooperatives into urban cooperative banks will be 
accelerated, monetary institutions other than banks, such as 
trust and investment companies and security companies, will be 
greatly developed, and the managerial system for rural 
cooperative foundations will be improved. We will deepen the 
reform of the insurance system and establish Hebei branches of 
the Taipingyang and Pingan Insurance Companies. We will create 
favorable conditions to bring in institutions of foreign funds 
and strive for foreign loans. 
  Fourth, we will speed up the reform of the planning system. 
We will further reduce the mandatory plans in the fields of 
production, commodity circulation, and distribution; establish 
and improve the systems for state ordering, storage, and 
allocation of goods; accelerate establishment of the new 
guidance planning system; put the focus of the planning work on 
the research and formulation of medium- and long-term plans, 
comprehensive coordination of macroeconomic policies, and 
application of economic levers; properly draw up the strategies 
for provincial economic and social development, targets of 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and industrial policies; 
do a good job in economic forecast; plan for the economic 
structure and production layout; and combine the fundamental 
role of the market in distribution of resources with the 
advantage of macroeconomic regulation and control through 
planning. 
  Fifth, we will deepen the reform of the investment and 
money-lending systems. We will further apply the mechanism of 
market competition to the work of investment and money-lending, 
strengthen the position of enterprises as major investors, and 
gradually establish the risk-taking responsibility system for 
legal person investment and bank credit. We will standardize 
the activities of the major investors, reform the methods for 
investment and money- lending, and improve the investment 
efficiency. Enterprises as legal persons hold the 
responsibilities and bear the risks for all the preparations, 
fund-raising, designing, and construction of construction 
projects and even the production, management, debt repayment, 
and the maintenance and increase of the value of assets. 
Regarding the new projects to be started and the projects 
already under construction, we will determine their major 
investors and, based on the sources and structure of the 
capital, establish the enterprises which institute the 
corporation system to hold the responsibility for the entire 
process of the construction. We will fully develop the role of 
the provincial construction investment company as the major 
investor in the basic industries. We will establish and improve 
the investment service systems provided by consulting, 
designing, auditing, construction supervisory, and other social 
intermediary organizations which serve the major investors. 
  Sixth, we will unify the exchange rate in line with state 
unified arrangements, abolish the foreign exchange retention and 
quota management systems, exercise unified foreign exchange 
purchases and sales, and establish the system whereby 
enterprises report foreign exchange income and expenditure. 
  Seventh, we will reform and improve enterprises' state-owned 
asset management system. We should look squarely at the serious 
losses in enterprises' state-owned assets, step up establishment 
of the "methods for the supervision and management of the 
property of Hebei's state-owned enterprises," and implement the 
system under which state-owned assets are owned by the state in 
a unified manner, supervised at different levels by governments, 
and managed independently by enterprises. We should explore 
ways to establish the major operators of state property rights 
and entrust certain units or establish supervision councils to 
experiment with the supervision and management of the 
state-owned assets of selected key enterprises subordinate to 
metallurgical industry, foreign trade, building materials, 
chemical industry, auto industry, and petroleum industry 
departments. After experiences are gained, they will be 
extended throughout the province. In this way, the supervision 
councils, while ensuring the enterprises' property right, will 
conscientiously hold the responsibility for supervising the 
maintenance and increase of the value of the property, but they 
should not intervene in the management of the enterprises. In 
the process of the reorganization and flow of the enterprises' 
property, it is strictly prohibited to covert state-owned assets 
into shares and sell them at low prices or even distribute them 
to individuals without compensation; and it is strictly 
prohibited to infringe upon state-owned assets and their 
interests. To overcome the defects in the traditional 
managerial system for state-owned property, we should follow 
state arrangements to make inventory and accounting of property 
step by step to ascertain the quantity, determine the property 
right, clarify debts receivable and debts payable, appraise 
property, verify the amount of property used by enterprises, and 
adopt effective property organizations and property managerial 
measures to make state-owned property yield due returns. (to be 
continued)

<F P=106> [Speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of Heilongjiang Provincial </F>
Party Committee, at the provincial experience-exchange meeting 
on ideological and work style of leading bodies: "Leading Bodies 
Should Take the Lead in Working Hard" on 28 February] 
  [Text] Working hard is our party's glorious tradition and 
the magic weapon for vanquishing the enemy. Each and every 
major success we made during the war period and the large-scale 
economic construction period was the result of hard work. At 
present, reform, opening up, and modernization have entered a 
new stage. Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability are 
the overall tasks of the whole party during these periods. 
Based on this topic, we successively held the second plenary 
session of the seventh provincial party committee, the 
provincial economic work conference, and the second session of 
the eighth provincial people's congress around the Spring 
Festival period to clearly define the tasks for the province's 
reform, development, and stability during 1994. To fulfill 
these tasks, we have to overcome many difficulties and to 
resolve many new contradictions and new problems. This requires 
leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in working hard 
and to strive to form a situation of working hard to become 
pioneers in great undertakings in the whole province. To 
promote the hardworking spirit during the new stage of reform, 
opening up, and modernization, we must unswervingly implement 
the party's basic line, pay simultaneous attention to hard work 
and creative work, and strive to seek realistic work 
achievements; concentrate energy on economic construction, try 
by all possible means to overcome difficult problems in the 
course of development, and strive to gain a fairly rapid 
development rate; uphold the mass line, share the comforts and 
hardships of the masses, do more practical things for them, and 
maintain flesh-blood ties between the party and the masses of 
people; and persist in resisting the corrosive influence of the 
bourgeois ideology, perform official work honestly and 
diligently, stress frugality, and promote the formation of a 
healthy, progressive, civilized, and open social atmosphere. 
  A. Our province has very complicated economic tasks and many 
difficulties which require our leading cadres at all levels to 
enhance spirit and immerse themselves in hard work. Through 
10-odd years of effort in reform and opening up, our province 
has made considerable progress and noticeably enhanced its 
comprehensive economic strength and the people's living 
standards. However, owing to the various kinds of 
contradictions and problems accumulated under the traditional 
systems over a long time, there are some prominent difficulties 
at present: The long shortage of investment, the lack of major 
projects to stimulate economic development, and the outdated 
equipment in key enterprises have mingled together to make 
industries lack ability to make progress and to make the number 
of unmarketable products increase; the resources of petroleum 
and timber have declined, the mining and excavation industry 
which accounts for one-third of the entire industry has 
continued to decline, thus increasing the number of "unleavened 
dough" in economic development and financial revenue; restricted 
by natural conditions, the per-unit construction cost of capital 
construction projects and the comprehensive energy consumption 
for producing every 10,000 yuan worth of products are higher 
than the national average, and the production cost has 
restricted the competitive ability of products on the market; 
the precision and intensive processing industry is undeveloped, 
the proportion of the processed coal, timber, oil, and grain is 
much lower than the national average which has resulted in a 
disconnection in various industries and a short processing 
chain; the development of the nonstate sector of the economy is 
not developed, and the township enterprises, and foreign-funded, 
individual, and private sectors of the economy have failed to 
give an impetus to promoting economic growth; while greatly 
increasing the total supply of grain and sideline products, the 
comparative returns of agriculture is low, and the more we have 
produced and stored grain, the heavier the burdens have become, 
making the progress of rural industrialization very slow. To 
overcome these difficulties in economic development, we must 
make progress actively and strive for greater state support. The 
most important is to rely on our own efforts to improve 
ourselves and work hard. First, we must enhance spirit. While 
facing many difficulties in the economy, Heilongjiang Province 
also has many favorable conditions. For example, the central 
authorities have decided to comprehensively establish the 
socialist market economic structure which will help us solve 
contradictions caused by inappropriate systems and difficulties 
in economic development and create an unprecedented opportunity; 
through many years of practice and explorations, we have formed 
a development idea that conforms to the state industrial policy 
and the basic provincial conditions, which will effect a better 
turn for the better in the whole province's economy if we uphold 
it; the development of new economic growing points, such as 
township enterprises, has been accelerated, and the preferential 
policies we have implemented will surely play a role in 
promoting economic growth in the whole province. Therefore, we 
must correctly grasp the economic situation, and in addition to 
recognizing and facing difficulties squarely, we must boost our 
courage to overcome difficulties. Only by urging leading bodies 
and leading cadres at all levels to first overcome the passive 
and pessimistic ideology of attempting nothing and accomplishing 
nothing, can we enhance the spirit of the higher and the lower 
levels across the province, fully mobilize the hidden enthusiasm 
of the masses of cadres, make concerted efforts to overcome 
difficulties, and accelerate the pace of economic development. 
Second, we should immerse ourselves in hard work. All 
difficult things on earth can be handled easily if we try it, 
and all easy things may seem difficult to handle if we do not 
try it. In face of the issues in economic development, leading 
cadres at all levels must cultivate a practical and hardworking 
spirit. With this spirit, we can solve overall difficulties 
and seek development. For example, with the similar natural and 
economic conditions, some places can maintain a healthy and 
vigorous development trend, and some are in a poverty-stricken 
state; likewise, some state-owned enterprises have gained vigor 
and vitality through reform and transformation and some have 
witnessed an increase in their difficulties. The crucial issue 
involved here is whether we can emancipate ideology and make 
earnest efforts to do practical things. Therefore, to 
strengthen the leading bodies, we must establish the mechanism 
of encouraging more practical work and paying attention to 
actual results, and resolutely overcome the problem of striving 
for undeserved reputation and practicing formalism; cultivate 
the habit of performing one's duty faithfully, working without 
complaints, and daring to undertake heavy tasks and to 
resolutely overcome the work style of paying lip service without 
doing anything or taking any responsibility, seeking comforts, 
and dodging contradictions. Third, we should work hard to make 
progress. The more difficulties we face, the easier the mental 
state of doing sloppy work will occur. At present, the ideology 
and feeling of being content with the present situation, seeking 
stability and fearing chaos, willing to stay in the middling 
state, and regarding backwardness reasonable have existed among 
some leading cadres in varying degrees. This is not the 
ambition and pursuit which our communist party people should 
have. The party and the people have entrusted us with the 
undertakings of one place or one department, we should cultivate 
a sense of political responsibility of "bringing benefits to a 
place when one is in office there," and exert utmost efforts and 
wisdom to manage well the work of that place and that 
department; have boldness and vigor to seize the opportunity, 
boldly carry out things which we think right, and resolutely do 
well things we should do; and cultivate the will of doing 
first-grade work and creating top-grade achievements, make 
vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous, and try by all 
possible means to make greater achievements. 
  B. Establishing the socialist market economic new structure 
is a brand-new and arduous task that requires leading cadres at 
all levels to blaze new trials and to make progress with a 
pioneering spirit. The implementation of the planned economic 
system over scores of years has left us many long-standing big 
and difficult problems. At present, our province's proportion 
of state-owned industrial units is as high as 80.2 percent (the 
national proportion is 48.1 percent), that of state-owned large 
and medium-sized enterprises, 60.87 percent (national proportion 
is 36.4 percent, that of mandatory plans, 23 percent (the 
national proportion is less that 5 percent), and that of 
enterprises directly under the central government, 42 percent, 
(national proportion is 20 percent), and these four proportions 
all rank first in the country. It is rarely seen in China that 
the factors of having enterprises of larger size and having a 
high degree of public ownership and the system of centralized 
and decentralized management are concentrated in one province. 
Therefore, it is not an easy task to establish the socialist 
market economic structure in Heilongjiang Province. We must 
exert painstaking efforts to achieve this. At present, we have 
entered the stage of tackling difficult problems and carrying 
out package reform with breakthrough thoughts in key areas. 
  We should give priority to reforming the property right of 
state-owned enterprises and accelerate the establishment of the 
modern enterprise system; regard cultivating markets of the 
essential production factors as the emphasis and accelerate the 
establishment of an integrated, open, competitive, and orderly 
market system; give priority to changing government functions, 
and establish and improve the economic regulation and control 
system; regard the unemployment and old-age insurance of 
enterprise workers as the priorities, and establish and improve 
the social security system; regard the shareholding cooperative 
system as the emphasis, further improve the rural operational 
system, and give priority to deepening foreign trade system to 
promote the escalation of the strategy of opening to the outside 
world; and attach importance to commercializing and 
industrializing the scientific and technological findings, and 
accelerate the process of integrating science with technology, 
education, and economy. To fulfill these reform tasks, we must 
have courage to blaze new trials and always regard emancipating 
the mind and deepening reform as the primary task. We must 
uphold the three essential criteria and never mechanically copy 
and follow plans from the higher levels, but work creatively in 
line with reality; never adopt the attitude of avoiding knotty 
problems or shifting the responsibility on to other people, but 
promote the spirit of daring to blaze new trials, to try, and to 
take risks advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; never stick to 
old ways or manage things with old experience while dealing with 
the new situation and new problems in reform, but think of new 
ideas, and be good at opening up a new working sphere and 
creating new achievements in work. We must advance despite 
difficulty, and take active and reliable steps to handle the 
difficult problems in reform. In deepening enterprise reform, 
we must withstand the strains of the employment problem of 
workers in enterprises which are ordered to shut down, suspend 
operation, amalgamate with other enterprises or switch to the 
manufacture of other products, and the arrangements for their 
living; in deepening reform of the price system, we must see 
whether the masses of people can stand the strain. In the face 
of the coexistence of these advantages and disadvantages, we 
must not adopt a hesitative and wait-and-see attitude because 
this cannot help us solve problems. Stagnation in reform will 
make us lose the future development opportunity. We must choose 
advantages, eliminate disadvantages, and advance in a pioneering 
spirit. Of course, while unswervingly promoting reform of the 
economic structure, we must properly handle the relations of 
reform, development, and stability, use our brain and think of a 
way to make breakthroughs in tackling difficult points in 
reform, persist in giving consideration to the overall 
situation, handle things in the order of priority, carry out 
reform in a coordinated manner, and ensure that reform of the 
socialist market economic structure will be carried out in a 
sound and orderly manner. 
  C. In the practice of reform and development, the number of 
social contradictions caused by readjustment of the relations of 
interests and destablishing factors will increase, and this 
requires leading cadres at all levels to show greater concerns 
for the people's living and do more practical things for them. 
Reform cannot be separated from the people's understanding, 
support, and participation. In the course of deepening reform, 
leading cadres at all levels should pay particular attention to 
the people's difficulties of one sort or another caused by the 
readjustment of the pattern of interests. At present, some 
cadres have enjoyed a certain power vested by the people but 
have failed to hold responsibility to the people and to perform 
their obligation. They have paid no attention to the hardships 
or the voice of the people, made suppositions subjectively while 
considering or resolving issues, and deviated themselves from 
reality and the masses. Some people have even sought personal 
"achievements in their career" at the cost of sacrificing the 
interests of the people. We must conscientiously resolve these 
problems. It is necessary to educate cadres at all levels to 
cultivate a viewpoint of giving first thought to the people and 
regard seeking benefits for the masses of people as the starting 
and resting points. We should take the lead in working hard and 
use this to cement the hearts of the masses, maintain close ties 
between the party and the masses by realistically resolving the 
problems which people have complained about strongly, and win 
the people's trust and support with our actual deeds of working 
our official work diligently. In policymaking, we must 
consider people's opinions and voice as the first signal. In 
formulating a policy or a decision, we must deeply conduct 
investigation and study, extensively listen to the people's 
opinions, and while formulating major reform measures, in 
particular, we must uphold and pay attention to the principle of 
letting all the people enjoy benefits and making all people 
withstand the strains, and enable policymaking and the 
implementation of policy decisions to become more in line with 
the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people. In 
work, we should regard doing practical and good things for the 
masses as the first duty of the leading bodies. We should go 
deeply to the grass roots regularly, help the masses eliminate 
misgivings and solve problems, realistically solve the issue of 
enabling workers of difficult enterprises to have work to do and 
food to eat and the issue on production and living of 
poverty-stricken households in the rural areas. It is necessary 
to do public welfare undertakings that may bring common benefits 
to the masses within our ability. In promoting the development 
of all undertakings, we should regard the masses of people as 
the first force on which we can rely. The mass line of "doing 
all things for the sake of the people, relying on the masses 
while doing every thing, getting the opinions of the masses and 
referring them back to the masses" must be upheld at any time, 
the pioneering spirit of the masses must be fully respected, and 
their enthusiasm must be protected and mobilized. We should 
urge the masses of people to work with us with one heart and one 
mind, to overcome difficult in the course of advance, and to 
make concerted efforts to successfully carry out reform and 
modernization by mobilizing them ideologically, showing them 
typical examples, and attracting them with policies. 
  D. With the enhancement of the degree of opening to the 
outside world, the task of resisting the corrosive influence of 
decadent ideology has become more urgent. This requires the 
leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in performing 
their official work honestly and paying attention to frugality. 
With the unceasing deepening of reform and opening up, the 
people's ideology and concept, and the social habits are being 
actively changed to meet the demand of social progress. 
However, we must recognize that some passive and backward 
phenomena running counter to the essence of socialism and the 
traditional virtue of the Chinese nation have really existed and 
grown. Particularly, money worshipping, out-and-out egotism, and 
the trend of extravagance have run rampant. What merits our 
attention is that these phenomena have also existed among some 
leading cadres. Some people have abused the powers in their 
hands as a means to seek personal gain, traded power for money, 
and sought benefits for the individuals and their family 
members and friends; some have sought personal comforts, dined 
and wined luxuriously, worn expensive clothes, sought inordinate 
consumption in living, and even compared their wealth with "rich 
people" in society. If we let such a situation to spread 
unchecked, the prestige of the party and the government will be 
seriously harmed and the achievements in reform, opening up, and 
construction will be buried. We must adopt resolute measures 
to correct this. The advanced nature of the communist party is 
to wholeheartedly serve the people and not to seek personal 
gain. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said: "Why did our party have 
great power in the past? During the war, we always said that if 
30 percent of the soldiers in the company are communist members, 
this company must be good and have strong fighting capacity. 
Why? This is because communist party members are always the 
first to fight on the frontline and the last to retreat and the 
first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts." Today, 
when we conduct reform, opening up, and modernization, we should 
also demand leading cadres at all levels and the broad masses of 
communist party members to show the broad mind of being "the 
first to worry about what the people have worried and the last 
to enjoy comforts," pay more attention to the success and 
failure of their work and less attention to their own gain or 
loss, and have courage to sacrifice their personal interests for 
the party's cause and the people's undertakings. Leading cadres 
at all levels should take the lead in performing official duties 
honestly, enhance the training of party spirit, cultivate a 
correct concept of value, power, hardships, and happiness, and 
strengthen ability to oppose corruption and guard against 
evolution; leading bodies at all levels should regard party 
style and administrative honesty as the important aspect of 
building leading bodies, persist in unswervingly conducting 
anticorruption struggle, and form a strong political atmosphere 
of opposing corruption and promoting honesty. We should also 
actively promote the trend of practicing economy. "Looking back 
at the prominent personages of the past, those who worked 
diligently became successful persons and those who spent 
extravagantly suffered failure." This old saying is still a 
famous dictum to date. During the new period in which 
Heilongjiang is taking steps to change the system and to blaze 
new trials in industry, and, in particular, under the situation 
in which some enterprises have difficulties in production and 
management and the living standards of some people have remained 
low, we should all the more uphold the principle of working 
hard, practicing economy, and building the country through hard 
work. All localities and departments should cultivate the idea 
of leading an austere life, appropriately conduct etiquette 
activities, improve working conditions, practice economy, and 
use the limited amount of money and material resources to 
effectively develop production. Party committees at all levels 
and discipline inspection commissions at all levels should 
strengthen supervision over leading cadres, promptly reorganize 
and reshuffle cadres who go in for ostentation and extravagance 
and spend public funds lavishly, and give party and 
administrative sanctions to those whose cases are serious in an 
effort to safeguard the advanced nature and purity of the party, 
to successfully build our leading bodies at all levels, and to 
provide a solid organizational basis and an effective leadership 
guarantee for promoting reform, opening up, and modernization.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of the report on the work of the Heilongjiang </F>
Provincial Higher People's Court given by Tang Xianqiang, 
president of the provincial Higher People's Court, at the second 
session of the eighth Heilongjiang Provincial people's congress] 
  [Text] Fellow Deputies: 
  I now submit the report on the work of courts across the 
province since the first session of the eighth provincial 
people's congress for your examination and approval. 
  In 1993, after the convocation of the first session of the 
eighth provincial people's congress, courts at all levels across 
the province used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 
14th party congress as the guidance, conscientiously implemented 
the guidelines of the resolution of the first session of the 
eighth provincial people's congress on the work report of the 
provincial Higher People's Court under the leadership, 
supervision, and guidance of the party committees and the 
people's congresses at all levels and the Supreme People's 
Court, acted in close connection with the central tasks of the 
party and the state, comprehensively strengthened all tasks 
centering on judicial work, and provided effective legal service 
and judicial guarantee for deepening reform and opening up and 
for accelerating economic construction. These were manifested 
in the following: First, courts at all levels across the 
province upheld the viewpoint that handling more cases, handling 
cases rapidly, and handling them well as the most direct and 
effective service for reform, opening up, and economic 
construction, further strengthened all judicial tasks, accepted 
a total of 187,945 cases of the first instance, and completed 
188,009 cases (including leftover cases from the previous year), 
up 3.1 percent and 3.6 percent respectively over the previous 
year. The rate of comprehensively winding up cases was 98 
percent, 5,644 cases more were completed as compared with the 
previous year; cases which were not completed showed a decline 
of 5.7 percent from the previous year. This showed that new 
progress was made in judicial work. Second, courts at all levels 
across the province persisted in linking judicial work with 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, gave prominence 
to service on their own initiative, expanded the service sphere, 
strengthened service measures, enhanced the service level, gave 
simultaneous attention to the quality of handling cases, 
efficiency, and results, and made new progress in making 
judicial work serve reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. Third, courts at all levels across the province 
persisted in regarding forming an image of "listening to reason 
while enforcing law, and performing their work most justly and 
honestly" as their objective, regarded building spiritual 
civilization as a motivation, and strengthened the ranks of 
judicial personnel. Among the courts across the province, 195 
had been named civilized units by their local party committees 
and governments, accounting for 97 percent of the total number 
of courts; among the court cadres and policemen across the 
province, 2,856 cadres and policemen were commended and awarded, 
accounting for 25.1 percent of the total number of cadres and 
policemen. This showed that new progress was made in building 
the ranks of policemen. The new progress in judicial work and 
the self-development of courts across the province should be 
attributed to our efforts to grasp the following three aspects 
of work: 
  1. We unceasingly deepened the guiding ideology for judicial 
work and conscientiously expanded the degree of serving reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. Since the beginning of 
1993, particularly after the issuance of the central major 
policy decision on strengthening macroeconomic regulation and 
control and the "decision of the CPC Central Committee on some 
issues concerning the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure" adopted at the third plenary session of the 
ah CPC Central Committee, the provincial court, on the basis of 
conscientiously conducting investigation and analyzing the new 
situation facing judicial work, successively held work meetings 
and meetings of court presidents on three occasions to study 
guidelines on how to consciously deepen judicial work and to 
strengthen the work on serving reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. The meetings set forth the necessity to 
ceaselessly emancipate the mind; renew the idea of enforcing 
laws; firmly foster the idea of taking the overall situation 
into consideration, the idea of service, the idea of policies, 
and the idea of accomplishing something; bring into full play 
the legal means' key functions for strengthening the 
macroeconomic regulation and control and standardizing the 
socialist market economic operation; justly enforce laws; 
improve work efficiency according to the policy on the inherent 
efficiency of the socialist market economy; stress the benefits 
from enforcement of laws; bravely eliminate the influence of the 
local protectionism and the departmental protectionism according 
to the requirements for the socialist unified, open-typed, and 
large-scale markets; enforce laws in a unified way; accurately 
handle the new-typed cases cropping up in the course of 
replacing the old systems by the new and under the situation 
that laws are not stipulated in explicit terms; persist in the 
accurate law enforcement orientation; and provide effective 
legal services and judicial guarantees for setting up the 
socialist market economic system. Due to the ceaseless 
deepening of the ideology for guiding the trial work, we 
enhanced the awareness of regulating and controlling the 
macroeconomy, developing the socialist market economy, and 
serving the struggle against corruption and the safeguarding of 
the social stability. First, we especially and concentratively 
attacked criminal activities and expanded the dynamics of 
dealing blows to various serious criminal offenders who 
jeopardize social order. The courts at various levels across 
the province unswervingly implemented the principle of sternly 
and immediately punishing criminal offenders and sentenced 
16,254 criminal offenders who caused legal effect, including 
6,589 criminals who were sentenced to five years of imprisonment 
or more or even to death, accounting for 40.5 percent of the 
total. The courts got involved, in advance, in the cases 
involving gangs of criminals and the major evil cases that 
society and the masses paid attention to; and tried every 
possible means to immediately try these cases. When waging the 
province-wide "spring attack," "100-day fortified battle," and 
"strict blow" struggles, we concentratively organized several 
province-wide attacks and maintained the momentum of the 
attacks. Second, we concentrated energy to try major and 
appalling economic criminal cases and strengthened the dynamics 
of strictly punishing economic criminals. The courts at various 
levels across the province generally set up leading groups to 
try major and appalling economic criminal cases and also set up 
a perfect system to report and supervise the handling of major 
and appalling cases. Persistently in line with the principle of 
strict punishment according to laws, we sentenced 2,777 
criminals who were guilty of corruption and bribery and caused 
legal effect, including 884 or 31.8 percent of criminals who 
were sentenced to five years of imprisonment or more and even to 
death. According to the party Central Committee and the 
provincial party committee's requirements for making 
achievements in the current-stage struggle against corruption, 
the provincial court concentratively organized forces and tried 
two groups of criminals who were involved in the major and 
appalling economic cases. In the forms of public trials and 
public pronunciation of the judgment, we strengthened propaganda 
and expanded the social effect of handling cases. Third, in 
line with the demands for economic development, we strengthened 
the dynamics of regulating, according to laws, the relationship 
among various sectors of the economy. The courts at various 
levels across the province positively explored new ways for 
serving the economic construction and expanded the service 
channels. The courts accepted and handled first rulings on 
36,816 economic cases, and the lawsuits on these cases were 
marked at 2.51 billion yuan, respectively increasing by 14.4 
percent and 90.8 percent over the previous year. According to 
the provincial actual conditions, the courts from higher levels 
downward carried out the special service activities of clearing 
up debts, defaulted taxes, and loans. By adopting lawsuit and 
non-lawsuit means, the courts at various levels handled 17,979 
enterprises' clearing-up cases, these cases were marked at 890 
million yuan, and 358 million yuan were retrieved for 
enterprises. By launching the activities that the tax affairs 
organizations jointly investigated, handled, and cleared up the 
cases of paying taxes and fines that should have been paid, 238 
million yuan worth of defaulted taxes were paid. Actively 
working in cooperation with the financial departments, the 
courts examined and handled, according to laws, 4,965 cases of 
withdrawing loans; and withdrew 265 million yuan of overdue 
loans and idle funds. Thus, the courts played a positive role in 
enlivening capital and promoting the development of the economy. 
  2. We persisted in enforcing laws strictly and strived to 
upgrade the law-enforcement level. To safeguard the unity and 
sanctity of law-enforcement and ensure impartial enforcement of 
laws, courts at all levels in the province always regarded 
strict law-enforcement and improvement of law-enforcement level 
as a very important task. First, we further improved the 
supervisory and restrictive mechanisms focusing on judicial 
supervision. While paying attention to standardized management 
of judicial work, strictly implementing the open trial system, 
and conducting large-scale inspection on law- and 
discipline-enforcement, we further improved the work mechanisms 
that separate registration of cases from trial of cases, trial 
of cases from law-enforcement, and trial of cases from 
supervision, and we worked out corresponding work systems to add 
impetus to the supervisory work and raise its level. Through the 
judicial supervision, courts at all levels in the province 
handled 13,144 appeals for reexamination and retrial, of which 
4.3 percent, or 566 cases, had their verdicts changed according 
to law. By strengthening judicial supervision, we corrected 
improper judgments of cases and erroneous deeds in 
law-enforcement. We also drew on experiences and lessons form 
this to promote the law-enforcement level. Thanks to inspection 
on law-enforcement, we attained an accuracy rate of more than 96 
percent and 91 percent in enforcing substantive laws and 
procedural laws, respectively. Second, we further strengthened 
the systems to ensure the quality in handling cases, which is 
focused on the system of investigating and affixing the 
responsibility for wrong cases. The provincial court began to 
experiment with this system in March last year at the courts at 
two levels in Qitaihe and Harbin cities, Suihua Prefecture, and 
state farms, clarified the scope of wrong cases, the major 
persons to be held accountable, measures for punishment, and 
procedures for handling, and established and improved relevant 
supporting measures. This system helped effectively enhance the 
sense of responsibility of cadres and policemen, improve the 
quality and efficiency in handling cases, promote honesty in 
performing official duties, facilitate the establishment and 
improvement of the mechanism of competition for cadre 
management, reform the patterns of trial, strengthen management, 
and raise the overall level of judicial work. After 
conscientiously summarizing the experiences of the experiment, 
the provincial court in December last year held a work 
conference on disseminating this system in the courts throughout 
the province. It decided that this system be applied by the 
courts at all levels in the province beginning 1 January this 
year in order to improve the supervisory mechanism for handling 
cases and the systems to ensure the quality. Third, we 
strengthened guidance to lower levels, with the focus on 
conducting investigation and study on implementation of laws and 
policies. To correctly handle the new types of cases emerging 
in reform, opening up, and economic construction in a timely 
manner, the provincial court organized and concentrated efforts 
to conduct investigation and study on how the seven intermediate 
courts and 34 grass-roots courts tried the new types of cases on 
bills, bankruptcy, and disputes over border trade and, in view 
of the problems that existed, formulated and issued documents to 
standardize the trials of cases on bills, bankruptcy, labor 
disputes, and real estate, and cases involving foreigners. 
These documents offered operable opinions on issues concerning 
enforcement of policies and laws and standardized 
law-enforcement activities. 
  3. Focusing on the anticorruption struggle, we greatly 
improved the contingents of cadres and policemen. To 
conscientiously implement the arrangements of the party Central 
Committee, the provincial party committee, and the Supreme 
People's Court on waging the anticorruption struggle and to 
achieve success in the anticorruption struggle of the provincial 
court, the provincial court formulated in a timely manner the 
"opinions on the anticorruption struggle to be waged by all the 
courts in the province in the near future" and the "work plan 
for the organs of the provincial court to wage the 
anticorruption struggle in the near future," clarified the major 
problems to be addressed and the methods, steps, ensuring 
measures, and basic requirements of the struggle, and thus 
promoted the in-depth development of the struggle in the courts 
at all levels of the province. First, we conducted extensive 
and intensive education to oppose corruption and advocate 
honesty among cadres and policemen. By carrying out ideological 
mobilization and organizing outstanding judges to make mobile 
reports on their deeds, the province conducted education among 
cadres and policemen on the typical cases of violating the law 
and discipline and better dealt with the ideological problems 
committed by cadres and policemen with regard to "having nothing 
to do with them," "implicating others and adopting a 
wait-and-see attitude," " indulging in self glorification," and 
of "being insufficient in confidence." Thus, the consciousness 
and firmness of cadres and policemen in successfully waging the 
struggle against corruption were enhanced. Second, clearing up 
and consolidation were carried out. By persistently regarding 
as an emphasis the work of encouraging cadres at or above the 
section level to perform their official duties honestly and to 
conduct self discipline, the province adopted the methods of 
conducting self examination and inspection; setting up hot 
telephone line and boxes for reporting cases; visiting the 
departments concerned; and sending letters to solicit opinions 
to deal with the problems in the following fields: Personnel in 
charge of handling the cases accepted the treat given by the 
offenders while taking food, boarding, and travel together with 
these offenders. Personnel accepted the money of offenders for 
paying their investigation expenses that are originally 
official. Personnel handled the cases by accepting bribes 
through doing the offenders a favor and giving a favorable 
decision in line with personal relationship. Personnel accepted 
bails and investigation expenses for probation by violating the 
regulations. In line with the difference of these problems, the 
province handled them respectively. Of the 37 offenders who 
committed 35 cases by seriously violating the law and 
discipline, 30 were imposed on with the sanctions of party and 
administrative disciplines; and seven were transferred to the 
procuratorial organs to pursue their criminal liabilities. 
Those who accepted bails and investigation expenses for 
probation were ordered to return the money within the given 
date. Third, we further established or improved the systems of 
performing official duties honestly. In line with the problems 
exposed in the struggle against corruption, courts at all levels 
across the province formulated or improved at their own level 
the systems of enforcing the law honestly and encouraging 
administrative honesty and anticorruption and further reinforced 
the supervisory work. While deeply waging the struggle against 
corruption, courts at all levels across the province also 
further enhanced the ideological and political work and 
extensively carried out the activities of fostering the fine 
image of people's courts, tribunals, and judges who are "the 
best in being impervious to reason, being justice, and being 
honest". They also vied to carry out the activities of scoring 
outstanding achievements and the emulation drive for carrying 
out on-the-job training for personnel. All of these have led 
cadres and policemen to foster their correct outlook on life and 
value; vigorously encouraged the development of the spirit of 
making selfless contributions, serving the people 
wholeheartedly, and strictly enforcing the law; and vigorously 
upgraded the political and professional quality of cadres and 
policemen. 
  Courts across the province achieved new progress in various 
work in 1993 and achieved larger progress in some fields. 
However, in line with the demands cropping up in developing the 
new situation and tasks, they still have some problems that 
brook to be neglected, which chiefly are as follows: The 
initiative of few courts in serving reform, opening up, and 
economic construction is not strong; their ways to render 
service in this regard are not wide; and their dynamics in this 
regard is not enough. Problems of not strictly enforcing the 
law and making unfair decisions in few cases still exist. Few 
cadres and policemen lack the sense of public servants and adopt 
a lukewarm, rigid, rude, and blunt attitude toward the masses. 
Specific cadres and policemen often commit the problems of 
handling the cases by doing a favor to offenders, giving 
favorable decisions in line with personal relationship, seeking 
personal gains by taking advantage of power, and violating the 
law and discipline. Measures adopted by courts for self 
improvement have been totally implemented. The supervisory 
mechanism of strictly running the courts have to be further 
improved and implemented. The interference of local and 
departmental protectionism is still very serious. Difficulties 
cropping up in enforcing the law have not been fundamentally 
overcome. As for the existing and aforementioned problems, we 
will adopt a seek-truth attitude and realistic measure to carry 
out earnest study over them and to earnestly resolve them. 
  Fellow deputies, at present, China is in an important 
historical period of deepening reform and comprehensively 
accelerating economic development. In the whole process of 
building the socialist market economic structure, we must rely 
on law enforcement to guarantee the operation of the market 
economy and use legal means to adjust all relations and disputes 
in the market economic activities. The people's courts which are 
holding an important status of enforcing law will face a higher 
demand and more complicated tasks, and will play a more 
prominent role and shoulder more important responsibilities. In 
order to meet the need of the development of the new situation 
in a better manner, we have defined the guidelines for the work 
of courts across the province in 1994, which are: Use Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary session 
of the 14th party Central Committee as the guidance, 
comprehensively strengthen all judicial work, give priority to 
trying major and appalling cases, persist in strictly enforcing 
law, enhance the law enforcement level, realistically strengthen 
self-development, strive to upgrade and improve all work, and 
provide effective legal service and judicial guarantee for 
accelerating the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure and promoting an accelerated development in our 
province's economy. The general demands are: We must create a 
momentum in dealing blows to criminals, achieve effective 
results in handling major and appalling cases, make big progress 
in readjusting the relations in various economic sectors, 
comprehensively enhance the law enforcement level, and achieve 
new progress in all undertakings. To realize the aforementioned 
guidelines and general demands, we must stress the following 
five aspects of work: First, we should deal strict blows to 
criminal offenses that seriously harm public security so as to 
safeguard social stability. It is necessary to proceed the work 
from the overall situation of providing a stable social 
environment for the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, continue to uphold the strategic principle 
of "taking a two-handed approach in work and be tough with 
both," resolutely deal blows to all kinds of criminals who 
seriously harm public security, and do all we can to safeguard 
social stability. We must maintain a momentum of dealing blows 
to criminals, resolutely deal blows to such crimes as murder, 
robbery, rape, hooliganism, serious theft, "bus and train 
robbery and waylaying," and "six vices," particularly the crimes 
committed by cliques involving the underworld society. We should 
strengthen the degree of dealing blows, uphold the principle of 
punishing criminals heavily and quickly in line with law, and 
rapidly try and resolutely mete out heavy punishment for 
criminals who seriously harm public security. It is necessary 
to expand the effect of dealing blows, conduct concentrated and 
special activities on dealing blows to criminals of different 
scales, with different substance, and at different levels in a 
timely manner, and give further play to the overall functions of 
courts in joining the comprehensive management of public 
security. Second, we should strictly punish serious economic 
criminals, safeguard economic order, and promote the deepening 
of anticorruption struggle. It is necessary to unceasingly 
deepen understanding on the necessity of dealing blows to 
economic crimes under the new situation and give priority to 
dealing blows to state functionaries who abuse their posts to 
engage in corruption, bribery, and misappropriation of public 
funds; and resolutely deal blows to such crimes as smuggling, 
cheating, making or selling fake or inferior products, and tax 
evasion. We should uphold the principle of punishing criminals 
strictly in line with law, resolutely resist and eliminate 
interferences from all sectors, and resolutely mete out heavy 
punishment to those who deserve heavy punishment and capital 
punishment to those who deserve death punishment in line with 
law. We should deepen anticorruption struggle through strictly 
punishing serious economic criminals in line with law. Third, 
we should regulate the relations in the economic sectors in line 
with law and promote the sound performance of the social market 
economy. It is necessary to proceed from the provincial 
conditions and characteristics and give further play to the 
functions and role of judicial work in regulating the relations 
in various economic sectors. We should actively try all sorts 
of cases on disputes emerging in the course of accelerating the 
establishment of the modern enterprise system, on developing the 
market system, on improving the economic regulation and control 
system, and on improving the rural operational system and reform 
of the foreign trade system in line with law and promote the 
development of the socialist market economy. 
  Attention should be paid to trying and handling the cases 
of new categories that have a direct bearing on the market 
economy, such as the cases concerning stocks, bills, bonds, 
futures agent, money-lending, and leasing. The research for the 
application of laws and policies should be strengthened in a 
timely manner in order to set forth standardized opinions. The 
experiences that facilitate economic construction should be 
summarized and deepened continuously, and such special service 
items as the cleanup of defaulted debts, loans, and taxes should 
be strengthened until good results are achieved. Fourth, the 
disputes among the people should be handled appropriately, the 
legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and 
other organizations should be protected actually, and social 
stability and unity should be guaranteed. We should 
conscientiously handle according to law the frequently occurred 
cases such as the cases concerning marriage, families, 
compensation, inheritance, houses and grounds, as well as the 
cases that involve many aspects and exert great influence, such 
as the cases concerning mountains and forest, irrigation 
facilities, and land. We should actively try and handle various 
kinds of cases of new categories, such as the cases concerning 
copyright, reputation right, portrait right, labor disputes, and 
real estate, so that we can resolve contradictions in a timely 
manner and promote stability, unity, and the building of 
socialist spiritual civilization. Special attention should be 
paid to handle in a timely and appropriate manner the cases with 
regard to the reduction of peasants' burdens in order to 
actually protect the legitimate rights and interests of peasants 
and mobilize peasants' enthusiasm in production. Fifth, the 
building of the ranks of court workers should be strengthened 
further to ensure strict law enforcement. We should continue to 
grasp the administration of justice with one hand and grasp the 
building of the ranks of court workers with the other hand. 
Efforts should be made to improve the political and 
professional expertise of court workers in order to try and 
handle cases more efficiently and in better quality and ensure 
strict enforcement of laws. We should extensively and 
profoundly launch the activities of fostering the image that 
people's courts, people's tribunals, and people's judges are 
most reasonable, most fair-minded, and most honest. We should 
fully understand the importance, necessity, and urgency of 
launching the activities under the new situation of building the 
socialist market economic structure, and should attach high 
importance on and do a solid job to launch the activities by 
regarding it as the goal and guiding principle for the building 
of the province's ranks of court workers. We should administer 
people's courts and the police strictly, strictly enforce laws 
and discipline, give rewards and punishments impartially, and 
straighten out discipline and work style in a timely and 
concentrative manner to prevent unhealthy trends from growing 
and spreading. We should further expand the channels of legal 
supervision, democratic supervision, and mass supervision, 
profoundly launch anticorruption campaign, and continuously give 
prominence to resolving such illegal issues as abusing one's 
power to seek personal gain, accepting gifts and bribes, 
practicing favoritism when trying cases, and unwarranted pooling 
of charges in order to correct unhealthy trends of trades. The 
discovered clues for resolving violations of laws and discipline 
should be investigated through to the end, and once these 
violations are verified, they should be dealt with severely 
without any indulgence and accommodation. We should vigorously 
strengthen the building of ideology and work style of leading 
bodies, actually build leading bodies of people's courts at all 
levels into a core of leadership that is tough in politics, good 
in style of work, competent in work, honest and strict in 
administration, and impartial in enforcing laws. So, we an 
ensure the strict enforcement of laws. 
  Fellow deputies, under the new situation of accelerating 
reform, opening up and establishing the socialist market 
economic structure, all the work of people's courts in the 
province are confronted with new challenges and tests. We 
should further enhance the sense of mission and the sense of 
responsibility, closely depend on the leadership of party 
committees at all levels and on the supervision and support of 
people's congresses at all levels to forge ahead and work hard 
in order to provide effective legal service and judicial 
guarantee for the province's reform, opening up, and economic 
construction.

1993"] 
  [Text] In 1993, the reform and opening up and economic 
construction of Hubei Province entered a new stage of vigorous 
development, the national economy grew steadily and at high 
speed, the quality of economic operations was distinctly 
improved, and the overall strength of the whole province again 
entered a new stage. The GDP of the whole province in 1993 
reached 129.5 billion yuan (108.1 billion yuan at constant 
price), a growth of 12.7 percent over the previous year 
calculated by comparable price, and the highest margin of 
increase in the past eight years. Major problems existing in 
economic operations were: Quite a big margin of increase in 
market prices; tight enterprise funds and a weak agricultural 
foundation; and a widening income gap between residents. 
<H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>
  Rural production further developed, and internal 
restructuring achieved remarkable success. In 1993, total 
agricultural output value amounted to 50.171 billion yuan 
(constant price 46.674 billion yuan), a 6.7 percent increase 
over the previous year calculated in terms of comparable prices. 
Agricultural added value [nong ye zeng jia zhi 6593 2814 1073 
0502 0237] amounted to 34.832 billion yuan, a 6.4 percent 
increase over the previous year, or representing 26.9 percent of 
GDP. [sentence as published] In agricultural internal 
restructuring, the scale of the growing industry was further 
developed. In total agricultural output value, the growing 
industry increased by 0.4 percent, and forestry, animal 
husbandry, and fishery increased by 7.8 percent, 13.7 percent, 
and 35.8 percent respectively. As for major agricultural 
products, except for cotton, with an output of 425,000 tonnes, a 
reduction compared with the previous year due to natural 
disasters, grain production was basically stable, with an output 
of 22,079,000 million tonnes, and total output of oil-bearing 
crops again reached an all-time high, with an output of 
1,117,400 tonnes, an increase of 120,000 tonnes over the 
previous year. Other cash crops developed rapidly, and the 
production of silkworm cocoons, sugar crops, tea, and fruits 
achieved bumper harvests again. 
  The output of major agricultural products was as follows:

telecommunications grew steadily. Added value for the whole 
year was 6 billion yuan, a growth of 6.3 percent compared with 
the previous year. With the completion and operation of a 
number of large major communications projects, continued 
improvements were made in transportation conditions. 
All-society transportation volume grew steadily. Of this,

  As a result of macroeconomic regulation and control, the 
explosive situation in the first half of the year in the market 
for the means of production was changed in the second half. The 
situation regarding resources changed from tense to slack, 
prices went down, and sales became normal. Purchase of the 
means of production by material goods supply and marketing 
enterprises amounted to 36.93 billion yuan, registering an 
increase of 12.6 percent over the previous year; and sales 
amounted to 39.39 billion yuan, up 14.3 percent. 
  With the increase in the strength of state economic 
restructural reform, the pace of pricing structural reform 
quickened. In 1993, the state freed the price of 180 million 
tonnes of coal under unified allocation by the central 
authorities, and basically freed the prices of iron and steel 
products and those of cement and communications equipment. The 
great majority of areas released the price of grain, and 
increased the price of electric power, the purchase price of 
cotton, transport charges for railway freight, and the price of 
crude oil. The system of price protection for grain and that of 
risk funds were introduced, and maximum price measures were 
implemented for agricultural means of production, which played a 
positive role in stabilizing the market and preventing a 
too-rapid rise in prices.

  Governor Chen Bangzhu said: While the province's overall

the province expeditiously implemented a structural efficiency 
strategy, improved the industrial structure, altered the ratio 
between primary, secondary, and tertiary industries from 
35.2:37.8:27 to 30.3:41:28.7, made headway in reform and opening 
up, and pressed ahead with all types of reforms with a view to 
building a socialist market economic structure and making its 
national economy more market-oriented. Moreover, he added, the 
province pushed ahead with enterprise reform by implementing all 
relevant regulations to the letter and furthering enterprise 
operative mechanism readjustment. The province conducted 
explorations and made more breakthroughs in finding more 
effective ways and means of implementing the public ownership 
system, further enhanced a socialized rural service system, 
rapidly developed a joint-stock cooperative economy, further 
developed all types of commodity markets, made fresh headway in 
developing such essential production element markets as finance, 
technology, information, labor, and real estate markets, and 
pressed ahead with such corresponding reforms as social security 
system reform, land utilization system reform, housing system 
reform, and other types of reforms. 
  Governor Chen Bangzhu asserted: In 1993 Hunan further 
developed all sorts of social undertakings, and energetically 
built socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal 
system. The province further integrated science and technology 
with economy, made 1,600 scientific and technological research 
achievements, obtained 2,766 technological patents, successfully

  Governor Chen Bangzhu continued: In 1993, Hunan also 
successfully carried out national defense education, as well as 
activities aimed at supporting the Army and providing 
preferential treatment to the families of revolutionary soldiers 
and martyrs and at supporting the government and cherishing the 
people. As a result, we further enhanced a sense of national 
defense and strengthened unity between the Army and the 
government and between the Army and the people. 
  Speaking of the province's work in 1994, Governor Chen 
Bangzhu stated: 1994 is a crucial and important year for 
China's reform and construction. Successful work in 1994 is 
bound to have a far- reaching impact on the province's overall

basic line, comprehensively implement and carry out the spirit 
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
mobilize and unify all the forces that can be mustered, firmly 
grasp every excellent opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening 
up, push forward overall development, and safeguard stability. 
  In the government work report, Governor Chen Bangzhu

the following three key aspects of work: 
  1. Push ahead with all types of reform with an eye on 
building a socialist market economic structure. 
  2. Strive for breakthroughs in various key areas and for a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth. 
  3. To vigorously build socialist spiritual civilization, 
democracy, and legal system as well as maintain social stability. 
  Governor Chen Bangzhu concluded by saying: Deputies, we are 
now in a crucial period of building a socialist market economic 
structure and socialist modernization and are facing extremely 
arduous and heavy tasks. We should thereby firmly grasp each 
and every excellent opportunity, work hard with one heart and 
one mind, vigorously forge ahead, carry out work in a 
down-to-earth manner, and strive to comprehensively fulfill all 
tasks in 1994 under the joint leadership of the CPC Central

Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, delivered at the eighth 
enlarged plenary session of the fifth regional CPC Committee on 
22 December: "Extend the Degree of Reform, Accelerate Economic 
Development, and Strive To Open Up a New Situation in 
Establishing the Socialist Market Economy System"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  The forthcoming 1994 will be a crucial year for 
comprehensive 
implementation of the decision of the third plenary session of 
the 14th party Central committee. The state has quickened the 
steps of reform, and a series of important reform measures are 
being put into practice one after another. Faced with the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system, a 
historical profound change, we should clearly estimate the 
situation and seize the opportunity to catch up with the 
country's reform steps so that we can gain the initiative in 
development. For this reason, a success in next year's work is 
very important to us. The tasks for this (enlarged) plenary 
session are, with the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
guidelines of the 14th part congress, to implement the 
guidelines of the decision of the third plenary session of the 
14th party congress, to put forward the region's tasks and ideas 
for accelerating reform and development and safeguarding unity 
and stability in line with the objective of establishing the 
socialist market economy system, and to mobilize all the 
Communist Party members and the cadres and masses of various 
nationalities in the region to work hard in unity, concentrate 
their minds and efforts on accelerating reform and development, 
usher in the crucial year with a mental attitude characterized 
by emancipated mind and courage to blaze new trails and 
experiment, create a new situation, and facilitate a sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development in the economy of our region. 
  On behalf of the standing committee of the autonomous 
regional party committee, I will now give a work report for your 
discussions. 
<H5>  1. A Brief Summary of the 1993 Work </H5>
  Based on the guidelines of the important speeches given by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his south China inspection in early 
1992 and the guidelines of the 14th party congress, the sixth 
(enlarged) plenary session of the fifth autonomous regional 
party committee put forward the targets and strategic priorities 
for the two stages of the region's economic development in the 
coming eight years. In 1993, party organizations at all levels 
in the region conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 
sixth (enlarged) plenary session of the fifth regional party 
committee, kept the party's basic theory and basic line in mind 
when drawing up overall plans, and, seizing the theme of reform, 
opening up, and development, promoted the work in all fields 
according to established priorities. Over the past year, the 
concept of the socialist market economy has been accepted by 
more and more people, and leaders at all levels, in particular, 
have greatly enhanced their understanding of the socialist 
market economy; reform in various fields aimed at establishing 
the socialist market economy system has made new headway; the 
economic structure has been improved further under market 
guidance and macroeconomic regulation and control; and urban and 
rural social productive forces have been further liberated and 
developed in the process of reform and opening up. 
  A. New progress was achieved in the reform in rural and 
pastoral areas, and bumper harvests were won in agriculture and 
animal husbandry despite disasters. The region continued to 
achieve fairly good results in agricultural and animal husbandry 
production in 1993 despite such serious natural disasters as 
spring drought and autumn floods. The agricultural output value 
was expected at 19.5 billion yuan, which was a 6-percent 
increase over the preceding year, higher than the national 
average growth of 4 percent. Grain output was a record height 
of 11.08 billion kg, up 610 million kg from the preceding year. 
The number of animals in the animal husbandry fiscal year 
totaled 55.78 million head, and the rate the animals slaughtered 
was expected at 38 percent, both a record height. The bumper 
harvests in agriculture and animal husbandry despite the 
disasters represented an overall test of the region's rural and 
pastoral work. They are the test of reform achievements and 
also construction level and scientific and technological 
progress; a test of the achievements in material civilization 
and also the achievements in party building and the spiritual 
civilization; and a test of the foundation for past work and 
also new progress in this year's work. 
  This fact once again proved incontrovertibly that the 
guiding ideology which we defined and the series of principles, 
policies, and measures which we adopted during recent years for 
consolidating the agricultural and animal husbandry basis are 
absolutely correct, and that fruitful results were achieved. 
Our region's production level in the rural and pastoral areas 
have jumped to a new stage as compared with previous years. 
This leap forward has greatly encouraged us to advance 
continuously with confidence, and laid a fairly good foundation 
for realizing the objectives of carrying out "high-yield, 
fine-quality, and highly efficient farming" and becoming fairly 
well-off. 
  B. Industrial and commercial enterprises continued to deepen 
reform, and economic efficiency improved. The autonomous region 
achieved noticeable results in implementing reform measures, 
such as delegation of power and signing contracts, in Batou Iron 
and Steel Company and other state-owned large enterprises, and 
succeeded in promoting reform of internal mechanism and 
self-development of these enterprises. The organization of a 
group of enterprise groups helped to readjust the enterprise 
organization structure. After the convocation of enterprise 
reform work conference in July, we gradually popularized the 
pilot reform experience of state-owned medium-sized and small 
enterprises to the entire region. We succeeded in exploring some 
new ways to solve the difficulties and problems of enterprises. 
Reform experiments on improving the property right relations 
was initiated, and a number of state-owned small enterprises 
transformed themselves by implementing the shareholding 
cooperative system, or by renting and selling their property. 
The industrial economic efficiency improved. During the 
previous three quarters, the sales rate of industrial products 
throughout the region reached 94.4 percent; the profit-tax rate 
of funds of industrial enterprises implementing independent 
accounting system reached 7.2 percent; the deficit range of 
industrial enterprises dropped by nearly two percentage point 
from last year; and the number of enterprises running in the red 
reduced by 148. Multilayered commodity markets developed 
rapidly, and all sorts of markets of essential production 
factors began to emerge. New progress was made in the 
supporting reform of all sectors; marcoeconomic regulation and 
control was further strengthened; financial order improved 
noticeably; and the macroeconomic environment improved. 
  C. New strides were made in introducing technology and 
investment and developing internal cooperation. We turned the 
guiding ideology of "using opening up to bring along the overall 
situation" into actual action. All localities successively 
issued new policies and measures on expanding opening up, 
introducing technology and investment from outside, and 
developing internal cooperation; and foreign trade and economic 
and technological cooperation were invigorated increasingly. 
All localities across the region had established trade and 
economic and technological cooperation relations with more than 
70 countries and regions. It is expected that the total volume 
of annual imports and exports may exceed $1.2 billion, up 28 
percent over last year; we newly increased 376 new items on use 
of foreign capital, and the contracts involved $403 million; and 
we approved 372 three types of foreign-funded enterprises, 
exceeding the total number of enterprises of this category of 
the past years. Many localities and enterprises gained new 
vitality through opening up, introduction, and cooperation. Our 
region's opening up is being developed from trade contacts to 
economic and technological cooperation, and the achievements in 
introduction and cooperation are becoming a new growing point of 
our region's economic development. 
  D. The pace in building basic industries, including energy, 
communications, telecommunications, and raw materials, and 
infrastructure facilities was accelerated. Smooth progress was 
made in building a batch of key projects of energy and raw 
materials industries, and remarkable results were made in 
building some key infrastructure facilities, including 
communications and telecommunications facilities. It is expected 
that this year the whole region's social investment in fixed 
assets may reach 20 billion yuan, the greatest input ever made 
during past years. The development of superior industries and 
the accelerated construction of infrastructure facilities will 
provide a strong momentum for our region's economic development, 
and will effectively promote a historical change from a 
traditional industrial structure into a modern production 
structure in our region's economy. 
  E. Township enterprises created a trend of doubling their 
output value plan and non-publically owned enterprises achieved 
faster development. The total output value of township 
enterprises in the year reached 18.5 billion yuan and showed an 
80 percent increased over 1992. The output value of township 
enterprises in a large number of localities showed a doubled 
increase. The output value of non-state-owned industrial 
enterprises is expected to show a 28 percent increase over 1992. 
Non-publically owned enterprises, including individually and 
privately owned ones, achieved faster development. The number 
of individually owned industrial and commercial enterprises 
reached 270,000 and showed a 15.2 percent increase over 1992. 
These enterprises accommodated 410,000 personnel that showed a 
13.9 percent increase over 1992. The "leap forward" development 
of township enterprises has enlightened us that where there is a 
gap there is a potential. Only by upholding the principle of 
proceeding from reality, emancipating minds, arduously 
pioneering a road, and developing the potential, will we totally 
be able to faster turn the potential into practical productive 
forces and to make a breakthrough in the common practice for the 
speed of economic development. 
  F. The livelihood of people of various nationalities was 
further improved. Since the beginning of 1993 we have 
continuously regarded as a basic demand for the work of rural 
and pastoral areas the principle of "stabilizing the production 
of agriculture and animal husbandry and increasing the incomes 
of peasants and herdsmen". We have also regarded as a big event 
the work of easing the burdens of peasants and herdsmen. In 
urban areas we have made efforts to develop the public utilities 
of serving the people's livelihood and to engage in the 
construction of public utilities. We have also adopted every 
possible way and means to bring the prices of daily consumer 
goods under control and paid attention to continuously 
increasing the incomes of staff members and workers. The per 
capita income of peasants and herdsmen is expected to reach the 
target of 100 yuan. The region will be able to narrow the gap 
between the region's per capita income in this regard and the 
national average one from 64 yuan in 1992 to around 40 yuan in 
the year. The region's total wages bill for staff members and 
workers in the first three quarters showed a 21.2 percent 
increase over the same period of 1992. The per capita living 
income of urban residents showed a 30.93 percent increase over 
the same period of 1992 and a 15.83 percent actual increase 
excluding the factor of price hikes. 
  G. The principle of "building the two civilizations 
simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them" was 
further implemented, new results were scored in the party 
building and in the construction of socialist spiritual 
civilization, the political situation of unity and stability was 
even more consolidated. We smoothly accomplished the tasks of 
term-shift elections of the autonomous regional people's 
congress, and the regional people's government, and the regional 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
committee. We deeply carried out commendation activities in 
honor of those who had made contributions to nationalities' 
unity and further enhanced the party building. We also adopted 
measures to enhance the political and ideological work in 
various social circles, to vigorously expand the pioneering 
spirit of the new historic period, to conduct comprehensive 
management of public security, and to grasp the work of 
correcting the malpractice cropping up in various industries and 
trades and of consolidating the "three arbitrary collections". 
In the recent period, we concentrated our efforts on vigorously 
grasping the work of encouraging the honest performance of 
official duties and combating corruptions and scored periodical 
results in the struggle against corruption. Units from top to 
bottom across the autonomous region are enjoying the political 
and social stability as well as nationalities' unity. Cadres 
and the mass of various nationalities displayed their extremely 
creative enthusiasm in the programs of reform, opening up, and 
modernizations. 
  The favorable exploration for establishing the systems of 
socialist market economy and the fruitful results scored in 
building socialist spiritual civilization have promoted the 
overall development of the national economy. The region's GNP 
in the year is expected to reach 44.67 billion yuan and to show 
a 10 percent increase over 1992. Of this GNP, that of primary 
industry is expected to show a 5 percent increase; that of 
secondary industry, a 14.9 percent; and that of tertiary 
industry, a 9.7 percent. The region's financial revenue is 
expected to reach more than 5 billion yuan and to show a 28 
percent increase over 1992. The total retail sale of social 
commodities may reach 21.9 billion yuan and show a 17 percent 
increase over 1992. 
  While fully acknowledging the achievements and the main 
stream of current situation, we must also analyze by seeking 
truth from facts the difficulties and problems cropping up along 
our advancing road. 
  First, strained transportation and shortages of electricity 
and funds remained to be the important factors restricting the 
regions' economic development. These long-standing problems, on 
the one hand, proved that our construction of energy, 
transportation, and other basic industries and infrastructural 
facilities still could not satisfy the needs in the vigorous 
development of various undertakings and the ever improving 
living standard and, on the other, exposed our backward 
managerial and technological levels and irrational economic 
structure. We should have a profound understanding of this and 
strive to fundamentally change such a situation. 
  Second, strained financial resources remained to be a big 
difficulty, and a considerable number of banners and counties 
failed to pay wages on time. We should face this squarely. The 
region's revenue grew fairly rapidly in the past few years. The 
average annual growth of the region's local revenue was 15 
percent from 1987 to 1992, up 4 percentage points from the 
national average in the same period. This year saw another 
rapid growth rate. The subjective and objective reasons for our 
financial difficulties, especially the difficulties of a 
considerable number of banners and counties, were 1) the low 
overall efficiency of the industrial economy, 2) the weak 
industrial foundation of most banners and counties and, on the 
part of many localities, few sources of revenues due to a lack 
of presentable industries and even township enterprises, 3) the 
increased expenditure every year due to the development of 
various undertakings, 4) the overstaffing of offices and 
institutions, the outstripping of the growth in wage over the 
growth in revenue, and the rather rapid growth in the public 
expenses of administrative units and institutions, and 5) some 
localities' lack of ability to manage and use financial 
resources and even the development of lavish spending, a 
man-made reason for strained financial resources. Of course, 
many banners and counties, including some poverty-stricken ones, 
enjoyed a good financial situation. This proved that as long as 
they accelerate reform and opening up, facilitate economic 
development, open up financial resources, and reduce 
expenditure, banners and counties are able to gradually resolve 
their financial difficulties. 
  Third, the region's 1993 GNP growth was the second highest 
rate after the Seventh Five-Year Plan period, but it was still 
lower than what our plan demanded and also lower than the 
national average. The major reasons for this were the uneven 
development in the region's reform, the low degree of reform, 
the wait-and-see attitude adopted by some localities and 
enterprises toward reform, enterprises' failure in reforming the 
three systems, and their continued practice of "eating from the 
common big pot," which dampened the enthusiasm of staff members 
and workers and could not liberate productive forces. Of 
course, problems also existed in enterprises' outdated 
equipment, low technological level, and failure in making their 
products meet market demand. Take light and textile industries 
for example. They registered negative growth in the first half 
of this year and could only create a slight increase by the end 
of the year. In addition, another important reason was our 
insufficient emancipation of the mind, ineffective measures, and 
sluggish development of township enterprises and the non-public 
sectors of the economy in many localities. As long as we face 
these problems squarely and strive to change such a situation, 
it is possible for us to achieve an annual increase of 12 
percent in GNP from 1993 to 1995 because many important projects 
started in the past few years will be completed and commissioned 
one after another. 
  The aforementioned problems and difficulties merit our full 
attention. Meanwhile, we should have a correct analysis and 
understanding. We should recognize that the shortage of 
transport facilities, power, and funds and the fluctuation in 
prices are problems emerged in the course of reform and 
development, and are not difficulties in stagnation; the failure 
in issuing wages on time is a phenomenon emerged not in the 
situation in which the living standards of workers have 
declined, but one emerged in a situation in which we have to 
meet the needs of pricing reform, the wages of workers have 
increased unceasingly and the living standards of people have 
improved increasingly; the failure in making the development 
rate reach the planned requirements is a phenomenon emerged in a 
situation in which the potential of existing reserve funds have 
not been fully tapped, and many key projects that require a long 
construction period but have big momentum for development are 
under construction. These problems and difficulties can be 
gradually solved along with the gradual deepening of reform and 
the development of modernization cause. Particularly, we should 
recognize that the essence and main aspect of our region's 
economic development are sound, the development trend is upward, 
and the hidden potential and momentum are tremendous. This also 
indicates that we have vast prospects for development. 
<H5>  2. Unite the Thinking with the Guidelines of the "Decision" </H5>
of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, 
and Inspire Our Fighting Enthusiasm With the Grand Objective of 
"Marching Towards the Front Rank" 
  The decision of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
central Committee is a major strategic policy, a blueprint for 
realizing the replacement of old economic structure with a new 
one, and a program of action guiding the whole party and the 
people of various nationalities across the country to spare no 
efforts to accelerate reform and development. The 
implementation of this decision has indicated that our country's 
reform of economic structure has entered a new development stage. 
  To successfully implement the guidelines of this decision, 
first of all, we must organize the broad masses of communist 
party members and cadres of various nationalities to 
conscientiously study this decision, profoundly realize and 
understand the essence of the guidelines, realistically unite 
the ideology and understanding with the guidelines of the 
decision, and translate them into a strong motivation for 
promoting reform, opening up and modernization drive. The 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure is a 
profound revolution involving many spheres, including the 
economic basis and the superstructure, which will surely cause a 
major change in the people's ideology, concepts, norms for 
action, and production and life style, and will inevitably meet 
many ideological problems and obstacles. We must solve these 
problems of ideology and understanding by deeply studying Volume 
No.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the decision 
of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
and by conducting effective ideological and political work, 
enable the broad masses of party members and people of various 
nationalities to greatly emancipate their minds, change 
concepts, and enhance consciousness. At present, we should 
particularly solve well the following few issues of ideology and 
understanding. 
  First, we should correctly treat our region's advantages 
under the socialist market economic conditions, unify thinking 
in the issue of accelerating development, and enhance 
confidence. We should recognize that we have realistically 
lagged far behind the developed areas in the economic growth 
rate, the overall economic balance, and development level. The 
market economy is an unevenly developed economy, and a 
competitive and open economy. Because our economic and 
technological basis is fairly poor, the competitive ability is 
fairly weak, and the degree of opening up is quite low, it is 
possible for this gap to expand continuously within a certain 
period if we fail to push this work forward. However, the 
accelerated establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure has also provided an important historical opportunity 
for accelerating development in our region. For example, the 
region has a vast territory, abundant resources, a small 
population, great potential for the development of agriculture, 
animal husbandry, township enterprises, and energy and raw 
materials industries, and broad market prospects; the state has 
included the support to and promotion of the economic 
development of minority areas in its macroeconomic regulation 
and control and more support will be given to it in terms of 
investment and policy; the region enjoys unique geographical, 
legal, and policy advantages; and so on. This constitutes a 
favorable condition for us to accelerate development. As long 
as we enhance confidence, raise spirit, work hard, emancipate 
the mind, conduct reform boldly, and open wider to the outside 
world, our region's advantages will be developed, its economic 
development will be faster, and its gap from advanced localities 
will be gradually narrowed. 
  Second, we should free ourselves from the shackles of the 
old 
ideas and concepts which have taken shape under the planned 
economy system and embrace the new ideas and new concepts of the 
socialist market economy. Some of our comrades have yet to 
break with the way of thinking that has taken shape under the 
planned economy and are still used to relying on the old ideas 
and old methods formed under the old system to observe and solve 
problems. They do not know how to look for new ideas from the 
developed market economy and always try to rely on the state and 
higher levels. They fail to see that the situation has changed, 
the state and the higher levels have begun acting according to 
the law of the market economy, and the method of asking for 
investment without paying attention to returns of investment and 
taking risks of investment no long works. We should make our 
comrades understand that to accelerate economic development, 
they should work in a creative manner, change their traditional 
concepts, embrace the concepts of information, markets, opening 
up, efficiency, competition, and legal system that conform to 
the socialist market economy, and understand and master the law 
of value, the law of supply and demand, the law of competition, 
and other objective laws governing the market economy. Only by 
using these ideas and concepts to guide our economic work, can 
we stand firm in the ever intense market competition and gain 
the initiative. 
  Third, we should firmly foster and always adhere to the 
criterion of "three advantages" and use it to treat the new 
conditions, new problems, and new things emerging in the process 
of establishing the new system and to judge the achievements of 
reform. As has been proven in practice, we should adhere to the 
criterion of "three advantages" so that we can achieve a common 
understanding and unify our steps regarding some major and 
complicated issues. Some comrades still lack the courage to 
blaze new trails, experiment, and take risks and often adopt a 
wait-and-see attitude and hesitate in doing work. Others do not 
understand and approve some methods for reform and even 
flagrantly criticize or create obstacles to them. The major 
reason for this is insufficient emancipation of the mind and a 
failure to eliminate the influence of outdated concepts and 
"left" ideas. In the final analysis, it is the failure to 
master Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the failure to firmly foster the 
criterion of the "three advantages." The establishment of the 
new system of the socialist market economy is bound to involve 
in the adjustment of the interests of various fields and to 
encounter many complicated contradictions and even obstacles. 
The more complicated problems and contradictions become and the 
more different opinions are, the more we should have the courage 
to emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and adhere to the 
criterion of "three advantages." Adherence to this criterion is 
a manifestation of the high political awareness, enterprising 
spirit, and sense of responsibility of communists. Adherence to 
this criterion means to safeguard the fundamental interests of 
the people of various nationalities and will be supported by the 
overwhelming majority of people. It is not the attitude and 
character of communists to avoid contradictions, retreat in face 
of difficulties, act as a good old man, and act perfunctorily. 
  Setting up the socialist market economic structure is a 
highly complicated pioneering endeavor. To accelerate the setup 
of the socialist market economic structure and ensure smooth 
progress in reform and opening up, we must accurately handle the 
following few relations: 
  First, we should accurately handle the relationship between 
reform and development and social stability. The development of 
the economy is our target as well as the foundation for social 
stability. Reform is the motivation of development when 
stability is the basic condition for reform and development. 
These three factors depend on one another and are inseparable. 
As leaders, we should be good at dialectically pondering over 
and handling issues, enhance ability in controlling the overall 
situation, enable these three factors to supplement and 
coordinate each other, ensure that neither is separated only one 
thing is attended to at the expense of the other. We should 
concentrate energy on deepening reform, vigorously conduct 
explorations, keep forging ahead, and promote development and 
stability by deepening reform. Simultaneously, we should pay 
attention to solving various kinds of problems that affect 
stability and use a stable social environment to provide a 
guarantee for reform and development. 
  Second, we should accurately handle the relationship between 
the interests of the whole and those of the part. The interests 
of the whole and those of the part are identical. When the 
interests of the part contradict the interests of the whole, the 
interests of the part must acquiesce to that of the whole. Only 
when we guarantee the interests of the whole will the interests 
of the part exist. Having the minor situation acquiesces to the 
overall situation and the minor principles acquiesce to the 
major ones is a good old rule of our party as well as the 
experience in our successful revolution and construction. 
Therefore, in the gigantic-reform process of setting up the 
socialist market economic structure, we should acquiesce to the 
overall situation of the whole country and resolutely implement 
the central authorities' policies on strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control and various reform measures that will 
soon be promulgated. Along with the deepening of reform, our 
region is also confronted with a problem concerning the 
reasonable division of rights and the readjustment of the 
relationship of interests. The autonomous region should take 
into consideration the distribution of interests among various 
levels in a reasonable and unified way and take care of various 
fronts. All leagues, cities, banners, and counties should 
submit themselves to the overall situation of the autonomous 
region, achieve ideological work in various spheres, and ensure 
that various reform measures are implemented. 
  Third, we should accurately handle the relationship between 
the difficulties ahead of us and the prospects for development. 
The difficulties and contradictions cropping up in the course 
of the region's economic operation are inevitable in the course 
of replacing the old system with the new. So, these are 
temporary difficulties and contradictions. Fundamentally 
speaking, we should rely on reform and development to solve 
these difficulties and contradictions. Facing temporary 
difficulties, the people from higher levels on down should work 
arduously, tighten their belts, unite with and help one another, 
and make concerted efforts to tide over the difficulties. We 
should educate the cadres and the masses not only to face up to 
the difficulties ahead but also to see the good prospects for 
development. We should enhance our confidence, meet 
difficulties head-on, and strive to create a new situation in 
the region's reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  Early in 1987, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his 
speech: Since the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has vast 
pastoral areas and a small population, the region may be able to 
stand at the front row of development. This is not only our 
earnest expectation but also his great scientific foresight. 
This should become the powerful spiritual motivation of the 
people of all nationalities in the region. The grand goal of 
"standing in the front row" reveals the region's prospects for 
economic development and social progress and conforms to the 
fundamental interests and the common expectation of all 
nationalities of people in the region. By assessing changes in 
the trends of development in both domestic and foreign 
situations and state macroeconomic policies and by judging the 
region's existing foundations and development potential, it is 
possible for us to realize the grand target through a longer and 
arduous struggle. We should regard the target of "being a 
vanguard" as a banner and direct the people of various 
nationalities across the region to aim high, to have lofty 
ambition, and to make unswerving efforts to realize the grand 
target. 
<H5>  3. Promote the National Economy To Achieve Sustained, </H5>
Rapid, and Healthy Development, and Ensure the Realization of 
the Two Periodical Targets by the Given Date 
  To realize the grand target of "being a vanguard," it is 
imperative to fulfill the two periodical targets adopted at the 
sixth (enlarged) plenum of the fifth autonomous regional party 
committee within the given date. By the end of this century, 
the region should become better-off and reach a level which is 
slightly higher than the national average. The year of 1994 is 
the second year of the first periodical target. Success or 
failure in the year's economic development has vital bearing on 
the timely realization of the first periodical target. 
Therefore, we should adopt every possible way and means to 
successfully conduct economic work in the year and to achieve 
faster economic development. In line with the region's current 
economic development trend, our region' GNP in 1994 may show an 
increase of over 10 percent in 1993 and we should strive to show 
a 12 percent increase in this regard. To attain such growth, it 
is imperative to accurately foster a new idea of economic 
development with economic results as a center and to 
emphatically do a good job in grasping the following: 
  A. We should actively readjust the production structure of 
agriculture and animal husbandry and further accelerate the 
economic development of rural and pastoral areas. Agriculture 
and animal husbandry are the foundation of the national economy 
and must be consolidated and strengthened. Tasks for our region 
to conduct its work in rural and pastoral areas are to implement 
in an overall way the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee and the spirit of the central rural 
work conference, to regard as an emphasis the work of 
establishing or improving the socialized service systems to 
further deepen the reform in rural and pastoral areas, and to 
actively readjust the production structure of rural and pastoral 
areas by regarding the work of developing agricultural and 
animal husbandry undertakings with "two highs and one 
fine-quality" as a target. The region's total agricultural 
output value should reach 21 billion yuan and show a 6 percent 
increase over 1993. The region should stabilize grains 
production at the level of over 10 billion jin. The number of 
animals for the livestock fiscal year should reach more than 
56.5 million. Of this number, that of hogs should reach 10 
million; that of meat goat, 200,000 ; and that of meat cattle, 
100,000. The per capita net income of peasants and herdsmen 
should show a 100 yuan increase over 1993. 
  According to the aforementioned tasks, party committees and 
governments at all levels should adopt effective measures to 
have the economy of rural and pastoral areas face the markets 
and to quicken the development. First, we should uphold markets 
as a guiding direction and regard economic results as a center 
to accelerate the pace in readjusting the production structure 
and to realize integration between agriculture and animal 
husbandry. Farming areas should accelerate the processing 
industry of grains and stalks; vigorously develop the 
undertakings of animal husbandry; and make a very large 
breakthrough in raising meat cattle, goats, and hogs. Pastoral 
areas should bring in cultivation production to animal 
husbandry, vigorously grasp the construction of fodder grass 
bases, and follow the road of raising animals by carrying out 
construction. Second, we should intensively enforce the 
strategy of having science and education make agriculture and 
animal husbandry prosperous; vigorously promote integration 
among agriculture, science, and education; and implement the 
technical measures of planting crops and raising animals in a 
scientific way. Third, we should continuously increase input in 
agriculture and animal husbandry. Efforts should be further 
made to enhance the support for the productive bases of various 
farming and livestock commodities and to increase the input in 
agriculture and animal husbandry with high-yield, fine-quality, 
and high-benefit. We should conduct reform in the methods of 
investing funds in agriculture and animal husbandry, upgrade the 
benefits of investments, and turn the appropriation into paid 
fund utilization or replace appropriation with award. Fourth, a 
good job should be done in processing farming and livestock 
products to increase their value; developing processing 
industries with farming and livestock products as major raw 
materials; broadening the production of commodities; and 
increasing the economic results. Fifth, we should carry out the 
activities of encouraging townships and villages to play an 
exemplary role or to foster a typical case in becoming 
better-off and apply overall, the target of becoming better-off 
to conducting the work of rural and pastoral areas. 
  We should adopt all kinds of feasible measures to ensure 
that peasants and herdsmen continue to increase income in the 
course of developing production and to actually protect the 
enthusiasm of peasants and herdsmen in production. We should 
continue to implement the pertinent stipulations of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council on truly reducing the 
burdens on peasants and herdsmen. We should further support the 
poor and exert greater efforts in developing the economy, 
effecting scientific and technological progress, and improving 
the quality of peasants and herdsmen in order to strengthen the 
self-development functions of poverty-stricken areas. From now 
on, we should consider it a mandatory target to increase the per 
capita net income of peasants and herdsmen and to extricate 
poverty-stricken areas from poverty to become prosperous. 
Meanwhile, we should use the work in this regard to assess and 
evaluate the practical performances of party committees and 
governments of various banners and counties. 
  B. We should pay attention to accelerating the growth pace 
and efficiency of enterprises and making enterprises reverse 
from deficits to profits in order to push the industry of the 
whole region onto a new stage. We should actually orient 
industrial and economic development to the orbit of improving 
efficiency, should switch the low-level duplicated construction 
projects with projects with a high starting point, high added 
value, and high quality, and should change from expanding 
production by mainly depending on the input of human and 
material resources to depending primarily on scientific and 
technological progress. By making flexible use of existing 
assets and effectively increasing new assets, we should strive 
to make the total regional industrial output value reach 57.2 
billion yuan in 1994, an increase of 14 percent. 
  At present, prominent problems in the region's industrial 
enterprises exist due to the poor economic efficiency and grave 
losses. Leaders at all levels should pay high attention to 
these problems and concentrate energy on solving them. First, 
we should further deepen the internal reform of enterprises, 
strengthen management, and fully mobilize the initiative and 
creativity of the vast numbers of cadres and workers. Second, 
we should accelerate technological transformation, technological 
progress, import, and "grafting," should develop new products 
and quality products that are readily marketable, and should, at 
the same time, develop diversified management. Third, we should 
strengthen the building of leading bodies of enterprises by 
selecting people who are very devoted to their work and who are 
familiar with the economy and management to serve as plant 
directors and managers. Handsome rewards should be given to 
those comrades who are outstanding in increasing growth speed, 
improving efficiency, halting deficits, and increasing profits. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should set up a 
responsibility system for improving efficiency and increasing 
profits within a set time and should truly give rewards or 
punishments. We should pay attention to the distribution and 
coordination of restrictive factors like funds, power resources, 
and communications and transportation facilities to ensure the 
development of key trades and enterprises. Large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises should take the lead in 
accelerating speed and improving efficiency. 
  C. We should continue to pay attention to pillar industries 
and key construction project to add strength and momentum to the 
economic development of the region. Accelerating the building 
of such pillar industries and infrastructure facilities as coal, 
power, metallurgical, petrochemical, light and chemical, and 
building materials industries as well as communications and 
transportation facilities and postal and communications 
facilities constitutes a major growing point of the region's 
economic development. We should try every possible means to 
accelerate the building of the key projects of these pillar 
industries and strive to improve the quality of construction in 
order to complete construction, put into to production, and 
yield results promptly. Pertinent departments in the region 
should again examine the projects under construction in various 
localities, reduce the scale of capital construction, and, in 
particular, reduce the construction of non-productive projects, 
such as luxurious guesthouses and luxurious amusement 
facilities, in order to spend limited funds on projects that 
most need them. We should help leagues, cities, banners, and 
counties yield results as quickly as possible from the projects 
that consume less investment, need a short construction period, 
and yield prompt results. 
  D. We should greatly develop township enterprises to 
enhance the economic strength of banners and counties. Speeding 
up township enterprise development is the only road for rural 
and pastoral areas to suit the needs of the market economy and 
expedite the transformation of farm, animal, and sideline 
products to increase their value and also the only road to 
realize the division of industries, the spread of labor forces, 
and the march toward modernization of agriculture and animal 
husbandry. The weak economy of the region's banners and 
counties has greatly restricted the region's economic and social 
development. At a conference on enterprise reform held in July 
this year, we raised the issue of developing banner and county 
economies. Banner and county economies must show great 
development next year. While keeping agricultural and animal 
husbandry production stable, they should greatly develop 
township enterprises to ensure 28 billion yuan in the output 
value of township enterprises next year and strive to make it 30 
billion yuan, an increase of over 50 percent from this year. 
They should have the courage to develop the township 
enterprises of various ownerships and various managerial 
methods, such as ones run by households individually or jointly, 
joint-investment ones, private ones, and shareholding ones, to 
create a new situation in which different ownerships and 
different systems are adopted in township enterprise 
development. The existing township enterprises run by townships 
and villages and the local state-owned enterprises of banners 
and counties should be transformed to become shareholding 
enterprises and be merged, "transplanted," or sold. They should 
develop the products that are based on a high starting point and 
have high scientific and technological level and high additional 
value. With regard to macroeconomic guidance, we should 
rationalize the distribution of township enterprises in such a 
way that they are concentrated in some areas, give particular 
support to key ones, optimize their structure, strengthen their 
management, and improve their efficiency. Funds should be 
allocated in a unified manner, and particular assistance should 
be given for the localities with a weak foundation to start 
township enterprise development. We should implement the 
strategy of developing towns and townships whose output value of 
township enterprises reaches 100 million yuan. We should launch 
regionwide emulation to create towns and townships whose output 
value of township enterprises reaches 100 million yuan and the 
township enterprises or villages whose output value reaches 1 
million yuan or 10 million yuan. We should strive to expand the 
scale of township enterprises, upgrade the standing of their 
products, improve their management, and promote their 
development to a new height. 
  E. We should continue to boldly develop the non-public 
sectors of the economy. We should have the courage to support 
and encourage the accelerated development of individual, 
private, and foreign-funded economies to truly turn the 
non-public sectors into an important force to enliven the local 
economy. All localities should conscientiously implement 
various policies, include the non-public sectors of the economy 
in the overall pattern of economic development, and make sure 
that no limits are imposed on their proportion, scale, field, 
and management. Localities where conditions permit may explore 
ways to establish individual and private economic development 
zones, expand their scale, speed up their development, and 
achieve a coordinated promotion effect. Pertinent functional 
departments should strengthen and improve management, coordinate 
supervision, management, support, and service, and resolutely 
ban the unhealthy trend of asking for benefits from individual 
and private economies. We should give full play to the role of 
the federation of industry and commerce and various trade 
associations and make a success of the ideological and political 
work for the persons developing non-public sectors of the 
economy. We should strengthen policy and law consultation, 
information, scientific and technical, and business guidance 
services to help the non-public sectors improve management and 
overall quality and guide them to achieve rapid and healthy 
development. 
<H5>  4. Promote Package Reform, Achieve Breakthroughs in Key </H5>
Areas, and Quicken the Pace in Establishing the Socialist Market 
Economy System 
  The most fundamental way to speed up the region's economic 
development lies in seizing the opportunity presented by reform, 
extend the degree of reform, and quicken the pace in 
establishing the socialist market economy system. China's 
economic restructuring will enter a new stage for package reform 
while achieving breakthroughs in key areas next year. Focusing 
on establishing and improving the macroeconomic regulation and 
control system, the state will take significant steps in the 
reform of financial and tax, monetary, investment, planning, and 
foreign economic systems. On the basis of invigorating the 
foundation of the microeconomy and cultivating and developing 
the market structure, the state will issue a series of major 
reform measures concerning the enterprise system, distribution 
system, social security system, housing system, and pricing 
system. Whether we can comprehensively carry out these reforms 
and smoothly implement all reform measures in our region is a 
test for all levels of party organizations throughout the region 
and for the masses of cadres of various nationalities. 
Regardless of whether it is quick or slow, it will also affect 
our region's economic development. All localities and all 
departments should enhance reform consciousness, and guarantee 
that all reform policy decisions of central authorities be 
implemented wherever needed in our region. We should proceed 
from reality and grasp the following reforms in a down-to-earth 
manner. 
  A. While regarding the building of a modern enterprise 
system as the orientation, we should regard the improvement in 
property rights relations as a breakthrough point and accelerate 
the pace of reform in state-owned enterprises. Continuously 
deepening enterprise reform, accelerating the change in 
operational mechanism of state- owned enterprises, and gradually 
establishing the modern enterprise system are the main parts of 
invigorating enterprises, an effective way for pushing 
enterprises to the market, and a central aspect in accelerating 
the building of a new structure. In line with the demand of the 
third plenary session of the 14th CPC central Committee, all 
localities should comprehensively accelerate the pace of reform 
of state-owned enterprises. Next year, the whole region should 
at least change the mechanism of over half of the state-owned 
enterprises and devote two years or so to help all state-owned 
enterprises across the region establish a new operational 
mechanism. 
  Clearly defining property rights relations and establishing 
a 
property rights system that suits the market eocnomy is a core 
issue to establishing the modern enterprise system. To deepen 
reform of state-owned enterprises, we must resolve confusion in 
issues on property rights, and establish a property right system 
that meets the demands of the market economy. At present, we 
should give priority to separating government functions from 
enterprise management, improve property rights relations, 
separate the property rights of legal persons from final state 
ownership, and personalize the property rights of enterprises. 
State-owned, large and medium-sized enterprises should 
continue to deeply implement the "regulation," deepen reform of 
the three internal systems, and actively create conditions for 
gradually moving to the company system. Next year, the region 
will choose 70 large and medium-sized enterprises with fairly 
good management and big development potential for experimenting 
with the modern enterpise system in the region. We may actively 
develop some liability companies with the mutual purchase of 
shares among the legal persons, and actively conduct experiments 
of establishing shareholding limited companies and exclusively 
state-funded companies. On the basis of readjusting the 
production set-up, we should establish 10 trans-regional, 
trans-departmental, trans-trade and trans-ownership enterprise 
groups with public ownership as the mainstay, large key 
enterprises as the lead, and integrated property rights as the 
major link in an effort to further develop the advantages and 
strengthen the competition capacity. Regarding the current 
enterprises with difficulties in operation and heavy debts, we 
should be determined to adopt the method of implementing several 
systems in one plant so as to invigorate each and every plant, 
or conduct "grafting" or transformation in one product, one 
workshop or one production line in an effort to rejuvenate old 
enterprises. 
  Our region has a large proportion of state-owned small 
enterprises, making the problems and difficulties lying ahead 
more prominent. Boldly and resolutely reforming the property 
rights of these enterprises will play an important role in 
promoting reform and development in the whole region. We must 
not hesitate on this issue. During the next two years, all 
localities should consider reform of the property rights system 
of state-owned small enterprises as the most important task, 
grasp it with all-out efforts, and make big strides in this 
regard. Practice has proved that implementing the shareholding 
cooperation system among small state-owned enterprises is a good 
form to promote the reform of the property right system and 
clearly define the property rights. Along with the development 
of the market economy, the public sector of the economy 
essentially merges itself with the non-public sectors of the 
economy in the shareholding form through competition. 
Therefore, we should boldly transform the small state-owned 
enterprises. The small state-owned enterprises that suffer from 
long-term poor management, can't seem to halt deficits, and that 
generate small profits should be auctioned or rented off openly 
so that a system of private ownership and private management or 
state ownership and civilian management is carried out. From 
now on, we should run new enterprises according to new systems 
and resolutely eliminate the practice of taking old paths. 
  The deep-seated problems concerning enterprise reform is 
what 
we should solve to balance the relationship of property rights. 
There are great difficulties in solving these problems. To 
effectively promote this reform, we should achieve the following 
few tasks: First, we should achieve the determination and 
assessment of property and property rights in line with reality 
and the principle of seeking truth from facts. We are allowed 
to use a portion of the profits from the state stocks to 
eliminate the traditional burdens of enterprises and solve the 
problems relating to the collective benefits. We should assess 
the assets according to the procedures, methods, and standards 
as stipulated in the State Council's "method for assessment and 
management of state-owned assets" so as to avoid creating the 
tendencies of overestimating or underestimating assets. On the 
premise of paid use of land, we can appropriately reduce the 
assessment value of the region's land. Second, we should make 
concerted efforts to appropriately eliminate the traditional 
burdens of enterprises. The enterprises with debts payable due 
to policy reasons are allowed extensions on paying back their 
debts and will not be charged interest so that they can first 
become active before paying off their debt in a step-by-step 
manner. It is necessary to separate enterprise management 
functions from social functions. Third, we should quicken the 
establishment of the state-owned asset management system; firmly 
attend to organizing and setting up commissions for management 
of state-owned property and their work organizations; and set up 
subordinate state-owned property management companies, 
investment companies, and holding companies. They should 
represent the state to supervise and manage the property of 
state-owned enterprises and to ensure that the value of state- 
owned property is protected and added. 
  B. We should deepen the rural and pastoral reform with the 
focus on setting up and perfecting the agricultural and 
livestock socialized service system. The establishment of the 
socialist market economic system has provided new tasks and 
requirements for reform in rural and pastoral areas. All 
localities should continue to stabilize and ceaselessly perfect 
the responsibility system dominated by the contracted 
responsibility on a household basis with payment linked to 
output as well as the dual management system where centralized 
management is linked with decentralized management, expand the 
extent of reform in the rural and pastoral areas with the focus 
on setting up and perfecting the agricultural and livestock 
socialized service system, guide the entrance of peasants and 
herdsmen into the markets, and promote the socialist market 
economy's replacement of the agricultural and livestock economy. 
  At present, the peasants and the herdsmen have an urgent 
demand for scientific and technological service and circulation 
service. All localities should set up and perfect the 
township-level scientific and technological service 
organizations and township- level circulation service 
organizations; and gradually form an overall socialized service 
system dominated by banner and county service, linked by town 
and township and sumu service, founded by village and gacha 
service, and supplemented by the self-service of the peasants 
and herdsmen. Next year, all leagues and cities should set up, 
on a trial basis, the socialized service system among several 
banners and counties. Each and every banner and county should 
set up several town and township service organizations and one 
or two "leading" companies and enterprises. The departments in 
charge of agricultural and livestock production at various 
levels should focus on offering scientific and technological 
service, vigorously popularize applied techniques, strengthen 
scientific and technological education for peasants and 
herdsmen, and upgrade their scientific and technological quality. 
  Our region's practice has shown that vigorous efforts to 
develop integration among trade, industry, and agriculture as 
well as among production, processing, and sale are favorable for 
optimizing or reorganizing the essential factors of production; 
for rationally readjusting the industrial structure; and for 
realizing the mutual supplement of strong points and the mutual 
benefits of interest between urban and rural areas. These 
efforts are also favorable for integrating the production of 
peasants and herdsmen with the demands of markets, for dealing 
with the contradiction between small-scale business and large 
markets, and for promoting the traditional agriculture and 
animal husbandry to be turned into modern ones. These efforts 
also represent a successful way for rural and pastoral areas to 
develop the socialist market economy. Various localities and 
departments should adopt effective measures to actively guide 
the integration; to vigorously support it; and to strive to have 
the integration among trade, industry, and agriculture, as well 
as among production, processing, and sale, be gradually adopted 
in wider fields, by more industries and trades as well as by 
units from low level to high one, and in a manner from 
inattentive style to attentive one. 
  C. By regarding as an emphasis the establishment of markets 
of essential factors of production, we should accelerate the 
fostering and improvement of market systems. All-out efforts 
should be made to develop the wholesale markets of means of 
production as well as the markets of money, labor forces, real 
estate, technologies, and information so as to gradually carry 
out rational distributions through markets among funds, 
technologies, labor forces, and essential factors of production. 
We should vigorously develop local regional trading markets. 
We should also establish the wholesale markets of staple 
products of agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline 
production, as well as the wholesale markets of means of 
production along the border lines with northeast, north, and 
northwest China as well as along the important lines of 
communications so as to gradually foster a large number of 
distributing centers for the commodities of grains, leather and 
fur, meat and foodstuffs, herb medicine, timber, coal, iron and 
steel, building materials, petroleum, and textile products. By 
making full use of the geographical strong points, we should 
further do a good job in establishing markets of trade between 
the border domestic and foreign residents at border ports as 
well as border banners and counties. We should also actively 
broaden the commodity exchanges with Mongolia and CIS. A good 
job should be also done in taking up the pilot work of futures 
markets. We should continuously deepen the reform in commodity 
prices, straighten out the relations among prices, and relax the 
restrictions on the prices of overwhelmingly major commodities 
and laboring work except for only a few products that have a 
bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. We 
should also gradually do away with the double-track system in 
the means of production and establish price forming mechanism 
that is chiefly formed by market prices. 
  D. By regarding as an emphasis the shifting of governmental 
function, we should accelerate the pace in conducting 
organizational reforms. Organizational reforms represent 
important conditions for establishing the systems of socialist 
market economy and accelerating the economic development. The 
overall plan for the autonomous region to conduct organizational 
reforms has been defined and the region may organize all forces 
to enforce the plan as long as it has been approved by the 
central authorities. According to the initially tentative idea 
in the plan, the autonomous regional level organs should strive 
to accomplish their organizational reform before the third 
quarter of 1994; leagues and cities (county-level cities) should 
strive to accomplish their organizational reforms before the end 
of 1994; and banners and counties should accomplish their 
organizational reform within the first quarter of 1994 because 
the original decision to have them accomplish reform by the end 
of this year has been changed due to giving consideration to the 
term- shift election at the banner-county level. The emphasis 
of organizational reforms should be placed on shifting the 
function. By meeting the needs of the systems of socialist 
market economy, the party and government organs at all levels 
should further define their duties and conduct comprehensive 
consolidation in the fields of managerial function; 
organizational style; operation mechanism; managerial methods; 
and personnel structure. They should also enhance the 
macroeconomic management, weaken the direct management, and 
strengthen the services so as to gradually establish an 
administrative managerial system that is in conformity with the 
new systems of the market economy and that is with all the 
necessary functions, a rational structure, harmonious operation, 
and accurate and high efficacy. Specialized economic 
departments should be turned into enterprises. Office personnel 
laid off due to streamlining should be encouraged to establish 
economic entities. Party, government, and mass organizations at 
all levels should reduce their sizes by 25 percent in two to 
three years. We should strictly enforce discipline and adopt 
realistic measures to prevent law and discipline breaches 
emerging in the process of institutional reform, such as 
promoting cadres suddenly and turning public property into 
private one. 
  E. We should ensure implementation of macroeconomic 
regulation and control measures, with the focus on reform of the 
financial and tax, monetary, investment, and planning systems. 
The central authorities have issued some major policies on the 
financial and tax, monetary, investment, and planning systems. 
This has an important significance in establishing the 
socialist market economy system, enhancing the central 
macroeconomic regulation and control capacity, and gradually 
narrowing the gap between the eastern area and the western area. 
We should resolutely implement the central policies and, at the 
same time, promote the region's reform in these fields in a 
creative manner in line with our actual conditions. Regarding 
the reform of financial and tax systems, we should step up 
establishment of local tax collection system, do a good job in 
organizing local tax organs, increase financial resources by 
developing production, strengthen tax collection and management, 
and prevent tax evasion to make sure that the financial 
situation at all levels is improved gradually. Regarding the 
reform of monetary system, we should separate policy-lending 
banking from commercial banking and, while putting total amount 
under state control, properly promote management of the 
proportion between savings deposits and loans and management of 
risks so that the market mechanism will be applied more to bank 
management. We should exert efforts actively to win approval 
for establishment of local development banks to guarantee 
supplies of funds for the region to accelerate economic 
development. Regarding the reform of investment system, we 
should step up efforts to make scientific policy decisions on 
major construction projects and establish the system of 
responsibility for investment risks and the system for 
intermediate organizations to exercise supervision and 
management of these projects. Regarding the reform of planning 
system, we should strengthen overall targets and efficiency 
targets and change direct administration into indirect 
administration. At present, we should pay particular attention 
to the connection in enterprises' transition from the contract 
system to the new tax system. According to the regulations of 
the central authorities, the projects and enterprises which have 
enjoyed tax reduction and exemption as approved by the 
autonomous regional government and whose tax reduction and 
exemption term had not expired when the central document no. 6 
was issued may continue to enjoy tax reduction and exemption 
until 1995, but they should be reexamined and acknowledged by 
pertinent departments first and should pay taxes and later have 
their taxes refunded. On the premise that the state 
macroeconomic regulation and control targets and tasks are 
fulfilled, we should strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and 
control of the region's economy and achieve success particularly 
in the following work: 1) We should achieve a balance between 
total supply and total demand and a success in structural 
adjustment according to established priorities. 2) We should 
strengthen the monitoring, warning, and forecast of economic 
trends. 3) We should adopt various means to address the 
contradictions and problems in economic operation and bring 
prices under control in line with state regulations to maintain 
social stability. 4) We should do a good job in the overall 
coordination of macroeconomic regulation and control measures. 
  F. We should speed up the reform of social security system 
by 
achieving a breakthrough in realizing the region's overall 
planning for retirement funds. Speeding up the establishment of 
the social security system is an important part of the endeavor 
to establish the socialist market economy system. We should 
realize regionwide overall planning for the retirement funds of 
enterprise staff members and workers, establish more quickly and 
improve the unemployment insurance, industrial injury insurance, 
and medical service systems, and form a mechanism whereby funds 
and risks are shared by the state, the collective, and the 
individual together under an overall plan. In rural and 
pastoral areas, we should gradually establish an old-age 
insurance system under which the aged are supported chiefly by 
their families with proper subsidies from the collective. We 
should also develop and improve the cooperative medical service 
system. 
  G. We should keep abreast of the demands of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction and further deepen the 
reform of scientific, technological, and educational structures. 
We should firmly foster the idea that "science and technology 
constitute the primary productive forces" and the idea that 
"education is of fundamental importance to the fulfillment of 
our great long-term mission." We should accelerate the reform 
of scientific, technological, and educational structures. At 
present, we should positively promote the readjustment of the 
structures of scientific and technological departments and the 
rational flow of talented people. We should encourage 
scientific research institutes to "stabilize basic research and 
basic technological research and to decontrol and allow 
flexibility for technological development institutes, public 
welfare-oriented scientific research institutes, and scientific 
and technological service institutes. We should also encourage 
scientific research institutes to follow the road of "combining 
scientific research with production and management." We should 
encourage scientific and technological personnel to plunge into 
the main battlefield of economic construction and to develop 
scientific and technological enterprises that embrace various 
forms of ownership and various forms of management in order to 
help translate scientific and technological achievements into 
practical productive forces. In line with the objective demand 
of modernization drive, we should positively readjust 
educational structure with a view to effecting a new step in 
developing vocational and technical education as well as adult 
education and in combining agriculture with science and 
education. Institutions of higher learning should further 
deepen reform in the links of enrollment, faculties setup, 
teaching materials content, teaching methods, and employment of 
graduates. We should actually change the situation in which the 
government takes on everything of schools and should set up the 
new system of combining government administration with 
participation of various circles of society. 
  H. We should comprehensively promote the opening to the 
outside world and to other domestic places, with large-scale 
import and large-scale integrations as the places to make 
breakthroughs. We should further strengthen the sense of 
opening to the outside world and penetrate the idea of "using 
opening up to promote the whole situation" to all trades and all 
items of work. We should accelerate the regionalization of 
economic development, integrate the province with various 
provinces, municipalities, and regions in northeast China, north 
China, and northwest China, use large-scale integrations to 
promote large-scale opening up, and use large-scale opening up 
to promote large-scale development. In the fields of 
importation, integration, and "grafting" renovation, we should 
have some thorough measures. We should energetically implement 
the strategy of diversification of markets and encourage various 
localities to boldly break with the doors of their own 
localities and country to actively open up markets at home and 
abroad. We should further enhance the stratum and level of 
opening up and expand the sphere and channels of opening up to 
create a new pattern of opening to all directions. We should 
make full use of the region's natural resources to accelerate 
the pace of absorbing foreign investment. We should continue to 
deepen the reform of foreign trade structure and set up 
mechanisms that are in agreement with the current international 
economic regulations. We should also expand export and develop 
spot exchange trade. We should continuously improve investment 
environment, improve work efficiency, and positively train 
export-oriented economic talents in order to create conditions 
for vigorously developing export-oriented economy. 
<H5>  5. Further Strengthen and Improve Party Leadership, and </H5>
Firmly and Unswervingly Implement the Principle of "Taking a 
Two-Handed Approach and Being Tough With Both Hands" 
  Setting up the socialist market economic system and 
accelerating the pace of modernization drive constitute a great 
historical mission of the new period. To win victory in this 
unprecedented and creative cause, we must actually strengthen 
the building of the party to provide a strong and effective 
political guarantee for accelerating reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive and must thoroughly carry out the strategic 
principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being tough with 
both hands" to create a fine social environment for accelerating 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  A. We should strengthen the building of the party around the 
target of establishing socialist market economic system. The 
new situation of accelerating the establishment of the socialist 
market economic system has set new task and demand on party 
leadership and party building. In light of the current 
prominent problems, party committees at all levels should 
continue to adopt practical and effective measures to 
comprehensively strengthen party building, exert strenuous 
efforts to build the leading bodies at all levels in accordance 
with the demands of the party Central Committee and the regional 
party committee on strengthening the building of leading bodies 
at and above the county level, and enable them to become a 
powerful political core for leading the masses to build the 
socialist market economic new structure. Party leading cadres 
at all levels must adapt themselves to new situation, greet the 
new test, take the lead in changing ideology and concepts, the 
way of thinking, the work methods, and the style of work, stand 
on the van of this great reform, shoulder the responsibility of 
leaders, and make contributions to accelerating reform and 
development. 
  In strengthening party building, the most important is to 
use 
the theory of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to arm the minds of all communist party 
members. At present, we should particularly study well Volume 
No.3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," strive to 
understand that emancipating the mind and seeking truth from 
facts is the quintessence of this socialist theory with Chinese 
characteristics, and be good at using this ideological weapon to 
understand and solve practical problems. In the course of 
study, we should act in line with the reality of our own 
localities, departments, and units, and in accordance with the 
reality of one's ideology and work, sum up experience 
conscientiously, consciously correct the understanding and work 
methods that are incompatible with the socialist market economic 
theory, and correctly answer the questions and handle various 
contradictions emerged in the course of reform and development. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should do a good 
job in training party and government cadres as well as 
enterprise cadres, and strive to rotationally train cadres at 
and above the section level at least once next year. Party 
committees at and above the banner and county level should 
carefully organize the central group's study. We should further 
enhance the political awareness of the broad masses of cadres, 
in particular, the leading cadres, in upholding the party's 
basic line through the study, and strengthen their sense of 
principle and foresight in carrying out their work in a 
systematic and scientific manner. 
  To strengthen the building of leading bodies at all levels, 
we must strictly implement the principle of building ranks of 
"revolutionary, young, well-educated, and professionally 
competent" cadres, and the standards of employing people of 
ability and political integrity, overcome the trend of giving 
priority to seniority, demanding perfection, and yielding to or 
making allowance for cadres, and boldly use cadres who make 
outstanding achievements, emancipate their minds, dare to blaze 
new trials, adopt highly efficient and practical work style, and 
are clean and honest in performing official work. We must adopt 
resolute and effective measures for readjusting the leading 
bodies who are average in political achievements, and fail to 
create a new situation in their work for a long time. At 
present, end-of-term elections are being conducted in the banner 
and county (city and district) people's congresses, governments, 
and committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference. Party committees at all levels should regard this 
end-of-term election as an important measure for strengthening 
the building of leading bodies, pay great attention to and 
carefully organize this work, strengthen leadership, and 
guarantee its smooth progress. The party leading bodies at all 
levels must strictly implement the principle of democratic 
centralism, further strengthen unity of the party and inside the 
leading bodies, resolutely guard against and overcome the 
disorganized and unprincipled acts of failing to strictly 
enforce law and prohibitions, guard against and overcome 
liberalism in politics, and maintain unity politically and 
organizationally and in work. Next year, we should conduct 
activities on "vying with one another in pioneering a work," in 
100 banners and counties (cities and districts) throughout the 
region, commend advanced units, and encourage the backward ones. 
It is necessary to further strengthen the building of 
grass-roots organizations. Beginning this winter and next 
spring, all localities, aiming at leading peasants and herdsmen 
to a fairly comfortable life, should comprehensively implement 
in rural and pastoral areas the three-year plan for improving 
village-level organizations with party organizations as the core 
and truly build rural and pastoral grass-roots party 
organizations into fighting bastions capable of leading the 
masses to affluence and a fairly comfortable standard of living. 
At enterprises, in coordination with the reform of the property 
right system and the establishment of the modern enterprise 
system, we should comprehensively implement the guidelines of 
the national forum on the party building of state- owned 
enterprises, exert more efforts to improve the party 
organizations of state-owned enterprises, and give full play to 
the role of these party organizations as the political core and 
their role of supervision and guarantee in deepening reform and 
in production and management. 
  Leading cadres at all levels should forge closer 
party-populace ties and, with the spirit of great responsibility 
to the party and the people, the spirit of serving the people 
wholeheartedly, and the spirit of plain living and hard work, 
score achievements and innovation in reform and development. 
They should learn about the trends in reform in a timely 
manner, go deep into the reality of life and the masses to 
intensify investigation and study, and adopt a down-to-earth 
work style to implement the party's various principles and 
policies to the letter. 
  We should further strengthen Army-government and 
Army-civilian unity and step up the building of the People's 
Liberation Army, people's armed police force, and militia. We 
should improve trade unions, Communist Youth League, women's 
federations, and other mass organizations and fully develop 
their role in reform and development and in safeguarding unity 
and stability. 
  B. We should adhere to the principle of "attending to two 
tasks simultaneously and being competent in both" and 
conscientiously build the socialist spiritual civilization. 
"Attending to two tasks simultaneously and being competent in 
both" is a basic principle we should always adhere to in the 
entire process of reform, opening up, and the socialist 
modernization drive. The more we deepen reform, open wider to 
the outside world, and accelerate development, the more we 
should strengthen ideological and political work and step up 
building of the spiritual civilization. We should note that 
people's style of living, style of thinking, and concept on 
value will change greatly following the establishment of the 
socialist market economy system. Generally speaking, the theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the party's 
basic line, patriotism, collectivism, socialism, the creative 
spirit of the masses in developing reform and the modernization 
drive, and the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation will 
show their tremendous power more and more thanks to the 
continuous social progress. However, we should also see that the 
market economy has its negative effect. Party committees and 
governments at all levels, especially leading cadres of the 
party, should have a clear understanding of this and always 
attend to and be competent in both construction and the legal 
system, both the endeavors of reform and opening up and the 
crackdown on various criminal activities, and both the material 
civilization and the spiritual civilization. 
  Spiritual civilization is important for its building and is 
valued for adherence. At the moment, what is most important and 
essential is to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to arm the whole party 
and to educate cadres and the masses. With the aim of training 
a new generation of people who are politically aware, morally 
sound, well-educated, and disciplined, we should make best 
possible use of the advantages in ideological and political work 
to enhance the political and ideological awareness of the vast 
numbers of cadres and the masses and to enhance their mental 
ability to bear the changes in reform. We should energetically 
advocate the practice of persisting in correct outlook on life 
and civilized and healthy style of life under the condition of 
the socialist market economy, should oppose money worship, 
ultra-individualism and corrosive style of life in a clear-cut 
manner, and should strive to eliminate all sorts of ugly 
phenomena to give rise to a fine social outlook that is 
conducive to the development of the socialist market economy. 
All levels of propaganda and mass media departments should 
energetically propagate the 64-character pioneering spirit set 
forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin, propagate the essence and 
characteristics of socialism, and extensively conduct the 
education on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism as well as 
the education on the legal system in order to enhance the 
people's national self-confidence, self-esteem, sense of pride, 
and sense of law. 
  We should further strengthen the building of socialist 
democracy and legal system and give full play to the role of 
people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees. 
The regional people's congress should accelerate the drawing up 
of local regulations in line with the demand of establishing the 
socialist market economic system. In accordance with the 
related regulations of the state and with the guidelines of the 
third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, we 
should accelerate the drawing up of the regulations regarding 
the regional autonomy of minority nationalities and other local 
regulations. We should also strengthen the supervision over law 
enforcement to promote the building of the two civilizations. 
  Leaders at all levels should pay high attention to the work 
concerning social stability and actually assume the political 
responsibility of "ensuring the stability of one's own area." 
Leaders should frequently study social trends and the trends of 
the masses' ideology and correctly approach and handle the 
contradictions among the people in order to tackle all sorts of 
instable factors in the bud and at the grass-roots level. They 
should further strengthen the comprehensive management of public 
security and deal severe blows to all sorts of serious criminal 
offenses to enhance the people's sense of security. 
  We should further pay attention to family planning work and 
strictly control population growth. Top leaders of party and 
government organizations at all levels should put this work in 
an important position and strive to yield results from it in 
line with the demand of "doing the job oneself and assuming 
overall responsibility." 
  We should energetically develop cultural, public health, and 
sports undertakings to constantly improve the ideological, 
cultural, and physical quality of the people of all 
nationalities. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should regard the vigorous development of productive forces and 
the constant improvement in people's living standards as the 
starting point of all their work. We should conscientiously 
implement the "housing project" to emphatically solve housing 
problems for homeless households, the households with dangerous 
houses, scientific and technological personnel, and teachers. 
  C. We should pay attention to the united front work of the 
party during the new period and strengthen the nationality work 
and the religious work to mobilize all positive factors. During 
the new historical period, the united front remains a major 
magic weapon of our party. The party's united front can only be 
strengthened but not be weakened and can only develop but not 
stop. We should consolidate and develop the system of 
multiparty cooperation under the leadership of the CPC. We 
should strengthen the unity among all nationalities and 
strengthen the unity and cooperation between the party and the 
various democratic parties, nonparty figures, and religious 
personages. We should mobilize all positive factors, turn the 
passive factors into positive ones, expedite reform and opening 
up, promote economic development, and safeguard a political 
situation of stability and unity. It is necessary to uphold the 
Marxist national concept and religious concept, and strengthen 
education and propaganda on national theory and policy and 
religious policy. In line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thesis 
that in treating the party's national policy and the issue of 
minority areas, it is necessary to pay attention to the essence 
and not to the form, we should firmly grasp the crux of the 
issue of whether we can develop the minority areas, implement 
the party's policy on nationalities, do a good job in 
nationalities work, and solve the problems on nationalities 
well. Activities on commending those who do a good job in 
national unity and progress must be carried out in close 
connection with reform, development, and stability. We should 
further consolidate and develop a socialist national 
relationship of equality, mutual help, unity, and cooperation, 
and realize common prosperity, unity, and progress among the 
people of various nationalities. It is necessary to implement 
the party's religious policy, respect the beliefs of the masses 
of religious believers, strengthen management over religious 
affairs in line with law, and never let them alone. Under the 
current situation, we should particularly guard against the 
conspiracy of advocating "westernization," and "polarization" of 
the international hostile elements, prevent domestic and foreign 
hostile forces from using nationalities and religious issues to 
engage in sabotage activities, immediately handle them in line 
with law when discovered, and never tolerate or abet them. 
  D. We should conscientiously implement the central plans, 
and 
unceasingly deepen the anticorruption struggle. In order to 
guarantee the smooth establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure, we must do a good job in anticorruption 
struggle. After the issuance of the central plan on conducting 
anticorruption struggle, all localities and departments have 
taken action actively, done lots of work in urging leading 
cadres to make self- investigation and self-correction, 
investigated and handled corrupt elements, checked the unhealthy 
trends in various trades, and achieved certain achievements. 
However, we must not overestimate the achievements we have 
made. Party committees at all level should fully understand the 
importance, arduousness, and protractedness of anticorruption 
struggle, and carry it out with unremitting efforts. Leading 
cadres at all levels, principal leaders, in particular, should 
act strictly in accordance with the demands of the party Central 
Committee, consciously assume leadership responsibility over 
anticorruption struggle, realistically take the lead in keeping 
themselves clean, honest, and self-disciplined, dare to grasp 
and manage this work, and guarantee that actual results are 
achieved in this anticorruption struggle. We should resolutely 
and conscientiously investigate and handle corrupt elements. 
Prior to the Spring Festival, party committees and governments 
at above the banner and county level and various departments of 
the regional organs should report the situation of fulfilling 
the definite anticorruption struggle tasks to the regional party 
committee and the discipline inspection commission, and 
promulgate the results of handling a number of major and 
appalling cases to the public in a step-by-step manner in an 
effort to unceasingly deepen the development of anticorruption 
struggle. We should take both permanent and temporary measures, 
strengthen the building of clean politics, strengthen the 
mechanism of supervision and restraint, and fundamentally check 
the growth and spread of corrupt phenomena. 
  Comrades, the establishment of the socialist market economic 
structure is an important and pressing task. Leading cadres at 
all levels are shouldering major historical responsibilities. 
Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the nucleus, we should unite with and lead the people 
of various nationalities across the region, enhance spirit, 
blaze new trials, and strive to realize this great historical 
task and the two expected objectives defined by the regional 
party committee.

"Unify Thinking, Heighten the Spirit, Seize the Whole Situation, 
Realistically Conduct Work, and Vigorously Create a New 
Situation in Propaganda and Ideological Work"] 
  [Text] The autonomous regional conference of propaganda 
and ideological work opened in Hohhot on 2 March and Wang Qun, 
secretary of the autonomous regional party committee, delivered 
an important speech at the conference. He pointed out: We 
should earnestly study and implement the spirit of the national 
conference of propaganda and ideological work, further unify our 
spirit, heighten our spirit, seize the whole situation, 
realistically conduct work, and vigorously create a new 
situation in propaganda and ideological work so as to create a 
much better ideological and media environment for the region to 
conduct reforms, to achieve development, to maintain stability, 
and to continuously boost its undertakings of reforms, opening 
up, and modernization. 
  Wu Liji, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee and vice chairman of the autonomous regional people's 
government, presided over the conference. Attending the 
conference were Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, Wang Zhan, Yang Enbo, 
Wuyunqimuge, Wang Duo, Liu Zuohui, Lin Yongsan, Zhang Zuocai, Wu 
En, and Yun Zhaoguang. 
  The speech of Wang Qun is divided into the following three 
parts: 1) On the importance of doing a good job in conducting 
the propaganda and ideological work in the new historic period. 
2) On several tasks for the current propaganda and ideological 
work. 3) On the enhancement of the party's leadership over the 
propaganda and ideological work. 
  Wang Qun said: The fundamental guideline and major tasks put 
forward at the recent national conference of propaganda and 
ideological work have the distinctive characteristics of the age 
and represent a major and important policy decision made by the 
CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core for 
implementing the principle of "building the two civilizations 
simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them," and a 
strategic arrangement for ensuring victorious progress in 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Successfully 
implementing the spirit of the national conference by bearing in 
mind the region's reality has a great, important, and practical 
significance on implementing the work guideline made by the CPC 
Central Committee with regard to "seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, 
and maintaining stability;" on promoting the region's programs 
of reform, development, and stability; on training from 
generation to generation new successors with ideals, morality, 
cultural knowledge, and the sense of abiding by the discipline; 
on consolidating and developing socialist nationalities' 
relationship; and on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. 
  Wang Qun said: In carrying out the grand cause of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the propaganda and 
ideological front occupies an important position and is assuming 
the important tasks of providing spiritual motive force, 
ideological guarantee, and intellectual support for the cause. 
Enhancing the propaganda and ideological work has a specially 
important significance on the autonomous region. First, the 
region is located in the border area and its economy and culture 
are relatively backward. Its ideology is more or less of 
closed-door style and its tasks for reform and economic 
development are very heavy. Tasks for the region to emancipate 
minds and shift its concepts are more arduous than those of 
other provinces and regions. Second, 1994 will be the year in 
which China will issue most measures for reforms. Therefore, 
difficulties encountered by the region will be large and many. 
In particular, the people in Inner Mongolia that is being 
restricted by various conditions will become relatively weak in 
bearing the pressure of reforms and encounter much more 
ideological problems. Third, Inner Mongolia is a place to 
exercise the regional national autonomy as well as the key 
target of the disintegration strategy of today's hostile 
international forces. Under such a new situation and new task, 
we must all the more attach importance on propaganda and 
ideological work. Propaganda and ideological work must be 
improved and enhanced without any degree of weakening or 
stagnation. 
  Wang Qun fully affirmed the achievements scored by Inner 
Mongolia in propaganda and ideological work, and, meanwhile, 
pointed out the shortcomings of the work. He said: To actually 
strengthen propaganda and ideological work, we should pay 
attention to the following three issues in understanding and 
practice: 1) Firmly embracing the concept of paying attention 
to both economic construction and political and ideological 
work; 2) profoundly understanding the idea that the "most 
serious mistake lies in education," and strengthening the sense 
of hardship; and 3) conscientiously implementing the measure of 
"being tough with both economic construction and political and 
ideological work." 
  Wang Qun pointed out: At present and in the future, the 
fundamental tasks of the region's propaganda and ideological 
work are: Closely around the overall situation of "reform, 
development, unity, and stability," we should arm the masses 
with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, spread propaganda among the masses with the 
party's basic line, principles, and policies, educate the masses 
with patriotic, collective, and socialist ideas, inspire the 
masses with the goal of reaching better-off standards of life 
and achieving common prosperity, seek unity of ideas among the 
masses, fortify the confidence of the masses, make the masses 
more united and enthusiastic, mobilize and give full play to the 
initiative and creativity of the masses and to their spirit of 
pioneering undertakings through hard work, and provide a good 
social and public opinion environment as well as a strong and 
effective ideological and political guarantee for realizing the 
region's fighting goals at two stages. 
  Wang Qun dwelt on the major tasks for the current propaganda 
and ideological work from the following four aspects: 
  1) We should pay attention to theoretical study to make the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics strike 
root in the hearts of the people. Arming cadres and the masses 
with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the most important task for the current 
propaganda and ideological work as well as the key to achieve 
success in propaganda and ideological work. In theoretical 
study, an extremely important work for Inner Mongolia is to arm 
the vast numbers of cadres and the masses with the Marxist 
concept of nationalities and the party's policy towards 
nationalities. Through the realistic, profound, and extensive 
education on the theory and policy towards nationalities, we 
should strive to firmly grasp the basic viewpoints to clarify 
what is right and what is wrong for some major issues and then 
to form a common understanding. 2) We should correctly guide 
public opinions and gear public opinions to the work of 
deepening reform, accelerating development, and safeguarding 
stability. Correctly grasping the orientation of public 
opinions is aimed at mobilizing the people of all nationalities 
to take an active part in reform and the modernization drive. 
We should involve all sorts of propaganda means and media and 
do a realistic and effective work to propagate and implement 
among the masses the party's theory, line, principles, and 
policies during the new period, to tell the masses the current 
situation and tasks, and to clearly explain to the masses the 
new problems and new contradictions emerging in the process of 
reform so that we can provide strong and effective ideological 
and political guarantee for reform and opening up and can create 
a good public opinion environment for developing the economy, 
national unity, and social stability. 3) We should pay 
attention to ideological education and strive to advocate good 
mental outlook and social conduct. The basic purpose of 
intensifying ideological education is to train the new people 
who have lofty ideals and moral characters and who are better 
educated and self-disciplined. The current priority is to 
educate the vast number of cadres, the masses, and youths with 
the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly as repeatedly 
advocated by Comrade Mao Zedong, the spirit of "having lofty 
ideals and moral characters and being better educated and 
self-disciplined" as repeatedly emphasized by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, and the 64-character pioneering spirit put forward by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin so that these kinds of spirit will become 
strong spiritual pillars of the endeavor of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the social conduct of the new 
period, and so that the erosion of corrupt ideas, such as money 
worship, pleasure-seeking, and ultra-individualism, can be more 
effectively resisted. 4) We should pay attention to literary and 
art creation and provide healthy and rich intellectual products 
to the people of various nationalities. In implementing the 
guidelines of the national propaganda and ideological work 
conference, the literary and art front should particularly do a 
good job in producing the outstanding literary and art works 
that advocate the main melody and reflect regional and national 
characteristics. Meanwhile, it should diversify the works to 
satisfy the ever growing spiritual and cultural needs of the 
people of various nationalities in the region. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: Now that the major policies for 
propaganda and ideological work have been decided on, the key to 
the next step of work is to make sure that the guidelines of the 
party Central Committee and the autonomous regional party 
committee are implemented to the letter at the grass-roots 
levels. This requires that party committees at all levels 
further strengthen leadership over propaganda and ideological 
work, firmly hold the initiative in it, and make it more 
fruitful through down-to-earth and effective work. First, they 
should attach great importance to the party's propaganda and 
ideological work and gain the initiative in leading the work. 
While giving close attention to and achieving success in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, party committees 
at all levels should conscientiously strengthen and improve 
leadership over propaganda and ideological work. They should 
include the work high in their agenda, conduct study of it on a 
regular basis, define the principles, tasks, and focuses of the 
work for certain periods, and devote more efforts to helping 
propaganda departments discuss and carry out major work and 
improve work level. Second, they should change work styles and 
pay close attention to implementation of work. Every 
department, unit, and comrade of the propaganda and ideological 
fronts should vigorously conduct investigation and study and 
seek truth from facts in the process of doing specific work. 
Third, they should strengthen coordination to rally forces to 
create a vivid situation in which the entire party and all 
quarters make concerted efforts to attend to propaganda and 
ideological work. Fourth, they should emancipate the mind, 
deepen reform, and invigorate the development of propaganda and 
cultural work. To strengthen party leadership over propaganda 
and ideological work, they should adhere to the principle of 
reform and, with reform as motivation, promote the entire 
propaganda and ideological work to a new level and new stage. 
Fifth, they should conscientiously step up efforts to improve 
the leading bodies and the personnel of propaganda and 
ideological departments. All the leading bodies and cadres of 
propaganda and ideological work departments should maintain 
political unity with the party Central Committee. The key to 
improving the personnel lies in improving the leading bodies of 
the propaganda and ideological fronts and turning them into 
leadership nucleuses that are unified in thinking, pure in party 
spirit, high-spirited, united, and truth-seeking. Party 
committees and governments at all levels should show concern for 
the comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts in their 
political activities, thinking, work, and life and enable them 
to better develop their talents and continuously make new 
contributions. 
  In conclusion, Wang Qun pointed out: Establishment of the 
socialist market economy system and the new situation and new 
tasks in attaining the two-stage targets defined by the 
autonomous regional party committee have set new and still 
higher demands on propaganda and ideological work and have also 
provided a broad room for the development of propaganda and 
ideological work. All leading cadres of the party and all 
comrades on the propaganda and ideological fronts should bravely 
shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted them by this era, 
uplift spirit, enhance confidence, willingly work in a 
down-to-earth manner, have the courage in innovation, and strive 
to create a new situation in Inner Mongolia's propaganda and 
ideological work. 
  Present at the conference were deputy secretaries of league 
and city party committees who were in charge of propaganda and 
ideological work; directors of the propaganda departments of 
league, city, banner, and county party committees; responsible 
comrades of league and city newspapers; directors of the 
propaganda departments of large industrial and mining 
enterprises and schools of higher learning; responsible comrades 
of the departments directly under the region; and relevant 
responsible comrades of the Liberation Army and people's armed 
police forces. Also present were the comrades attending the 
meeting on overseas propaganda, cultural, radio and television, 
and publication work; comrades attending the meeting on the 
education of party members; and comrades attending the advanced 
study class of the autonomous regional party school for leading 
cadres of leagues, cities, departments, and bureaus. 
  At a preparatory meeting held on the evening of 1 March, 
Wang 
Zhan, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee, gave a speech on the tasks, content, procedures, and 
requirements of the conference. Comrade Wuyunqimuge chaired the 
preparatory meeting.

  [Text] Wang Qun, leader of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous 
Regional delegation to the Second Session of the Eighth National 
People's Congress, secretary of the autonomous regional party 
committee, and chairman of the autonomous regional people's 
congress standing committee, voiced his opinions at the group 
discussion on the "government work report" given by Premier Li 
Peng on the afternoon of 11 March, in which he stressed that in 
achieving development we should have new ideas. Various work 
undertaken by the autonomous region should be carried out in 
line with the principle of abiding by or serving the whole 
situation in the work of the entire party and of the country as 
a whole. Efforts should be made to deal earnestly and 
successfully with the relationship among reform, development, 
and stability; to maintain mutual harmony and promotion among 
reform, development, and stability; and to strive to win a new 
victory in socialist modernizations. 
  Wang Qun said: The "government work report" given by Premier 
Li Peng has summarized in line with the principle of seeking 
truth from facts the important and major achievements scored by 
China over the past year in conducting reform, opening up, and 
modernizations and clearly defined the major tasks for 
conducting reform and construction this year. In view of the 
party's line, principles, policies, and measures, the government 
work report has fully reflected the spirit of the 14th CPC 
Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee and totally conformed with China's reality 
in socialist modernizations. I very much agree with the report. 
It is a good report of enhancing the national vigor and 
heartening the public feeling because it has revealed the heroic 
spirit of Chinese Nation in being not afraid of power. 
  Wang Qun said: In his "government work report," Premier Li 
Peng said: "Tasks stressed by the CPC Central Committee with 
regard to seizing the opportunity, deepening the reform, 
broadening the opening up, promoting the development, and 
maintaining the stability represent the whole situation 
prevailing in the work of the entire party and the country as a 
whole." In achieving development and making progress, Inner 
Mongolia Autonomous Region should have the whole situation in 
mind; closely follow the situation; and abide by and serve the 
situation. The region's work in various fields, as well as 
cadres and people of various nationalities, should also abide by 
and serve the whole situation and so should various localities 
and departments throughout the region, which should turn the 
practice of abiding by and serving the whole situation into the 
conscious action of the broad masses of cadres and people. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: To achieve development in the region 
in line with the whole situation, it is imperative to follow the 
content stressed by Premier Li Peng in his "government work 
report" with regard to dealing successfully and earnestly with 
the relationship among reform, development, and stability. 
Economic construction represents a center of work in various 
fields, as well as reform and opening up represent the 
motivating force of development. Development and reform 
represent a basis for maintaining social stability and having 
China enjoy long-term order and peace. Maintaining social 
stability represents an inevitable condition for developing the 
economy and smoothly conducting reform. If we fail to 
concentrate on further deepening the reform and broadening the 
opening up, the region's program of accelerating development 
will become empty talk. Without social stability there will be 
no development. Units from top to bottom across the region, as 
well as various industries and trades, should realistically and 
fruitfully do a good job in further conducting reform and 
broadening the opening up to enable the region's undertakings of 
four modernizations to achieve faster development and to promote 
the country's to become more prosperous. They must maintain the 
mutual harmony and promotion among reform, development, and 
stability and continuously score new achievements in socialist 
modernizations. 
  Comrade Wang Qun stressed: In achieving development in the 
region, we should have new ideas. The paragraph of General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech quoted by Premier Li Peng in his 
"government work report" has an important and guiding 
significance on the region's work. New ideas for the region to 
achieve development are as follows: It is imperative to truly 
orient the region's work onto a track with a center of 
increasing economic results and not to follow the old way of 
blindly seeking output value and growth and broadening the scale 
of investments. It is necessary to proceed from the region's 
reality in doing everything and to truly orient the economic 
development onto a track of depending on scientific and 
technological progress and upgrading the quality of labor 
forces, particularly onto a track of readjusting the production 
structure and products' mix, improving products' quality, and 
increasing economic results. What is important is to seek 
progress in upgrading the managerial and technical standards and 
improving the quality. Only such progress can be essential. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: We should further understand the 
region's strong and weak points under the conditions of the 
socialist market economy. Accelerating the establishment of 
socialist market economic systems will bring about an important 
opportunity for the region to accelerate its development. The 
region is endowed with vast territory and abundant resources and 
its population is small. In particular, the region's potential 
in agriculture, animal husbandry, township enterprises, and the 
industrial development of energy resources and raw materials, is 
very large and its prospect is vast. The state has put the 
supporting and promoting of economic development to minority 
regions into the program of macroeconomic readjustment and 
control and will give more supports in investment and policies 
to these regions. All of these are superior and favorable 
conditions for the region to develop its economy. Only by 
seizing opportunity, deepening the reform, broadening the 
opening up, and bringing the region's superiority into full 
play, are we able to achieve faster development. 
  Wang Qun pointed out: In view of the autonomous region in 
developing the economy, it is particularly necessary to break 
away the out-dated concepts and fetters accumulated under the 
systems of planned economy and to foster the new concept and 
ideas of socialist market economy. Efforts should be made to 
foster the sense of information, markets, opening up, economic 
results, competition, and legal systems, which are suitable to 
the market economy. It is also necessary to conduct work in a 
creative way in understanding and grasping the objective laws of 
market economy, which include the law of value, supply and 
demand, and competition. 
  Comrade Wang Qun said: In his "government work report", 
Premier Li Peng expounded in an overall way the great 
achievements scored by the country over the past year and 
accurately analyzed the country's contradictions, difficulties, 
and problems cropping up in the economic operation. However, 
these problems are predicted to crop up along the advancing 
road. In reading the government work report, we have felt that 
the determination of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council to deepen the reform and to push forward the 
establishment of socialist market economic systems is 
unswerving. They have clearly pointed out difficulties and 
problems that will crop up along the advancing road and urged 
the entire party to pay great attention to them, to earnestly do 
a good job in dealing with various contradictions and problems 
in a timely manner, and to maintain the unity and stability to 
ensure the smooth progress in conducting reform and building 
socialism. 
  Wang Qun stressed: In his "government work report" Premier 
Li Peng stressed that we should take a two-handed approach and 
be tough with both hands and uphold the principle of building 
the two civilizations simultaneously. Meanwhile, we should 
upgrade to an important position the work of enhancing the 
nationalities' unity and accelerating the development of 
minority regions. All of these have given great support to the 
border minority regions and fully indicated that the party and 
state are showing concern and supporting the development and 
mutual prosperity of border minority regions. Under the correct 
leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin 
at the core, we should further make efforts to wage struggle; 
safeguard the unification of the motherland and the great unity 
fostered by various nationalities; and build Inner Mongolia into 
a prosperous, civilized, rich, strong, and socialist border 
region.

  [Text] The sixth enlarged meeting of the provincial 
people's government opened on the morning of 18 March. The 
meeting is chiefly aimed at implementing the spirit of the 
second session of the Eighth National People's Congress and 
discussing the issue of how to further enhance industrial 
production and economic work in various fields in line with the 
province's current progress in economic development and 
organizational reforms so as to intensively conduct reform among 
the provincial level organs, to promote rapid economic 
development, and to maintain social stability. 
  Gao Yan, governor of the province, delivered an important 
speech at the meeting, in which he emphatically cited the 
following three parts: 
  1. We should clearly discern the situation, enhance our 
confidence, and do a good job in conducting industrial 
production and economic work in various fields. The province's 
economic operation in the January-February period somewhat 
achieved development based on the rapid growth of 1993. 
However, we should not neglect the existing problems. The 
situation in industrial production is serious and the problems 
cropping up in the circulation funds for production are 
prominent. The new situation prevailing after strictly 
controlling the gross credits and issuing some major and 
important measures for reform has further exposed the province's 
old problems such as the structural contradiction in economic 
development, the poor quality of enterprises, and the lack of 
competitive capability of products. Industrial production is a 
priority and is a difficult point in the province's economic 
work at present. The growth of industrial production was lower 
judging from the situation in February. What we have to do at 
present is not to fear the difficulties, not to complain, to 
enhance understanding, to unite as one in making progress, and 
to bring about a change as soon as possible to the low growth of 
industrial production. Efforts should be made to ensure the 
growth of industrial production in the first half of this year, 
which must surpass the figure of [words indistinct]. 
  Thus, first, we should enhance the leadership over 
industrial 
production. In particular, the mayor of cities where industrial 
enterprises are concentrated in should focus his efforts on 
grasping industries. In conducting the reform of organs, the 
leading bodies of the provincial level departments in various 
fields should define the division of work, realistically have 
the department assume its own responsibility, have it study the 
new situation and resolve the new problems, and have it conduct 
its work in a creative way. 
  Second, we should adopt every possible way and means to 
grasp 
funds. Various financial departments across the province should 
provide necessary fund guarantee for industrial and agricultural 
production development, reinforce business operations and sales, 
curtail overstock, and do a good job in grasping saving 
deposits. They should also strictly enforce the business 
mechanism and follow the targets of [words indistinct]. 
  Third, we should vigorously encourage enterprises to 
increase 
their economic results. Efforts should be made to grasp the 
production of key agricultural items, key enterprises, and key 
[words indistinct]. A good job should be done in boosting the 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. In particularly 
improving enterprises in various fields, we should [words 
indistinct]. By adopting the method of reforms, we should 
concentrate our efforts on organizing enterprises to earn more 
profits and [words indistinct]. The current emphasis of the 
rural work is to do a good job in making preparations for spring 
farming and to provide fertilizer and diesel for farming. While 
enhancing the active guidance over markets and optimizing the 
structure to stabilize grain production, we should vigorously 
develop a diversified economy so as to promote the rapid 
development of township enterprises. We should also firmly 
grasp the work in foreign economic relation and trade and the 
economic work in other fields and strive to make progress in 
this regard in the first half of the year. 
  2. We should do a good job in conducting reform among 
organs and implement the system of having personnel hold 
responsibility for the attainment of certain objectives in 
reform. We should make organizational reform and economic work 
mutually promote each other. Efforts should be made to organize 
all cadres to study well the documents issued by the central 
authorities with regard to organizational reforms and their 
reform plan and to orient their ideology and understanding onto 
the central authorities' documents and onto the decisions made 
by the provincial party committee and the provincial people's 
government. 
  First, we should stress discipline at present. In 
particular, leading cadres in the leading bodies of departments 
whose personnel transfer during the organizational reform is 
larger should report themselves to their new posts within the 
given date and plunge into the new assignment as soon as 
possible. 
  Second, a good job should be done in making new work 
connections among the changes of organizations and striving to 
complete the connections within a shortest period. 
  Third, we should firmly grasp the formulation of plans for 
various departments to implement the three decisions. 
  Fourth, we should enhance the ideological and political 
work; 
organize personnel affairs and establish departments to be well 
coordinated in reform; enhance the leadership over reform; and 
conduct careful work in reform. Along with the organizational 
reform, a good job should be done in implementing the system of 
having personnel hold responsibility for the attainment of key 
objectives in reform. The provincial people's government has 
defined the work target of [words indistinct] for this year. 
Various departments should further discern their tasks for the 
target, be responsible for their subordinate units to fulfill 
the target, and have the target be fulfilled at all levels. In 
line with the key work, the responsibility assumed by various 
departments for fulfilling the target should be enhanced. As 
for the matters that have been decided by the provincial party 
committee and the provincial people's government, various 
departments must earnestly implement them and ensure them to be 
thoroughly carried out. In meeting the demands of reform and 
development, we should further improve our work style. We 
should study more, have few social dealings, grasp practice, do 
practical deeds, pay attention to quality, stress efficiency, 
take the whole situation into consideration, and abide by 
discipline. Through the reform we should promote the 
construction of governmental organs and enable various 
governmental departments to create a new balance between their 
work and efficiency. 
  3. We should safeguard social stability and create a fine 
environment for organizational reform and economic development. 
Social stability is a big event that has a vital bearing on the 
whole situation. It is difficult for us to smoothly carry out 
organizational reform and economic development without a stable 
political or social environment. We should do a good job in 
grasping the following four tasks to successfully safeguard 
social stability: First, we should correctly discern and deeply 
understand the essence of contradictions. By taking education 
as a main measure, we should actively relieve or resolve 
contradictions. Second, we should uphold the correct guiding 
orientation of public opinions, do things in line with an 
objective law, and enhance our confidence in overcoming 
difficulties. Third, we should uphold the classified management 
in line with the difference of departments. Fourth, we should 
realize long-term social stability by upholding or depending on 
reform and development. Only by earnestly implementing the 
spirit of the three plenums of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission can we carry forward the struggle against corruption 
deeply and protractedly and score new periodical results in it. 
  During the meeting Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee, also delivered a speech on the issue 
of implementing decisions. He urged various units to further 
unify their thinking and understanding, to strictly enforce the 
law and regulations on establishment, to accelerate the progress 
in implementing the three decisions, to intensively straighten 
out relations, and to clear up or consolidate the personnel who 
will be the successors of other posts or be transferred. 
  During the meeting, Wei Minxue, vice governor the province, 
delivered a report on the province's current situation in 
industrial production, in which he made specific arrangements 
for organizing industrial production. 
  Among those who were invited to the meeting were leading 
comrades from the provincial party committee, the provincial 
people's congress standing committee, the provincial Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference committee, and from 
the departments concerned of the province's capital.

  [Text] The organizational reform of the party and 
government organs directly under the province has officially 
started. The provincial party committee and government held a 
mobilization rally on the morning of 4 March on the 
organizational reform of the organs directly under the province 
to implement the plan for the party and government 
organizational reform of Jilin Province approved by the party 
Central Committee and the State Council and to mobilize and 
arrange the party and government organizational reform of the 
organs directly under the province. 
  He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
chaired the rally. Liu Yazhi, standing committee member of the 
provincial party committee and director of its organization 
department, read the circular of the party Central Committee and 
the State Council on the plan for the party and government 
organizational reform of Jilin Province and the plan for the 
setup of Jilin's provincial-level party and government 
organizations. On behalf of the provincial party committee and 
government, Gao Yan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of Jilin, spoke to mobilize and arrange 
the provincial-level party and government organizational reform 
and put forward clear requirements. 
  Gao Yan pointed out: The provincial party committee decided 
that Jilin's party and government organizational reform should 
be conducted in such a way that the province as well as counties 
and cities will start first and that the province will lead the 
reform of cities [shi] and the autonomous prefecture, and 
counties and cities will lead the reform of towns and townships. 
The organizational reform at the provincial level and the 
county level should be by and large completed in the first half 
of this year, and efforts should be made to complete the 
organizational reform at the city or autonomous prefectural 
level and the town or township level in the second half of this 
year. According to the province's party and government 
organizational reform plan approved by the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, Jilin's provincial-level party 
and government organizations will total 54 after the 
organizational reform. After the reform, the provincial party 
committee will have nine organizations directly under it. The 
provincial discipline inspection commission; the general office, 
organization department, propaganda department, united front 
work department, commission for politics and law, research 
office, and rural work office of the provincial party committee; 
and the work committee of the organs directly under the Jilin 
Provincial CPC Committee are the agents of the provincial party 
committee. In addition, the provincial party committee's 
veteran cadre bureau, medical bureau, office of the secrets 
commission, office of the overseas propaganda group, and office 
of the leading group for the work toward Taiwan will be put 
under the administration of the departments of the provincial 
party committee. In line with the above-mentioned reform plan, 
the organizations directly under the provincial party committee 
will be reduced by four, or 30.8 percent, from the original 13 
before the reform. After the organizational reform, the 
provincial government will have 46 departments. They are 
general office, planning commission, economic and trade 
commission, economic structural reform commission, education 
commission, science and technology commission, the foreign 
affairs office of the provincial government, public security 
department, state security department, supervision department, 
civil affairs department, justice department, finance 
department, personnel department, labor department, geological 
and mineral resources department, construction department, 
machinery industry department, metallurgical industry 
department, petrochemical industry department, light industry 
department, communications department, water resources 
department, agriculture department, forestry department, trade 
department, grain department, foreign trade department, foreign 
economic cooperation department, culture department, radio and 
television department, public health department, physical 
culture and sports commission, family planning commission, 
auditing department, statistical bureau, industrial and 
commercial administration, press and publication bureau, 
township enterprise management bureau, tax bureau, environmental 
protection bureau, land management bureau, the legal system 
bureau of the provincial government, construction industry 
bureau, and coal industry bureau. In addition, following the 
state's method, nine organizations under the administration of 
the commissions and departments will be established: state 
property management bureau, technological supervision bureau, 
building material industry bureau, medical administration, food 
industry bureau, labor reform work administration, the 
letters-visits office of the provincial party committee and 
government, the investigation and study office of the provincial 
government, and the reception office of the provincial 
government. These organizations under the administration of 
commissions and departments will be at the deputy-departmental 
level. 
  In line with the above-mentioned plan, the organizations of 
the provincial government will be reduced by 23, or 33.3 
percent, after the reform. 
  Gao Yan pointed out: The organizational reform of the 
provincial-level people's congress and Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference organs, court, and 
procuratorate will be conducted simultaneously with the party 
and government organizational reform, and so will be the reform 
of mass organizations, such as the provincial trade union 
council, Communist Youth League committee, and women's 
federation. 
  Speaking on the reform of the institutions directly under 
the 
province, Gao Yan pointed out: The orientation is the 
separation of government functions from the functions of the 
institutions and socialization of the institutions. After the 
reform, the personnel of the institutions directly under the 
province who are supported by financial allocation will be 
reduced by over 20 percent. 
  Speaking on the organizational reform of cities, autonomous 
prefecture, counties, cities [shi], towns, and townships, Gao 
Yan urged that they should step up implementation of the plan 
for the provincial party and government organizational reform 
after it is transmitted to lower levels, study and work out the 
specific plans for the organizational reform at their own 
levels, and apply for approval according to the stipulated 
procedures to their implementation. 
  Gao Yan also pointed out: In coordination with the 
provincial party and government organizational reform, we should 
popularize or try out the state public servant system in a 
timely manner. All departments of the provincial organs should 
institute the system in a timely manner after their 
organizational reform plans are approved. The system should be 
popularized or tried out mainly in party and government organs. 
When popularizing or trying out the public servant system, the 
organs directly under the province should adhere to the 
following basic principles. First, the organizational reform 
and the popularization or experimentation of the public servant 
system should be conducted under unified plans and in a 
coordinated manner, and they should support each other. Second, 
key areas should be emphasized and consideration should also be 
given to other areas. Third, standards should be unified, 
different guidance given, and overall operation conducted. 
Fourth, the organizations should be improved, their quality 
raised, and their personnel optimized. 
  Comrade He Zhukang gave an important speech at the 
mobilization rally. He emphasized: The following work should 
be made successful if we are to achieve success in the present 
organizational reform. 
  First, we should make conscientious efforts to unify 
thinking. Pertinent comrades of all units should first take the 
lead in studying documents and unifying their thinking in line 
with the plan for the reform and the decision of the provincial 
party committee and government to ensure smooth implementation 
of the present organizational reform. 
  Second, we should give attention to focus in doing work. We 
should devote more efforts to raising work efficiency. All 
organizations and personnel should strive to raise work 
efficiency in line with the requirements of the new functions 
and the qualifications of public servants. 
  Third, we should correctly handle the relationship between 
organizational reform and day-to-day work. 
  Fourth, we should strengthen leadership. To make the present 
organizational reform successful, we should strengthen the 
party's unified leadership, adhere to the principle of 
democratic centralism, and strictly enforce discipline. Matters 
related to the organizational reform should be decided after 
collective discussions, and the practice of letting only one 
person or a few persons have the final say should not be 
permitted. This system should be strictly implemented 
particularly in the transfer of personnel. Taking advantage of 
the reform to promote cadres quickly, grant titles, divide up 
money and materials, and transfer public property must never be 
allowed. Pertinent departments should strengthen supervision 
and examination and strictly deal with the law and discipline 
breaches discovered in the process of reform.

<F P=106> [Speech by Yue Qifeng, deputy secretary of the Liaoning </F>
Provincial CPC Committee and governor of the province, at the 
provincial rural work conference on 26 December: "Clarify Ideas, 
Make Earnest Efforts To Do Solid Work, and Strive To Enable 
Rural Areas To Achieve a Fairly Comfortable Standard of Living 
Ahead of Schedule"] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  This provincial rural work conference is based on the 
decision of the provincial party committee and government to 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the central rural 
work conference, correctly analyze Liaoning's rural economic 
situation, summarize and exchange experiences, define the goals 
to be attained, and accelerate Liaoning's pace of achieving a 
fairly comfortable standard of living. Based on the opinions 
discussed at the meeting of the standing committee of the 
provincial party committee and the executive meeting of the 
provincial government, I will speak on four issues. 
<H5>  1. A Historical and Fundamental Change Has Taken Shape in </H5>
Liaoning's Agriculture and Rural Economy 
  Since the beginning of the nineties, party committees and 
governments at all levels in the province have led the vast 
number of cadres and people on the agricultural front to 
thoroughly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, implement the guidelines 
of the 14th party congress, conscientiously carry out the 
party's series of rural principles and policies, adjust the 
unitary ideas for economic work, bring into better balance the 
relationship between urban and rural areas and between industry 
and agriculture, adhere to the strategic idea of promoting urban 
areas to lead rural areas and achieving integrated and common 
development of urban and rural areas, strengthen and extend 
leadership over rural work, continuously deepen rural reform, 
and strive to improve production conditions, thus effecting a 
historical and fundamental change in Liaoning's agricultural and 
rural economy. This year, in particular, the province has again 
reaped a good harvest in agriculture, achieved a new 
breakthrough in township enterprises, and effected a new change 
in the rural economy. A bumper harvest was won in farming, with 
grain output totaling 16.96 million tons, up 8.1 percent from 
last year when a bumper harvest was registered; and the output 
of oil-bearing crops 204,000 tons, up 15.7 percent. Vegetable 
output exceeded 10 million tons, the output of fresh and fine 
vegetables increased greatly, and the greenhouses for growing 
vegetables exceeded 550,000 mu, up 250,000 mu compared to last 
year. Fruit output came to 2.1 million tons, up 23.5 percent, 
and orchards exceeded 10 million mu. Animal husbandry grew 
steadily. Despite the serious influence of the No. 5 disease of 
livestock and the decline in the production of the major 
producers in the country, meat output is expected at 1.295 
million tons, up 10.9 percent from the previous year; the 
year-end number of pigs in stock may reach 11 million heads, the 
same as in last year, and the number of pigs slaughtered was 10 
million heads, up 5.8 percent; the number of the cattle in stock 
was 1.65 million, and that of the cattle slaughtered was 
540,000, up 6.2 and 29.5 percent respectively; the number of 
sheep in stock was 2.4 million, and that of the sheep 
slaughtered 1.23 million, both a slight increase; and the output 
of poultry and eggs was 710,000 tons, up 10.4 percent. 
Liaoning's output value of animal husbandry is expected at 10.6 
billion yuan, exceeding 10 billion for the first time. 
Aquiculture has made new headway. The output of aquatic 
products is expected at 1.46 million tons, up 10.4 percent, of 
which 620,000 tons will come from ocean fishing, up 8.6 percent. 
Prawn breeding was seriously affected by disasters. Despite 
this, sea water cultivated aquatic products reached 730,000 
tons, up 11.1 percent, and fresh water cultivated aquatic 
products 110,000 tons, up 14.6 percent. The increase of 
good-quality varieties has led to substantial increase in output 
value, which is expected at 7 billion yuan, up 18.6 percent. 
New progress has been achieved in forestry. Up-to-standard 
afforestation totaled 2.04 million mu, up 22,000 mu from last 
year; forests of economic value have developed rapidly to reach 
650,000 mu, up 300,000 mu; 160 million trees were planted by 
people voluntarily, 177,000 mu of saplings were cultivated, and 
943,000 cubic meters of timber were produced. Production 
related to forestry has developed rapidly, with the output value 
of forestry expected at 1.2 billion yuan this year, up 23.7 
percent from last year. Rural infrastructural construction has 
been expedited. 
  At present, the whole province has 
developed 1,417 country trade fairs in rural areas with 1,079 
comprehensive markets and 392 special markets, expanded the 
scale of the markets, and promoted the circulation of 
commodities. During the year, we sent 140 million laborers to 
participate in the construction of farmland and water 
conservancy projects, completed 410 million cubic meters of 
earth and stone work, harnessed rivers and repaired dikes 
totaling over 2,100 km, increased 2.65 million mu of water and 
soil conservation areas, developed 780,000 mu of water irrigated 
land, improved conditions for agricultural production, and 
raised the comprehensive production capacity; we accelerated the 
rate of building a network of highways, increased 2,375 
kilometers of asphalt road surface, and improved 2,228 km of 
road beds of highways at and above the county level. Fairly 
great improvements were seen in telecommunications work, and a 
new leap forward emerged in township enterprises. It is 
expected that the total output value of township enterprises may 
reach 146.4 billion yuan, an increase of 71.1 percent over the 
previous year; the total output value of township industry may 
exceed 100 billion yuan, an increase of 65.7 percent; 6.9 
billion yuan of export products may be delivered, up 36 percent; 
the total amount of profits and taxes may reach 10.6 billion 
yuan, up 47.3 percent; and the total amount of taxes may reach 
5.06 billion yuan, up 35.1 percent. It is expected that the 
whole province will have 19 counties (cities and districts) each 
with a total output value of township enterprises exceeding 2 
billion yuan, an increase of nine counties over the previous 
year; 360 townships and towns each with a total output value of 
township enterprises exceeding 100 million yuan, an increase of 
95 townships and towns, of which, 10 may exceed 1 billion yuan; 
and 1,600 villages each with a total output value of township 
enterprises exceeding 10 million yuan, an increase of 535 
villages. The "221" township enterprise project had been 
realized two years ahead of schedule. County-level financial 
revenues and the income of peasants have increased. The 
financial revenues of 65 counties (cities) of 14 cities across 
the province may reach 3.903 billion yuan, an increase of 28.13 
percent over the previous year. Of these, the number of counties 
each with a financial revenue of over 100 million yuan increased 
from 6 last year to 13 this year; and the number of counties 
each with a financial revenue of over 50 million yuan increased 
from the 23 last year to 30. The average per-capita net income 
of peasants across the province may reach 1,100 yuan, up 105 
yuan over the previous year. 
  Thanks to sustained and rapid development in agriculture and 
the rural economy during recent years, the whole province has 
become self-sufficient in the total grain output with an average 
per-capita amount of over 400 kg, of which, the output of rice 
and wheat exceeded 120 kg. This year, we delivered 25,000 tons 
of paddy to the southern provinces for the first time. With the 
approval of the state, we began to export 300,000 tons of rice 
to Japan in December. We became self-sufficient in major 
nonstaple foods with a small surplus. The average per-capita 
amount of such nonstaple foods as meat, eggs, eggs, milk, 
aquatic products, vegetables, and fruits was higher than the 
national average. Liaoning began to deliver pork to Shanhaiguan 
during the fourth quarter of this year, and 150,000 hogs were 
delivered; the average per-capita net income of peasants was 
maintained at above the national average, and the problems of 
food and clothing have been basically solved. In view of our 
province's tremendous changes in agriculture and rural economy 
and recalling the past situations, we heartily felt the pride of 
our province's major breakthroughs in rural economy under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. Our province's agriculture was a 
weak feature for a long time. Agriculture with a weak 
foundation had to support the large industrial setup in the 
urban areas, thus giving rise to a pattern of "big industry and 
small agriculture." In order to guarantee industry and urban 
supply, the broad masses of peasants have made tremendous 
contributions and sacrifices, undertaken the grain purchasing 
task that was higher than the national average by 200 percent, 
provided meat, eggs, vegetables, milk, and fish to the urban 
areas at very low prices, and some localities even had to buy 
hogs at a high price in order to fulfill the assigned purchasing 
tasks. Even under such circumstances, residents in cities and 
towns can only lead a life of sharing 2 kg of rice, 1.5 kg of 
flour, 0.15 kg of oil, and 0.25 kg of meat monthly. Because the 
people of Liaoning traveled to Shanhaiguan to buy pork, they got 
the name of "tigers of northeast China." Comrades living in 
Liaoning have experienced this personally. 
  Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, our province 
reaped bumper grain harvests for four consecutive years from 
1990 and set historical records every year. Our province not 
only ensured self-sufficiency in grain and such main foodstuffs 
as meat, eggs, vegetables, milk, fish, and fruit and made the 
dreams of the people of several generations come true but also 
started to distribute its rice and pork to other places. This 
could not be imagined in the previous planned economy era. What 
inspires us more is that town and township enterprises, as new 
forces, are suddenly coming to the fore with a tendency of 
developing vigorously. The net increase in the output value of 
town and township enterprises totaled 100 billion yuan from 1991 
to 1993. Simultaneously, the state did not make any investment 
in town and township enterprises. These enterprises even used a 
mere 2 billion yuan of bank loans annually. Such development 
speed could not be expected and understood from the viewpoint of 
the unitary planned economy. The rapid development in town and 
township enterprises not only helps slow the province's 
regression rate in industrial output value ranking in the whole 
country but also helps noticeably change the long-term situation 
of unbalance in industrial structure, product mix, enterprise 
structure, and ownership structure and also affects the 
province's economic development. According to calculation and 
analysis by relevant departments, from 1989 to 1993, the 
proportion of the rural output value in the total social output 
value rose from 28.9 percent to 36.8 percent, the ratio of the 
output value of the industries at or above the county and 
township levels to the province's total industrial output value 
rose from 75:25 to 69:31, the ratio of the output value of the 
state-owned and non-state-owned industrial enterprises to the 
total industrial output value rose from 68:32 to 52:48, and the 
ratio of the output value realized by large, medium-sized, and 
small enterprises to the total industrial output value rose from 
53:47 to 47:53. The proportion of the export value of town and 
townshp enterprises in the local foreign exchange earnings from 
exports rose from 13.9 percent to 28 percent. The proportion of 
the profits and taxes of the non-state-owned industrial 
enterprises in the total profits and taxes of the industrial 
enterprises rose from 25.4 percent to 27.8 percent. Along with 
the changes in these several structures, not only some old 
economic patterns have been or are being changed but also the 
province has upgraded its economic capability for bearing the 
state macroeconomic regulation and control. In the latter half 
of 1993, the state strengthened macroeconomic regulation and 
control. Thus, the increase rate of the state-owned industrial 
enterprises began to fall after a rise. In a situation where 
the state-owned industrial enterprises registered a negative 
increase in output value in the fourth quarter, the province 
still kept the increase in the industrial output value within 21 
percent this year. Of the newly added industrial output value 
totaling 50.1 billion yuan, the output value realized by 
state-owned industrial enterprises increased by 5.5 billion 
yuan, accounting for 11 percent; and that by non-state-owned 
industrial enterprises increased by 46.6 billion yuan, 
accounting for 89 percent. Of this, the output value realized 
by town and township enterprises increased by 38.54 billion 
yuan, accounting for 76.9 percent of the total increase value. 
Without big development in non-state-owned sectors of the 
economy, such as town and township enterprises, the situation in 
the early 1980's when the national economy was readjusted may 
emerge again in a situation in which the state-owned 
enterprises' growth rate fell after a rise and the GNP increase 
rate suddenly dropped from 8.9 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 
1981. It may be like the situation in the three years of 
improving the economic environment and rectifying the economic 
order when the GNP growth rate was reduced from 11.3 percent in 
1988 to 0.3 percent in 1990. 
  Agriculture and the rural economy, as the most vigorous 
growing points, have played a decisive role in Liaoning's 
economic development. They have made contributions to 
Liaoning's rapid economic development. We should fully appraise 
and greatly praise this. Therefore, it is appropriate and 
natural for us to say that agriculture and the rural economy 
have effected a historical breakthrough and a fundamental 
change. These achievements were a result of the hard work of 
the cadres and the masses on the agricultural front, but they 
could not be separated from the great support provided by all 
trades and professions. Here on behalf of the Liaoning 
Provincial CPC Committee and the Liaoning provincial government, 
please allow me to extend the most sincere gratitude and high 
respect to the cadres and peasants who have made tremendous 
contributions to Liaoning's rural economic development and the 
comrades from all trades and professions who have shown concern 
for and supported rural economic development! 
  Witnessing the tremendous change in Liaoning's agriculture 
and rural economy and studying again volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping have enabled us to 
understand better the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Since the third plenary session of the 11th 
party Central Committee, the vast rural areas have eliminated 
the restrictions imposed by the "two whatevers," changed once 
and for all the people's commune system of "three-level 
ownership by the commune, the production brigade, and the 
production team, with the production team as the basic 
accounting unit, without change for 30 years," and instituted 
the household-based output-related contract responsibility 
system, which, as peasants said, has enabled peasants to "keep 
all they produce for themselves as long as they turn in 
sufficient amount to the state and set aside sufficient amount 
to the collective." As a result, peasants' enthusiasm has been 
fully boosted, and rural productive forces have been greatly 
liberated and developed. Meanwhile, in agricultural production, 
we eliminated the "leftist" stuff, such as "taking grain as the 
key link and wiping out all others" and eliminating chicken and 
duck breeding and vegetable planting as the "capitalist tails," 
and greatly developed diverse production while never slackening 
efforts in grain production. In this way, we have rationalized 
rural economic structure. What is more eye-catching is the 
rising of township enterprises as a new force. In the past 
decade or so, the output value of the township enterprises of 
the country has increased from 160 billion yuan to over 2,000 
billion yuan. Such a growth rate is a miracle. Although some 
people frown upon and do not understand such remarkable 
development, it is indeed a reality that cannot be refuted or 
negated. Just as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "rural reform has 
yielded good results in three years," "the true change is in 
rural areas," and "some changes are unexpected." Speaking on 
the changes in rural areas with Chinese characteristics, 
township enterprise development is the most evident 
characteristic of the endeavor to build socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The reason for this is that rural areas, 
through reform, have established new mechanisms full of 
vitality, and that such mechanisms have a large capacity for 
self-development, self-regulation, and self-compensation. Early 
this year, information from all localities told us that peasants 
would no long grow grain, and that land would lay wasted. We 
firmly believed at that time that as long as we conscientiously 
implemented the party's series of principles and policies, 
adhered to the household-based output-related contract 
responsibility system, and gave full play to the role of the new 
mechanisms of rural areas, such a situation would never occur. 
Facts have fully proved this. Therefore, the vigor brought by 
the new mechanisms cannot be estimated with ordinary rules, and 
the mechanisms have opened up broad prospects for peasants to 
march toward a fairly comfortable standard of living. Comrade 
Xiaoping said: "Whether Chinese society is stable and whether 
China's economy can be developed should be judged, first, by 
whether rural areas can develop and whether peasants' life can 
be improved. To attain the 700-percent increase, an important 
thing is to see whether the 80 percent of our population can 
attain it. Judging from the current situation, the series of 
new rural policies have been successful." As has been proven in 
practice, Comrade Xiaoping's theses are totally correct. We must 
arm our minds with Comrade Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, persistently emancipate 
our minds, seek truth from facts, and consolidate and develop 
the excellent rural situation. 
  Comrades, why can such noticeable changes take place in our 
province's agriculture and rural economy in a short span of a 
few years after we have entered the 1990's? In addition to the 
correct leadership of the party Central Committee and the State 
Council and the adoption of measures, such as deepening reform, 
developing science and technology, and increasing input, we also 
have many work experiences worthy of summarizing. 
  First, we persisted in combining the urban efforts with the 
rural efforts to seek common development. For a long time, 
owing to various reasons, our province's priorities were mostly 
placed in industry in urban areas, failed to sufficiently attend 
to agriculture and rural economy, lacked a dialectical and 
united concept in handling the relationship between the urban 
and the rural areas and between the management of state-owned 
large and medium-sized enterprises and the development of 
township enterprises, always set them against each other, and 
even placed the development of agriculture simply in a 
subordinate place of guaranteeing urban supply and serving the 
urban areas, and believed that township enterprises would 
scramble for energy, raw materials, and markets with large and 
medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, when the state adopted the 
macroeconomic regulation and control measures, we always set 
restrictions on township enterprises in the first place. As a 
result, we failed to develop the rural economy and successfully 
run state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. We 
summarized these experiences and lessons, proceeded from 
Liaoning's reality, made full use of our province's advantages 
of having many large and medium-sized cities, state-owned large 
and medium-sized enterprises, a big proportion of raw material 
industrial units, many colleges, universities and scientific 
research units, and strong city functions, upheld the road of 
using the urban areas to bring along the rural areas, large 
projects to bring along small ones, heavy industry to promote 
light industry, and combined the efforts of urban areas with the 
rural areas to seek common development. Thus, we succeeded in 
effectively promoted a sustained, speedy, and sound development 
in our province's urban and rural economies as well as in 
industrial and agricultural production. Practice showed that 
combining the efforts of the urban areas with that of the rural 
areas to seek common development is conducive to enabling the 
rural areas to use the advantages of funds, technology, and 
trained personnel of the urban areas to transform traditional 
agriculture, develop township enterprises, and expedite the 
process of modernization; enabling the urban areas to use the 
favorable conditions of the rural areas to guarantee the supply 
of staple and nonstable foods to the urban areas, solve the 
contradictions of the shortage of raw materials and work sites, 
break the barriers of urban and rural areas, actively develop 
urban and rural markets, and realize the goal of optimum 
distribution of essential production factors and taking 
advantages of each others' strengths; enabling large industrial 
enterprises in the urban areas to realize product and 
technological transfer and spread in the course of 
transformation and readjustment, concentrate efforts on 
intensive and precision processing industry, develop high-tech 
and value-added products, and raise competition ability; 
enabling rural areas to be influenced by large industrial 
enterprises in the urban areas, to develop rural industry, break 
the old pattern of having the urban areas to run industry and 
rural areas to engage in farming, and accelerate the 
readjustment of industrial, product and ownership structures and 
distribution of productive forces; enabling the urban areas to 
exchange materials with the rural areas, promote cultivation and 
formation of markets, and accelerate the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure; and enabling the urban 
areas to merge their economy with the rural areas, maintain a 
close relationship between industry and agriculture, and narrow 
the difference between the urban and the rural areas. 
Therefore, we may say that regarding the development of 
high-yield, fine-quality and highly-efficient farming, township 
enterprises as well as individual private economies as an 
important growing point of Liaoning's economic development is an 
inevitable choice. Liaoning is the first province to implement 
the system of "placing counties under city administration." It 
has experiences and gained lessons in combining the efforts of 
urban areas with that of the rural areas to seek common 
prosperity. Facts showed that in the condition of developing 
the socialist market economy, it is a general trend for the 
urban and rural areas to effect economic infiltration and 
amalgamation to become an integral whole, and a necessary path 
for invigorating Liaoning's economy by combining the efforts of 
the urban and rural areas to seek common prosperity. 
  Second, we persisted in the principle that "two results 
must supplement each other." The practice in the past few years 
told us that to accelerate the development of agriculture and 
the rural economy, we must persist in the principle of never 
ignoring grain production; positively develop a diversified 
economy; follow the path of agriculture; promote the overall 
development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline 
production, and fishery; and promote coordinated development of 
the primary, secondary, and tertiary industries. We used to 
grasp agriculture as it stands and to lay undue emphasis on 
"taking grain as a key link" in the rural work. As a result, 
the grain output did not increase, the foodstuffs were in short 
supply, and the peasants were still poor. This historical 
lesson was extremely profound. Grain is a special commodity 
linked to the national economy and the people's livelihood. 
Therefore, grain production should increase steadily. However, 
at present, the comparable results of grain production are 
reduced and the grain production areas and the peasants do not 
have high enthusiasm for growing grain. To maintain sustained 
and stable agricultural development, not only should the 
government strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and 
carry out the policies to protect and support agriculture and 
the peasants but we should also bring into full play the 
functions of the new mechanism characterized by 
self-development, self-accumulation, self- regulation, and 
self-compensation, that has taken shape through rural reform; 
and carry out the principle that two results must supplement 
each other. First, at the time of stabilizing grain production, 
we should vigorously develop high-yield, high- efficiency, and 
good-quality agriculture; positively develop a diversified 
economy; and use the high income from the diversified economy to 
make up for the deficiency due to the low income from grain 
production so as to have the internal sectors of the large- 
scale agriculture supplement one another. Second, we should 
vigorously develop town and township enterprises, rely on these 
enterprises to "feed agriculture back," and supplement and 
develop agriculture with industries. This is the most realistic 
way for us to develop agriculture under circumstances in which 
our country is unable to follow the way taken by the western 
countries where a portion of money is drawn from the high 
profits realized by the industries to subsidize agriculture. 
This is just like what Comrade Xiaoping has said: "Conversely, 
the development of town and township enterprises is very helpful 
to agriculture and helps promote agricultural development and 
solve problems of comparatively low results of farm products and 
dampened enthusiasm of peasants. Over the years, we have 
persisted in this way and mainly relied on rural forces to 
develop the rural economy, maintained proper input to 
agriculture, better solved the contradictions due to the state's 
insufficient input to agriculture, and ensured sustained, fast, 
and sound development of agriculture and the rural economy. 
  Third, we persistently protected and mobilized the 
enthusiasm 
of both the peasants and the rural grass-roots cadres. This is 
a principle that we have constantly persisted on when developing 
agriculture and the rural economy. Over the years, we have 
repeatedly stressed that the peasants are the main body of 
agriculture and that their enthusiasm should not be hurt. If 
their enthusiasm is hurt, the people may have to go without 
food. Even social and political problems will be created when 
the situation becomes serious. We also adopted policies to 
control the situation where the prices of production factors 
rose at an excessively faster speed, carried out the grain 
protective prices, implemented various aid-agriculture policies, 
made up our minds to carry out the measures for reducing the 
unreasonable burdens on the peasants, and effectively mobilized 
and protected the enthusiasm of the peasants. Simultaneously, we 
also stressed the necessity to protect and mobilize the 
enthusiasm of the rural grass-roots cadres. The rural 
grass-roots cadres are the links through which the party and the 
government establish contacts with the broad masses of the 
peasants. We should rely on the grass-roots cadres to 
specifically organize forces to implement various rural tasks. 
If their enthusiasm is dampened, the party's policies and 
principles and the government's political decrees will become a 
mere scrap of paper and will be implemented to the letter with 
difficulties. At the beginning of this year, in the course of 
implementing the party Central Committee and the State Council's 
policies on strengthening agriculture and the rural work, some 
localities shifted the responsibility of adding to the peasants' 
burdens on to the grass-roots cadres. This is unfair. They are 
only enforcers. If we set them against the broad masses of the 
peasants, their enthusiasm will be dampened. 
  In light of this situation, we definitely pointed out at 
the first plenary session of the eighth provincial government: 
There is no denying the fact that a few cadres at the 
grass-roots level have violated laws and discipline and even 
bullied and oppressed the common people. The overwhelming 
majority of cadres, however, have been diligent and 
conscientious in serving the people. Their work is very hard. 
Without the arduous struggle of the vast numbers of cadres at 
the grass-roots level and without their faithful practice of the 
line, principles, and policies laid down since the third plenary 
session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the tremendous 
changes in agriculture and rural economy today could not be 
explained. We must completely comprehend them. Pertinent 
departments of the state and provincial, city, or county 
authorities are responsible for some of the excessively heavy 
burdens on peasants. Not all of them are caused by cadres at 
the grass-roots level, and we should not shift all the 
responsibilities onto cadres. Leaders at all levels should 
assume responsibilities for the heavy burdens on peasants and 
should strive to protect and mobilize peasants' enthusiasm. 
Practice shows that our attention to protecting and mobilizing 
the initiative of both cadres and the masses has made the 
government function well and the people enjoy peace and has made 
cadres and the masses unite with each other to march towards the 
goal of having the people become relatively well- off. This is 
an important guarantee for the rapid development of agriculture 
and the rural economy. 
  We should persist in combining cities with the countryside 
to 
effect common development, should make cities and the 
countryside complement each other, and should mobilize the 
initiative of both. This is not only a successful experience 
gained by our province in accelerating the development of 
agriculture and the rural economy but also the principle we must 
uphold in the future. We should strive to improve it 
continuously through new practices. 
<H5>  2. The Position of Agriculture as the Foundation Should Be </H5>
Strengthened Rather Than Weakened in Establishing a New 
Socialist Market Economic Structure 
  Agriculture has always been the stabilizing trade of the 
state and has been the foundation of the entire national 
economy. The third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee adopted the "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the 
Establishment of the Socialist Market Economic Structure." In 
establishing the socialist market economic structure, is it 
necessary to strengthen agriculture and persist in the position 
of agriculture as the foundation? The answer is yes, of course. 
Just as Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out repeatedly: "In the 
process of building the socialist market economic system, we 
should continue to firmly and unswervingly implement the 
principle of considering agriculture as the foundation and 
firmly and unswervingly put agriculture in the most important 
position in economic work." Comrade Jiang Zemin called on the 
whole party to "strengthen the position of agriculture as the 
true foundation internally rather than externally, in deeds 
rather than words, and wholeheartedly rather than 
half-heartedly." Premier Li Peng also pointed out at the 
national rural work conference: "Today, in establishing the 
socialist market economic structure, the position of agriculture 
as the foundation cannot waver in the slightest degree, and 
agriculture should be strengthened rather than weakened." These 
important instructions of the central leading comrades have 
clearly pointed out the orientation for us to further strengthen 
the position of agriculture as the foundation and continue to 
attend to the rural work under the new situation. 
  We should fully understand that the establishment of 
socialist market economic structure has not changed the reliance 
relations between the entire national economy and agriculture. 
Food is essential to the people, and all the people must have 
sufficient food to eat. As far as the whole state is concerned, 
the issue of feeding 1.1 billion population is the most 
important issue that should never be neglected. As far as the 
province is concerned, the proportion of industry is relatively 
great, with a larger urban population, heavier peasants' 
burdens, so that the issue of feeding the people can no longer 
be neglected. In this aspect, we paid a big price and had 
bitter experiences. Today, although the conditions have 
changed, we are still required to draw a lesson from the bitter 
experiences. In particular, under the condition of establishing 
a socialist market economic structure, the degree of reliance on 
agriculture by the entire society and the national economy has 
not been weakened but has been strengthened. This has manifest 
itself in the fact that the domestic and international markets 
are continuously setting new demands on the quality, variety, 
and quantity of agricultural products. More importantly, to 
rapidly tackle the most conspicuous contradiction--the 
unreasonable structures of industries, products, enterprises, 
and ownership, we must further strengthen the position of 
agriculture as the foundation and accelerate the development of 
agriculture and the rural economy. 
  Of course, following 
the development of the modernization drive and the adjustment of 
the industrial composition, the proportion of the secondary and 
tertiary industries in the GNP will increase, and that of 
agriculture will decline. This is an unavoidable situation 
after the improvement of productive forces and social progress. 
However, this never means that agriculture is no longer 
important. Besides, the development of secondary and tertiary 
industries cannot be separated from agriculture; and only when 
agriculture is developed and peasants become affluent, can they 
provide a consumer market for the secondary and tertiary 
industries. We should note all the more that China's broadest 
market with the greatest potential for development lies in rural 
areas. When the rural economy does not develop, peasants' 
income don't improve, and the rural market is not opened up, 
secondary and tertiary industries will not develop and will even 
recede. Therefore, the endeavor to establish the new system of 
the socialist market economy is in unity with the effort to 
emphasize the fundamental position of agriculture in the 
national economy, and we should understand them as such. 
  We should fully understand that the fundamental position of 
agriculture should be strengthened continuously if we are to 
solve the numerous problems in agricultural development. 
Although Liaoning achieved historical breakthroughs in 
agriculture in the past few years, the conditions for 
agricultural production have yet to be fundamentally changed, 
the foundation for agriculture is not solid, some localities are 
still weak in their resistance cabilities against natural 
disasters, and production fluctuates greatly. Meanwhile, some 
conspicuous problems remain in the process of advancement. 1) 
The price difference between industrial and farm products has 
widened, the comparable interests of agriculture have declined, 
peasants' income has increased slowly, and their enthusiasm for 
grain production has been dampened. 2) Agricultural investment 
is insufficient. This year, merely a small amount of the funds 
for agricultural capital construction and the special funds for 
supporting rural production was in place, and large amounts of 
credit funds were used in non-agricultural trades, thus 
affecting the construction of basic agricultural facilities and 
weakening the capacity for sustained agricultural development. 
3) The rural production setup was adjusted slowly, the quality 
and variety of farm products did not meet market demand, and, in 
particular, processing of farm and sideline products aiming at 
increasing their value was stagnant, thus affecting the increase 
of peasants' income. 4) In institutional reform, some localities 
improperly stopped financial support to agrotechnical 
dissemination organs or diverted their personnel to other fields 
of work. As a result, the contingent of agricultural scientific 
and technical personnel is not stable, and agricultural 
scientific research and technology dissemination do not meet the 
needs in developing high-yield, good- quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture. 5) Leading comrades of some 
localities do not attach sufficient importance to agriculture 
and rural work, nor exercise effective leadership over them. In 
doing work, they gave more consideration to cities and industry 
than to rural areas and agriculture and neglected agriculture. 
Liaoning is a large industrial province, and half of its 
population lives in cities. How its agriculture is developed 
has a direct bearing on the entire economic situation. If we do 
not continue to strengthen the fundamental position of 
agriculture and adopt effective measures to address the 
above-mentioned problems, agricultural development and even the 
regular operation of the entire national economy will be 
affected. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "Agriculture is the 
foundation, and we must not forget this." We should have a 
thorough understanding of this, and implement this instruction 
resolutely. 
  We should fully understand that strengthening the 
fundamental 
position of agriculture is an important content of and effective 
guarantee for Liaoning's "second pioneering program." Carrying 
out the "second pioneering program" and making the old 
industrial base regain its vigor and magnificence is a strategic 
policy decision made by the people across the province after 
they conscientiously studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important 
speeches given during his south China inspection tour, 
continuously enhanced understanding of the provincial situation, 
and learned form the successful experiences of other localities. 
To regain Liaoning's magnificence, we should not only develop 
the original advantages of state-owned large and medium-size 
exercise but, we should also greatly cultivate new growing 
points of the economy, including developing high-yield, 
good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture and township 
enterprises, in order to form new advantages. 
  The 
tremendous changes in agriculture and rural economy over the 
past few years have created conditions for accelerating the 
whole province's economic development, and laid a foundation for 
conducting the "second pioneering program," and, in particular, 
creating a favorable objective environment for invigorating the 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. As all people 
are aware, state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises failed 
to find a successful path in areas like the implementation of 
the family-based output-related contracting in the rural areas 
under the influence of factors of the unitary planned economy 
and the urban economy, so that 70 percent of the enterprises 
failed to be invigorated, so that even while some became good or 
fairly good, they were extremely unstable, and thus became a 
major and difficult point for our province's economic 
development and structural reform. Our strenuous efforts are 
needed to speed up the change of operational mechanisms through 
deepened reforms and to expand investment strength to expedite 
technological transformation. This requires not only an 
exploration process, but also sufficient input of funds. 
However, for a long time, the state has collected excessive 
amounts of profits from state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises, reducing profits retained by most enterprises to 
its lowest point. In 1990, the average per-capita profit 
retention was only 217 yuan, making it difficult for enterprises 
to maintain even simple production processes, not to mention 
technological transformation. Therefore, we proposed a series 
of policies to provide water for raising fish and to allow large 
and medium-sized enterprises to rest and build up their strength 
to accelerate readjustment and speed up transformation in an 
effort to conserve financial resources, and tried our utmost to 
put them into practice. In 1992 and 1993, we did not correct 
even a single cent of the profits earned by budgetary industrial 
enterprises across the province, and allowed enterprises to keep 
all the profits. In addition to the implementation of the 
input-output overall contracting system and tax refund, profit 
retention was as high as some 7 billion yuan. Where can we get 
the money under the situation in which the financial department 
must gradually increase its annual rigid expenditure? Thanks to 
the bid development of township enterprises and other non-state 
economic sectors, we increased financial revenues in the 
localities. Otherwise, it is impossible for us to achieve this. 
Therefore, at the central economic work conference of eight 
north China and northeast China provinces, cities and region, I 
briefed General Secretary Jiang Zemin that this is called "not 
digging a well until one is thirsty." If not, we have no money 
for conducting technological transformation in state-owned, 
large and medium-sized enterprises. If we fail to conduct 
transformation, a considerable number of enterprises may fall. 
Then, we will commit a historical mistake, be ashamed to face 
our predecessors and to brief later generations. So, we can say 
that developing agriculture and rural economy, township 
enterprises, in particular, in no way contradicts the 
invigoration of large and medium-sized enterprises. In a 
situation in which most state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises have not been successfully managed, if we fail to 
achieve great economic development in rural areas and still 
depend on begging for food and meat from other places, it will 
be difficult to maintain social stability, and the entire 
national economy will suffer one disaster after another. We 
should not simply pay attention to large and medium-sized 
enterprises. We must study and consider the overall economic 
situation of the whole province while correctly handling the 
relationship between the urban and the rural areas and between 
industry and agriculture, and trying by all possible means to 
invigorate large and medium-sized enterprises, we should also 
actively cultivate such new economic growing points as high- 
efficiency farming, township enterprises, as well as individual 
and private economic sectors in an effort to strengthen local 
financial strength, reduce financial delivery pressure of 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, enable the 
implementation of state- stipulated policies on supporting large 
and medium-sized enterprises, and create conditions for 
invigorating them. Therefore, it is impossible to conduct the 
second pioneering program, rejuvenate the old industrial base, 
and revitalize Liaoning without agricultural development, 
invigoration of rural economy, and agricultural support. 
  We should fully understand that to deepen reform and open 
wider to the outside world, we should stabilize agriculture all 
the more so as to stabilize society. The third plenary session 
of the 14th party Central Committee drew up the basic framework 
for China to establish the socialist market economy system. The 
"decision" it adopted is the program of action for us to deepen 
reform in various fields. The implementation of the various 
reform measures and opening wider to the outside world require 
good external conditions and a stable social environment. This 
depends on the steady development of agriculture and the 
effective supply of farm products. Since the beginning of this 
year, urban and rural markets as well as people's feeling have 
been comparatively stable despite the rather large increase in 
price index. This should be attributed to the good agricultural 
situation, the ample supplies of farm and sideline products, and 
the thriving urban and rural markets in addition to the increase 
in people's income and their increased mental guard against 
price fluctuation. Even a slight slackening of efforts in 
agriculture and rural work will bring adverse influences on the 
market, people's lives, social stability, and even the endeavors 
of deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and 
establishing the socialist market economy system. Therefore, we 
must overcome the tendency of neglecting agriculture when the 
agricultural and rural situation is good. The better the 
agricultural and rural situation, the more we should remain 
clear- headed. 
  3. Carry Out Work in a Down-To-Earth Manner and Facilitate 
New Progress in Agriculture and Rural Economy 
  Next year will be the year for comprehensive implementation 
of the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee to expedite the process of establishing the 
socialist market economy system and also one to continuously 
maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. 
What are the targets of Liaoning's rural work and how should we 
attain the target? This is a question this conference should 
clarify. 
  Based on the guidelines of the national rural work 
conference 
and the actual conditions of the province, the provincial party 
committee and government decided, after study, that from next 
year and until the end of their tenure, Liaoning's rural work 
should aim at substantially increasing peasants' income and 
county-level revenues. Increasing peasants' income is the core 
of the current issues on agriculture, rural areas, and peasants. 
Thanks to rapid agricultural development, peasants' net income 
increased by 400 yuan in Liaoning from 1988 to 1993, showing an 
average annual increase of 9.5 percent. Allowing for price 
rises, however, the actual increase was merely 1.56 percent. If 
peasants suffer a sluggish increase of income and lack 
purchasing power, rural markets will not become brisk, it will 
be difficult to expand the market capacity of industrial 
products, and peasants' investment in production is bound to 
decline. As a result, the target to achieve a fairly 
comfortable standard of living will be difficult to attain. 
Increasing county- level revenues is a key issue concerning 
Liaoning's economic development and social progress. Last year, 
among the 65 counties (cities) and suburban districts in the 
province, those whose revenues exceeded 100 million yuan 
numbered merely six, and those whose revenues were less than 20 
million yuan numbered 15, including some whose revenues were 
merely about 10 million or 8 million. Thirty of the 45 counties 
and county-level cities in the province relied on financial 
subsidies, which totaled 391 million yuan a year. Without 
changing such a situation, it will be difficult to develop the 
county-level economy and achieve sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development of the province. Peasants' net income 
should be increased to 1,800 yuan, an average annual increase of 
over 5 percent within this government's tenure, thus achieving a 
fairly comfortable standard of living ahead of schedule; and 
one- third of the 65 counties (cities) and suburban districts 
should increase their revenues to over 100 million yuan, and the 
rest should double their 1992 revenue figures. This is another 
grand objective in Liaoning's agricultural development in the 
new situation to establish the socialist market economy system 
and is an arduous historical task. 
  Next year is the first year to realize this magnificent 
goal. It is extremely important to have a good beginning. 
Major targets for next year's agriculture and rural economy 
are: Gross grain output should be stabilized at 15 million 
tonnes or more; total output of meat, eggs, milk, and aquatic 
products should reach 4.04 million tonnes, up by 10 percent over 
this year's figure; fruit output should reach 2.3 million 
tonnes, up by 10 percent; total output value of township and 
town enterprises should surpass 200 billion yuan, up by 42.9 
percent; the net per capita income of peasants should reach 
1,250 yuan, 150 yuan more than this year's figure; and financial 
revenues at the county level should also have a substantial 
increase. In line with this fighting goal, the general guiding 
ideology for next year's agriculture and rural economic work is: 
Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, we should profoundly implement the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; should energetically 
develop the high-output, fine-quality, and high- efficient 
agriculture, with the establishment of the socialist market 
economic structure as the goal, with markets as the guidance, 
and with efficiency as the central link, on the premise of never 
neglecting grain production; and should positively develop 
secondary and tertiary industries, with township and town 
enterprises as the mainstay, and accelerate the modernization of 
agriculture and the industrialization and urbanization of the 
countryside in an effort to make the rural economy flourish in 
all fields. 
  We may meet many difficulties in implementing the 
above-mentioned guiding ideology and in materializing the 
above-mentioned goal. We maintain, however, that favorable 
conditions are more than difficulties. First, the development 
of agriculture and the rural economy has already brought forth a 
good mechanism, and this kind of mechanism will show an even 
greater vitality in accelerating the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure. Second, the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council have recently adopted another 
series of major policies and measures that are conducive to 
developing agriculture and the rural economy, and these policies 
and measures will surely further mobilize the initiative of the 
vast numbers of peasants and the cadres at the grass-roots 
level. Third, the train of thought concerning the development 
of agriculture and the rural economy has been even clearer. So 
long as we firmly and unswervingly march forward, we will surely 
be able to win a new victory in developing agriculture and the 
rural economy. Fourth, over the past several years, a good 
foundation has already been laid for the development of 
agriculture and the rural economy, bumper harvests have been 
reaped in agriculture for four years running, five trades have 
been brisk in the vast countryside, forestry, animal husbandry, 
sideline production, and fishery have developed completely, a 
historical breakthrough has been made in developing township and 
town enterprises, the construction of infrastructure has been 
accelerated in the countryside, financial revenues of counties 
and townships have increased continuously, and the material 
condition for accelerating the development of agriculture and 
the rural economy has been better than that in any other period. 
Fifth, market prices have good prospects, prices of all grain 
and foodstuffs have been decontrolled, and, in particular, the 
state will raise the procuring prices of grain next year. 
Therefore, peasants' enthusiasm in production will be enhanced 
further. Sixth, through the endeavor in the past several years, 
the province has already witnessed a number of good examples 
that we can learn from and use as a reference. So long as we 
conscientiously summarize and energetically spread their 
experiences, we can bring along the extensive development of the 
rural economy throughout the province. Seventh, natural 
conditions are better than those in previous years. Reservoirs 
in the province have stored more water than in the past. Since 
the beginning of this winter, the province has experienced many 
successive snowfalls. The land of Liaoning is covered with 
silver snow, promising a bumper harvest next year. So long as 
we make full use of these favorable conditions and make great 
efforts to surmount difficulties, it can be affirmed that our 
province will have another excellent situation in agriculture 
and the rural economy next year. For this, we should have full 
confidence. 
First, we should take markets as a guidance to vigorously 
develop high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient 
agriculture. New demands have been set on agriculture in the 
course of setting up the socialist market structure. We should 
conscientiously study the influence over the province's farm and 
sideline products by the reform measures that will be worked out 
by the state next year as well as the changes in the domestic 
and foreign markets' needs for farm and sideline products. 
Oriented by the macroeconomic policies and market demands and 
closely in line with the target of increasing economic results 
and increasing revenues, we should accelerate the readjustment 
of the cropping, breeding, and farm and sideline product 
processing industrial structures and vigorously develop 
high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture. 
  On the premise of stabilizing grain production, we should 
positively develop a diversified economy. To ensure "the supply 
of sufficient food," our province should steadily turn out more 
than 15 million tons of grain. This target must not be changed. 
To stabilize grain production, we should mainly follow the way 
of increasing per unit yield and increasing total output. We 
should gradually increase the overall grain production 
capability by strengthening farmland capital construction, 
developing water irrigated areas, popularizing plastic-film 
covering techniques, improving soil quality, standardize the 
farm work with improved varieties, and rising multiple cropping 
targets. We should widen the field of vision to develop a 
diversified economy; persist in the overall development of 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery as well as 
the overall management of the primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industries; link science with industry and trade; and follow the 
path of large-scale agriculture. It is necessary to readjust 
the farm cropping structure and reform the cropping system. 
Particularly, the areas in the southern and western parts of the 
province should fully use the favorable conditions created by 
this winter's increased snowfalls to appropriately control and 
reduce paddy rice sown areas, to expand wheat sown areas, and to 
intercrop wheat and soybeans. By so doing, will we not only 
reduce water consumption and alleviate the southern areas' 
strain on water supply but also regulate the province's grain 
varieties, solve the problems of having surplus rice and 
insufficient wheat and lacking soybeans, and avoid creating the 
disasters due to "autumn drought." In this way, the peasants 
will also increase their income. Next year, the province should 
ensure 4 million mu of wheat sown areas and strive to reach 4.5 
million mu. It is necessary to continuously develop the 
production of protected areas, garden-based economy, and 
ecological agriculture. To develop forestry, we should combine 
long-term efficiency with short-term efficiency and gradually 
increase the income of forest farmers. According to the market 
demands and in line with the principle of planting different 
trees on different types of areas, the areas with a slope of 25 
degrees or below should develop economic forests, vigorously 
develop fresh and dried fruit trees, replace forests by fruit, 
and unify the social benefits with the environment benefits and 
the economic efficiency. In particular, we should make 
unswerving efforts to plant trees along both sides of the 
mountain slopes of the Shenyang-Dalian Expressway. The areas 
around cities should plant more coniferous trees and broad leaf 
trees to make them green and beautiful. It is necessary to 
quicken the pace of building "Liaoning on the sea." We should 
fully use such natural resources as having long coastal lines, 
more beaches, and vast sea areas to vigorously develop the sea 
breeding industry and to positively and steadily develop the 
deep-sea fishing industry so as to enhance the export and 
foreign exchange earning capability. We should strengthen the 
breeding, popularization, and import of famous, special, new, 
and high-quality animals and plants; vigorously increase the 
number of quality farm products; and quicken the development of 
non-polluted foodstuffs. We should vigorously develop the 
intensive and precision processing of farm and sideline products 
and increase their value and economic results. Now, the 
province's processed farm products account for a small 
proportion, the quality of farm products is poor, and the 
storage and fresh maintenance quality is low, and the package is 
not exquisite. The primary products account for 70 percent of 
the total farm products exported through foreign trade. 
Therefore, we should change as soon as possible the situation 
that only primary farm products are exported. We should 
introduce foreign advanced techniques to upgrade the intensive 
and precision processing of farm and sideline products and 
enhance the ability in competition on the domestic and foreign 
markets. It is necessary to further develop agriculture with 
foreign exchange earnings. The foreign trade departments and 
the enterprises for exporting farm and sideline products should 
strengthen the contacts with the peasants, provide information 
and technological service for the peasants, vigorously pioneer 
foreign markets, and send increasingly more farm products to 
international markets. We should strengthen the setup of export 
bases and special plants, share risks and benefits with the 
peasants, and develop the economy where trade, industry, and 
agriculture are united as one. 
  Second, we should deepen rural reform and improve the rural 
operating system. We should continue to stabilize and improve 
the household-based output-related contract responsibility 
system. We should encourage peasants to increase investment to 
improve the productivity of land. The term of land contracts 
should be extended another 30 years. Public bidding may be 
adopted in developing the resources of wasteland, and the term 
of the contract may be extended another 50 years. Within the 
term of the contract, the contracted land will not be increased 
or reduced no matter if personnel are increased. Compensated 
transfer of land use right is permitted. 
  On the premise that the responsibility system with 
household- 
based output-related contract as the major form is stabilized 
and improved, we should popularize the operations adaptable to 
scaled economy in line with specific local conditions and as 
long as peasants' desires are fully respected in the localities 
where the secondary and tertiary industries are fairly developed 
and labor forces have transferred and enjoy a stable income, 
especially the southern area of Liaoning where township 
enterprises are fairly developed. Localities where conditions 
permit should greatly advocate the system of unified farming and 
separate management. We should accelerate the reform of the 
managerial system of state-run farms to meet the needs in 
establishing the socialist market economy system. In livestock 
breeding, we should actively popularize large- scale and 
intensive management and support the development of large grain 
and livestock growing households. 
  We should greatly develop the cooperative shareholding 
system. We should make full use of Liaoning's advantage of large 
amounts of rural savings deposits to guide peasants to increase 
investment in production, especially in the secondary and 
tertiary industries, and develop the cooperative shareholding 
economy. Making use of their transportation, resources, and 
human power advantages, many localities in our province have 
accumulated considerable funds through development of the 
diversified economy. We should actively guide peasants to 
invest in the secondary and tertiary industries, with township 
enterprises as the mainstay, to expand production. We should 
encourage peasants to invest with the land, fruit trees, 
mountain areas, and forests they have contracted as well as 
their own labor service, funds, and technology to establish 
cooperative shareholding farms, orchards, forest farms, and 
enterprises with integrated trade, industrial, and agricultural 
management. 
  Third, we should intensify construction of agricultural 
basic 
facilities, achieve success in comprehensive agricultural 
development, and improve the conditions for agricultural 
production. Intensifying construction of agricultural basic 
facilities is a matter concerning the sustained development and 
long-term stability of agriculture, and it should be carried out 
successfully. We should put construction of agricultural basic 
facilities in an equally important position as energy, 
transportation, important raw materials, and other basic 
industries and should continue to increase investment in it. 
Water conservation is the basic industry of the national 
economy, and we should attach adequate importance to it. We 
should continue harnessing large, medium, and small rivers 
successfully and accelerate the development of water resources 
to meet the needs in agricultural development. Intensifying 
construction of farmland capital construction is an important 
part of the endeavor to improve the conditions for agricultural 
production. We should continue the "Dayu Cup" emulation 
activities in farmland capital construction. At present, we 
should give particular attention to building the supporting 
facilities for bridges, culverts, and sluice gate stations to 
improve their drainage capacity. We should step up the 
equipment renewal and technical transformation of large- and 
medium-sized irrigation and drainage stations and the facilities 
of irrigated areas and develop irrigated areas. Power 
facilities for agricultural use are old and not safe, which not 
only waste energy resources but also increase the burden on 
peasants. We should adopt measures to replace their equipment 
and technically transform them step by step and manage them 
well. Developing rural communication and transportation is an 
important guarantee for enlivening the economy and making 
peasants prosper. We should continue to step up construction of 
county and township road networks to build 2,488 km of asphalt 
roads and transform 1,154 km of roadbeds next year to change the 
backward transportation of Liaoning's rural areas, especially 
economically less developed areas. We should speed up the rural 
postal and telecommunications undertakings and accomplish the 
"2127" project on schedule. We should continue to improve the 
ecological environment focusing on tree planting and water and 
soil conservation. We should make early preparations against 
drought and floods next year and enhance our capacity for 
resisting natural disasters. 
  We should do a better job in comprehensive agricultural 
development. In line with the demand of industrialization, we 
should engage in serial development of superior industries and 
leading products, give priority to grasping integrated serial 
development of seven superior industries and a batch of leading 
products, including grain (animal feeds), animal husbandry, 
aquatic products, forestry and timber, dried fruits and 
medicinal herbs industries, and enable rural economy to become 
more specialized, commercialized and socialized. Based on 
comprehensive agricultural development, we should make overall 
arrangements for all sorts of funds and use them in a 
concentrated manner in an effort to raise the effect of the use 
of funds. We should expedite the pace of comprehensive 
agricultural development in Liaohe delta, and raise its 
comprehensive production capacity. It is necessary to build 
high-yield, fine-quality, and highly-efficient farming 
demonstration zones, give priority to planting fine varieties of 
crops that reflect the new achievements of agricultural science 
and technology, and raise the scientific content of agricultural 
products. We should select the best places for building 
scientific and technological agricultural development parks and 
develop new- technology agricultural industries through policy 
guidance, input of science and technology, the support of funds, 
and other measures in an effort to stimulate the transformation 
of traditional farming, and promote regional economic 
invigoration. We should unceasingly improve the service system 
closely-related with agriculture, such as popularization of 
technology, cultivation of fine strains, livestock inoculation, 
vegetation conservation, meteorology, and farm machinery. 
  Fourth, we should actively implement the strategy of 
invigorating agriculture through science and education, and 
invigorate the rural economy. Relying on scientific and 
technological progress, combining agricultural science with 
education, and raising the quality of peasants is the 
fundamental way for invigorating the rural economy. While 
strengthening basic research, we should place the emphasis of 
science and technology agricultural work on accelerating the 
application of scientific and technological achievements. The 
agricultural scientific research units should be eager to help 
and meet the needs of agricultural production, and should 
actively organize scientific research units to tackle difficult 
problems and serve the development of production in line with 
the difficult tasks in the course of production and 
developoment. At present, we should concentrate energy on 
popularizing high and new technology in the agricultural sector, 
continue to implement the "123" project, the spark plan, and the 
good harvest program, and raise the scientific and technical 
level of the agricultural sector. 
  We should strengthen the building of agricultural technology 
popularization and service system. The agricultural technology 
popularization organs in townships and towns are a component of 
the state agricultural technology popularization organs, 
shouldering the heavy task of guiding agricultural development 
and popularizing advanced technology; township agricultural 
technology popularization personnel have been working on the 
forefront to implement the strategy of invigorating agriculture 
with science and education, shouldering the heavy responsibility 
of directly disseminating agricultural technology to peasants 
and raising the scientific and technical level of agriculture. 
Therefore, in the course of organizational reform, we must not 
simply "transfer them to other places," or make them "disconnect 
their relations with agricultural organs." In line with the 
agricultural technology popularization law, all localities 
should make use of the winter slack season to do a conscientious 
job in resuming, consolidating, and raising all agricultural 
stations in townships and towns, and keep this contingent 
stable. We must not reduce working fund in this aspect but 
strive to gradually increase it if possible. 
  We should fully mobilize the enthusiasm of agricultural 
science workers. It is necessary to award agricultural 
scientific and technical personnel who have made achievements in 
scientific research and popularization, and give handsome awards 
to those whose achievement is outstanding. Regarding some 
agricultural science and technology projects, we should clearly 
define the method of collecting withholdings and giving awards 
according to a definite proportion of economic results as soon 
as the projects begin so as to raise the transparency of the 
work, guarantee the implementation of the projects, and mobilize 
the enthusiasm and creativity of scientific and technical 
personnel to the maximum. We should continue to make overall 
planning for agricultural science and educational work, 
strengthen technical training for township and village cadres as 
well as peasants, extensively conduct the "project of issuing 
green certificates to peasants," raise the ability of township 
cadres in leading the economy, and enhance the quality of 
laborers. It is necessary to accelerate the readjustment of 
rural education, optimize the distribution of schools, reduce 
the number of above-quota teachers, increase educational input 
through various channels, and be determined to solve the problem 
of delaying the payment of wages for teachers prior to the end 
of this year. Economically developed localities should encourage 
prosperous peasants to invest in education. 
  Fifth, we should persist in increasing agricultural input 
through various channels. Peasants are the mainstay of 
agricultural input. We should continue to give play to the 
vitality and role created by the "two mutual complementary 
efficiencies" brought by the implementation of the new mechanism 
of the family- based output-related contracting system since 
rural reform, induce and encourage peasants to develop 
diversified undertakings, develop township enterprises, and 
increase agricultural input. Governments at all levels should 
conscientiously implement the stipulation mentioned in the 
"agricultural law" that the "increase of agricultural investment 
from the state financial department should be higher than the 
increase of regular income of the local financial department," 
and ensure that the financial budgetary funds for supporting 
agriculture will increase annually. In capital construction 
investment, we should gradually increase the proportion of 
investment in agriculture; and in next year's loans, we should 
ensure that the scale of agricultural loans will be greatly 
increased over the previous year. The provincial, city and 
county levels should further perfect and improve the system of 
establishing agricultural development funds, and the relevant 
provincial departments should step up efforts to formulate 
methods for collecting and managing the funds. Meanwhile, we 
should boldly use foreign capital, raise the level of 
investment, and carry out developmental agriculture. 
  Sixth, we should continue to develop township enterprises. 
From the aforementioned analysis of the rural economic 
situation, we can easily discover that the rapid development of 
the national economy of the whole province during the past few 
years should be attributed to the rapid development of township 
enterprises. Actively developing township enterprises has become 
a major issue affecting the province's overall economic 
situation and having a direct bearing on agricultural stability 
and development. In the past, we summarized the status and role 
of township enterprises from 10 aspects, such as promoting the 
prosperity of peasants, accelerating economic structural 
readjustment, urging large and medium-sized state-owned 
enterprises to change mechanism, improving the financially 
difficult situation of counties and townships, and promoting the 
building of spiritual civilizations, regarded these as a most 
important growing point of our province's economy, and called on 
township enterprises to take the lead in jumping to a new stage. 
Practice has proved that this major move is absolutely correct. 
We should uphold these major guiding thoughts, continue to 
implement the principle of "paying attention to the advanced 
units so as to make improvements and paying attention to those 
lagging behind so as to promote an even development," and 
implement the new "221" demonstration project on the basis of 
completing the "221 project" ahead of schedule. This means that 
we must devote four to five years to building 20 counties 
(cities and districts) whose township enterprises each has a 
total output value of more than 5 billion yuan, of which, 10 
should exceed 10 billion yuan; 200 townships and towns whose 
township enterprises each has a total output value of more than 
300 million yuan, of which, 100 townships should exceed 500 
million yuan; and 1,000 villages whose township enterprises each 
has an output value of more than 50 million yuan, of which, 100 
should exceed 200 million yuan. Counties, townships, and 
villages which have been listed as demonstration projects should 
simultaneously increase the development rate and economic 
efficiency, and make the development rate, the profits, and tax 
delivery show an average annual increase of more than 25 
percent, 20 percent, and 15 percent, respectively. Areas where 
township enterprises have a good foundation, and have rapidly 
developed should exert efforts to readjust the structure, raise 
the grade, and increase efficiency. 1) We should march toward 
high and new technology. Comrade Feng Jiazhi from Xiaozhaizi 
has proposed that it is necessary to shift the production of the 
existing products of low technical content to other localities, 
and concentrate efforts on developing products of high technical 
content as well as high and new-tech products. This orientation 
is correct. Nowadays, science and technology have progressed 
and developed with giant strides. Township enterprises must 
catch up with this situation. 2) We should march toward 
economies of scale. Actively developing enterprise 
associations, forming a new advantage of enterprise groups and 
encouraging and supporting township enterprises with financial 
strength to county seats or even to cities to merge with, rent 
or buy medium-sized and small state-owned enterprises, or to buy 
shares from large state-owned enterprises may help township 
enterprises not only to open a vast world for development but 
also to create a new path for state-owned enterprises to change 
mechanism, so as to form a new pattern under which large 
enterprises bring along small ones, small enterprises stimulate 
large ones, and the urban areas and rural areas exert joint 
efforts to develop themselves. 3) We should march toward the 
international market, raise the level of township enterprises in 
creating foreign exchange through exports. According to 
analyses from relevant departments, our province's increase in 
foreign exchange through export has not been swift this year. It 
is lower than Shandong, Jiangsu, and Guangdong Provinces. The 
disparity is mainly caused by the export of products of township 
enterprises. So, we must exert strenuous efforts to develop 
export-oriented township enterprises. 4) We should march toward 
intensive management and combine township enterprise development 
with construction of small cities and towns. Relying on small 
cities and towns to develop concentrations of township 
enterprises helps to reduce investment of resources, land, and 
infrastructural facilities; to promote information exchanges, 
material distribution, shaping of the market, technology 
dissemination, and pollution control; and to produce 
polyreaction to increase the competitive edges of products. 
Meanwhile, it will also help to increase the economic strength 
of small cities and towns, accelerate their development, and 
facilitate the progress of the urbanization of rural areas. All 
localities should make overall plans and reasonable arrangements 
to develop the concentration of township enterprises and use 
this to promote the construction of small cities and towns in 
order to provide even better conditions and environment for the 
development of township enterprises. Localities where the 
foundation for township enterprises is poor and the development 
is slow should pool the efforts of various sectors, adopt even 
more flexible policies, and create a more relaxed environment to 
accelerate development. They should emancipate the mind 
further, remove obstacles, relax policies, and improve service 
to develop private and individual sectors of the economy in 
particular. Localities where township enterprise development is 
sluggish must achieve a notable breakthrough and progress next 
year. 
  We should deepen the reform of township enterprises. An 
important reason for the unexpectedly rapid development of 
township enterprises lies in their mechanism that meets the 
needs of the market economy. In some township enterprises, 
however, there are also confused relations in property right and 
the "regression" of mechanisms. Some towns, townships, and 
villages ask township enterprises for the money and materials 
they need. If such a situation continues, township enterprises 
are bound to collapse! We should resolutely change this 
situation, never turn township enterprises into the subordinates 
or private coffers of town and township governments, and never 
change township enterprises' flexible operating mechanism and 
turn them into "second state-run" enterprises. We should 
conscientiously enforce the "regulations" on township 
enterprises, strictly implement the regulations on the profit 
distribution of township enterprises, and prohibit 
indiscriminate transfer of township enterprises assets. We 
should raise the level of enterprises' accumulation funds to 
enhance their ability for technical transformation and 
development and strictly enforce the regulations on subsidizing, 
supporting, and developing agriculture. 
<H5>  4. Conscientiously Strengthen Leadership Over Agriculture </H5>
and Rural Work 
  In the new situation in which the socialist market economy 
system is to be established, agriculture is the production 
restricted by natural conditions and market risks. Such special 
production requires that we conscientiously strengthen 
leadership over agriculture and rural work. 
  We should include agriculture and rural work in our agenda 
and extend leadership over them. Not only should the localities 
where agriculture accounts for a large proportion attach 
importance to agriculture, but also the localities where 
industry accounts for a large proportion and large industrial 
cities have more favorable conditions to and should make 
agriculture and rural economy still better. Not only the 
leaders in charge of agriculture but also top party and 
government leaders should pay attention to the rural economy. 
Not only should we make rural work successful when there are 
numerous problems in agricultural production, but also we should 
strengthen rural work when the agricultural situation is good; 
and, when developing agriculture, not only should we develop 
grain production, but also we should develop township 
enterprises, the diversified economy, and the processing of 
materials to increase their value, on the premise that grain 
production is stabilized, so as to achieve high yield, good 
quality, and high efficiency. In short, all localities and all 
levels should, at all times, conscientiously put agriculture in 
the fundamental position of the national economy, develop it 
with unremitting efforts, and never, in the slightest degree, 
slacken efforts in it. Counties and townships, in particular, 
must devote major efforts to agricultural production and rural 
economic work. As I have said, leaders who do not understand 
rural areas, agriculture, and peasants cannot be regarded as 
all-round good leaders. We should use this as the criterion to 
judge the work of a city. 
  We should positively guide and organize the peasants to 
enter markets. In developing the socialist market economy, the 
government does not lighten but even enhances its responsibility 
for leading agriculture. The new situation requires us to 
quicken the change of functions. The governments should change, 
in a step-by- step manner, the sets of administrative means and 
methods by pressing the peasants to engage in planting and 
harvesting, combating disasters, and providing relief to 
disastrous areas into the methods of offering market 
information, economic policies, and economic levers to the 
peasants and guiding and organizing them to engage in production 
and management according to market demands so as to eliminate 
the current contradictions between the decentralized management 
of the households and large-scale circulation and large- scale 
markets. So far, the peasants have paid attention to and 
entered markets. However, they still cannot use the functions 
of market mechanisms or handle affairs according to the economic 
law. This year, fruit growers in Dalian city miscalculated the 
market situation and waited for the right prices to sell the 
local apples. As a result, lots of Shandong's apples have 
occupied Dalian's market. We should draw this kind of lessons. 
According to the thinking that the governments cultivate 
markets, markets guide production, and production suits markets, 
we should strengthen the setup of the 
trade-industrial-agricultural integrated management 
organizations. We should organize and set up planting-breeding- 
processing coordinate management entities to form advantageous 
industries and key products, promote the development of bases 
with advantageous industries and key products, enable the bases 
to establish contacts with the peasants, and send the peasants 
to markets. We should strengthen the setup of grain, vegetable, 
aquatic product, ginseng specialized markets and farm and 
sideline product wholesale markets to enliven the circulation of 
farm products and to promote production. We should strengthen 
the setup of socialized service systems; provide the peasants 
with service before, during, and after production; guide 
decentralized management and the combination of the peasants 
with market demands; and make farm products and processed farm 
products become readily marketable. 
  We should support grain production areas and 
poverty-stricken 
areas to develop the economy. The problem that the areas with 
high output of grain are hit by poverty has constantly been 
prominent. We should fully notice that under the socialist 
market economic conditions, various kinds of production factors 
will more easily be distributed to the areas with high 
efficiency. Therefore, the grain production areas where social 
benefits are high and their own benefits are low absolutely need 
the government support. We should vigorously support main grain 
production areas to develop precision and intensive processing 
of farm products. The departments concerned should first 
support them in regard to the arrangement of projects and the 
collection of funds. The province and cities should 
appropriately give priorities to the main grain production areas 
when arranging some key construction and technological 
transformation projects so as to gradually change their 
unreasonable industrial structure and low economic results. We 
should exert efforts to enliven the circulation of main grain 
production areas, give priority to the distribution and 
transportation of their grain, and strengthen the construction 
of the facilities to store up and dry grain in the sun. We 
should untie the grain "debt chains" in line with the method of 
adding overdue fines and interests so as to protect and mobilize 
the enthusiasm of main grain production bases. 
  Over the past years, our province has made great 
achievements 
in supporting the poor and the poverty-stricken areas have 
basically had sufficient food and clothes. Under the new 
situation of building the socialist market economic system, the 
problems due to the uneven development of the regional economy 
still become more serious. These are the problems cropping up 
in the course of advance. The governments at various levels 
should pay high attention to this. The faster the economy 
develops, the more we should support the poor. The governments 
at various levels should mobilize their internal vitality, 
upgrade their self-development functions, study and work out 
support-the-poor measures, and quicken the pace of eliminating 
poverty and seeking wealth. 
  We should intensify the protection, regulation, and control 
of agriculture. It is impossible for agricultural production to 
compete with other production on an equal footing because it has 
great risks and comparable low profits. Therefore, government 
support and protection are necessary. 1) The work to reduce the 
burdens on peasants should not be shaken. Measures for this 
work have won great popular support and yielded good results 
and, therefore, should be continued. 2) Resolute efforts should 
be made to prevent issuance of IOU's during purchases of farm 
products. We have done a pretty good job this year, and 
peasants are fairly satisfied. Banks, finance departments, and 
grain enterprises should please make continued efforts in the 
supplies of funds for the purchases. 3) Efforts should be made 
to ensure the payment to cover the price difference in the 
purchases of chemical fertilizers and diesel oil linked to the 
grain purchasing contract. 4) We should protect the limited 
cultivated land, establish the basic farmland protection system 
as soon as possible, strictly control the use of land for 
non-agricultural purposes, and adopt effective reclamation and 
compensation methods to control the use of large amounts of 
cultivated land. 5) Efforts should be made to carry out 
agricultural insurance in line with specific conditions and 
improve the agricultural risk compensation mechanism. In 
essence, to protect agriculture is to protect the interests of 
peasants. Governments at all levels should sternly investigate 
and handle all cases that damage the interests of peasants to 
protect and boost peasants' production enthusiasm. We should 
strengthen local governments' capacity to regulate and control 
agricultural development. A particularly important task for the 
present is to establish the local grain reserve system as soon 
as possible and develop a multi-level reserve system 
participated in by the central and local authorities as well as 
peasants. We should establish the grain risk foundation. 
Finance departments at all levels should use the reduced amount 
of subsidies resulting from lifting of grain price control as 
the grain risk foundation and development foundation and no 
other purposes. We should deepen the reform of rural credit 
cooperatives and establish rural cooperative banks to collect 
funds and provide better service to rural economic development. 
  We should change work styles, go to the grass-roots level to 
continuously study and address the new conditions and new 
problems in rural economic development. Problems of one kind or 
another are bound to emerge in rural economic development 
following the establishment of the socialist market economy 
system and the deepening of rural reform. These problems, plus 
the old ones, will make new and old contradictions intertwine, 
increase work amount, and make our work more difficult. This 
requires that our leading comrades at all levels go to the 
grass-roots level and the masses to conduct investigation and 
study, pay attention to the major contradictions in rural 
economic development, and, in particular, study ways to properly 
resolve the new conditions and new problems emerging after the 
execution of a series of reform measures next year. Due to 
numerous factors, the prices of some staple and nonstaple foods 
have risen fairly substantially, thus bringing certain 
difficulties to urban people's life. The provincial government 
recently held a meeting on this work and sent a cable to lower 
levels to put forward some specific demands. Leading comrades 
at all levels should implement it well. In particular, they 
should adopt effective measures to help disaster- and 
poverty-stricken areas and loss-making enterprises arrange well 
the life of their people and workers so that they will spend the 
two large festivals happily. In line with the requirements of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council, we should 
implement to the letter the three tasks for opposing corruption 
and be determined to investigate and handle the major and 
serious cases like the ones committed by the Changtu County 
grain departments to enhance people's confidence in the 
anticorruption struggle. Leading comrades at all levels should 
take the lead in maintaining honesty and self-restraint and 
establish a good image among the masses, particularly during the 
New Year and Spring Festival periods. 
  Comrades! Liaoning's agriculture and rural economic 
development have entered a new stage, and the tasks we encounter 
are both arduous and glorious. Despite the numerous 
difficulties and contradictions on the road of advancement, we 
will be able to promote Liaoning's agriculture and rural economy 
to a new level and make contributions to the "second pioneering 
program" and to regaining Liaoning's magnificence as long as we 
earnestly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, implement the guidelines 
of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee, further emancipate the mind, deepen reform, uplift 
spirit, pioneer the way forward, and work in a down-to-earth 
manner.

  [Text] On 3 March, Zhang Huanwen, president of the Liaoning 
Provincial Higher People's Court, delivered "the work report of 
the provincial higher people's court" to the second session of 
the eighth provincial people's congress for examinations and 
discussions. 
  After reviewing the 1993 work done by the provincial higher 
people's court, he said: In 1993, under the leadership and 
supervision of the provincial party committee, the provincial 
people's congress standing committee, and the Supreme People's 
Court, the people's courts at various levels across the province 
persisted in the guiding ideology of setting up the socialist 
market economic system; made achievements in safeguarding the 
national political and social stability, promoting a fast 
economic development, and promoting the struggle against 
corruption; comprehensively strengthened the judicial work; made 
efforts to upgrade the law enforcement level; and better 
accomplished the judicial work tasks assigned by the party and 
the state. Over the past year, the courts at various levels 
across the province accepted and handled 248,080 cases of 
various categories, an increase of 3 percent over the previous 
year; and concluded 227,265 cases of various categories 
according to the constitution and the law, accounting for 4.5 
percent. Of this total, the courts concluded in first trials 
21,102 criminal cases, accounting for 9.3 percent; 119,612 civil 
cases, accounting for 52.6 percent; 44,827 cases of economic 
disputes, accounting for 19.7 percent; and 41,724 cases of 
appealing to higher courts and presenting cases in courts as 
well as administrative and executive criminal cases, accounting 
for 18.4 percent. The courts comprehensively launched the 
judicial activities according to laws, dealt blows to various 
criminal activities, protected the legal rights and interests of 
citizens and legal persons, readjusted the economic relations, 
and played a positive role in safeguarding social stability and 
promoting the deep development of reform and the setup of the 
socialist market economic system. 
  He reported, in detail, on the work in the following five 
aspects: 
1. We Dealt Strict Blows to the Criminal Activities of 
Jeopardizing Social Order and Safeguarded the Stability of the 
State and Society [subhead] 
  In 1993, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory 
on building a socialism with Chinese characteristics and with 
the general goal of setting up the socialist market economic 
system as set forth by the party Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as its core, we unswervingly deepened reform, 
expanded the scale of opening up, and maintained political 
stability, economic development, national unity, and social 
progress. Like the whole country, our province's situation was 
good. However, many problems still existed. The criminal cases 
judged by the courts last year were shown as follows: First, 
the serious criminal cases accounted for a large proportion. 
Last year, the courts across the province accepted and handled 
21,786 cases in first trials, a drop of 5.6 percent from the 
previous year and concluded 21,102 criminal cases in first 
trials, a drop of 5.3 percent. However, the extraordinarily 
serious criminal cases accounted for 42.2 percent of the total 
criminal cases. Second, the number of criminal gangs that 
brazenly looked down upon society increased. Last year, the 
courts across the province concluded 2,810 cases of crimes 
committed by gangs of criminals, accounting for 18.8 percent of 
the criminal cases that were concluded through first trials. In 
particular, some underworld criminal gangs appeared in 
succession and they brought about extremely serious damages to 
the social order. For instance, several cases committed by 
criminal gangs in Yixian County and the Xiuyan Man Nationality 
Autonomous County were tried. Third, the criminal cases of 
money embezzlement were comparatively concentrated. The theft, 
speculation, robbery, blackmailing, and economic criminal cases 
accounted for a considerably large proportion. Fourth, many 
all-round and serialized criminal cases took place. Some 
criminal offenders committed various kinds of crimes, such as 
looting, stealing, murdering, and kidnapping and blackmailing. 
  Social order directly affects the overall situation of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction as well as the 
setup of the socialist market economic system. So, social order 
has constantly been a hot-debated issue that the masses of the 
people have generally paid attention to. Therefore, in 
conducting the judicial work, the courts at various levels 
persistently implemented the principle of rapid and strict 
punishment and prominently dealt blows to criminal activities. 
A total of 21,313 criminals that produced legal effect were 
judged during the year. Of this, 1,052 were sentenced to death, 
to death with stay of execution, or to life imprisonment. Some 
59.1 percent of the criminals were sentenced to the imprisonment 
of five years or more. Four hundred and fifty large-scale 
public trials were held. This maintained the prestige and trend 
of the concentrative attacks. 
  Launching a special struggle to improve public security in 
a specific area is a successful experience for solving regional 
public security problems. Our province has a vast territory 
with coastal development zones, large inland cities, oil fields, 
mining areas, and some economically underdeveloped rural areas. 
Different public security problems have occurred at different 
times and in different localities. Cases of committing a crime 
with a gun, kidnapping, blackmailing, robbing rental cars, 
killing taxi drivers, and hiring someone to kill somebody have 
mostly happened in big cities; criminal gangs with the nature of 
underworld society which dominated a certain area have mostly 
appeared in rural areas, county seats, and towns; and cases on 
theft of industrial raw materials and damage of power facilities 
have mostly appeared in oil fields and mining areas. Courts in 
various localities defined the tasks for this special struggle 
in line with local conditions and effectively resolved the 
prominent public security problems in their localities in a 
timely manner. 
  The central authorities have clearly defined that in solving 
public security problems we must strengthen comprehensive public 
security management. During trials, courts at all levels 
persisted in implementing the comprehensive public security 
management system. First of all, they gave full play to their 
judicial functions and tried all kinds of cases in line with the 
law. They succeeded in maintaining social stability through 
trying criminal cases; properly handled the internal 
contradictions among the people and guarded against and reduced 
the number of crimes by trying civil, economic, and 
administrative cases; and eliminated destabilizing factors by 
doing a good job in handling lawsuits. Second, they 
appropriately extended judicial work. Through conducting open 
trials and trying and meting out punishment locally, courts at 
all levels succeeded in increasing the number of areas 
influenced by education on the legal system; strengthened the 
social effect of judicial work by establishing special 
collegiate benches for trying delinquents; strengthened the work 
of supervising and transforming criminals by visiting and 
investigating criminals who were placed under the control and 
temporary suspension of the execution of a sentence, or exempted 
from punishment; and resolved hosts of contradictions and 
disputes at the grass roots and eliminated crimes in the bud by 
intensifying the role of the people's courts. Third, they paid 
attention to expanding the social effect of judicial work. Last 
year courts at all levels printed over 100,000 copies of 
propaganda materials on typical cases and the legal system in 
the course of trials, gave 1,180 lectures on law and legal 
consulting services, promptly proposed 1,224 judicial 
suggestions for relevant departments, and publicized law through 
radio and television broadcast, press, and other media means, 
which were generally valued. 
<H5>  2. We Strictly Punished Criminal Activities Seriously </H5>
Disrupting the Economy and Unceasingly Deepened Anticorruption 
Struggle 
  Deeply conducting an anticorruption struggle and promoting 
administrative honesty is a major affair which the party and the 
country should grasp at present and in the future. In line with 
the central plan that noticeable results should be achieved in 
an anticorruption struggle within a certain period of time, 
courts at all levels further strengthened trial of serious 
economic cases. Judging from the economic criminal cases 
accepted by courts across the province last year, we noticed the 
following characteristics: First, the number of cases accepted 
declined during the year. Last year courts across the province 
accepted 1,528 economic criminal cases (excluding 103 old 
cases), showing a decline of 22 percent from the previous year's 
figure of 1,950 cases. Second, the number of this category of 
cases declined first and then increased again. During last 
year's first nine months, courts across the province accepted 
972 economic criminal cases as against 1,505 cases accepted 
during the corresponding period of the previous year, showing a 
decline of 35.4 percent. During the year's third quarter, the 
central authorities proposed efforts be made to achieve 
noticeable expected progress in the anticorruption struggle. 
The number of cases accepted by courts began to rise again. 
During last year's fourth quarter, courts accepted 556 cases 
compared to 445 cases during the corresponding period of the 
previous year, showing an increase of 24.9 percent. Third, most 
of the cases concentrated on economic crimes. Of the total 
number of economic criminal cases accepted by the courts last 
year, 1,208 were cases of the four categories, namely, 
corruption, cheating, misappropriation of public funds, and 
bribe-taking, accounting for 80 percent of the total number of 
cases accepted. Of these cases, 37.8 percent were cases of 
corruption; 16.7 percent, cheating; 13.3 percent, 
misappropriation of public funds; and 12.2 percent, 
bribe-taking. Fourth, the proportion of criminal cases involving 
party members and cadres was quite big. Of the court decisions 
that had legal effect, 40.2 percent involved party members and 
cadres. Over the past year, courts across the province tried 
1,529 economic criminal cases. Owing to the complicated social 
situation and the difficulties in obtaining evidence and 
conducting investigations, 506 cases were rejected for 
reinvestigation because the facts for fixing the crimes and 
determining the sentence were unclear, and the evidence was not 
adequate. Among the 1,084 criminals covered by legal 
consequences, 435 involved the amount in excess of 10,000 yuan. 
Of them, 309 criminals involved amounts between 50,000 and 
10,000 yuan, 60 involved amounts between 100,000 and 50,000 
yuan, and 66 involved the amount in excess of 100,000 yuan. Of 
these criminals, 11 were given death sentences, suspended death 
sentences, and life imprisonment, and 286 were given an 
imprisonment of over five years. As a result, a total of 27.81 
million yuan in economic losses was retrieved for the state. In 
trying economic cases, courts at all levels always persisted in 
the principle of "being both resolute and prudent to ensure 
correctness" and offered corresponding policies and ideas for 
handling the bribery cases taken place among contracted and 
leased enterprises, the criminal cases committed by scientific 
and technological personnel, and the cases of misappropriation 
of public funds, and the cases of illegal money lending, thus 
ensuring the quality of the trial of economic cases. 
<H5>  3. We Vigorously Strengthened the Trial of Economic Cases </H5>
and Deepened the Functional Role of Readjusting Economic 
Relations 
  Along with the establishment and development of the 
socialist 
market economic structure, last year all courts in the province 
received a total of 49,142 economic dispute cases of various 
kinds, an increase of 23.4 percent over the previous year, and 
the total volume involved by lawsuits exceeded 4.27 billion 
yuan, a high record in history. These cases increasingly 
manifested the characteristics of large amounts of money 
involved by lawsuits, the increase in cases of new categories, 
and the complexity of legal relations. Many cases spanned 
several localities and trades and their legal relations 
overlapped, thus making it more difficult to handle them. 
First, in trying and handling these cases, people's courts, on 
the one hand, resolutely exercised overall control in 
consideration of the state overall interest, supported banks to 
withdraw unreasonable loans, banned the funds under illegal 
circulation, and prevented the "circulation of funds outside the 
legal entities." On the other hand, people's courts gave 
consideration to the objective factors of policy readjustment, 
reasonably judged the right or wrong of the related parties, and 
tried every possible means to reduce the economic losses of both 
parties involved in a case. Second, people's courts protected 
according to law the fair competition in the main body of 
markets. As an economy based on the legal system, the market 
economy has set an even higher demand on law enforcement. After 
the convocation of the 14th CPC Congress, in the process of 
changing from enforcing laws under the product economic 
structure to enforcing laws under the socialist market economic 
structure, courts at all levels paid attention to guiding the 
vast numbers of judicial cadres to overcome the legal concepts 
and traditional habits formed under the old economic mode and to 
learn to correctly enforce laws under the new economic 
structure. Third, people's courts continuously expanded the 
sphere of service. In trying economic cases, courts at all 
levels, on the one hand, correctly handled economic disputes in 
a correct and timely manner, and, on the other hand, positively 
helped enterprises develop production. By voluntarily going 
deep into enterprises to help them examine contracts and 
rationalize contract relations, people's courts achieved better 
social results in orienting the trail of economic cases to 
economic construction. 
<H5>  4. We Comprehensively Tried Civil and Administrative Cases </H5>
and Protected the Legitimate Rights and Interests of Citizens 
and Legal Entities 
  Among the cases tried by courts, civil cases accounted for 
the largest part. Last year, courts throughout the province 
received a total of 125,824 civil cases of various kinds, 
accounting for 50.6 percent of the total, or an increase of 9.3 
percent over the previous year. Courts at all levels strictly 
enforced the "General Principles for Civil Code of the PRC" and 
the "PRC's Law on Civil Procedures," continuously strengthened 
the trial of civil cases, and continuously improved the quality, 
efficiency, and social effect of the trial. In handling cases, 
courts strengthened the sense of law enforcement and changed 
from handling cases based on experiences to handling cases 
according to the law. In terms of the time to try cases, courts 
strengthened the sense of time limit and changed from handling 
cases at will to handling cases efficiently. In the form of 
trial, courts strengthened the sense of evidence and changed 
from completely depending on investigations to combining 
evidence with investigation. First, courts conscientiously 
handled the frequently occurred civil cases. Second, courts 
prudently handled the cases of new categories and other 
sensitive cases. Due to the influence of the upsurge in real 
estate, stocks, negotiable securities, and business in the 
previous stage, new types of civil cases increased with each 
passing day. The lawsuits due to the disputes over development 
of real estate, transfer of negotiable securities, labor 
services, copyrights, and reputation rights were brought to the 
courts in succession. Third, the construction of the people's 
courts was strengthened, and the contradictions and disputes 
were solved among the grass roots. Larger numbers of civil 
disputes took place in the grass roots. The people's at various 
levels paid attention to strengthening the grass-roots work. 
Through readjustment, the province had 386 courts. Last year, 
the people's courts guided the grass roots to mediate and handle 
230,741 civil disputes. So, 215,188 contradictions were nipped 
in the bud and among the grass roots. 
  In the past three years after the enforcement of the law 
governing administrative procedures, the courts in the province 
accepted 2,083 administrative cases in first trials and 
concluded 2,033 of them. Thus, greater headway was made in the 
administrative judicial work. In trying the administrative 
cases, the courts at various levels not only protected the legal 
rights and interests of citizens and legal persons but also 
enabled the administrative organs to exercise their functions 
and strictly handle affairs according to the laws. They 
conscientiously examined, according to the laws, the specific 
administrative activities and made judgments in line with the 
principle of seeking truth from facts. In particular, they paid 
attention to examining and handling the administrative cases 
closely relating to reform, opening up, macroeconomic regulation 
and control, and change of government functions, including the 
cases of affecting the change of enterprise managerial 
mechanisms, wantonly collecting funds, wantonly apportioning 
expenses, and wantonly imposing fines, so as to protect the 
enterprises' decision-making right to management and to promote 
the setup and development of the socialist market economic 
system. The administrative cases that cropped up due to the 
restriction of the personal freedom were prudently treated and 
appropriately handled. So, the courts realistically safeguarded 
the citizens' legal rights and interests. Through 
administrative judicial activities, the courts forcefully 
supported the administrative organs to do administrative work 
according to laws; helped standardize the administrative 
management activities, upgrade the citizens' awareness of 
abiding by laws and disciplines, and protect the legal rights 
and interests of citizens and legal persons; and were welcomed 
and praised by all social circles. 
<H5>  5. We Strengthened the Construction of the Court Cadre </H5>
Contingents and Ensured the Strict Enforcement of Laws 
  Viewing the general situation, we know that the province's 
court cadre contingents are basically good and can be relied on 
the party and the people. However, they still lag far behind 
the requirements for deepening the development of reform and 
opening up and setting up the socialist market economic system. 
Over the past year, the courts at various levels across the 
province grasped the trial work with one hand and grasped the 
construction of the cadre contingents with the other. They 
regarded the improvement of the cadres and policemen's political 
integrity and professional quality as an important measure for 
achieving the court work. First of all, they unified the 
ideology of cadres and policemen with the guidelines of the 14th 
party congress. The courts at various levels conscientiously 
organized the broad masses of cadres and policemen to deeply 
study, according to their actual conditions, the guidelines of 
the 14th party congress and the third volume of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping, to further emancipate the mind, to renew 
their ideas, to deepen the understanding about the market 
economic system, to firmly enhance the basic line of the party, 
to enhance the sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency 
for bringing into play the judicial functions to serve the 
acceleration of the setup of the socialist market economic 
system, and to enhance the ability to understand, analyze, and 
solve problems with the theory on socialist market economy. 
Under the conditions where the number of cadres continued to 
increase, there were no sufficient judicial forces, and the 
working conditions were comparatively poor, the broad masses of 
cadres and policemen carried forward the fine traditions of the 
judicial work, were inspired with enthusiasm, waged an arduous 
struggle, and worked harder for a long period of time. Thus, 
there emerged a group of advanced courts and outstanding 
judicial cadres that strictly enforced laws, were honest in 
performing their official duties, and served the people 
wholeheartedly. Second, they made efforts to upgrade the 
professional abilities of cadres and policemen. By the end of 
1993, 54 percent of the cadres and policemen in the courts of 
the province had an education level of college degree or higher. 
Gigantic changes took place in the court cadres' educational 
and specialized structures. Third, they strengthened the 
improvement of administrative honesty and the supervision over 
the judicial work. In order to resist the interference which 
unhealthy social trends had brought to judicial work, courts at 
all levels persisted in managing the courts and police strictly, 
strictly enforced judicial discipline further and improved the 
mechanism of restraint through employing people to supervise 
administrative honesty work, establishing the law enforcement 
responsibility system and the system of reinvestigating wrong 
cases, conducting activities on vying to be an honest judge, and 
signing joint pledges on administrative honesty with the persons 
concerned. In line with the guidelines of the directives of the 
central authorities and the provincial party committee on the 
anticorruption struggle, courts at all levels conscientiously 
investigated and resolved their own problems and adopted 
resolute measures to straighten out and handle two prominent 
problems on above-quota collection of fees and confusing the 
set-up of judicial organs with their administrative power. Fees 
which were collected above quota or should not be collected had 
been refunded within a set time limit; and all authorized organs 
whose administration and judicial powers were confused had all 
been abolished without exception. Problems on law and discipline 
violation emerged in judicial cadres had been strictly handled; 
those whose offenses constituted a crime had been resolutely 
punished in line with the law; the image of people's courts and 
the purity of the ranks of judicial workers were maintained. To 
guarantee strict enforcement of law, courts at all levels 
realistically strengthened judicial supervision, promptly 
resolved problems emerged in judicial work through the 
procedures of second trial and retrial, and through law 
enforcement inspections. Last year courts across the province 
tried 11,146 cases subject to second trial, handled 5,393 cases 
of appeal, received 278,129 visits from the masses, handled 
5,393 letters from the masses, and changed the verdicts to 
straighten out in line with law those cases whose facts to 
support the original sentence were unclear and the evidences 
were inadequate, and that laws were not properly applied to 
them. Measures for improving the situation of failing to 
strictly implement the procedural law and for improving rough 
judicial work style were proposed in a timely manner. 
  During the past year, our province made definite 
achievements 
in court work, but it still lagged far behind the demands of the 
party and the country and the unceasingly developed situation, 
which were mainly indicated in the following: Our ideology, 
concept, and professional quality were not totally compatible 
with the overall objective of establishing the socialist market 
economic structure; our ability to deal with the new situation 
and resolve new problems needed further enhancement; the 
problems that the masses of people found it difficult to bring a 
lawsuit to court and that courts found it difficult to put the 
verdicts into effect had not been thoroughly resolved; problems 
on failing to strictly enforce the law caused by the influence 
of protectionism of localities existed at varying degrees; 
problems on the rough work style and sloppy work of some 
judicial workers occurred frequently; some cases were not 
handled in a timely manner and a small number of cases were not 
properly handled; some cadres and policemen violated law and 
discipline, and, although such cases were not great in number, 
they had a very bad influence in the masses. We should adopt 
effective measures to resolve these problems in an effort to 
unceasingly improve the work of people's courts. 
  Zhang Huanwen said at the end of his report: This year we 
should deeply study the guidelines of the third plenary session 
of the 14th CPC Central Committee, take the party's basic line 
as the guidance and economic construction as the central task, 
act in line with the demand of the conference of presidents of 
the higher people's courts across the country, gain great 
prestige in dealing strict blows to criminals, grasp major and 
appalling cases until good results are achieved, make big 
progress in regulating the relations in various economic 
sectors, and comprehensive enhance the judicial level. It is 
necessary to safeguard social stability, better serve the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure, 
guarantee the smooth progress of reform and opening up, and 
promote a sustained, rapid, and sound national economic 
development.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of a report on the work of the Shanghai </F>
Municipal Higher People's Court delivered by Court President Hu 
Ruibang at the Second Session of the 10th Shanghai Municipal 
People's Congress on 21 February 1994] 
  [Text] In 1993, courts in Shanghai, guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the 14th CPC National Congress' guidelines, 
unswervingly carried out the party's basic line of "one center, 
two basic points" and the central and municipal party 
committees' arrangements for the anticorruption drive, further 
emancipated minds and sought truth from facts, comprehensively 
strengthened judicial work, raised the level of administering 
justice, and actively explored ways for reforming courts, 
thereby providing judicial guarantee and legal service for 
maintaining social stability; promoting Shanghai's reform, 
opening up, and economic construction; and establishing a 
socialist market economic structure. 
<H5>  1. Relentlessly Launching the Drive To Crack Down on Crimes </H5>
To Maintain Social Stability 
  In the past year, courts throughout Shanghai accepted 7,844 
criminal cases of the first instance, down 3.86 percent from the 
previous year; and concluded 7,763 cases and rendered verdicts 
on 12,175 criminals, down 6.67 percent from 1992. Of the 10,073 
criminals, on whom the verdict was enforced, 3,129, or 31.06 
percent of the total, were serious criminal offenders having 
committed murder, robbery, rape, intentional grave injury, major 
larceny, and railroad banditry. Of these, 2,154, or 68.84 
percent of the serious criminal offenders, were sentenced to 
five years or more in prison, life imprisonment, or death 
(including death sentence with a stay of execution). 
  Under unified arrangements, courts in Shanghai closely 
coordinated with the relevant departments and concentrated 
efforts to launch in depth a special antitheft drive. 
Throughout the year, they accepted a total of 4,157 cases 
involving 6,882 accused. Of these, the courts concluded 4,102 
cases and sentenced 6,753 criminals, accounting for 55.47 
percent of the total number of criminals sentenced. 
  Courts at all levels in Shanghai, earnestly implementing the 
National People's Congress' relevant decisions, meted out swift 
and harsh punishments according to the law to 165 criminals who 
smuggled, produced, trafficked, and traded in narcotics; who 
smuggled, produced, and disseminated pornography; who abducted 
women and children for sale; who engaged in prostitition; or who 
assembled people to gamble. 
  The Shanghai railroad transport courts, proceeding from the 
need to maintain public order, cracked down on railroad and 
highway bandits. Throughout the year they tried and concluded 
490 cases involving 996 criminals who committed murder, robbery, 
rape, injury, and larceny along railroads or on trains. Of the 
910 criminals on whom a verdict was already enforced, 379, or 
41.65 percent of the total, were sentenced to five years or more 
in prison, life imprisonment, or death (including death sentence 
with a stay). 
<H5>  2. Cracking Down on Serious Economic Crimes and Punishing </H5>
Corruption To Safeguard Economic Order 
  Courts in Shanghai performed an extremely heavy task in 
cracking down on economic crimes. Major economic criminal cases 
increased markedly with the following features: 1) increased 
number of serious cases and volume of money involved; 2) more 
crimes committed by employees of banking institutions; and 3) 
changes in the attributes of criminals. Most of the accused 
were administrative and managerial, financial and accounting, 
supply and marketing, and maintenance personnel of enterprises 
and institutions or employees of banking institutions; and their 
age tended to become younger. Of the 18 economic criminals 
sentenced by the Intermediate Court, 55.6 percent were under the 
age of 25. 
  Courts at all levels meted out severe punishment without 
mercy specifically for crimes committed by state functionaries, 
especially those of leading party and government organizations, 
judicial departments, administrative law enforcement 
departments, and economic management departments who took 
advantage of their position and powers to embezzle and 
misappropriate public funds and take bribes; for crimes of 
producing and marketing fake and shoddy goods to the detriment 
of consumer interests; and for fraud in economic contracts. 
Throughout the year, they accepted 1,086 economic cases 
involving 1,499 accused; and, together with the cases left over 
from 1992, concluded 1,075 cases involving 1,515 accused. Of 
the 998 criminals on whom the verdict was already enforced, 367, 
or 36.77 percent of the total, were sentenced to five years or 
more in prison, life imprisonment, or death (including death 
sentence with a stay). Of the economic criminals given a 
verdict, 40.1 percent were former state functionaries. Through 
holding trials, courts recovered 53.0879 million yuan of 
economic losses for the state and collectives. To maintain 
market economic order and stop unlawful competition, the courts 
sentenced 46 criminals involved in fake trademarks. 
  Following the Second Plenary Session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission, the courts took immediate 
action to strengthen the intensity of deepening the 
anticorruption drive. Three successive special trials were held 
in Shanghai in August, September, and October to try publicly 99 
cases of embezzlement, bribery, and misappropriation of public 
funds. From September through December, a total of 423 economic 
criminal cases were concluded, equivalent to 64.88 percent of 
those concluded in the first eight months. 
<H5>  3. Intensifying Judicial Administration of Economic Cases, </H5>
Using Legal Weapons To Readjust Economic Relations, and Ensuring 
the Establishment and Development of the Socialist Market Economy 
  Last year, law courts handled 22,802 economic disputes of 
various descriptions, up 54.59 percent from the previous year. 
They completed the trials of 21,424 cases, up 48.77 percent 
from the previous year. Claims involved in litigation topped 
3.83 billion yuan, a 198-percent increase over the previous 
year. There was an upsurge in the number of cases that 
reflected salient problems in the way the economy functioned. 
The number of cases involving foreigners and Hong Kong, Macao, 
and Taiwan compatriots increased rapidly. Also, there was an 
increase in the number of cases in which the defendants were 
from outside Shanghai. Interference from protectionist 
practices by local authorities was serious. In light of these 
problems, the municipal higher court held several meetings to 
carefully analyze the new circumstances in which economic cases 
were tried, and explicitly called for enhancing concepts in five 
areas of the judicial administration of economic cases: 
Enhancing the concept of equality by providing equal legal 
protection to all types of market competitors, such as 
state-owned, collectively owned, privately run, and "partly or 
wholly foreign-owned" enterprises; heightening the concept of 
contractual obligations by fully respecting the intentions of 
interested parties and ensuring the realization of the market 
economic principle of fostering contractual practices; enhancing 
the concept of overall interests by resolutely resisting and 
opposing local protectionist practices and safeguarding the 
unity and authority of legal institutions; heightening the 
concept of policy-guided law enforcement by handling cases in 
strict accordance with the law where relevant legal provisions 
are available; by following the guidance of basic principles in 
policies and laws in the absence of legal provisions or explicit 
legal provisions; and by realistically and properly applying the 
criterion of whether cases are solved in a manner conducive to 
the "three causes"; and enhancing the concept of efficiency by 
striving for good political, economic, and social benefits. 
  Law courts across the municipality actively tried cases 
stemming from enterprise bankruptcy, joint enterprise 
operations, contracting, and leasing, providing legal guarantees 
and services for changing operating mechanisms in enterprises. 
Last year, they tried 815 cases that fell under these four 
categories, concluding proceedings in 703 cases. They actively 
conducted explorations, boldly carried out practical work, and 
conscientiously tried stock- related cases. First, they stopped 
blackmarketing in stock subscription forms to maintain order in 
issuing stocks. Second, they halted stock speculation to 
maintain fair and orderly stock trading. Third, they 
strengthened stock companies' responsibilities as brokerages to 
protect stockholders' legitimate rights and interests. Fourth, 
they experimented with the issuance of public notices on losses 
incurred on stock markets to protect investors' legitimate 
rights and interests. The development of scientific and 
technological markets caused a corresponding increase in 
disputes involving trademarks, patents, and technological 
contracts. Law courts in Shanghai handled 140 cases that fell 
under these categories. 
  Last year, law courts dealt with 182 cases involving 
foreigners and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots 
(including maritime cases), twice the number in the previous 
year. They took care to serve the policy of opening up wider to 
the outside world through the manner in which they handled 
cases. They fully exercised China's jurisdicational rights in 
accordance with the principle of maintaining state sovereignty. 
They upheld the principle of equally protecting the legitimate 
rights and interests of Chinese and foreign litigants, as well 
as litigants within and outside the national boundaries. They 
actively publicized China's laws and investment policies to 
attract foreign investment. In dealing with illegal acts 
committed by foreign business people, they meted out legal 
punishment or applied compulsory measures in accordance with the 
law. 
<H5>  4. Strengthening Civil Judicial Work To Effectively Protect </H5>
the Civil Rights and Interests of Citizens and Corporations 
  In the past year, courts accepted 36,963 civil cases of the 
first instance and concluded 36,864, up 12.95 percent and 14.19 
percent respectively over 1992. Divorce, debt, and indemnity -- 
the three major categories of civil lawsuits -- accounted for 
nearly 80 percent of the total, of which 21,277 cases involved 
divorce, constituting 57.56 percent of total civil lawsuits. 
  Courts at all levels, pursuant to the law and the Shanghai 
municipal regulations for protecting the aged, the young, and 
women and children, heard some 25,000 cases involving divorce, 
alimony, child and parental support, and inheritance, thereby 
protecting the lawful rights and interests of women, children, 
and the aged. Persistently giving priority to lawsuits involving 
the aged, courts expedited the handling of such civil cases; 90 
percent of the cases were concluded in two months and most of 
them in less than a month, and 97 percent were resolved. In 
handling lawsuits related to violation of consumer interests, 
courts earnestly enforced the "Regulations on Protecting the 
Lawful Rights and Interests of Consumers in Shanghai 
Municipality;" of the lawsuits settled, 96 percent were won by 
consumers. 
  In the past year, a total of 73 lawsuits involving housing 
and real estate management were accepted by the Municipal 
Intermediate Court alone, which handled only two such cases in 
1992. While hearing individual cases, courts demanded their 
personnel to foster an overall concept and to refrain from 
adopting a wait-and-see attitude as a result of failing to 
obtain a clear grasp of policies and laws. They were urged to 
combine the hearing of housing and real estate dispute cases 
with the implementation of the state's macroeconomic regulation 
and control policies, to guard against handling cases 
independently, and to pay attention to the social benefits of 
case handling. They were also urged to persist in proceeding 
everything from reality and adhering to agreements in handling 
housing and real estate disputes; to uphold the equality of 
subjects before the law; and to expedite hearing and enforcement 
of ruling while ensuring the quality of case handling. In 
addition, courts also accepted 102 cases of labor disputes; and 
591 civil lawsuits involving foreign and Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan businessmen, thereby protecting the lawful rights and 
interests of foreign nationals and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan 
citizens in the mainland, as well as promoting the normal 
development of people-to- people exchanges. Personnel of 
grass-roots people's courts actively took part in local 
comprehensive management of public order. Throughout the year 
they offered guidance and training to 5,611 mediation personnel 
on a total of 349 occasions, and alleviated aggravating 
contradictions by properly handling 352 civil cases in good 
time, thereby maintaining social stability and unity. 
<H5>  5. Actively Conducting Administrative Judicial Work To </H5>
Protect the Lawful Rights and Interests of Citizens, 
Corporations, and Other Organizations and To Ensure and 
Supervise Administrative Organs in Exercising Functions 
According to the Law 
  In the past year, courts accepted 339 administrative cases 
of 
the first instance and, together with the cases left over from 
1992, concluded 360 cases. Courts at all levels, earnestly 
implementing the Administrative Procedural Law, focused the 
administrative judicial work on serving key municipal 
construction projects. They took the initiative to provide 
out-of-court legal service in a bid to resolve disputes before 
lawsuits were filed and promptly heard cases related to key 
municipal construction projects, thereby providing an effective 
legal guarantee for the municipal construction. 
  Courts actively accepted cases related to encroachment upon 
enterprises' autonomy in production and management in violation 
of the Enterprise Law; cases related to unwarranted pooling of 
funds and arbitrary requisitioning of donations and extraction 
of fees from enterprises; and various administrative cases 
involving large and medium state-owned enterprises, which were 
filed with the people's courts according to the provisions in 
the Administrative Procedural Law. Throughout the year they 
accepted 854 cases from administrative institutions for 
compulsory enforcement by courts, and enforced 854, or 99.18 
percent of the total, thereby supporting administrative 
institutions in exercising functions according to the law. 
  In the past year, courts in Shanghai accepted a total of 
97,950 cases of all kinds and concluded 97,846, up 12.3 percent 
and 12.46 percent, respectively, over 1992. In view of the 
judicial tasks, which became more and more heavy and difficult, 
courts continued to follow the correct guiding ideology and 
focused the work on the three major tasks of serving economic 
construction, fighting corruption, and ensuring social 
stability, thereby keeping the work of courts in pace with the 
continuous development of the new situation arising from a 
market economy. The following major measures were taken: 
<H5>  1. Persist in Strictly Enforcing the Laws and Make Efforts </H5>
To Enhance the Judicial Level 
  First, efforts were made to ensure that cases were placed on 
file for investigation and prosecution. The overwhelming 
majority of cases tried at the courts were directly handled by 
courts; public prosecution cases accounted for only 7.52 percent 
of the total number of the cases mentioned above. Second, we 
persisted in holding public trials, placed judicial activities 
under supervison by the masses and public opinion, and 
vigorously put an end to "cases influenced by relationships or 
favoritism." Third, we strengthened supervision over court 
trials and provided better guidance for proceedings. In the 
past year, we wound up a total of 815 criminal cases which had 
been appealed to a higher court and a total of 22 cases 
protested by procuratorial organs. Fourth, we improved study of 
application of the law. Over 50 special judicial work 
conferences and seminars of various forms were held across the 
municipality to study laws, rules, and regulations which had 
been recently promulgated as well as judicial explanations. The 
judge training center sponsored 13 training sessions to give 
professional training to nearly half of the key members of 
judicial work. Fifth, we further strengthened law enforcement. 
We handled 20,407 various law enforcement cases in the whole 
year; coupled with the cases kept on file, we handled a total of 
21,348 cases, making the rate of cases finished in the year 
reach 82.27 percent. Thus, we maintained the authority of 
verdicts as well as the dignity of the laws. Sixth, we conducted 
a general examination of law and discipline enforcement. Law 
courts in Shanghai examined 5 percent of civil, economic, and 
law enforcement cases; seriously handled the problems 
discovered; and made corrections while trying to consolidate. 
Seventh, we established rules and regulations to standardize the 
conduct of cadres and policemen. Shanghai's law courts 
established or amended over 160 various rules and regulations, 
including a system to determine the responsibility for mistakes 
in the trial of a case, while launching a special drive to 
rectify unhealthy practices found in government departments and 
in trades and professions and while conducting a general 
examination of law and discipline enforcement. 
<H5>  2. Step up Reform of Law Courts Themselves and Strictly </H5>
Enforce the Laws 
  First, we deepened reform of the personnel system and 
improved administration through appraisal of objectives achieved 
during job tenure, thereby arousing the enthusiasm of the vast 
numbers of cadres and policemen. Law courts in Yangpu, Putuo, 
and Changning districts implemented an "on duty, standby, and 
off duty" system among their personnel, thereby preliminarily 
giving expressing to the principle -- competition on an equal 
footing, and those who excel will succeed and those who fail are 
eliminated. Second, we rationalized the law court system and 
installed better facilities in law courts. In 1993, we 
established law courts in New Pudong Area, New Minhang Area, and 
Jiading Area; the Higher People's Court established a court for 
handling complaints and petitions; and the intermediate people's 
court established a second court for hearing civil cases. 
Third, we explored reform of court trial methods. The Shanghai 
Municipal People's Higher Court specially set up a group for 
guiding reform of court trial methods to provide specific 
guidance for the progress of the work. Law courts in New Pudong 
Area, Yangpu District, Xuhui District, Huangpu District, and 
Songjiang Area successively experimented with criminal cases' 
prosecution and defense and with the hearing and proof method 
for civil, economic dispute, and law enforcement cases. Fourth, 
we implemented a system for determining the responsibility for 
mistakes in the trial of a case and adopted a new pattern of 
lawsuit documents on a trial basis. They have a positive 
significance for promoting the enhancement of judicial 
personnel's professional and law enforcement level. 
<H5>  3. Earnestly Improving Work Style and Stepping Up </H5>
Investigations and Studies 
  After the party central committee and the muncipal party 
committee encouraged the "practice of conducting investigations 
and studies," leaders elected to a new term on the municipal 
higher court used two months' time to investigate and study 
thorny problems and issues of widespread concern arising during 
the course of judicial processes in law courts at the 
grass-roots level. They promptly held a work conference of 
officials from economic dispute mediation centers in Shanghai's 
law courts, drawing up work rules for such centers after summing 
up their experiences. They also made specific provisions 
regarding the character, tasks, establishment, case-handling 
procedures, and mediation principles of such centers on the 
basis of legal provisions and practical experience in judicial 
administration. Moreover, they stepped up their efforts to hold 
academic seminars and actively attended the fifth national 
academic seminar of judicial departments. A total of 12 papers 
from law courts in Shanghai won prizes, accounting for 55 
percent of the total number of papers sent to the seminar. The 
higher court won the prize for well-composed treatises. 
<H5>  4. Setting Priorities in Judicial Administration and Hearing </H5>
Major and Important Cases 
  Leaders in law courts at all levels personally heard major 
and important cases, meting out harsh punishment expeditiously 
in accordance with the law for serious cases of embezzlement and 
bribery that gravely infringed on the interests of the state and 
people, and impaired the reputation of the party and the 
government; for serious cases involving fraud, profiteering, the 
production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, tax 
evasion, and grave disruption of economic order; and for cases 
that seriously affected public order, endangered people's lives 
and property, and affected social stability, such as murder, 
robbery, rape, highway banditry, and especially crimes committed 
by gangsters that were similar to organized crime. They 
conscientiously tried major and important economic, civil, and 
administrative cases related to the drive for deepening reform, 
especially to the drive for accelerating reforms of the banking, 
investment, financial, and taxation systems. They worked hard 
to enhance the results of handling cases and improve service. 
They showed courage in enforcing the law strictly in 
exceptionally serious or controversial cases. They established 
a sound supervision and inspection system, formulated the 
"Opinions on Earnestly Trying Major and Important Cases," and 
prodded law courts at all levels to ensure thorough judicial 
administration of major and important cases. 
<H5>  5. Applying Different Means To Actively Participate in </H5>
Comprehensively Improving Public Security 
  At the begining of last year, the Central Committee and 
municipal party committee issued a series of important 
instructions on strengthening the comprehensive effort to 
improve public security. The higher court promptly convened a 
meeting of presidents of the courts at the district and county 
level to gain a better understanding of the instructions, during 
which it offered specific opinions on implementing the 
instructions. Setting a target for the work of enhancing trial 
functions and participating in the comprehensive effort of 
improving public security, courts at all levels strengthened 
examination and supervision in this respect. Through the efforts 
of the police, it has become an initial standard that all courts 
in the municipality take part in the comprehensive effort to 
improve public security. First, education to publicize the 
legal system was conducted through public hearing of cases and 
public sentencing of offenders. The courts in the municipality 
held 236 public meetings to announce the sentencing of 
offenders, at which sentences on 717 cases involving 1,221 
offenders were announced. This has helped educate some 191,100 
people. Second, typical cases were selected and publicized 
through the media to expand the cases' impact on society. Last 
year, 1,641 pieces of case-related materials were compiled for 
publicizing. About 3,110 manuscripts were sent to the central 
and local press units, 2,138 of which were used. Third, 
concrete education on the legal system was conducted by making 
use of criminal cases. Last year, 1,747 visits were made to the 
scene where cases occurred or to the relevant units to conduct 
legal education by making use of related cases, and the masses 
welcomed this method of education. Fourth, in dealing with 
problems discovered in the course of handling cases, judicial 
proposals were applied to urge the relevant units to improve the 
legal system by plugging loopholes. Courts at all levels put 
forward 707 judicipal proposals containing 1,031 articles, 384 
of which were adopted by relevant departments. Rectification 
and reform measures were implemented accordingly. Fifth, 
efforts were made to strengthen education after sentences were 
meted out to criminals. The purpose was to encourage criminals 
to agree with the court judgement and reform themselves. To 
keep an eye on criminals who were placed on probation, the 
courts established a system under which the criminals were 
frequently revisited for observation purposes. Measures to help 
educate them were implemented in coordination with public 
security departments and other relevant units. For juvenile 
criminals, each had a personal file set up and an analysis of 
their conditions was conducted regularly. The municipality's 
courts made 472 revisits to check on criminals placed on 
probation. To check on juvenile offenders, the courts made 697 
revisits. 
<H5>  6. Strengthening the Building of Court Personnel and </H5>
Keeping Them Clean and Honest 
  Adhering to the principles of setting strict demands on 
party 
members and court personnel, the courts throughout the 
municipality took great pains to improve the quality of their 
personnel. First, they strengthened the building of leading 
bodies. Following the election of new leading bodies for the 
courts at various levels, the higher court party group 
immediately convened a municipal conference on court work during 
which it called on the leadership of courts to strengthen unity 
and put the collective strength of courts into play. Second, 
efforts were made to deepen the struggle against corruption to 
promote honesty among court personnel. The higher court 
conducted special checks aimed at improving the quality of 
trials and at rectifying the practice of making litigants' money 
and property the main criterion for handling cases; resolutely 
carried out the provisions of the Supreme People's Court on 
building a clean government; and promptly issued a circular to 
rectify the collection of fees and charges in violation of 
regulations. Third, courts at various levels organized cadres 
and police to conscientiously study the documents of the 14th 
CPC National Congress, Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping," and "The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on 
Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market 
Economic Structure," and to receive education on communist 
ideals and ethics in order to enhance their consciousness and 
firmness in adhering to the party's basic line. Fourth, to 
purify the rank of cadres, courts at all levels earnestly 
investigated and punished violators of laws and discipline. 
  With the acceleration of reform, opening-up, and economic 
construction, a legal system with the Constitution as the core, 
suited to the development of a socialist market economy, is 
being established. As more and more social and economic 
relations are being regulated by legal means, the workload of 
people's courts is getting heavier and heavier. Under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Third 
Plenary Session of the party's 14th Central Committee and 
according to the arrangements made by a national conference of 
higher people's court presidents, the main tasks of this 
municipality's people's courts in the new year are to continue 
cracking down on criminal activities; to do a good job in trying 
serious cases, especially serious economic cases; to vigorously 
regulate economic relations; to effectively protect the 
legitimate rights and interests of the people, legal entities, 
and other organizations; to strengthen and improve judicial work 
by strictly enforcing laws and raising the quality of judicial 
workers; and to provide a judicial guarantee and legal service 
in maintaining social stability, promoting a clean and honest 
government, and taking the lead in building operating mechanisms 
for the socialist market economy in Shanghai. 
  First, it is necessary to step up the trial of criminal 
cases 
and to strive to maintain social stability. 
  Second, we should regulate economic relations according to 
law and promote the establishment of a modern enterprise system 
and a market economic structure [the word "socialist" was not 
included]. 
  Third, efforts should be made to step up the trial of civil 
and administrative cases to effectively protect the legitimate 
rights and interests of citizens and legal persons. 
  Fourth, people's courts should step up their reform and 
strengthen themselves. 
  The tasks facing the people's courts in 1994 are arduous. 
Under the leadership of the municipal party committee and under 
the supervision of the Supreme People's Court, the municipal 
people's congress, and its standing committee, we are determined 
to rally more closely around the party Central Committee; guided 
by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese Characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the party's 14th Central Committee, we will 
strengthen our spirit, resolutely carry out reforms, and work 
hard to bring our judicial role into full play so as to make a 
fresh contribution to Shanghai's effort to be the first to build 
operating mechanisms for the socialist market economy and to 
"making some changes in one year and substantial changes in 
three years."

<F P=106> [Speech by Gao Dezhan, secretary of the Tianjin Municipal </F>
Party Committee, at the closing ceremony of the second session 
of the ninth municipal CPPCC committee, on 5 March] 
  [Text] Fellow members and fellow comrades: 
  Thanks to the concerted efforts of all members, the second 
session of the ninth municipal committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is about to conclude 
successfully today after satisfactorily fulfilling all 
predetermined tasks. During the session, members listened to 
and discussed the report made by Vice Chairman Li Changxing on 
the work of the standing committee of the ninth municipal CPPCC 
committee. They also attended as nonvoting deputies the second 
session of the 12th municipal people's congress and listened to 
and discussed the government work report delivered by Mayor 
Zhang Lichang. They offered many sound opinions and suggestions 
for the major issues related to the overall situation of 
Tianjin, manifested a high degree of the sense of responsibility 
and a strong sense of mission, and manifested the close 
relations of showing utter devotion and sharing honor or 
disgrace between the CPC and various democratic parties and 
nonparty patriotic figures. This session, that has been held 
very successfully, is a session characterized by democracy, 
unity, reality, and encouragement, a session devoted to 
emancipating the mind, enhancing morale, grasping practical 
work, and promoting development, and a session to commonly 
discuss how to accelerate the pace of reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive and again create glorious achievements. On 
behalf of the municipal party committee, I would like to warmly 
congratulate the success of this session! 
  Since the shift of the term of the municipal CPPCC committee 
last July, CPPCC organizations at all levels in the municipality 
have profoundly implemented the guidelines of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's important speeches and the 14th CPC Congress, 
conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping" and the "decision" of the third plenary session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, given full play to the advantages of 
the CPPCC, and further expanded the sphere of work and 
invigorated various activities in the course of carrying on and 
carrying forward the fine traditions of the CPPCC. These 
organizations have also made new progress in political 
consultation, democratic supervision, participation in and 
discussion of political affairs, and self- construction. These 
organizations have also made great contributions to promoting 
the building of two civilizations, to safeguarding social 
stability, and to promoting the all-around progress of the 
society. The good situation of today's Tianjin is indispensable 
from the endeavor of all levels of CPPCC organizations and all 
CPPCC members of Tianjin. Here, on behalf of the Tianjin 
Municipal CPC Committee and the Tianjin Municipal People's 
government, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to the 
municipal CPPCC committee, to CPPCC committees of all districts 
and counties, to all democratic parties and industrial and 
commercial federations, to all nonparty patriotic figures, to 
pertinent people's groups, and to the figures of all 
nationalities of all circles in the municipality! 
  This year is extremely critical to Tianjin's reform, opening 
up, and modernization. As everybody knows, Tianjin's major 
goals to be attained in the foreseeable future are: By 1997, it 
should quadruple the 1980 GNP three years ahead of schedule; by 
the end of this century, it should initially set up the 
socialist market economic structure; and through 20 years' of 
struggle, it should become one of the areas that take the lead 
in basically realizing modernization. To attain these 
magnificent but extremely arduous goals, Tianjin is required to 
exert even greater efforts. It is of extremely great 
significance to achieve success in this year's work. If we can 
seize and make good use of the opportunity to make big 
breakthroughs in all work and effect even faster and better 
development, we will gain the initiative and embark on a 
favorable development path under the new situation and will lay 
a solid foundation for continuous advancement. Therefore, in 
this year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line, we should comprehensively implement the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress and the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and seize the 
opportunity to form a new vivid situation of forging ahead in 
unity and quietly immersing into hard work in order to make 1994 
a year in which Tianjin's economy develops in a sustained, 
rapid, and sound way, a year in which the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure is accelerated, and a year 
characterized with stability, unity, and all-around social 
progress. 
  To make this year's work a success and to fulfill all the 
tasks, the most important thing is to extensively and profoundly 
mobilize all the masses and the figures of all nationalities on 
all circles to work hard with one heart and one mind. This 
year, CPPCC committees at all levels should, under the guidance 
of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, 
comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, should subject themselves to the overall situation of 
the work of the whole party, should continue to hold high the 
banners of socialism and patriotism, should better exercise the 
functions of political consultation, democratic supervision, and 
participation in and discussion of political affairs, should 
unite all the forces that can be united, and should mobilize all 
positive factors in an effort to make a big breakthrough, a big 
progress, and even greater contributions to fulfilling all the 
tasks set forth by the second enlarged plenary session of the 
sixth municipal party committee and by the forthcoming second 
session of the eighth National CPPCC Committee. 
  1. With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory as the fundamental 
principle, we should raise the CPPCC work to a new height. 
  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics constitutes the Marxism of current 
China, the spiritual pillar of the whole party and the people of 
all nationalities in China, and a powerful ideological weapon to 
achieve success in reform, opening up, and modernization. With 
Comrade Xiaoping's theory as the fundamental principle, CPPCC 
organizations should, in particular, permeate all their work 
with Comrade Xiaoping's theory concerning the united front 
during the new period. We should conscientiously study and 
profoundly comprehend Comrade Xiaoping's exposition that the 
CPPCC is an important organization to consolidate and expand 
China's patriotic and united front, as well as an important form 
of China's political system to carry forward the socialist 
democracy and exercise mutual supervision; his exposition that 
the united front during the new period includes two alliances; 
his exposition that the CPPCC should hold high the two banners 
of patriotism and socialism; his exposition on realizing the 
plan of "one country, two systems" and accomplishing the great 
cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland; and his 
exposition that the general task of the CPPCC is to mobilize all 
positive factors, turn negative factors into positive factors, 
unite all the forces that can be united, pool the efforts of all 
fields to safeguard and develop political stability and unity, 
and work hard to build China into a strong modernized socialist 
country. The study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions 
concerning the united front work should be combined with the 
study of the guidelines of the important speeches on the united 
front work and the CPPCC work made by Comrade Jiang Zemin, 
Comrade Li Ruihuan, and some other central leading comrades. We 
should make continued efforts to deepen the understanding of 
Comrade Xiaoping's theory, comprehend the essence of the 
guidelines of the theory, have a good command of basic 
viewpoints, enhance our understanding of the theory, further 
strengthen the sense of glory and the sense of mission in doing 
the CPPCC work well, and give full play to the initiative and 
creativity of CPPCC organizations and members in order to raise 
the CPPCC work to a new height. 
  2. We should give full play to the role of CPPCC 
organizations in participating in and discussing political 
affairs in order to make new contributions to building the two 
civilizations. 
  Participating in and discussing political affairs is a major 
task of the CPPCC, is a major form to exercise the fundamental 
functions of political consultation and democratic supervision, 
and provides an even wider sphere and even more opportunities 
for CPPCC organizations and members at all levels and the 
figures on various circles, that are connected by the CPPCC, to 
offer advise and suggestions and to give full play to their 
professional knowledge and skills. We sincerely hope that CPPCC 
organizations at all levels will participate in and discuss 
political affairs in an even more vivid manner and will achieve 
even greater results in this aspect. We should persist in 
democratic consultation. From now on, all the major issues 
related to Tianjin's overall situation should be subject to 
consultation before they are decided. We should give full play 
to the intelligence and wisdom of the figures on all circles to 
make policymaking more democratic and scientific. We should 
remove obstacles from the discussion channels, earnestly enact 
the provisional regulations of the National CPPCC Committee on 
political consultation and democratic supervision, and create a 
democratic and harmonious consultation environment for all 
democratic parties, people's groups, nonparty patriotic figures, 
and personages of all nationalities on all circles in an effort 
to remove barriers from and expand the channels of offering 
advise and suggestions. We should give full play to the unique 
advantages of the CPPCC, such as having a galaxy of talents and 
abundant intellectual resources, being not restricted by 
position, having a wide field of vision, having contacts with 
various circles, and representing a wide range of areas. With 
economic construction as the central task, we should pay 
attention to and conduct discussion of major affairs in line 
with the tasks and demands defined by the second enlarged 
plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee. We 
should focus on participation in and the discussion of political 
affairs on major issues that have a bearing on the overall 
development of the municipality. We should offer ideas, raise 
suggestions, and work for accelerating reform and opening up, 
for promoting economic development, for safeguarding stability 
and unity, and for building spiritual civilization. By 
participating in and discussing political affairs, the CPPCC 
should widely and frequently contact the figures of all circles 
abroad and should fully utilize its advantages and make even 
greater contributions to expanding the scale of opening up, 
utilizing foreign funds, and strengthening the friendship 
between China and the world. CPPCC organizations should 
continuously deepen their understanding of the participation in 
and discussion of political affairs, enhance their sense of 
consciousness and their sense of responsibility, and further 
improve their ability and expertise of participating in and 
discussing political affairs. Party committees and governments 
at all levels should fully carry forward democracy, provide wide 
opportunities for airing views to listen to public opinions, and 
create conditions for making the CPPCC participate in and 
discuss political affairs in an even better way. 
  3. We should pay attention to strengthening unity to help 
promote reform, development, and stability. 
  The essence of the united front lies in mass unity and 
integration. CPPCC committees at all levels should regard the 
endeavor of strengthening unity as an unshrinkable duty and 
should play a positive role in strengthening the mass unity 
across the municipality. This year, China will take a big step 
in reform and put forward many reform measures. Hence, Tianjin 
is faced with an arduous task of reform and development. Under 
such a situation, Tianjin must appropriately handle the 
relations between reform, development, and stability, must not 
only foster the idea of depending on reform to promote 
development but also attach high importance to stability, and 
must safeguard political and social stability so as to create a 
good condition for the smooth progress of reform and 
development. Having maintained close ties with all circles of 
society for a long time, the CPPCC constitutes an important 
force to coordinate the relations between various sectors, to 
resolve contradictions, to strengthen unity, and to safeguard 
stability. CPPCC organizations should utilize its unique 
advantages to understand and reflect the public feeling through 
various channels and then help the party and the government 
dispel doubts and explain questions for the people through a 
penetrating and painstaking work, strengthen the friendship 
among the people, harmonize the feelings of the people, enhance 
the people's common understanding, further strengthen the unity 
among the people of all nationalities, all parties, all levels, 
and the figures of all circles, and encourage all the people to 
press forward with one heart and one mind the reform, opening 
up, economic construction, to safeguard stability and all-around 
social progress, and to work hard to invigorate Tianjin. 
  4. We should further build the CPPCC itself and make the 
CPPCC better suit the demands of the current situation and 
tasks. New situation and tasks set an even higher demand on the 
CPPCC. To successfully accomplish the glorious mission invested 
on the CPPCC and to create a new situation in the CPPCC work, 
CPPCC committees at all levels should further build themselves 
well. First, they should strengthen study. By carrying forward 
the fine tradition of self-education, CPPCC committees should 
encourage their members to consciously and voluntarily study 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, the politics on current 
event, the state laws and policies, modern scientific and 
cultural knowledge, and, in particular, Volume 3 of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" so that they can use Comrade 
Xiaoping's theory to seek unity of thinking and guide the work. 
To participate in and discuss political affairs in an even 
better way in the course of deepening reform, CPPCC members 
should also be encouraged to conscientiously study the "decision 
of the CPC Central Committee on some issues of establishing the 
socialist market economic structure" and study the knowledge and 
theory concerning the socialist market economy. Second, CPPCC 
committees should strengthen investigation and study. They 
should make great efforts to create conditions to encourage 
their members to go deep into the realities of life and the 
midst of the common people to conduct investigation and study in 
the light of the new circumstances and new problems cropping up 
in the course of reform, development, and stability and then 
offer feasible opinions and suggestions. Third, CPPCC 
committees should pay attention to summarizing experiences. By 
summarizing experiences, CPPCC committees should constantly 
deepen their understanding of the law of the CPPCC work and 
should further explore the new ways of doing the CPPCC work 
well. Fourth, CPPCC committees should strengthen and improve 
their office work. They should strive to improve the political 
and professional expertise of office workers, improve the 
quality and efficiency of their work, enhance the stratum and 
level of service, and build CPPCC organs into the "home of 
members" in an effort to made the CPPCC work even more vivid and 
achieve even more fruitful results in the work. 
  The CPPCC constitutes the important organizational form of 
the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation 
under the leadership of the CPC. Party committees at all levels 
should actually strengthen leadership over, attach high 
importance to, and give great support to the CPPCC work. Party 
committees should also list the CPPCC work as a major items on 
their daily agenda, listen to the report on the CPPCC work, do 
research for the CPPCC work, and help CPPCC committees solve 
practical problems. Major cases should be reported to CPPCC 
committees in a timely manner, and major problems should be 
consulted with CPPCC committees in a timely manner in order to 
give full play to the role of the CPPCC. The motions and 
suggestions offered by CPPCC members should be earnestly handled 
by departments concerned. All government departments should 
voluntarily strengthen the contacts with CPPCC committees so 
that CPPCC members can better understand government affairs and 
discuss government affairs in an even better manner. Support 
and assistance should be given to the inspection, visit, 
investigation, and study of CPPCC organizations. Press units 
should pay attention to widely propagating and reporting the 
CPPCC work. 
  Fellow members and fellow comrades, the fighting goals and 
work tasks defined by the second enlarged plenary session of the 
sixth municipal party committee and by the second session of the 
12th municipal people's congress are arduous but inspiring. We 
believe that in this new year, all levels of CPPCC organizations 
and all CPPCC members will certainly stand on a new starting 
point, give rise to a new atmosphere, and create a new situation 
with high morale and firm confidence. Let us closely rally 
around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
the nucleus, and work hard with one heart and one mind to 
further maintain and develop the fine trend of the municipality 
and win a new victory in reform, opening up, and modernization!

  [Text] On 14 March Deputy Gao Dezhan voiced his opinions 
at the plenum sponsored by the municipal delegation to the 
National People's Congress'[NPC] session, in which he said that 
he totally supported the government work report given by Premier 
Li Peng. The report is succinct in style, rich in content, and 
profound in implications. It reflects the whole situation of 
the work of party and country as a whole, conforms with the 
reality of the entire country and Tianjin Municipality, mirrors 
the desire of the vast number of people, and has an important 
significance on further promoting the country's programs of 
reform and opening up and the development of socialist 
modernizations. 
  Gao Dezhan said: The people throughout the municipality 
earnestly implemented the important speech of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping and the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress last year and 
based on the past foundation scored vary great achievements in 
reform, opening up, economic construction, and in the work of 
various fields. Nineteen ninety four is a crucial year for us to 
deepen the reform and to maintain a good trend of development in 
the national economy and an important year for us to further 
consolidate and develop the situation of stability and unity. 
We must earnestly implement the spirit of the NPC session and 
vigorously do a good job in conducting the municipal work 
according to the principles of "seizing the opportunity, 
deepening the reform, broadening the opening up, promoting the 
development, and maintaining the stability," which constitute 
the whole situation in the work of party and country as a whole. 
  Gao Dezhan said: To fulfill the tasks of this year and to 
successfully conduct the local work in line with the spirit of 
the government work report, we should further do a good job in 
dealing with the following three problems relating to ideology 
and concepts: First, we should firmly foster the concept of 
whole situation. We should truly place the work of localities 
and departments on the whole situation of the entire country's 
work and take overall consideration in conducting work. Efforts 
should be made to further discern the whole situation, to take 
the whole situation into consideration, to abide by and serve 
the whole situation, and to achieve in letting the partial 
observe the whole. A good job should be done in concentrating 
on the three events of reform, development, and stability. 
Second, we should firmly foster the sense of opportunity. We 
are facing a rarely historic opportunity as well as should 
clearly discern the currently favorable international conditions 
and the fine domestic situation; be good at seizing the 
opportunity, treasuring it, and making good use of it; and 
further enhance the sense of emergency and responsibility. We 
should also double our efforts in work to promote the municipal 
economy to achieve rapid and satisfactory development. Third, 
we should further uphold the Marxist ideological line of 
emancipating minds and seeking truth from facts. Efforts should 
be made to uphold the integration between emancipating minds and 
seeking truth from facts and not only to do as much as possible 
but also to do what we are capable of in developing the economy. 
We should uphold the principle of proceeding from reality in 
doing everything, correctly analyze and judge the situation, and 
vigorously upgrade our capability in having the situation well 
in hand. Efforts should be made to work out practical measures, 
to do practical deeds, and to seek substantial results. 
  Gao Dezhan said: In conducting the specific work, we should 
emphatically and successfully grasp the following four aspects 
in line with the arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee 
and the State Council: First, we should foster new ideology and 
work out new methods in developing the economy. Development 
represents an essential criterion. By persistently regarding 
the economic construction as a center, we should concentrate our 
efforts on boosting the economy and maintaining the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. The 
development of sustaining, rapidity, and soundness are 
dialectical unity. A growth we have to maintain should be 
sustained, rapid, and sound. Therefore, it is imperative to 
achieve unification between growth and economic returns. In 
developing the economy, we should pay attention not only to the 
increase of total supply and demand but also to upgrading the 
quality of economic development and truly orient economic 
development onto a track with the increase of economic results 
as a center and onto a track of depending on scientific and 
technological progress to upgrade the laborers' quality. We 
should vigorously concentrate our efforts on readjusting the 
structure, enhancing the management, making technical progress, 
making up the deficits, increasing economic results and profits, 
and upgrading the quality of staff members and workers, and make 
a large breakthrough in these aspects. We should also seek 
growth by upgrading the levels of business, management, and 
technology and by increasing economic results. Second, a good 
job should be done in grasping well the relations among reform, 
development, and stability. Stability represents the premise of 
reform and development and without a stable social environment, 
we are in no position to do all things. Only by upholding 
reform, opening up, and economic development can we 
fundamentally maintain the stability. Development represents a 
purpose; reform, a motive fore; and stability, a guarantee. All 
of the three are an organic and unified entity, are mutually 
linked, and help one another forward. Successfully grasping the 
relations among the three is very important for us to 
successfully conduct our work and fulfill various tasks this 
year. We should also foster the thinking of depending on reform 
to promote development, deepen the reform, and accelerate the 
establishment of socialist market economic systems to promote 
economic development. Meanwhile, great attention should be paid 
to the issues concerning stability and to providing good social 
and political environments for reform and development. Third, 
we should persistently "take two-hand approach and be tough with 
both hand" as well as achieve rapid development in the economy 
and overall progress in the society. We should improve the work 
in both economic construction and spiritual civilization to a 
new level. Efforts should be made to strengthen the education on 
patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; to expand the 
pioneering spirit of the new historic period; to vigorously 
develop the main melody; and to enhance the construction of 
socialist democracy and legal systems as well as the 
comprehensive management of public security. Great attention 
should be paid to developing various social undertakings, and 
maintaining the harmonious development between the economy and 
society to promote the overall progress in the society. Fourth, 
we should do a good job in dealing with the relation between 
developing the economy and upgrading the people's lives and 
persistently regard the "three advantages" as a fundamental 
yardstick in measuring the work in various fields. We should 
make all-out efforts to do practical deeds for the mass, adopt 
every possible way and means to do practical deeds for 
enterprises, and bring into play the enthusiasm of the broad 
masses of cadres and people in building socialism. Efforts 
should be made to vigorously develop socialist productive 
forces, to reinforce the actual strength of the economy, and to 
upgrade the people's lives. By persistently regarding as a 
purpose the practice of serving the people wholeheartedly and 
upholding the basic principle of "doing everything for the 
people and relying on the people to do everything," we should 
grasp the work of showing concern for the people's vital 
interests and of improving the people's lives by regarding it as 
a big event. We should also achieve in having the mass in 
minds, doing everything for the mass, and doing our work by 
relying on the mass. Enterprises are the foundation of the 
economy and the mass is the basis of society. Specifically 
speaking, concentrating our efforts on boosting the economy 
means to boost the enterprises; particularly to invigorate the 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; to improve the 
people's lives; and to vigorously increase the incomes of staff 
members, workers, and peasants. 
  Gao Dezhan said: Tasks we are facing this year are very 
heavy. We must earnestly implement the arrangements made the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council. Units from top to 
bottom throughout the municipality should be of one mind, unite 
as one, rouse themselves for vigorous efforts to make the 
municipality prosperous, work hard, and vigorously do a good job 
in conducting the municipal work. Only by so doing can we live 
up to the expectations of the CPC Central Committee, the State 
Council, and the people throughout the municipality.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of report by Zhang Lichang, mayor of Tianjin </F>
Municipality, delivered at the municipal economic work 
conference on 17 January: "Uplift Spirit, Work With All-Out 
Efforts, and Create a New Situation in Accelerating Development"] 
  [Text] This economic work conference is a very important 
conference, whose major tasks are, in accordance to the 
guidelines of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, to implement the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party 
Central Committee and the national economic work conference and, 
based on the requirements put forward at the second (enlarged) 
plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee, to make 
overall arrangements for Tianjin's economic work for 1994. 
  Following the enlarged session of the municipal party 
committee, people throughout the municipality have 
conscientiously studied and thoroughly implemented its 
guidelines, taken quick actions, exerted earnest efforts, and 
created a good momentum. A good beginning has been achieved in 
the work of all fields. I will now speak on 10 opinions on 
economic work. 
  1. Seize Favorable Opportunities To Further Accelerate 
Development 
  The 1990's constitutes a very important historical period 
for 
Tianjin's economic and social development. Seizing the 
opportunity to accelerate development is our task of prime 
importance and also the common desire of the people across the 
municipality. Based on the general demand put forward at last 
year's municipal party congress and people's congress and to 
meet the needs of the development of the situation, we have put 
forward clear targets to quadruple Tianjin's GNP three years 
ahead of schedule in 1997; to complete the renovation of 
dilapidated houses in large areas of the city proper in five to 
seven years; to transplant, adjust, and technically transform 
all the state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in the 
municipality in about eight years; and to generally complete the 
construction of the new coastal area in about 10 years. Having 
attained these targets, Tianjin will regain the magnificence of 
a large commercial port, create new advantages in the modern 
economy, and gradually become a large international city. An 
arduous, yet great cause, this period is important for Tianjin's 
development. We must bravely shoulder tasks that are heavier 
than anytime before. To attain these targets, we should 
earnestly summarize the experiences gained from the many years 
of economic development and make innovations. The general road 
for development is to deepen reform, open wider to the outside 
world, and, paying attention to the economy's new growth points 
to accelerate development there while paying attention to the 
renovation of the older city proper and its older enterprises by 
accelerating adjustment and invigoration of existing areas and 
enterprises. The older city proper should support new areas, 
and the new areas should lead the older city proper. They 
should develop together and promote each other so that a new 
situation can be created in which Tianjin is opened wider to the 
outside world, provides better service to the country, and 
achieves great development in service and the process of opening 
up. To attain these targets, we must make every year and every 
step successful, effect new changes every year, and effect a 
large change every five years. 
  A review of last year's work showed that we made important 
steps in accelerating development and achieved new changes in 
the work in all fields. Our GNP grew by 11.8 percent, 
industrial output value 24.5 percent, fixed asset investment 
32.4 percent, contracted amount of foreign capital 84.9 percent, 
and revenues 21.8 percent, all of which are the best records for 
the past few years. Agricultural production increased steadily, 
commodity distribution was expanded, markets thrived, and urban 
construction, science and technology, education, culture, public 
health, and other undertakings made new headway. The 20 tasks 
to benefit urban and rural people were fulfilled on schedule, 
and people's living standards were improved. We continued to 
maintain an excellent situation of political and social 
stability. All this resulted from the unified and indomitable 
efforts of the people throughout the municipality which has laid 
a good foundation for success in this year's work. 
  The year 1994 is critical to the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure, to making even greater 
breakthroughs in reform and opening up, and to effecting even 
quicker progress in the economy. Therefore, it is of extremely 
great significance to do this year's work well. We should 
deepen the reform, expand the opening up, enhance morale, and go 
all out to do our work in line with the work principle and 
general demand defined by the municipal party committee. All 
localities, all departments, and all professions and trades 
should foster a high degree of urgency and responsibility, start 
from a high level, stress high efficiency, high quality, and 
good economic returns, and achieve better major economic targets 
than last year. Continued efforts should be made to maintain 
sustained, rapid, and sound development of the national economy. 
Major goals of the municipal economic work are: to effect a 
12-percent increase in the GNP; to top $5 billion in the total 
value of contracted foreign investment directly utilized by the 
municipality, with investment made by foreign traders reaching 
$3.5 billion; to effect $2.3 million in foreign export trade 
volume; to complete 3.6 million square meters of housing; to 
effect obvious improvement in economic returns; and to further 
improve the income level of urban and rural residents. 
  The tasks we face are arduous, but, when viewed from the 
general situation, there are also many favorable conditions. 
Thus, it is entirely possible for us to realize these tasks 
through hard work. As far as reform is concerned, the decision 
of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
will certainly be carried out in an all-round way, and the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure will 
certainly develop in depth. Now, the new round of reform has 
already begun, a series of major reform measures of the state 
have been put forth, and macro-economic environment will become 
even more stable and better. As far as opening up is concerned, 
international capital finds favor China, and Tianjin has become 
a popular area for foreign investment, resulting in an upsurge 
in our utilization of foreign capital. Regarding the condition 
for development, the international market's capacity has 
expanded, the demands on domestic markets are brisk, and the 
adaptability of enterprises to market demands has been 
strengthened further. Meanwhile, the scale of investment and 
credit funds have improved over last year. Some key projects 
related to the development of strength and momentum in Tianjin 
have already been built, some of which have already witnessed 
results and manifested great potential for development. Some 
old enterprises have transformed mechanisms, undergone 
renovation, and thus become more vigorous and active. Tianjin 
has taken the lead in carrying out the tax assignment system and 
the system of separating tax payment from profit retention, thus 
gaining an initiative. The mental outlook of leading cadres at 
all levels is undergoing profound changes, and the broad masses 
of the people in the municipality are trying to make changes and 
rapid progress. The work in the past several years has laid a 
good foundation for future development. Central leading 
comrades and responsible comrades of relative state ministries 
and commissions have come to Tianjin to learn about the 
situation and give guidance to our work, thus giving us great 
support and help. We must have a full understanding of this new 
situation in reform, opening up, and development. 
  Of course, while viewing these favorable conditions, we 
should also catch sight of the problems and difficulties 
emerging in our way of advance, catch sight of all sorts of 
factors that restrict our development, and catch sight of the 
shortcomings and the deficiencies in our work. We should 
clearly notice that both favorable and unfavorable factors are 
in a dynamic state and that one can be transformed by the other. 
While favorable conditions can be obtained and created through 
our energetic endeavors; unfavorable conditions can also be 
transformed and overcome through our energetic endeavor. Under 
the same conditions and problems, whether Tianjin can create a 
new situation and effect even more rapid progress depends 
chiefly on our mental outlook, our morale, our determination, 
and our work level. On the whole, we are now in an excellent 
opportunity of large-scale development, and favorable conditions 
are a main trend. Such a good opportunity is not frequent for 
Tianjin, and thus it is very valuable. The opportunity cannot 
be missed, and the opportunity will not await us. We must seize 
the opportunity to accelerate development. 
  2. Build a New Coastal Area and Quicken the Pace of 
Building It Into the Largest Economic Growth Point of the 
Municipality. 
  To quicken the development of Tianjin and to create new 
economic development advantages, we must cultivate large 
economic growth points. Occupying a forward position in opening 
the municipality to the outside world, this coastal area has 
more advantages and potentials for accelerating the pace of 
development than any other places in the municipality. With the 
efforts made by the previous municipal party committees and 
governments, the thinking of accelerating the construction of 
the new coastal area has basically been ripe. The general 
project is as follows: Build a high-degree, open-type 
modernized new economic area with Tianjin Harbor, development 
zones, and bonded area as its framework and metallurgical and 
chemical industries as its foundation; where commerce and trade, 
banking industry, and tourist trade vie with one another for 
development; with new rising industries and export-oriented 
enterprises as its mainstay; with complete sets of 
infrastructural facilities and service functions; and catering 
to the needs of the 21st century. Based on this, Tianjin will 
be able to further develop itself into a free port. Through the 
development and construction in the next 10 years, the new 
coastal area's GNP and foreign exchange earnings from exports 
will account for more than 40 percent of the municipality's 
total. The development and construction of the new coastal area 
should be regarded as a key economic work priority of the 
municipality. We should work out a unified plan and implement 
the plan in a step-by-step manner. We should mobilize the 
enthusiasm of all fronts, concentrate energy, accelerate the 
construction, and build the new coastal area into one whose 
economic growth rate is faster than any other places in the 
municipality as well as the largest economic growth point of the 
municipality. 
  First, we should exert efforts to accelerate the port 
construction. Port is the largest advantage of Tianjin. Cities 
rejuvenate themselves in reliance on ports and ports become 
flourishing in reliance on cities. Therefore, the construction 
of ports should be regarded as the most important task. In line 
with the principle of increasing the total capacity and having 
full functions, we should accelerate the pace of construction 
and strive to build Tianjin harbor into an international large 
harbor with an annual loading and unloading capacity of more 
than 100 million tonnes at the beginning of the next century. 
We should open various channels to attract capital, use both 
domestic and foreign capital, and develop both cooperatively- 
and independently-funded enterprises. Anyone who wants to make 
investment is welcomed. 
  Second, we should further bring into play the functions of 
the development zone and the bonded area. The development zone 
and the bonded area are the banners in opening Tianjin to the 
outside world. Thus, the development zone and the bonded area 
should exert greater efforts to continuously maintain their 
leading role in the whole country and play an experimental, 
guiding, and serving role for the new coastal area and even the 
municipality as a whole. The development zone should accelerate 
the development of land on a large scale, its development on a 
snowballing basis, the development of inter-regional circulation 
of capital; and develop itself into a large-scale, high-level, 
technologically advanced export processing zone and a financial, 
commercial, and trade zone. It should develop 25 square 
kilometers by 1997 and 33 square kilometers by the end of this 
century. The bonded area should firmly attend to the 
construction of the second-phase project and try every possible 
means to set up a system of making storage, transportation, and 
processing a coordinate process. We should draw on the methods 
of the international free trade areas, expand the circulation of 
goods and materials, develop entrepot trade, and build itself 
into the largest international trade window in north China. 
  Third, we should build a heavy chemical industrial area. Key 
maritime chemical industrial and petrochemical industrial 
enterprises are concentrated in the new coastal area. A modern 
metallurgical industrial foundation with seamless steel tube as 
a symbol has been laid. There are also several on-going 
projects and several projects whose construction has been 
prepared, including a 140,000-tonne ethylene project, a 
200,000-tonne polyester project, and a 5 million-tonne oil 
refining project. So, a new-typed heavy chemical industry zone 
has preliminarily taken shape and shown a vast prospects for 
development. This is a key investment area. From now on, new 
large-sized industrial projects should be developed in this area 
in principle. It is necessary to accelerate the construction of 
the projects that have started construction and firmly attend to 
the pre-phase preparatory work for the projects whose 
construction has been defined. The old enterprises in urban 
districts can be moved to this area when conditions permit. The 
enterprises in the new coastal area should accelerate the 
transformation of managerial mechanisms, set up completely new 
enterprise systems, and create new modernized industrial 
advantages. 
  Fourth, we should speed up construction of infrastructural 
facilities. To start up the new coastal area early, we should 
make a breakthrough in infrastructural construction. Urban 
construction departments should improve the plan, make 
arrangements, and put forward a clear demand on progress. 
  This year, we should make the best of the funds from various 
sources and increase investment to complete the construction of 
the overpass on the Xinhua Road in Tanggu District, start 
construction of the Gangtang Road and Shanguang Road, speed up 
construction of the Nanjiang Bridge, and complete, as soon as 
possible, the heat and power plant and water plant in the 
development zone and the project to divert Luan He water to 
Hangu District. We should make active efforts to use foreign 
capital to build the expressway from the city proper to the new 
coastal region. 
  Speeding up construction of the new coastal area is a major 
task in Tianjin's economic work. All fields should take the 
overall situation into consideration, make concerted efforts, 
devote energy, and make contributions to construction. Tanggu, 
Hangu, Dagang, Dongli, and Jinnan Districts should do their work 
well to meet the needs in the construction of the new coastal 
area, compete with and promote each other, and accelerate 
development. 
  3. Deepen Reform and Invigorate Existing Enterprises 
  To accelerate development, we should also make more efforts 
to invigorate existing enterprises. If existing enterprises are 
not invigorated, it will be very difficult to develop new ones. 
We may say that invigorating existing enterprises, especially 
state-owned, large and medium-sized ones, is the foundation for 
future development. After over four decades of construction, 
Tianjin has accumulated a considerable amount of property and 
technology and possesses a number of backbone enterprises and 
highly competitive products. A valuable source of wealth, their 
potential should be fully tapped in every way. 
  We should invigorate existing enterprises by accelerating 
reform. Through the means of reform, adjustment, and 
reorganization, we should adopt different measures according to 
differing conditions and keep some while abandoning others to 
suit the remedy for each case. Large and medium-sized 
enterprises whose conditions permit should actively experiment 
with reform in the modern enterprise system and turn themselves 
into limited liability companies or limited liability stock 
companies. Small enterprises should make great efforts to adopt 
the cooperative shareholding system or the leasing and contract 
methods to become enterprises "run by the people without 
changing their state-owned status." Enterprises which have 
achieved notable efficiency and large shares of the market and 
have bright prospects for development should be encouraged to 
expand their scale and upgrade their levels and, by merging and 
cooperating, expand their strength and develop enterprise groups 
linked mainly by property rights. Enterprises with poor 
efficiency may be divided into several smaller ones and improved 
with measures that match their actual conditions so that they 
can be invigorated. In short, all enterprises should adopt 
reform measures that match their actual conditions and take 
actions as soon as possible. Enterprises should make earnest 
efforts in reform, take the initiative in finding ways, and try 
to liberate themselves through their own efforts instead of 
relying on assistance and relief. 
  We should invigorate existing enterprises through technical 
transformation carried out with foreign funds and technology. 
The experience of a number of enterprises, such as Otis 
Elevator, Honda Motorcycle, Tianyang Washing Machine, and 
Jinmeile Beverage, proved that technical transformation with 
foreign funds and technology is an important way to invigorate 
existing enterprises. Therefore, we should have greater courage 
and greater determination to promote this work. Not only small 
enterprises but large ones, not only one enterprise but a whole 
trade, and not only enterprises in a slump but also ones that 
are doing well may conduct technical transformation with foreign 
funds and technology as long as foreign firms are willing. This 
year, Tianjin should select a group of large enterprises for 
contacts with foreign firms and they should achieve great 
progress in technical transformation with foreign funds and 
technology. 
  We should invigorate existing enterprises by encouraging 
them to do business with various industries and various trades 
and professions. Development of the market economy requires 
that enterprises break the mode of developing only one plant or 
one product and that they conduct unitary management, adapt 
themselves to market changes on their own initiative, accelerate 
structural readjustment, and do business with various industries 
and various trades and professions in a timely manner. This has 
become the law of economic development. Therefore, it is 
necessary to do business this way. It is not an expedient 
measure. We should be determined to do it in a big way, gather 
momentum, select a number of enterprises that were running in 
the red for a long time in downtown areas, particularly in the 
golden areas, to practice this and make big strides in this 
aspect. All enterprises that need to do business with various 
industries must take action quickly, because they will gain 
initiative in this regard if they start this work early and will 
be in a passive situation if they carry out this work late. 
They must change their ideas, never put on airs, suit measures 
to local conditions, each display their own strong points, and 
seek development by doing business with various industrial 
sectors. 
  We should create necessary external conditions for 
invigorating the existing economic units. Invigorating economic 
units is not a matter of enterprises only, it is also an 
unshirkable duty of all departments. We must give enterprises a 
free hand, decontrol their management, and delegate powers to 
them. Powers which have been defined to be delegated to 
enterprises must be put in place, and more powers should be 
delegated to the lower levels according to needs and 
possibility. It is necessary to boldly allow enterprises to 
manage things which they can manage well. The higher level 
pertinent departments and functional departments should actively 
support enterprises conduct readjustment, reorganization, 
grafting, and development of various industries, and should not 
interfere with or restrict their work. With regard to 
enterprises which the municipality authorities do not want to 
manage but the district authorities are willing to accept, we 
should place them under the management of district authorities. 
  4. We Should Expand the Use of Foreign Capital and Open the 
Municipality to All Directions, at Home and Abroad 
  Being an open coastal city with development of 
export-oriented economy as the mainstay, Tianjin should strive 
to do a good job in opening itself at home and abroad and give 
rise to a situation of opening up to all directions, various 
spheres, and higher levels. 
  First, we should further expand the scope of using foreign 
capital. To accelerate development, it is necessary to increase 
investments. Judging from the possibility of raising funds, 
using foreign capital is a very practical and convenient and 
rapid way of getting money. Introducing foreign capital will 
bring in not only funds but also advanced technology and 
management. In order to develop the new coastal area, accelerate 
the pace of enterprise grafting and transformation, fulfill the 
target of renovating dangerous and shoddy houses, and conduct 
infrastructure facilities, Following the path of expanding the 
degree of opening to the outside world and using foreign 
capital, Tianjin must take quick action in using foreign 
capital. If we do a good job in using foreign capital, we will 
be able to accelerate the realization of our defined goal, if 
not, accelerated development will be empty talk. The higher and 
lower levels across the municipality should make due 
contributions to this major matter of extreme importance and 
urgency. We should proceed from the overall situation, mobilize 
all sectors, take coordinated action, and form a joint force to 
speed up introduction of foreign capital and use them 
practically and wisely. We should regard introduction of more 
foreign funds and good efficiency as the standards for testing 
this work. This year, the trend of using foreign capital is 
very good, the prelude has been played, and the climate is being 
formed. This trend has appeared more quickly than expected. We 
should take advantage of this trend to advance, carry out this 
work comprehensively, and make breakthroughs in some major 
aspects. In addition to achieving major progress in the direct 
use of foreign capital, we should also actively open up the 
channel of effectively using inter-government loans, loans from 
international banking organs, and buyers' credit. Cooperation 
can be conducted in all sectors, including the primary, 
secondary, and tertiary industrial sectors; all large, 
medium-sized, and small items are welcomed and various 
cooperative forms may be adopted. We should firmly grasp those 
large projects which, once imported, will result in the 
development of a large area. All units should not delay this 
work. Regarding some major items, we should report the 
situation of progress to the higher level in a timely manner in 
an effort to combine the efforts of the higher and the lower 
levels to make this work a success. 
  Second, we should vigorously improve the intangible 
environment of investment. Whether we can utilize a large 
amount of foreign capital depends chiefly on our investment 
environment, the intangible environment in particular. To 
improve the intangible environment for investment, we should 
always proceed from ourselves. We should create an environment 
in which foreign traders have profits to net and have money to 
make. We should be good at doing accounts and lay emphasis on 
long-term benefits. We should persist in the service forms of 
"one continuous line" and "one station," characterized by quick 
tempo and high efficiency. Proceeding from expediting the 
completion of our projects, we should revise and prefect our 
policies in a timely manner. By improving the intangible 
environment, we should be able to attract and retain more 
foreign capital, utilize foreign capital more quickly, and yield 
better results from utilizing foreign capital. We should make 
great efforts to build Tianjin into an area that is most 
attractive to investors and make foreign traders more 
enthusiastic in investing in Tianjin. 
  Third, we should try every possible means to make Tianjin 
more popular. Since last year, all fields have exerted great 
effort in going abroad and bringing in foreign funds and have 
done a lot of work in absorbing foreign investment and spreading 
propaganda abroad. Not long ago, the municipal government 
delegation paid a visit to the ROK and Malaysia via Hong Kong, 
and the visit left a deep impression on the delegation. There 
are many funds that can be utilized in the world. The key lies 
in whether we can absorb them. From now on, we should make even 
better use of all sorts of channels, opportunities, and 
propaganda media to extensively propagate Tianjin, spread its 
influence in the world, and interest more foreign investment by 
foreign friends. In absorbing foreign investment, we should 
attach great importance on the role of noted persons, large 
enterprises, and large financial groups that are influential in 
the world. If we have the ability to invite them to Tianjin to 
carry out several large projects, we will be able to further 
expand Tianjin's influence in the outside world and attract even 
more investors to Tianjin. 
  Fourth, we should play the "service card" well. Tianjin's 
reform is multi-directional, and thus its service should also be 
multi- directional. We should strive for development with 
service and set up the role as the economic central city with 
service. Not only should we improve the service abroad, but 
also improve the service at home. Not only should we serve the 
areas around Bohai Bay, but also serve the areas in north, 
northeast, and northwest China. Not only should we serve 
various departments under the central authorities, but also 
serve various provinces and municipalities. We should drop the 
haughtiness of being a large city and jump out of the closed 
circle to open Tianjin's gate wide. Convenience and service 
should be given by every possible means to the projects that are 
conducive to the economic development of both sides, regardless 
of their scale, distance, and order of cooperation. All 
localities, all departments, all units, and even all social 
members should foster a strong sense of opening up and a strong 
idea of service and should find proper places to conduct 
service. We should enhance the comprehensive service functions 
of cities, use first-class service to win sentiment and 
reputation, and constantly enhance our attraction to bring in 
even more professional talents, materials, funds, and 
information in order to create a completely new situation of 
opening the whole municipality in all directions at home and 
abroad. 
  5. Accelerate the Development of the Tertiary Industry, With 
Emphasis on Cultivating and Developing the Market Structure 
  To successfully establish the socialist market economy, we 
are required to cultivate large markets and develop large-scale 
circulation. In the past, enterprises relied on plans, but now 
they rely on markets. Establishment of several large markets 
will provide conditions for developing enterprises, and the 
image of the entire municipality will experience big changes. 
In future economic work, we should regard the cultivation and 
development of large markets as an important part of 
government's service to enterprises and change of government 
functions and should place this work in an even more conspicuous 
position so that we can gradually build Tianjin into the biggest 
commercial and trading center in northern China. 
  It is necessary to consolidate and develop the existing 
trading markets. Over the past years, the municipality has done 
a lot of work in setting up markets. So far, 64 commodity 
wholesale markets, 28 trading markets for capital goods, and a 
group of banking, technology, skilled persons, and labor markets 
have been set up. A market system framework has beginning to 
take shape. This has positively helped promote the reasonable 
flow of production factors, the enlivening of the economy, and 
the acceleration of development. But, the existing markets are 
still less advanced in terms of the development scale, the 
categories, the influential power, and the service level. We 
must further adopt positive and effective administrative 
measures to expand the scale of management, intensify the 
service functions, improve the trading environment, form a big 
climate. On the basis of developing spot markets, we should 
create conditions to run, on a trial basis, one or two futures 
trading centers. We should fully apply market information to 
serve enterprises. Simultaneously, enterprises should be good 
at using information to guide production and management. 
  It is necessary to build another group of trading markets. 
First, we should form, as soon as possible, the banking markets 
dominated by the flow of funds by banks. We should positively 
expand the categories and scale of various bonds, increase the 
negotiable securities management organizations and service 
networks, achieve the issue and listing of stocks, enhance the 
influential power and attractiveness of the municipality's 
securities markets, and create conditions for striving to run 
the third securities trading center in China. We should also 
strive to run gold trading centers. Second, in line with the 
setup of the modern enterprise system, we should positively 
cultivate and develop the markets for trading enterprise 
property rights. Third, we should firmly attend to organizing 
the state-level north China technology trading market and build 
the municipality into a key scientific and technological 
findings and information distribution area and a technology 
trading center in north China. Fourth, in line with the 
development of land resources, the reconstruction of the old 
urban areas, and the reform of the housing system, we should 
further improve and expand the real estate market. Fifth, we 
should continue to build a group of national and regional large 
markets in cooperation with state departments and commissions 
and brotherly provinces and municipalities. Simultaneously, we 
should positively develop various kinds of professional 
intermediate organizations of market and bring into full play 
their functions for serving, notarizing, and supervising 
economic activities. 
  By developing various categories of markets, we should 
further promote the development of transportation, postal and 
telecommunications, information consultation, catering service, 
shopping, tourist, and entertainment trades; increase the 
proportion of the tertiary industry in the GNP; and further make 
Tianjin vigorous and flourishing. 
  6. Accelerate the Construction of Key Projects and Enhance 
the Reserve Strength for Economic Development. 
  To elevate the economy to a new height, Tianjin must build, 
as soon as possible, a group of pillar industries and develop a 
group of large-scale, high-level, and wide-needed products with 
competitiveness so as to enhance the reserve strength for 
development and competitiveness. Otherwise, Tianjin will lose 
the position as a key city. 
  Tianjin's machinery industry with automobiles and machinery 
equipment as the mainstay, electronic industry with 
telecommunication and computers as the mainstay, chemical 
industry with petrochemical products, marine chemical products, 
and fine chemicals as the mainstay, and metallurgical industry 
with fine-quality steel tubes and high-grade metal products as 
the mainstay have taken an initial shape. Their output value 
accounts for 70 percent of the total industrial enterprises, and 
their profits and taxes account for 80 percent of the total of 
all budgetary industrial enterprises. We should continue to 
accelerate the development of these four pillar industries and 
expand them. In automobile production, we should increase the 
capacity to 150,000 as soon as possible. In seamless steel tube 
production, we should organize and operate it well, make the 
best of its investment, and apply its advanced technology to 
other trades. Construction of the ethylene and polyester 
projects should be accelerated. Regarding the production of the 
20 key products, such as program-controlled telephone exchanges, 
video recorders, engineering machines, metal products, and 
chemical fibers, we should expand the scale, upgrade the levels, 
and improve the efficiency. Guided by market demand, we should 
expedite the adjustment and renovation of light and textile 
industries and their technical transformation with foreign funds 
and technology. Larger-scale renovation and reorganization 
should be made in some key industries. All districts, counties, 
and bureaus should also pay attention to their own key products. 
  We should comprehensively speed up construction of 
infrastructural facilities, further improve the investment 
climate, and enable the municipality to play a better role as 
the carrier to meet the requirement for the great economic 
development. This year, we should step up the expansion of the 
Beimalu Road and Laotieqiao Street, link up all the sections of 
the inner ring road, build four new overpasses, and expand and 
renovate some road sections with snarled traffic to ease 
strained transportation in urban areas as soon as possible. We 
should speed up construction of a number of commercial, trading, 
and public cultural facilities, such as the Quanyechang 
Department Store, Baihuo Shopping Center, Zhongshan commercial 
building, Huaxin commercial building, Beiyang industrial and 
medicinal herb commercial and trading integrated building, 
TIANJIN RIBAO multi-purpose building, and JINWAN BAO building, 
to effect a notable change in the outlook of the municipality. 
We should continue construction of the second-phase project of 
the Xinkaihe Water Works, expedite construction of such energy 
facilities as the Jixian Power Plant and Chentangzhuang Heat and 
Power Plant, actively prepare for the construction of the No. 3 
gas plant, ensure supplies of heat to 3 million square meters of 
houses, and increase the local telephone capacity to 400,000 
lines. We should make all-out efforts to organize the 
implementation of the projects for the 43d Works Table Tennis 
Games and make sure that they are completed on schedule. 
  7. Strengthen the Fundamental Position of Agriculture and 
Further Expand the Rural Economy 
  Persisting in the integrated and common development of urban 
and rural areas and quicken the process of Tianjin's rural 
modernization constitute an important aspect of the endeavor to 
develop Tianjin's economy. We should always attach importance 
to agriculture and rural work and never shake the fundamental 
position of agriculture in the process of establishing the 
socialist market economy system. Agriculture can only be 
strengthened and never weakened. All trades and professions 
should support agriculture and rural work and forge closer ties 
between urban and rural areas and between industry and 
agriculture. 
  To accelerate rural economic development, we should continue 
to develop suburban-type and export-oriented economy, adhere to 
the principle of serving the city and making peasants prosper, 
further restructure the rural economy, develop high-yield, 
good-quality, and high-efficient agriculture, stabilize and 
increase grain and cotton production, make the "shopping basket" 
project successful, and improve the socialized service system. 
We should increase agricultural investment continuously and 
improve rural policies. We should focus all our efforts on 
increasing peasants' income. This is the basic guarantee for 
stabilizing agriculture and rural areas. All localities should 
adopt various forms in line with their actual situation to 
greatly enhance the living standards and actual income of 
peasants. This should be regarded as a major criterion for 
assessing the work achievements of leading bodies at all levels 
on the agricultural front. Continued efforts should be made to 
grasp the work of helping the poor people, and study and adopt 
some permanent measures to rapidly change the backward outlook 
of the poverty-stricken areas. Greatly developing township 
enterprises is a major move for invigorating Tianjin's economy. 
We should further deepen reform, clearly define the property 
right relations, promote the shareholding cooperative system, 
and standardize and develop township enterprise groups. We 
should keep a flexible mechanism in township enterprises and 
never follow the old pattern of state-owned enterprises. It is 
necessary to take the market as the guidance, actively expand 
the use of foreign capital, readjust the structure, upgrade 
quality and management, enlarge the scope, upgrade products, and 
form a leading industry and key enterprises, and produce 
competitive products of our own in an effort to strengthen the 
ability to compete. We should combine the development of the 
rural economy with the building of small towns, carry out this 
work ahead of schedule, clearly define the major points, provide 
support and guidance, and build a number of new towns with their 
own characteristics through several years of efforts. 
  8. We Should Develop High and New Technology, and Combine 
Science With Economy 
  We are now in a period of rapidly developing technology and 
information. Science and technology have infiltrated into all 
spheres of our social and economic life, playing an increasingly 
important role. Under the market economic condition, commodity 
competition is actually a contest of technology. As a big city, 
it certainly cannot find a foothold if its technology is 
backward. It must strengthen the sense of urgency in relying on 
scientific and technological progress. Through reform and 
opening up, we should apply the market mechanism to further 
promote a combination of science and technology. We should 
unceasingly use advanced technology to transform traditional 
industries and old enterprises, digest and absorb imported 
technologies, blaze new trials, and raise the technological 
content of products. Pertinent economic and scientific and 
technological departments at all levels, all scientific research 
organs, and all enterprises should make arrangements for the 
work of relying on scientific and technological progress, and 
achieve actual progress. 
  We should expedite the development of a new technology 
industrial park. The park must be built to become our 
municipality's high and new-tech industrial base, the source of 
radiation in transforming traditional industries, the showcase 
of opening to the outside world, and the experimental area for 
deepening reform. We should give play to our advantages of 
having many scientific research organs, a good foundation in 
high and new technology, and a strong capacity in research and 
development, actively use foreign capital, and achieve big 
progress in developing jointly-funded and cooperative scientific 
and technological items and new industries. We should further 
improve all policies, laws, and regulations, raise the service 
level, and realistically enhance cohesion in the park. This year 
we should accelerate the construction of Huayuan industrial 
zone, Wuqing industrial zone, the management and service base, 
and the second Baidilu science and trade street, and rapidly 
form an atmosphere in this aspect. 
  We should actively establish the science and technology 
service system. This year we should give priority to building 
science and technology coordination centers and technology 
trading centers in northern provinces, and raise and perfect the 
science and technology pioneering center. On this basis, we 
should establish the science and technology evaluation center 
and the productive forces promotion center. It is necessary to 
make our municipality produce more and better achievements 
rapidly through the establishment of science and technology 
service system, and rapidly translate scientific and 
technological achievements into real productive forces. 
  Tianjin, being one of our country's old industrial bases and 
the economic center of northern China, should follow the world's 
advanced technology in some spheres. We should give full play 
to the role of scientific research units, institutions of higher 
learning, and municipal scientific research organs in Tianjin, 
and speed up the process of commercialization and 
industrialization of the scientific and technological 
achievements. We should implement the doctrine of bringing in, 
and graft advanced technology with pillar industries and 
transplant it to competitive products. 
  Personnel are the guarantee and education is the foundation 
for implementing the principle of developing the municipality 
with science and technology and for developing high and new 
technology. To develop the economy, education should be 
developed first; to promote the economy to a new height, 
education should be promoted to a new height first; and to make 
the economy a cut above others, personnel and the education that 
trains the personnel should be made a cut above others first. 
All relevant departments should put education in a strategic 
position for development on a priority basis, conscientiously 
implement the arrangements made at the municipal education work 
conference held by the municipal party committee and government, 
accelerate educational reform and development, and train a large 
number of high-quality personnel of various specialties for 
Tianjin's economic development and social progress. 
  We should establish a social practice of respecting 
knowledge 
and respecting personnel throughout the municipality, 
realistically raise the social status and material benefits of 
intellectuals, and give full play to their role in reform, 
opening up, and the modernization drive. 
  9. Achieve a Breakthrough in the Renovation of Single-Story 
Houses To Further Improve People's Living Standard 
  Seizing the opportunity to accelerate development, in the 
final analysis, depends on the enthusiasm, initiative, 
creativity, wisdom, and forces of the masses. Without them, 
everything will be out of the question. When the masses are 
plunging themselves into reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive with high spirit, we should all the more 
show concern for their vital interests and exert utmost efforts 
to do practical work for them. All our leading cadres come from 
the masses and are at the service of the people. At no time and 
under no circumstances should they forget the masses. They 
should put themselves in the position of the masses and work for 
them. They should step up the work urgently needed by the 
masses and create favorable conditions for doing the work for 
which conditions are lacking for the time being. Regarding the 
work most urgent in people's lives, in particular, they should 
not wait until the revenue is improved or the economy is 
promoted to a new height. They should adopt every means to carry 
it out and truly regard the difficulties of the masses as the 
focus of their work. 
  Housing, income, children's education, and public security 
are the issues the masses are currently most concerned about. 
Due to numerous reasons, Tianjin still has many dilapidated 
single-story houses, where many people are living. There are 
even some houses where three generations live together, sweating 
in the summer and freezing in the winter. If we remain 
indifferent to this, serving the people will become an empty 
talk, the endeavor to accelerate development will have no 
appeal, and the image and prestige of the party and the 
government among the masses will be damaged. This is a serious 
issue. We should also note that speeding up the renovation of 
dilapidated single-story houses cannot only directly benefit the 
masses but it can also lead to the improvement of urban traffic 
conditions, the renovation of the old city proper, the 
construction of infrastructural facilities, and the development 
of the tertiary industry, increase urban employment 
opportunities, and raise the degree of urban civilization. It 
is a good thing that has plenty of benefits and a major measure 
to make the city prosper and the people happy. We should 
enhance understanding and confidence and race against the time 
to carry it out. 
  In 1994, we launch the first battle to rebuild the 
one-storey houses. We must be successful in the first battle. 
Six districts in the municipality should set historical records 
in the number of areas where houses are dismantled and the 
people have to move to other places because of the 
reconstruction, the number of construction areas, and the number 
of newly built houses. A total of 2.795 million square meters 
of houses should be built this year. All districts should ensure 
to achieve this target. We should try every possible means to 
increase the use of foreign capital. We should timely sum up 
experiences, revise and perfect policies, and attract more 
foreign businessmen to engage in the reconstruction of 
one-storey houses. All supporting units should take the overall 
situation into consideration, care for the weal and woe of the 
people, strive to reduce various expenses, and make up no 
excuses to gain profits from the reconstruction of one-storey 
houses. According to the requirements of the overall urban 
planning, we should ensure that the construction designs are 
new, carefully organize construction, and guarantee the 
construction quality so the masses are satisfied. We should 
achieve the work in such channels as dismantling old houses, 
having the people move to other places, exchanging houses, and 
returning to newly built houses; handle affairs strictly 
according to policies; make the accomplishments visible to the 
public; and end various kinds of unhealthy tendencies. We 
should conscientiously treat and appropriately handle the 
problems that the masses have complaints and carefully 
accomplish the good things. It is necessary to organically link 
the reconstruction of one-storey houses with the deepening of 
the housing reform coordinately in line with policies and to 
encourage and guide the masses to accurately understand that the 
individuals must undertake reasonable burden. It is necessary 
to eliminate administrative interference and monopoly and to 
open bidding and make competition on equal terms in 
participating in the reconstruction of one-storey houses and 
developing the real estate industry. 
  At the time of accelerating the reconstruction of dangerous, 
shabby, and one-storey houses, the leading cadres at various 
levels should experience in various aspects the weal and woe of 
the masses and do more good deeds to help the people with 
difficulties. Particularly, we should try every possible means 
to help the enterprises whose production has wholly or partially 
been suspended, the staff members and workers with low income, 
and those with living difficulties; provide necessary relief for 
the households with special difficulties; and ensure that all 
households can live a good life. We should adopt necessary 
measures to make the markets flourish and stabilize the prices 
of goods. We should persistently do 20 deeds to improve the 
livelihood of the urban and rural people and mainly do the 
things that can directly benefit the people and that are closely 
related to the people. It is necessary to continuously 
strengthen the overall improvement of social order, deal strict 
blows to various criminal activities, and make the people live 
in peace and contentment. 
  10. Be Inspired With Enthusiasm And Creatively Carry Our 
Work. 
  The key to making a high start in the 1994 work and to 
making 
new changes in various aspects hinges on the leading cadres at 
various levels. It is not easy to create a new situation. The 
situation is pressing. There are no routes of retreat. With 
new ideas, new field of vision, greater courage, and greater 
boldness, we should carry forward the spirit of pioneering 
undertakings in the new situation and guide the broad masses of 
the people to create a new situation in accelerating the pace of 
development. 
  It is necessary to emancipate the mind. To make new headway 
in our work, we should emancipate the mind. To emphasize the 
emancipation of the mind, the leading cadres should be the first 
in emancipating the mind, handle affairs resolutely in line with 
the ideological line of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, thoroughly free 
themselves from the restrictions of rigid and outdated ideas, 
foster new ideas, and have the daring to be the first in the 
world. We should give free reins and have the daring to do the 
things that are conducive to the development of Tianjin and lose 
no good opportunities. To emphasize the necessity to emancipate 
the mind, we should see real results in our work. The leading 
cadres at various levels occupy important positions. So, their 
work performances not only have the bearing on their own 
political achievements but also are related to the personal 
interests of the 9 million people in the municipality. Facing 
the heavy tasks, we cannot spend 1994 easily and steadily. We 
should be ready to perspire, use energy, and lose weight. Some 
comrades think that the tasks are heavy and they bear heavy 
pressure. It is normal. The situation must not be submitted to 
us. On the contrary, we should consciously suit the 
requirements for the development of the situation. We should 
think out new methods, pioneer new ways, vie with one another to 
do things, select and bear heavy burden, do several concrete 
deeds, and live up to the expectations of the party and the 
people. 
  We should dare to aim high and win the first place. In 
assessing the work in various fields, we should not compare 
ourselves with what was achieved in the past, but should compare 
with the advanced places in the nation and with the standards 
the municipalities should attain. Tianjin dwellers are not 
foolish, and those who are seated here will also not admit that 
they are more foolish than others. Tianjin dwellers are able to 
do a big cause. We should persist in high standards and set 
strict demands on the work in all fields, should have a strong 
spirit of admitting no defeat and a spirit of working with all 
our might. The time cannot be delayed and all work should be 
done hurriedly to create a first- class work. 
  We should stress on overall situation and unity. 
Accelerating development is precisely the overall situation. 
All our speeches and actions should subject to this overall 
situation. The entire municipality should develop according to 
a unified plan, and all the people there should make encouraging 
remarks and support each other to form a concerted power. All 
the remarks that are detrimental to unity should not be made, 
and all the things that are detrimental to unity should not be 
done. We should advocate the selfless spirit, face up to 
difficulties, yield convenience to others, render service to 
lower levels, find out shortcomings among ourselves, and 
concentrate our efforts on our own work. We should 
comprehensively carry out the system of being responsible for 
attaining one's own work targets. We should give assignments to 
everyone and let each level assume responsibility for its own 
work. For the major matters that have a bearing on the overall 
situation, we should allow everyone to air his views and listen 
to the opinions of the masses before making policy decisions. 
Once a policy is determined, it should be executed resolutely 
to ensure its smooth implementation. 
  We should fully believe and depend on the masses. Over the 
past several years, Tianjin has given rise to the basic work 
idea of "doing everything for the people and relying on the 
people to do everything." This idea must be carried forward. 
On the final analysis, we must depend on the masses to fulfill 
this year's arduous tasks and to realize our fighting goals. 
Our determination and our methods are all from the aspirations 
and wisdom of the masses. In establishing the socialist market 
economic structure, we will certainly meet many new 
circumstances and new problems. Under such a situation, leading 
cadres at all levels must frequently go deep into the 
grass-roots areas to set off the atmosphere of conducting 
investigation and study and avoid subjectivism and making 
mistakes that should not be made. We should make best possible 
use of our political advantages and extensively launch voluntary 
labor activities in order to fully mobilize the initiative of 
the masses and reasonably exploit their initiative. 
  For the overall situation of accelerating the development of 
Tianjin, and for the common interest of the people in Tianjin, 
we should eliminate all resistance and should not hold on to a 
post without doing any work. The basic quality of the ranks of 
our cadres is good, and the overwhelming majority of our cadres 
are competent. We sincerely hope that all cadres will stand the 
test, perform their duties on their posts, run forward every 
day, and make their due contributions to garner the support of 
the masses. 
  While concentrating on carrying out reform, opening up, and 
economic work, we should attach importance to the work of 
propaganda, culture, public health, sports, environmental 
protection, and family planning, and should strengthen the 
building of spiritual civilization, socialist democracy, and the 
legal system with a view to effecting a comprehensive progress 
in society. 
  Nineteen ninety four is an extremely important year to the 
acceleration of Tianjin's development. The people's aspirations 
are ardent and the tasks are arduous. Let us closely rally 
around the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
the nucleus. Let us unite as one, struggle arduously, and truly 
attend to practical work under the correct leadership of the 
municipal party committee in order to win a new victory in 
Tianjin's reform, opening up, and various other undertakings in 
1994!

  [Text] The municipal party committee and government held a 
meeting of district, county, and bureau leading cadres on 15 
March to relay the guidelines of the third plenary session of 
the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, State Council's 
work conference on opposing corruption, and the important 
speeches of Comrades Jiang Z emin and Li Peng and to arrange 
Tianjin's 1994 anticorruption struggle. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, and 
Li Shenglin, deputy secretary of the municipal party committee 
and executive vice mayor of Tianjin, gave speeches. 
  Attending were municipal leading comrades Li Jianguo, Liu 
Fengyan, Fang Fengyou, Li Huifen, Song Pingshun, Luo Yuanpeng, 
Zheng Zhiying, Lu Xuezheng, Zhang Haosheng, Wang Dehui, Li 
Changxing, Huang Yanzhi, and Zhang Guanwen. 
  In his speech, Gao Dezhan reviewed and appraised Tianjin's 
anticorruption work carried out in the previous period. He 
said: Party committees and governments at all levels in the 
municipality have conscientiously implemented the central 
guidelines and the arrangements of the municipal party committee 
and government, remained firm in attitude and quick in action, 
adopted realistic measures, and carried out plenty of work. The 
vast number of party members, cadres, and the masses have shown 
wholehearted support and actively participated in the 
anticorruption struggle. Thanks to the concerted efforts of all 
fields, Tianjin has created a good trend in the anticorruption 
struggle, developed it in a healthy manner, and by and large met 
the central requirements, thus achieving good results for that 
period. 1) Good results have been achieved in waging special 
campaigns to tackle specific problems and in correcting 
unhealthy trends. Tianjin has started early and exerted earnest 
efforts in the work to check collection of unwarranted fees, 
fines, and donations and thus has achieved notable results. It 
has conducted thorough investigations on the problem of 
travelling abroad and beyond the border with public funds. 
Meanwhile, it has drawn up clear stipulations to ensure strict 
examination and approval, thus preventing some groups from 
visiting abroad in violation of the stipulations. The work to 
examine the businesses developed by party and government organs 
is being carried out in an active and prudent manner, and about 
a half of the business entities have severed their ties with 
these organs or have been closed down. Other unhealthy trends 
have also been effectively checked. 2) Leading cadres have 
gained more initiative in remaining honest and self-disciplined. 
Leading bodies at and above the county or section level in the 
municipality have extensively held inner-party democratic 
meetings to examine and correct themselves in line with the five 
regulations on honesty and self-discipline. Problems, such as 
holding concurrent jobs in economic entities of various types, 
accepting money and marketable securities as gifts, applying for 
membership cards and credit cards with public funds, and buying 
enterprise shares to be sold within the enterprises only, have 
been solved. 3) Substantial progress has been made in 
investigating and handling major and serious cases. Discipline 
inspection commissions at all levels investigated 852 discipline 
breaches committed by party members in the whole year, and 
concluded 680 of them. Procuratorial organs investigated and 
handled 330 major and serious cases on embezzlement and 
bribe-taking and publicly pronounced judgments on nine major 
economic criminals. The initial success in Tianjin's 
anticorruption struggle has enhanced people's confidence in 
opposing corruption and their trust in the party and government, 
thus playing a positive role in safeguarding social stability, 
promoting reform and opening up, and facilitating economic 
development. Although fairly good results have been achieved in 
the anticorruption struggle for the previous period, leaders at 
all levels should remain clearheaded and never overestimate the 
results. Our work is still falling rather far behind when 
considering the existing problems and the demands of the masses. 
Development of work has been uneven in different departments 
and different units. Some good results have yet to be 
consolidated, and any slack efforts might lead to a setback. We 
should not only realistically affirm the achievements in the 
previous anticorruption struggle, but also we should note that 
corrupt phenomena are still serious, and we should continue our 
painstaking work and never take them lightly or slacken our 
efforts, even in the slightest degree. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: The general demand on Tianjin's 
1994 anticorruption work is that we should persistently take 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the guide, 
take the initiative in subjecting ourselves to and serving the 
overall interest of the work of the entire party, continue to 
implement the central decision on the anticorruption struggle, 
carry out the new content of the struggle put forward by the 
Central Discipline Inspection Commission while consolidating the 
achievements already won, and continue the anticorruption 
struggle in an in-depth, sustained, and more effective manner. 
Regarding its anticorruption struggle for this year, Tianjin 
should continue to do a good job in cadres' honesty and 
self-discipline, in investigating and handling major and serious 
cases, and in correcting the unhealthy trends in various trades 
and, based on the characteristics of the situation, add new 
content to these three aspects of work and conscientiously carry 
them out. 
  First, regarding leading cadres' honesty and 
self-discipline, 
leading cadres at and above the county (section) level of party 
and government organs in the municipality should strictly 
enforce the various regulations of the party Central Committee 
and the State Council on improving party style and honesty in 
performance of official duties. The five regulations on honesty 
and self- discipline put forward by the party Central Committee 
last year should be further implemented. Comrades who did not 
conduct self-examination and self-correction based on the 
regulations and those who had problems but did not report or 
correct them should take remedial measures. Regarding the 
problems exposed after the self-examination which have not been 
addressed, we should step up efforts to properly deal with them 
in line with the relevant documents of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission. The above-mentioned work should be 
conscientiously carried out by the end of April. After this, all 
violations of the "five regulations" which are not reported by 
the persons concerned after the self-examination and 
self-correction, but are exposed by the masses and those 
committed again after the issuance of the "decision of the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council on the several tasks of 
the anticorruption struggle to be successfully carried out in 
the near future" should be strictly dealt with. While 
continuing to enforce the "five regulations," we should 
conscientiously enforce another five regulations put forward by 
the central authorities this year. 
  1. It is prohibited to purchase cars in violation of 
regulations or replace them with imported luxury ones; it is 
prohibited to abuse power to exchange cars with and borrow cars 
from enterprises or subordinating units or collect money from 
them to buy cars; it is prohibited to use loans, the money 
collected from people, and funds for special projects to buy 
cars for leading cadres; and district and county party and 
government leading organs and units which owe wages to their 
staff members and workers are prohibited from buying cars. 
  2. It is not permitted to buy houses at reduced prices in 
violation of the State Council regulations on housing reform; it 
is not permitted to abuse power to provide preferential terms 
for oneself or one's children, relatives, and friends to buy 
houses; and it is not permitted to decorate one's house in 
excess of the established standards with public funds. 
  3. Leading cadres should use simple cars and take few people 
with them during domestic official activities, and their 
accommodations should not exceed the local standards for 
reception; and no special dance parties should be held for them. 
  4. It is not allowed to take the opportunity of the 
marriage, 
funeral, job transfer, birthday, and house moving of oneself and 
one's family members to give lavish parties and spend without 
restraint, still less to use public funds and materials for such 
activities or to earn money from them. 
  5. It is not permitted to abuse power to refuse to return 
public funds; and it is not permitted to use public funds to buy 
or build houses for oneself and one's relatives and friends and 
to engage in profit making. 
  Leading cadres at and above the county (section) level 
should 
earnestly conduct self-examination and self-correction based on 
the above-mentioned five regulations. We should hold the 
democratic meetings at high standard, refrain from vague, 
general discussions, and conscientiously address problems. We 
should immediately conduct examination of our own accord and 
rapidly correct mistakes if any. Leading cadres of enterprises 
and institutions should also remain honest and self-disciplined, 
abide by laws and discipline, and oppose abuse of power for 
selfish gains, embezzlement, bribe-taking, spending without 
restraint, and numerous negative and corrupt phenomena. Leaders 
of loss-making enterprises, in particular, must share weal and 
woe with their staff members and workers and receive the same 
treatment with workers concerning wage decreases and basic 
living expenses. Loss-making enterprises unable to pay wages to 
their workers are strictly prohibited from buying high-class 
cars, and their leaders are prohibited from going abroad for 
inspection or giving parties in excess of the established 
standards. 
  Second, regarding investigations and handling of cases, we 
should concentrate efforts on major and serious cases, 
particularly the cases on embezzlement, bribe-taking, and abuse 
of power for selfish gains committed by leading cadres, the 
malpractice, bribe-taking, and other law and discipline breaches 
committed by law- and discipline-enforcing personnel, and the 
law and discipline breaches committed by legal persons. We 
should step up efforts in handling cases and speed up the 
progress. We should, in particular, step up efforts to 
investigate and handle the major and serious cases involving 
leading cadres and never procrastinate. 
  Third, in correcting the unhealthy trends in some trades, 
the 
general demand is that we should consolidate and develop the 
achievements won last year in correcting the unhealthy trends 
and, on this basis, correct three unhealthy trends thoroughly 
and effectively in line with the new arrangements of the central 
authorities. 1) We should conscientiously correct the practice 
of the personnel of party and government organs who abuse power 
to use, without compensation, the money and property of 
enterprises to suit the purposes of their organs or of their 
own. 2) We should investigate the allocation of enterprise 
funds in various excuses to serve as the private coffers of 
units and the indiscriminate issuance of bonuses. 3) We should 
resolutely check the unhealthy trend of asking for donations 
from enterprises in various excuses. All departments should 
adopt effective measures to solve their problems well. We 
should also make great efforts to check the lavish wining and 
dining and vulgar gift-giving that the masses bitterly hate and 
achieve good results in this. 
  Gao Dezhan urged: Leading comrades at all levels must study 
and master the guidelines of the important speeches of Comrades 
Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, deepen their understanding of the 
importance of the anticorruption struggle, and have more 
initiative in this work. They should deepen their understanding 
of the importance of opposing corruption from the perspective of 
upholding the party's nature and its basic purpose of serving 
the people wholeheartedly, the perspective of consolidating the 
party's position as a ruling party, and the perspective of 
ensuring the overall interests of the work of the entire party 
and entire work. 
  Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should conscientiously strengthen 
leadership over the anticorruption struggle and study documents 
well. Leading bodies of departments, committees, offices, 
districts, counties, bureaus, enterprises, and institutions 
should devote enough time to the study of the speeches of 
central leading comrades, the requirements of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council, and the arrangements of the 
municipal party committee and government. Meanwhile, we should 
organize well the study of the cadres at and above the county 
level. Through the study, we should enhance understanding, 
master the guidelines, and have a good command of the overall 
situation and policies. Party and government leaders should 
make concerted efforts. Party committees and governments at all 
levels should continue to list the anticorruption work high in 
their agenda, and their principal leaders should attend to it 
personally. Every level should be responsible for the work of 
the next lower level to ensure implementation of work at every 
level. We should stress realistic results, check vague 
generalization, and oppose perfunctory work. We should 
conscientiously extend the system of responsibility for the 
anticorruption work targets. We should exert earnest efforts to 
tackle knotty problems and put forward specific time limits, 
progress, and work quality requirements. We should have a 
strict command of policies and conscientiously implement the 
guiding thoughts and the series of principles and policies 
defined by the central authorities. The anticorruption struggle 
should be geared to the overall interests of the work of the 
entire party and serve the promotion of reform, construction, 
and development and the safeguarding of social and political 
stability. We should intensify investigation and study, have a 
strict command of policies, and correctly distinguish and handle 
the two different types of contradictions. We should firmly 
rely on the masses in waging the anticorruption struggle, but we 
should not launch mass movements or have everybody make 
self-criticisms. We should encourage the people to report 
crimes. We should give full play to the role of democratic 
parties and the personages without party affiliation, organize 
them to participate in the implementation of the tasks related 
to the anticorruption struggle, and give more attention to their 
opinions and suggestions. The anticorruption struggle should be 
coordinated with the work to develop healthy trends. We should 
keep education in view and aim at improvement. Opposing 
corruption and advocating honesty is a strategic measure for the 
enduring order and stability of the country, not a stopgap 
measure. We should intensively and persistently educate party 
members and cadres on the basic purpose of serving the people 
wholeheartedly and the traditional work style of plain living 
and arduous struggle, maintain and develop the fine tradition of 
honesty in performing official duties and diligence in serving 
the people, and develop honesty and diligence simultaneously. 
This is the necessary demand on the purpose of serving the 
people wholeheartedly. Only with honesty can we have stability, 
and only with diligence can we have hope. We should combine 
self-examination and self-correction with supervision. We 
should first strengthen the inner supervisory mechanism for 
opposing corruption and advocating honesty and, in the meantime, 
strengthen the supervision and restriction by the masses and 
various circles of society. We should persist in both stopgap 
and radical measures. Regarding the problems exposed, we should 
stem loopholes in a timely manner, improve systems, strengthen 
management, and establish and improve various policies and 
rules. We should fully develop the functional role of 
discipline inspection and supervision departments. As 
discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels 
shoulder heavy responsibility for the anticorruption struggle, 
they should step up efforts to improve themselves and 
continuously raise their ideological and work levels. Party 
committees and governments at all levels should show concern for 
and support the work of discipline inspection, supervision, and 
judicial departments, coordinate the relationship between 
various sectors, check buck-passing, and rally their forces. 
  In conclusion, Gao Dezhan said: The situation we are faced 
with is very good, and our tasks are very arduous. We should 
firmly implement the basic principles for and the overall 
interests of the work of the entire party, unite more closely 
round the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as 
the core, conscientiously carry out the various arrangements of 
the party Central Committee and State Council, and continue to 
work hard and in a down-to-earth manner. In this way, we will 
continue to score new and greater achievements in Tianjin's 
reform, opening up, development, stability, anticorruption work, 
and the work to build a clean government. 
  Li Shenglin gave specific opinions on the work to correct 
unhealthy trends in some trades. He said: We should further 
consolidate and develop the achievements in this work. First, 
we should continue the great efforts in checking collection of 
unwarranted fees. All departments in the municipality should 
include this in their targets for management and have those in 
charge hold the responsibility for it. If problems arise, those 
in charge of the pertinent departments should be held 
accountable. Second, we should do a better job in severing the 
ties between party and government organs and the economic 
entities they run and make sure that this work is by and large 
completed by the end of June this year. Third, we should 
continue efforts to check the unhealthy trend of travelling to 
outside the country (the border) with public funds. Fourth, we 
should do a better job in reducing the burdens on peasants and 
never restore the unreasonable burdens that have been canceled 
as stipulated in explicit orders. 
  Li Shenglin pointed out: We should thoroughly and 
effectively correct these three unhealthy trends in line with 
the new requirements of the central authorities. All 
departments and units should make specific arrangements based on 
their reality. We should coordinate this work with leading 
cadres' endeavor to remain honesty and self-disciplined, with 
the endeavor to do practical work for enterprises and their 
workers, and with the endeavor to educate cadres on professional 
ethics and the awareness in the legal system. We must never 
allow continuous emergence of the unhealthy trends or refusal to 
correct them, still less must we allow retaliation against the 
enterprises and individuals who have reported problems.

<F P=106> [By Michael Smith and Jim Cheung] </F>
  [Text] Anger over China's sentencing of a local reporter 
to 12 years' imprisonment mounted yesterday with more than 80 
journalists demonstrating outside the Xinhua News Agency to call 
for their colleague's release. The protest came 24 hours after 
China confirmed Ming Pao reporter Xi Yang had been imprisoned 
for spying and stealing state secrets. 
  Hong Kong journalists were joined by the international media 
yesterday who condemned the sentence as too severe and a breach 
of human rights. The Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) 
will launch an investigation into the events that led to Xi's 
arrest. They want to discover why he returned to China after 
saying he feared for his safety there. 
  Close friends and colleagues of Xi told The HONGKONG 
STANDARD 
that months before his arrest he had pleaded with his editors to 
be allowed to return to Hong Kong. They said Xi was being 
constantly followed by four Public Security officers but his 
concern went unheeded by Ming Pao's editors. 
  The newspaper denied the claims on Monday but yesterday a 
senior Ming Pao source confirmed Xi had expressed his concerns 
to the paper in June or July last year. The source added that 
Xi was only sent back to China after receiving official 
permission to join a delegation covering economic development in 
the northeast of the country. "He went through all the proper 
application procedures and followed all the rules applying to 
Hong Kong journalists," the source said. 
  The vice-chairman of the HKJA, Kevin Lau, said the events 
surrounding Xi's return to China were still unclear. "What we 
want to find out objectively is if there were any signals that 
he was in danger before the arrest," Mr Lau said. "That is an 
important mystery. We have been trying but no one has been able 
to talk to Xi Yang direct... only he will be able to provide 
truthful information." 
  Journalists outside the Xinhua building yesterday accused 
the 
Chinese authorities of jeopardising the future of press freedom 
in the territory after 1997. 
  HKJA chairman Daisy Li said Mr Xi's sentence had shocked 
Hong 
Kong and Taiwanese journalists working in China. She said 
China's state secret laws were too vague. 
  Journalists have written a letter to China's Premier Li Peng 
demanding an open and fair trial for Xi's appeal. They have 
also launched a three-day signature campaign calling for his 
release. 
  Journalists plan to lobby the Chinese-appointed Hong Kong 
affairs advisers and local deputies to the mainland's 
legislature in a bid to get a full account of Xi's case. The 
chairman of the 123 Democratic Alliance, Lawrence Yum, said 
China had violated human rights and its own legal system. 
  And lecturer in journalism at the Hong Kong Baptist College, 
To Yiu-ming, warned the laws that led to Xi's arrest could be 
extended to Hong Kong after 1997.

  [Text] Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] Vice Chairman Kao 
Kung-lien said Tuesday [5 April] that the Thousand Islands Lake 
incident has an negative factor on relations between Taiwan and 
mainland China. He urged Peking to handle the matter in a 
practical and sincere fashion. 
  Thirty-two people, including 24 members of a Taiwanese 
tourist group, were killed when the tourist boat exploded in 
flames while crossing the lake in eastern mainland China last 
Thursday. The victims' bodies were recovered from the cabin of 
the (Haijui) on Thousand Islands Lake in central Chekiang 
[Zhejiang] Province. The lake is about 200 kilometers west of 
Hangchou [Hangzhou] City. 
  Kao requested that the mainland permit family members of the 
Taiwan victims to take pictures of the remains. He said that 
Peking should also allow officials of Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation [SEF] to extend humanitarian aid at the site of the 
accident and let Taiwan reporters cover the accident on the spot. 
  So far, the mainland has been criticized for its attempt to 
cover up the incident.

  [Text] The ROC [Republic of China] Navy plans to complete 
its modernization of its ancient fleet by 2001 to meet the 
military threat from Mainland China. The Navy document 
presented to lawmakers envisions a seven-year plan to modernize 
the Navy by building new ships in Taiwan and buying more 
advanced vessels from abroad. 
  The document says Mainland China now has 2,640 ships and is 
planning to build aircraft carriers. The naval document says 
three Taiwan-made 4,200-ton anti-submarine missile frigates 
built with U.S. technologies have been launched and five more 
will go into service by 2001. They are to replace some of the 
24 destroyers bought from the United States some 40 years ago. 
In 1991, Taiwan signed a contract to buy six 1,200-ton 
Lafayette frigates from France and to build 10 similar vessels 
on its own with French technologies. In addition, the Navy 
plans to build 12 500-ton petrol boats to strengthen Taiwan's 
coast guard.

  [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Taipei travel agencies are 
preparing a boycott of tours to Mainland China in protest over 
the rude and unjust handling of a boat accident which left 24 
Taiwan tourists dead. 
  The entire tour group and eight mainlanders died in a 
suspicious fire during a cruise of Thousand Island Lake in 
Zhejiang Province March 31. The disappearance of the money 
carried by the victims and the mysterious nature of the deaths 
point to foul play. 
  News of the mishap was supressed for two days and all 
reporters have been barred from the site where the charred 
corpses are being stored. 
  Announcing the boycott, Hsu Chin-jui, chairman of the Taipei 
Association of Travel Agents, said travel agents are indignant 
at the insensitive and rude treatment afforded victims' 
relatives by mainland authorities. 
  The mainland authorities rejected all requests by the 
relatives including to see the ship where the accident occurred 
and to ship the corpses back to Taiwan for burial or cremation, 
he said. 
  Hsu added that the boycott will begin soon after association 
members decide on a date. 
  President of the Republic of China [ROC] and Kuomingtang 
Chairman Li Teng-hui, commenting on the incident, said Wednesday 
[6 April] that the ruling party should express its grave concern 
about the accident through proper channels. 
  Li called for appropriate handling of the victims remains 
and 
adequate assistance for their relatives. 
  Meanwhile, opposition legislator Chen Shui-bian suggested 
that Taiwan designate Mainland China a "high risk" area and urge 
people to avoid travel there until mainland authorities 
satisfactorily explain the incident. 
  Legislator Chou Po-lun also called for an across-the-board 
cut in communication with the mainland until authorities there 
present acceptable reparations for a recent spate of incidents 
involving Taiwan tourists.

was quoted as saying on Monday [4 April] that President Li 
Teng-hui's visits to foreign countries are intended to expand 
the ROC's [Republic of China] diplomatic relations, not to

  The president is scheduled to visit Costa Rica and South 
Africa for presidential inauguration ceremonies next month. It 
will be his second overseas trip this year. 
  Tai told reporters that President Li's visit abroad is to 
seek international cooperation so as to help decrese the 
hostility between Taiwan and the mainland. He was quoted as 
saying Taiwan and the mainland should act like brothers, not 
like father and son, and the two sides should help each other 
bring about a new China. Regarding his recent trips to the 
Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand, Tai said the trip was not 
meant to poison relations between Peking [Beijing] and the three 
nations. Instead, Tai stressed, Taiwan is seeking more economic 
cooperation with those countries.

  [Text] Taipei, April 5 (CNA) -- Thanks to its outstanding 
export performance in recent years, the information industry has 
overtaken the electronics industry to become the backbone of 
Taiwan's export business, sources said here Tuesday [5 April]. 
  Taiwan's info product exports totaled nearly U.S.$10 bill on 
last year, and the figure is expected to climb by 15 percent 
this year, the semi official Information Industry Institute 
said, adding that Taiwan is already the world's No. 1 producer 
of several info products such as monitors and motherboards. 
  In contrast to the booming information industry, the once 
flourishing electronics industry experienced a big decline in 
exports last year. 
  Statistics made public by the Industrial Technology Research 
Institute (ITRI) show that exports of consumer electronics 
products dropped by 16.9 percent last year from 1992 to 
U.S.$1.29 billion, with items such as electronic clocks and 
watches, audio-visual equipment, video games, and calculators 
posting the biggest falls. 
  However, imports of those items in 1993 surged by 5.7 
percent 
from a year ago to more than U.S.$1 billion, indicating that the 
industrial upgrading by local manufacturers has fallen short of 
the public's expectations, and that fierce competition from 
Southeast Asian countries has strained the market, an ITRI 
official said. 
  He said many local manufacturers of traditional, low-end 
electronics products have been forced to relocate their 
production sites overseas to cut down on costs, which is the 
main factor behind the continuous decline in exports of those 
items by Taiwan makers. 
  The manufacturers who have chosen to stay in Taiwan, he 
said, 
must start producing more value-added products in order to 
survive, and need to spend more money on software development 
rather than simply acting as manufacturers for foreign buyers.

  [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan's inflation rate 
reached 3.4 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter of this 
year, approaching the government-set 3.5 percent ceiling, a 
cabinet-level agency reported Wednesday. 
  The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics 
(DGBAS) said the relatively high inflation during the 
January-March period mainly resulted from substantial price 
hikes in February fueled by a pre-lunar new year buying spree. 
  Consumer prices declined slightly in March, the directorate 
said. The consumer price index (CPI), which measures price 
changes from 1991 when the index was 100, stood at 110.02 last 
month, down 0.2 percent from February, the agency noted. 
  It attributed the decline mainly to drops in clothing and 
floral prices as well as service fees following the end of the 
lunar new year holidays. 
  Compared with March 1993, the annual inflation rate was 3.39 
percent, DGBAS officials said. The rise was attributed to a 
6.23 percent hike in education and entertainment bills, a 4.92 
percent surge in housing rents and baby-sitting charges, a 3.03 
percent increase in food prices and a 2.12 percent advance in 
medical bills, the officials said. 
  Meanwhile, wholesale prices and import prices also rose in 
March, up 0.37 percent and 2.19 percent from the year-earlier 
levels because of a slight depreciation of the new taiwan dollar 
against the U.S. greenback. 
  The export price index, however, declined 0.37 percent in 
March when compared with the year before, according to DGBAS 
tallies. 
  For the January-March period, wholesale and import prices 
edged up 1.11 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively, from 
year-earlier levels, while export prices dropped by an average 
of 1.54 percent.

  [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] will continue to strive for closer economic cooperation 
with Southeast Asian countries as part of its commitment to 
playing a more active role in Asia-Pacific economic development, 
Premier Lien Chan said Wednesday [6 April]. 
  Addressing the opening ceremony of the 29th Conference of 
Governors of the South East Asian Central Banks (SEACEN), Lien 
said the ROC now ranks high on the list of foreign investors in 
most SEACEN member nations and its bilateral trade with these 
countries has increased tremendously. 
  "Even though our overseas investments have shown a slight 
drop in the past couple of years," Lien said, "the ROC remains 
among the top three foreign investors in most of SEACEN member 
nations." 
  Lien said Taiwan will discuss the issue of double taxation 
and reach agreements on the promotion and protection investments 
with each of these countries. "We hope to reduce as much as 
possible the many obstacles to economic and trade interflow," he 
noted. 
  The premier continued that Taiwan is drawing up plans to 
eliminate restrictions on the establishment of financial 
institutions and their range of operations, to gradually relax 
the control of capital flow, and to encourage competition from 
more foreign financial institutions so as to further liberalize 
its financial markets. 
  "We are also cultivating talent, promoting a free flow of 
commodities and information, and making the best use of Taiwan's 
strategic location and economic conditions to develop the Taiwan 
area into a multinational operations center in the 
Asia-Pacific," Lien said. 
  He added Taiwan hopes to attract both domestic and foreign 
capital to create a bright future for Taiwan's economic 
development. 
  Speaking on the same occasion, Lord Kingsdown, former 
governor of the Bank of England, said the world has become 
steadily more inter- dependent and economically integrated. 
  Against this background, Kingsdown said, international 
monetary cooperation has become very important. He noted that 
the volume of international financial transactions has grown 
substantially in recent years. He cited as an example that 
United States cross- border transactions in bonds and equities 
grew from 2.8 percent of gross domestic products (GDP) in 1970 
to 92 percent of GDP in 1990. 
  Central bank governors and other senior financial officials 
from 10 SEACEN member states -- South Korea, the Philippines, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Nepal, 
Myanmar [Burma] and the host ROC -- attended the opening 
ceremony at the Taipei International Convention Center. 
  Central bank governors from Cambodia, Laos, Fiji and Tonga 
were also present at the meeting as observers. 
  This is the first time Taiwan has hosted the annual SEACEN 
conference. Taiwan became a full member of the forum in 1993. 
The government-level regional financial cooperation 
organization was founded in 1966. 
  The participants will review regional financial situations 
and discuss possible financial and economic cooperation projects 
over the next two days. A joint statement will be issued at the 
end of the annual conference Friday. 
  President Li Teng-hui is scheduled to receive the Southeast 
Asian central bank governors Thursday.

  [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Taiwan has mobilized its 
resources to fight a war against narcotics, which has already 
paid off handsomely, Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou said 
Wednesday [6 April]. 
  In 1993 alone, Ma pointed out, more than 6,400 kilograms of 
drugs were seized here. The amount far exceeds seizures 
recorded in previous years, he noted. 
  In addition, the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau 
has foiled a number of drug trafficking efforts with the help of 
international cooperation and information exchanges, he stressed. 
  As an international business operations center, Taiwan has 
been used by drug traffickers as a transshipment point, he added. 
  The minister pledged that the government would spare no 
effort in combating the drug problem. 
  Moreover, he said, Taiwan's anti-drug efforts have won 
recognition from the United States. 
  The 1993 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report 
issued by the U.S. State Department Monday said that authorities 
in Taiwan are increasingly involved in combating the rapidly 
growing drug abuse problem, and that Taiwan's drug laws are 
being strengthened. 
  "In 1993 there were no reports of corruption in connection 
with narcotics law enforcement in Taiwan," the report said. 
  Ma made these remarks while fielding questions at the 
Legislative Yuan. 
  Meanwhile, Director Wu tung-ming of the Investigation Bureau 
said that a report made by a U.S. House of Representatives 
delegation last year also praised Tawian's efforts in dealing 
with drug issues. The delegation visited Taiwan last August for 
an anti-drug meeting. 
  Taiwan has done a good job in customs inspection, Wu 
asserted, saying 14 percent of containers entering and leaving 
Taiwan are inspected, compared to the United States' 12 percent. 
  The war against narcotics calls for increased information 
exchanges and increased international cooperation, he stressed.

  [Text] Mainland China is spending big bucks in an attempt 
to buy diplomatic recognition from countries and bribing them to 
switch from Taipei to Peking [Beijing], the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs indicated in a recent report. 
  The ministry's report based on the mainland's diplomatic 
offensive from the period September 1993 to February 1994. It 
showed that Peking has written checks for a major amount of 
money to tempt the ROC's [Republic of China] diplomatic allies 
to switch recognition. Countries included in the list as being 
targeted by the mainland were Malawi, the Central African 
Republic, Haiti, (?Belize) and Niger. The mainland's money 
comes in the form of low interest loans among other things. 
Also, Peking is said to be using procurement strategy to gain 
influence through the purchase of the countries' goods and 
services toward the ROC's allies Costa Rica, Honduras, Paraguay, 
and the Dominian Republic. Meanwhile, in the case of countries 
which don't maintain official ties with Taipei, Peking block 
them from developing friendly relations with Taiwan (?under) 
unofficial relations by telling the nations to bear in mind that 
there is only one China and that Peking will not tolerate such 
relations with Taiwan which it considers as a renegade province.

  [Text] Qingdao, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Qingdao city, in East 
China's Shandong Province, well-known for its textile industry, 
has carried out a strategic economic shift to put stress on the 
chemical, machinery and electronics sectors. 
  According to Zhang Rongxiang, a top official in charge of 
the 
city's economic affairs, Qingdao poured more money into these 
fields last year, accounting for 49 percent of the province's 
total such investment, and 10 percent more than in textiles. 
  He said that 44 percent of the completed projects involved 
these industries, including a 1.2 billion-yuan oil refinery and 
an 80 million-yuan project which is to produce big-screen colour 
televisions. 
  Statistics show that last year the city fulfilled 675 
projects on technological improvement, which cost more than 2.8 
billion yuan. They are expected to increase the city's annual 
output value by 6.17 billion yuan. And they will bring in 692 
million yuan in profits and 167 million U.S. dollars in foreign 
exchange. 
  Zhang also said the city will encourage enterprises in the 
spheres of machinery, electronics and chemical industry to seek 
cooperation with big-name international conglomerates.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai, China's 
leading port, has scored a steady monthly increase in exports 
since the beginning of the year, according to the municipal 
foreign trade department. 
  The city's exports rose from 520 million U.S. dollars-worth 
in January to 550 million dollars-worth in February, and climbed 
further to 650 million dollars-worth in March, an official of 
the municipal commission of foreign economic co-operation and 
trade said. 
  Shanghai exported 1.75 billion dollars-worth of goods in the 
first quarter of 1994, up 22 percent over the same period of 
1993. 
  The official said that the municipal government has decided 
to take exports as the driving force behind shanghai's economic 
growth this year. 
  Exports are set to grow faster than in 1993 and faster than 
the city's gross domestic product in 1994, he said.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 5 (XINHUA) -- The State Science and 
Technology Commission has recently approved the establishment of 
a 50 million yuan, 213-hectare textile industrial city in East 
China's Shanghai Municipality. 
  It is intended to promote the introduction of foreign 
advanced technology and to lift the whole sector of the country 
to a new level. 
  The measure aims to give Shanghai, China's largest textile 
and economic center, an exemplary role for the whole country in 
the transformation of the traditional Chinese textile industry 
with overseas funds and technology. 
  Located in the eastern part of Qingpu County in Shanghai, 
the 
textile industrial city will be built with funds jointly 
provided by China Textile Association, Huayuan Corporation and 
local Qingpu government. 
  The whole construction project is planned to be completed in 
eight to ten years. 
  The textile industry in the city will possess all the 
features of advanced development, such as increased processing 
capacity of synthetic fibres, expansion of the output of textile 
products for purposes other than clothing, and close combination 
of textile industry with other sectors like commerce, foreign 
trade and finance. 
  Already, many transnational corporations, including Du Pont, 
of the United States, have signed contracts and letters of 
intent with the industrial city, with a total investment of 200 
million U.S. dollars involving large number of high-tech textile 
projects. 
  According to the general manager of the industrial city, 
this 
pillar industry of China's economy and exports has long been 
strained by surplus productivity, with 30 to 40 percent of its 
equipment lying idle, irrational production structure, low added 
value in exports and reduction of profits. 
  Transformation of the sector with the help of technological 
innovation and introduction of foreign funds has become urgent 
and the establishment of the industrial city is only the first 
step taken by the government.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 5 (XINHUA) -- A pension insurance 
system has just taken shape in Shanghai, marking the largest 
city as the leader among all Chinese regions in reforming the 
old retirement system. 
  Official sources here said four million workers of some 
20,000 enterprises and government organs, i.e. about four-fifths 
of the city's entire workforce, are now covered by the pension 
insurance. 
  Whereas pensions were paid to retirees solely by their 
employers under the old retirement system, the new premiums for 
pension insurance are shared between the government, employers 
and retirees. 
  This is believed to have saved a huge sum of pension money 
for those old state-owned enterprises with many retirees on the 
rolls. The city had about 1.66 million retirees at the end of 
1992, requiring a payment of 4.27 billion yuan in pension a year. 
  While this number of retirees already is equal to 32.5 
percent of those in employment, it is predicted that the city's 
pension budget would have to face a sharp rise in retirees in 
the coming 20 to 30 years. 
  The new system also makes pensions adjustable by the 
previous 
year's living costs index, thus reducing the risk of 
inflationary effects, the sources said. 
  From April 1 last year when the new pension system began to 
prevail, each retiree in Shanghai got 21.5 yuan a month as a 
compensation for price rises, which has resulted in total 
pensions in 1993 increasing by 19 percent over the total for 
1992. 
  The new pension system also removes or reduces an obstacle 
in 
changing jobs, for in the old days, since the length of 
employment was a primary factor in deciding one's pension money, 
job changing often risked pension decreases. 
  The premiums for pension insurance are now calculated at 
three percent of one's monthly salary in the previous year, the 
sources added.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The economic takeoff 
over the past 15 years has doubled the area of cities and towns 
in South China's Guangdong Province, according to the provincial 
construction department. 
  Cities and towns in Guangdong now cover a total area of 
1,676 
sq km and have a combined population of more than 19 million, 
accounting for 29 percent of the provincial population total, an 
official of the department said. 
  At the end of 1993 Guangdong had 41 cities with a combined 
area of 835 sq km and 1,462 towns with a total area of 841 sq 
km, he said. 
  He cited the Pearl River Delta and the Chaoshan Plain as the 
two most rapidly urbanizing areas in Guangdong. 
  For example, the delta, best known for its booming 
processing 
industry, has formed a network of 100 cities and towns, 
including the provincial capital of Guangzhou, the Shenzhen and 
Zhuhai Special Economic Zones, and the cities of Shunde, 
Dongguan, Zhongshan, Panyu, Foshan and Nanhai. 
  In recent years the 2,800-year-old city of Guangzhou has 
built the satellite towns of Wuyang, Tianhe, Jiangnan and 
Fangcun on the outskirts, doubling its urban area to 187 sq km. 
  "Guangdong now serves as a tourism, transportation, 
commercial and financial center for the whole of South China," 
the official said. 
  The construction has helped improve the living conditions of 
urban residents, he noted. 
  Apartment buildings with a total floor space of 168 million 
sq m have been completed over the past 15 years. As a result, 
the floor space per urban resident has risen to nearly 10 sq m 
from 5.4 sq m in 1979. 
  Since 1990 Guangdong's investment in urban infrastructure 
construction has risen at an annual rate of 104 percent, 
totaling 32.5 billion yuan. 
  In 1993 along Guangdong used 740 million yuan in foreign 
funds for urban construction, triple the total for the previous 
12 years. 
  He said that the provincial government plans to increase the 
number of cities to 50, and towns to 1,500 at the end of 1995, 
and the urban population is expected to reach 22 million at that 
time, he said.

3189): "Liuzhou Police Break Up Transnational Drug Trafficking 
Ring, Arresting 13 Criminals and Seizing Some 3 kg of Heroin"] 
  [Text] Nanning 26 Mar (WEN WEI PO) -- Liuzhou, in Guangxi, 
broke up a major transnational drug trafficking ring, arresting 
13 criminals, of whom two were Burmese. Some 2,800 grams of 
heroin and 30,000 yuan were seized, in addition to 280,000 yuan 
and $500 in counterfeit banknotes. 
  The drug was trafficked to the Chinese mainland from Burma 
via Yunnan, with the ultimate destinations of Guangzhou and Hong 
Kong. On their way via Liuzhou, the traffickers attempted to 
"open a new market" in that city. On 3 March, this ring of 
criminals wrapped some heroin in small packages, which they put 
into their pockets, and started peddling them on the street. 
They were promptly discovered, and reported to the police. 
  At around 1500, drug-trafficker Peng Zhiquan [1756 1809 
2938] 
was caught red-handed while making a deal with someone. Peng's 
house was searched, with the result that 120 grams of heroine, 
and a balance and a drug-packaging apparatus were discovered. 
  With clues provided by Peng, two other drug-traffickers -- 
Lin Guorong [2651 0948 2837], and Xu Zijun [6079 2655 0689] -- 
then were rounded up, with 140 grams of heroin seized. 
  In the wake of this operation, local public security cadres 
and policemen tracked down other accomplices by following clues 
in hot pursuit. One after another, the whole ring of drug 
traffickers was rounded up, including Long Minxiong [7893 2404 
7160], Dong Yunxiang [5516 0061 7449], He Ganmo [0149 1626 
7803], Zhang Zhijun [1728 1807 6511], Bao Dolong [0202 6670 
7893], and Yu Jiachang [0151 1367 2490]. In addition, 18 bricks 
of heroin weighing a total of 2,500 grams were seized, along 
with 280,000 yuan in counterfeit 100-yuan notes and $500 in 
counterfeit banknotes, as well as some 30,000 yuan of drug 
money, a gun, and a number of fake identification cards.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Foreign 
Minister Liu Huaqiu said here today that the diversity of the

  Speaking at the 50th session of the Economic and Social

equal. They should respect, open to and complement each other 
through enhanced cooperation. 
  The historical experience over the past 47 years has 
demonstrated that the most important contributing factor for the 
sustained progress in the Asia-Pacific is the firm seizure of 
the historical opportunity to seek progress amidst stability and 
facilitate development through reform, Liu stressed. 
  Over the past year, the Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed 
relative political stability, sustained economic growth, 
enhanced trading status, strong investment momentum and further 
expanded regional cooperation, Liu said. 
  "While acknowledging the sustained economic growth in the 
Asia- Pacific, we should not lose sight of the widening gap 
between the North and the South and the serious problem of 
uneven development in this region," Liu said. According to 
statistics of the Asian Development Bank and ESCAP, the region, 
with as many as 800 million people in abject poverty, accounts 
for two-thirds of the world's poverty-stricken population, he 
said. 
  In spite of the agreement reached in the Uruguay Round of 
GATT talks, trade protectionism, especially that against 
developing countries, has been on the rise, posing a threat to 
the healthy development of international trade, the Chinese vice 
foreign minister added. 
  As a result of poverty and a shortage of capital and 
technology, their infrastructure is mostly inadequate to meet 
actual needs and has already become a "bottleneck" or another 
constraint seriously impeding their economic and social 
development, Liu said, adding that in this sense, to convene a 
session on "infrastructure development as key to economic growth 
and regional economic cooperation" is very timely and necessary. 
  With a view to speeding up the infrastructure development 
and 
cooperation in this region, the Chinese delegation wishes to put 
forward the following propositions: 
  1. Infrastructure development should be tailored to national 
conditions. 
  2. Sources of finance should be explored further in order to 
raise funds for infrastructure development. 
  3. Infrastructure development calls for intensified efforts 
to develop human resources. 
  4. The international community and the developed countries 
in 
particular, should give vigorous support to infrastructure 
development. 
  5. Infrastructure development requires extensive regional 
cooperation. 
  "We stand ready to have closer cooperation with others", Liu 
further said. "We hope to see China's reentry into GATT as 
contracting party at an earlier date, which will further promote 
trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit," he added.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
should take positive and pragmatic steps to cast aside man-made 
obstacles and make joint efforts with China to push forward the 
bilateral trade and economic relations, Chinese Minister of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said here today on 
the eve of her U.S. trip. 
  China's sustained, fast and healthy economic growth and its 
grandiose development plan will create even more favorable trade 
and investment opportunities for U.S. enterprises, the minister 
told XINHUA in an exclusive interview barely a week before she 
starts her U.S. trip with a trade delegation. 
<H5>  JCCT Session Important </H5>
  Wu said that the most important thing during her mission is 
to co-chair, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, the 
Eighth Session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and 
Trade (JCCT), scheduled for April 13-14 in Washington, D.C.. 
  The annual government-level meeting is a most important 
occasion for discussing bilateral economic and trade relations 
and other related issues, she said. It represents another major 
event following the Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle and the 
talks between finance and foreign ministers of the two countries. 
  She revealed that during the forthcoming session, the two 
sides will discuss trade and investment policies, and 
cooperation and issues concerning legal matters in such areas as 
information, energy, transportation, chemical industry and 
environmental cooperation. 
  The Chinese delegation will hold trade and investment 
symposiums in Los Angeles and New York on April 11 and 19 
respectively, she said. 
<H5>  More Investment Projects </H5>
  China will offer about 800 investment projects for 
discussion 
at the symposiums to be jointly sponsored by the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the U.S. law firm Graham 
and James, and the U.S. Asian Association. 
  It will be China's largest trade and investment promotion 
activity to be held in the United States so far. 
  The Chinese trading group will be made up of senior 
officials, experts and business executives from eight ministries 
and commissions of the State Council, three national 
corporations and 26 provinces and municipalities. 
  The projects to be offered include the construction of 
hydroelectric and thermal power stations, highways, railways, 
airports and wharfs and projects in industrial raw materials for 
the machine-building and electronic equipment, electronics, 
petrochemical and metallurgical industries as well as in 
agriculture, livestock breeding and forestry. 
  The trading group also plans to buy U.S. goods worth 
hundreds 
of millions of U.S.dollars. 
<H5>  Obstacles </H5>
  The minister said that bilateral trade and U.S. investment 
in 
China have grown continuously in recent years despite some 
problems that have cropped out from time to time. 
  According to statistics from the General Administration of 
Customs of China, the bilateral trade jumped from 2.45 billion 
U.S. dollars in 1979 to 27.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, a 
rise of more than 11-fold. 
  The number of U.S.-funded projects in China has topped 8,000 
in the same period, involving a total investment agreed upon 
reaching 11 billion U.S. dollars, topping the list of all 
foreign investment. More than 50 of the top 500 U.S. firms have 
opened businesses in China. 
  She said that a major reason for the rapid development of 
bilateral trade and cooperation is the fact that the two 
economies are highly supplementary to each other. 
  If the bilateral trade and cooperation are to further 
develop, Wu Yi said, the U.S. side should take further steps to 
remove man-made obstacles. 
  This includes the lifting of the control on U.S. technology 
export to China, the resumption of financing to feasibility 
studies for projects undertaken by the U.S. Trade Development 
Agency, the resumption of risk guarantee by the private U.S. 
Investment Co. for U.S. Investment in China, and the resumption 
of preferential loans by the American Import and Export Bank to 
relevant construction projects in China. 
  "Such actions will help further tap the vast potential of 
China's imports from the U.S. and the U.S. investment in China," 
Wu said. 
  MFN and GATT 
  On the most-favored-nation (MFN) status, Wu said, as a 
purely 
trade issue, it should not be entangled up with issues with 
which it has nothing to do. 
  A proper handling of MFN status is an important condition 
for 
the further development of the bilateral trade and economic 
cooperation, the minister stressed. 
  China has long opposed the practice of linking MFN status to 
human rights issues, as views on human rights differ greatly 
from country to country, she added. 
  China and the United States have differences of views on the 
human rights issue and they may discuss them through other 
channels on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference in 
each other's internal affairs and seeking common ground while 
preserving differences, the Chinese minister stressed. The two 
sides should in no way let this non-trade factor to stand in the 
way of furthering the bilateral trade and economic cooperation. 
  On the issue of China's restoration of its contracting party 
status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Wu 
said that major progress was made in the 16th session of the 
GATT working party on China last month. 
  During the session, most GATT members voiced their support 
for China's early re-entry into GATT, Wu said. The United 
States had promised to firmly support China's re-entry into GATT 
and China hopes that United States will "keep its promise and be 
as good as its word".

  [Text] Beijing, 30 March (XINHUA) -- Recently, the 
Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee and the 
General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] have jointly issued the "Circular on Commending the Units 
Advanced in the Army-Civilian Joint Activity of Building 
Socialist Spiritual Civilization" and have called on all 
localities and PLA units to launch the Army-civilian joint 
activity of building civilized units in an even more profound 
and realistic manner in a bid to provide spiritual motivation 
and intellectual support for reform, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  The "circular" states: Since the third plenary session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, advocated by Deng Xiaoping and 
other veteran proletarian revolutionaries, the Army and the 
civilians throughout the country have extensively launched the 
Army-civilian joint activity of building socialist spiritual 
civilization to meet the demand of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, thereby achieving fruitful results. In 
his report to the 14th National CPC Congress, Comrade Jiang 
Zemin demanded that "greater efforts should be made to launch 
such mass activities as the Army-civilian joint activity and the 
police-civilian joint activity of building civilized units in 
order to implement the building of spiritual civilization down 
to grass-roots organizations in both urban and rural areas." In 
order to implement the series of instructions given by the CPC 
Central Committee on strengthening the building of the socialist 
spiritual civilization, to meet the demand that the PLA units 
should march in the van of the society in building spiritual 
civilization, and to continuously deepen the Army-civilian joint 
building activity, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central 
Committee and the General Political Department of the PLA have 
decided to commend in October this year a number of units 
advanced in launching the Army-civilian joint building activity. 
  The "circular" stresses: Those grass-roots units which have 
scored remarkable achievements in the army-civilian joint 
activity of building the socialist spiritual civilization should 
be recommended for commendation. Major conditions are: The 
units whose Army and local leaders have attached importance to 
the activity, whose organizations are perfect, and which have 
plans and specific measures for joint building activity; the 
units that have launched the activity closely around the 
principle of training a new generation of people who are 
politically aware, morally sound, well educated, disciplined, 
and that have effected an obvious improvement in the ideas, 
morality, and cultural expertise of their soldiers and 
civilians; the units that have adapted themselves to the new 
situation of building the socialist market economic structure, 
have continuously created and summarized new experiences, and 
have played an exemplary role in building spiritual civilization 
in their own areas; and the units where Army and local personnel 
learn from and support each other and the relations between Army 
and local personnel are harmonious. 
  The "circular" demands: All localities and all PLA units 
should regard the process of recommending advanced units for 
commendation as the process of profoundly and realistically 
launching the Army-civilian joint building activity, should 
conscientiously research and draw up plans and measures for 
deepening this activity under the new situation, and should 
further mobilize the initiative of the vast numbers of soldiers 
and civilians in participating in this activity.

  [Text] Moscow, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin has proposed a civil peace plan aimed at preventing 
political violence in the country. 
  The Presidential Information Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov 
said that Yeltsin has submitted the accord to parliamentary 
leaders, some political groups, and the press. 
  Yeltsin called on all political leaders and social 
representatives to end confrontation and unite to overcome the 
economic crisis and the intensified political situation. 
  He warned that the process of drafting, approving and 
implementing the civil peace accord could be destroyed by the 
distrust which exists among political blocs. 
  The six-part draft accord states that the signatories will 
neither revise the current constitution nor launch any political 
activities aimed at promoting early national elections. 
  The signatory parties will also shoulder the responsibility 
for forbidding the use of violence to solve social problems. 
  On March 4, Yeltsin decided to sign a similar accord which 
aroused controversy among Russia's political blocs.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Hu Hangying: "Russia Adjusting Its Principles </F>
for Economic Reform"] 
  [Text] Moscow, April 5 (XINHUA) -- The main task facing the 
Russian president, government, and economic departments is to 
adjust their principles for economic reform. 
  According to some Russian economists and government 
officials, the sense of a market economy has been planted in the 
minds of their citizens and changes have taken place in Russia's 
economic system and ways of management since the country began 
to reform the economy in 1992. 
  Since then, private enterprises, stock companies and 
cooperatives have been established in Russia. 
  However, as these economists and officials point out, very 
serious problems still exist. 
  Russia's economy and industrial and agricultural production 
have been declining since the beginning of 1992, casting gloom 
over economic reform. 
  Industrial output dropped by 16.3 percent in 1993 compared 
with 1992, and output value for the first two months of 1994 
decreased 23.6 percent compared with the same period last year. 
  Russia's agricultural and husbandry production has also 
declined between six and eight percent. 
  Economic recession has become the most difficult issue for 
the government. 
  Therefore, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
proposed that they "close the door of romanticism." one of the 
important principles for Russian reform is to strengthen the 
government's control over the economy. 
  According to the prime minister, Russia can neither return 
to 
its old management by administrative decree nor take a 
laissez-faire attitude toward enterprises when the economy is in 
turmoil. 
  Another serious problem is high inflation and soaring 
commodity prices. 
  Average monthly inflation was 20 percent, and prices went up 
10 fold in 1993. This January prices increased by 22 percent. 
  In order to solve these problems the Russian government has 
decided to adopt a comprehensive administration system. 
  The government now offers loans to departments of national 
defense, energy and agriculture to stimulate production. 
  The government is also attempting to tackle the problem of 
triangle debts, which are estimated by the ministry of finance 
to be 31 trillion rubles. 
  The government has also decided to allow enterprises which 
have long incurred losses to go bankrupt in order to ease the 
nation's burden. 
  Other means, such as an increase in export taxes and 
rigorously enforced tax regulations, will be implemented to curb 
inflation, which Russia has pledged to decrease to seven or nine 
percent by the end of 1994. 
  At the same time, Russia will continue its privatization 
policies. Some 70 percent of all stores, hotels and other 
service facilities had been privatized by the end of 1993. 
  The declining standard of living and the extremes of wealth 
and poverty are becoming serious problems which must be dealt 
with. 
  One-third of Russia's citizens are living below the poverty 
line, and some four million people are unable to provide 
themselves with basic necessities. 
  The income of the rich, perhaps 10 percent of the 
population, 
is about 30 percent of the total income of society. But the 
poor, another 10 percent of the population, secures only 3.4 
percent of the nation's income. 
  Therefore, chernomyrdin proposed enhancing the reform of 
social guarantees and gradually increasing retirement pay. The 
government will also compensate veterans for savings lost 
before 1992. 
  Russia called for a crack-down on crime in a government 
report; organized crime groups were rampant throughout the 
country last year. 
  It is believed that these mafia-type gangs now control over 
40,000 economic entities in Russia, including state-run 
enterprises and banks. This situation is greatly disturbing 
both to society and the government. 
  The above policies are being carried out by the Russian 
government one by one, and time alone will demonstrate their 
effectiveness.

  [Text] Moscow, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev will fly to Brussels on April 21 to sign a 
framework agreement on the country's participation in the NATO's 
"partnership for peace" program. 
  Kozyrev's Deputy Vitaliy Churkin told a press conference 
today that while Russia will sign the document of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization, the plan is not supposed to deal 
with all issues relating to European security or to replace the 
existing security structure. 
  Russia's participation in the program does not mean it will 
abandon its own concept about European security, he said. 
Rather its participation is intended to ensure that the NATO 
plan reconciles with Russia's conception of European security. 
  Russia hopes that the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (CSCE) will be transformed into an effective 
all-European organization for closer cooperation between Europe 
and the former Soviet republics, he said. 
  Such a transformation also requires close coordination among 
the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the Commonwealth of 
Independent States (CIS). 
  At the same time, Russia also wants to strengthen its 
cooperation with the North Atlantic Cooperation Council so that 
the institution can become an effective instrument for 
coordination. 
  The "partnership for peace" plan is not a new international 
agreement, Churkin emphasized. Therefore it can not ask its 
signatories to assume new obligations. Russia and the NATO 
should not be legally bound to each other under the plan, he 
added. 
  Russia's participation in the plan has been a hot topic 
among 
the Russian leadership. 
  Presidential Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov announced 
five days ago that Russia needed consultations of six to seven 
months to achieve a public consensus on the issue. 
  However, Foreign Minister Kostikov said the next day that 
Russia would sign the plan in April as scheduled [sentence as 
received]. 
  Sergei Shakhray, a deputy of the State Duma (lower house of 
parliament) and minister of nationalities and regional policy, 
also joined the debate today. He told reporters that Russia's 
participation should not be decided unilaterally by the 
government. Instead, the government should first consult the 
legislature. 
  Moreover, he added, it remains unclear whether Russia's 
participation will affect its relations with other CIS member 
states and its eastern neighbors, especially China.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) is making great efforts to 
realize national unification and denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula, President Kim Il-song said here today. 
  According to the KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, Kim Il-song 
made 
the statement at a banquet to welcome King Norodom Sihanouk of 
Cambodia and Queen Norodom Mouique Sihanouk, who began an 
official visit to dprk on April 4. 
  At the same time King Sihanouk said that the DPRK is not 
responsible for the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula. 
  He added that the DPRK is entitled to defend itself if any 
foreign forces launch an invasion. 
  A row has blown up recently between the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK over the inspection of the 
latter's nuclear sites. The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that 
Pyongyang rejected full inspection while the DPRK said that it 
had met the IAEA's demands. 
  Last Thursday [31 March] the United Nations Security Council 
requested, in a presidential statement, that the DPRK allow the 
IAEA to complete its inspection of the nuclear facilities by 
mid-May. 
  On Monday, South Korea decided to postpone the planned joint 
military exercise between its armed forces and those of the 
United States until mid-May in the hope that the DPRK would 
respond positively to the U.N. Security Council's request.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa said today Japan wants to strengthen its 
cooperation with China and to make the bilateral relationship 
21st century-oriented that will contribute to the international 
community. 
  Hosokawa proposed more exchanges in such sectors as youth, 
students, culture and local cities so as to deepen mutual 
understanding. 
  The Japanese Government leader was talking to Guo Chaoren, 
director-general of China's XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, at his official 
residence. 
  Recalling his visit to China in March, he said, "Japan's 
relations with China have entered a new stage." He added that 
during that trip, he obtained first-hand information about the 
steady and smooth development of China's reform. 
  "When I met with business leaders after I returned home, I 
repeatedly urged them to pay more attention to China," he told 
Guo. 
  Hosokawa expressed confidence in the future of bilateral 
trade and economic ties and suggested the two countries become 
"partners that will hold themselves responsible for the 
international economy." 
  Guo arrived in Japan yesterday for an eight-day visit at the 
invitation of KYODO NEWS SERVICE and JIJI PRESS.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 KYODO -- Separate Japanese and 
Chinese investigations reveal that moldy, foul-smelling Chinese 
rice found in Japan was not the result of poor handling on the 
Chinese side, according to a state press report. 
  Tests on 42 samples, kept from a 5,000-ton shipment from 
China in early January, were free from mold and had a water 
content of only 13.1 percent, nearly 3 percentage points lower 
than what the contract specified, the INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS 
NEWSPAPER said. 
  The samples were kept at the Tanggu commercial inspection 
bureau at the eastern Chinese port city of Tianjin and were 
tested on February 17, the paper quoted a person connected with 
the case as saying. 
  The unnamed person also said Japanese officials visited and 
inspected the rice plant responsible for the shipment as well as 
storage facilities in Tianjin and concluded that "the cause of 
the mishap is not on the Chinese side." 
  The paper accused the Japanese press of seriously harming 
the 
credibility of Chinese rice exporters. 
  Other similar incidents have been reported concerning U.S., 
Thai and Australian rice, the paper said. 
  "Concerning the difficulties and frustration of opening the 
Japanese rice market, the appearance of this type of incident is 
unfortunately not by chance," the paper said.

  It is in the interests of China and Japan, two friendly 
neighbors, to strengthen cooperation in every field, Rong added,

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- China is becoming a 
rising force economically in the Asia-Pacific region and it will 
promote the prosperity of the whole region in the next century. 
  The remarks were made by Peter Tapsell, speaker of the New 
Zealand [NZ] Parliament, in an exclusive interview with XINHUA 
before leaving here for Xian today. 
  During his three-day stay in Beijing, the speaker met with 
Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing 
Committee, and Vice-President Rong Yiren. His delegation also 
held talks with Chinese officials. 
  "Any appreciation of the future development in the Pacific, 
either politically, economically and in terms of security, China 
would be an important force," Tapsell said. 
  New Zealand hopes that China maintains its responsible role 
in the region, which would benefit New Zealand, he added. 
  There would be "excellent opportunities" for trade and 
economic cooperation between New Zealand and China, he said. 
China has been and will continue to be a huge market for NZ's 
exports, mainly wool and timber. China is NZ's biggest wool 
buyer, importing more than one quarter of its wool exports. For 
New Zealand, Tapsell said it would import more Chinese 
machinery, tools, clothing and other light industrial products. 
  New Zealand is shifting its trade focus from the traditional 
European market toward Asia, China in particular, Tapsell said. 
China has been one of NZ's top ten trading partners. Although 
New Zealanders are mainly decendants of European immigrants, the 
younger generations no long have strong ties with Europe, 
rather, they are closer to Asia. Objectively speaking, the 
establishment of the European Common Market has shut New Zealand 
out, he noted. To enable China to trade with the rest of the 
world on an equal base, New Zealand supports China to resume its 
status in the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. Moreover, 
NZ and China share views on many international issues. 
  China has also well preserved its culture including the 
ancient historical sites and sites featuring many minority 
ethnics. Tapsell is a Maori, NZ's indigenous people. He is 
also NZ's first speaker from the Maori and the first speaker 
from the opposition party. 
  The visit so far has been quite a success, he said, adding 
that he hopes to know more about China in his visit to Xian and 
Shanghai.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met 
with visiting Eritrean President Isayas Afewerki and his party 
here this afternoon. 
  Their conversation mainly focused on the growth of 
relationship between China and Eritrea. 
  Noting that the peoples of the two countries have 
traditionally enjoyed friendship, Qiao said that since they 
established diplomatic ties one year ago, their contacts have 
increased and areas for cooperation have gradually broadened. 
  The NPC intends to establish ties with the national assembly 
of Eritrea so as to promote exchanges and cooperation between 
the two parliaments, he said. 
  Isayas said Eritrea has always worked hard for the 
enhancement of its friendly relations with China, adding that 
Eritrea's independence has laid a solid foundation for 
furthering such a relationship. 
  He noted that since the two countries established diplomatic 
ties, bilateral ties have grown rapidly, which, he said, 
conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries. 
  Qiao said he admired the unremitting efforts that the 
Eritrean Government and people have made in healing the wounds 
of war and rebuilding the country's economy under extremely 
difficult conditions. 
  He said the key to avoiding a road of twists and turns for a 
newly independent country depends on whether it will strictly 
act in accordance with its national conditions. 
  Qiao said he was sure that under the leadership of President 
Isayas, the diligent and wise Eritrean people will achieve 
success in exploring a new way for development suitable to its 
national conditions. 
  Isayas said he agreed with Qiao's view on learning from 
other 
countries' experiences and not copying from others. 
  He said that Eritrea and China may differ in national 
conditions. However, he added, there are many useful things that 
Eritrea can learn from China. China's assistance to Eritrea is 
particularly playing an important role in the latter's 
reconstruction. 
  Tan Qinglian, chairman of the Chinese Government reception 
committee and vice-minister of construction, participated in the 
meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, in a meeting here this morning 
with Tsanga Abanda, special envoy of the president of Cameroon, 
said that nation-to-nation disputes should be solved through 
peaceful means without resorting to force. 
  The Chinese foreign minister, after being briefed by Abanda 
on the situation regarding recent border conflicts between 
Cameroon and a neighboring country, said that African countries 
are developing countries, and that developing their economy and 
pushing forward domestic construction should be their main tasks. 
  Even if there were disputes, said Qian, they should be 
solved 
by peaceful methods, and not by way of force. Armed clashes run 
counter to regional stability and economic development as well, 
he added. 
  Qian expressed his satisfaction over the smooth development 
of bilateral relations since China and cameroon established 
diplomatic ties, saying that the visit to China by President 
Biya last year further strengthened such relations, and that the 
Chinese Government is willing to work with the Cameroon 
Government to promote such ties in a wider range. 
  Abanda said that Cameroon and China enjoy good relations, 
hoping that such relations will be further enhanced. 
  During the meeting, Qian asked Abanda to convey greetings 
from Chinese President Jiang Zemin to President Biya. Abanda 
asked Qian to convey a letter from President Biya to President 
Jiang. 
  Yesterday, Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei held 
working talks with Abanda, who arrived here on April 2.

<F P=106> [Article by Yvonne Van Der Heijden: "Arbed Subsidiary Paul </F>
Wurth To Modernize Chinese Anshan Steelworks"] 
  [Excerpt] Beijing -- Plans by the Luxembourg-based 
engineering company Paul Wurth to help modernize the largest and 
oldest iron and steel plant in China have entered their final 
stage now that the Luxembourg Government has given its guarantee 
for the project, which is worth billions. The last remaining 
loose ends will be tied up this month. Paul Wurth is one of the 
last remaining European companies to specialize in blast furnace 
technology. The Luxembourg-based Arbed subsidiary will supply 
the Anshan iron and steel plant in the northeastern province of 
Liaoning with the technology it requires to grow into a modern, 
efficient steel company. The aim of the modernization is to 
boost annual steel production at the mammoth Chinese company, 
which employs 200,000 people, to 10 million tonnes. Last year, 
the Chinese company produced 7 million tonnes. 
  The visit to China last month by an economic mission from 
Luxembourg, presided over by Luxembourg's Crown Prince Henri, 
and comprising representatives from approximately 20 companies, 
led by Luxembourg Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Goebbels, 
gave the contract a push in the right direction. Minister 
Goebbels was given provisional approval for the project by Gan 
Ziyu [name as published], vice-chairman of the State Planning 
Committee. "Luxembourg has already undertaken a large number of 
projects in China, but this one would be the most comprehensive 
undertaken to date," said the (Luxembourg) minister, 
highlighting the significance of the plans of Arbed subsidiary 
Paul Wurth. 
<H5>  Technology </H5>
  The technological modernization of China's largest and 
oldest 
steel plant fits in with the government's policy of boosting 
steel production significantly by the year 2000. It intends to 
do this by restructuring the ownership situation of state 
companies or importing high-quality technology. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Warsaw, April 1 (XINHUA) -- "China is a prospective 
economic partner of Poland," Boguslaw Liberatzki, Polish 
minister of transport and maritime economy said today. 
  Back from his official visit to Beijing, Boguslaw predicted 
that by the year 2000, trade volume between the two countries 
will recover to the level of 1986 and stabilize at 1 billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  1991 witnessed a sharp decline in bilateral trade when the 
trade volume dropped to 140 million dollars, down 71 percent 
from the previous year. 
  In face of the widespread recession in Western Europe and in 
an effort to get new international market, Poland found a new 
partner in China. In 1993, by developing new forms of 
cooperation beyond barter trade, Poland and China greatly 
augmented economic and trade exchanges and investment in each 
other. 
  The trade volume in 1993 climbed to 400 million dollars and 
is expected to rise steadily in 1994. 
  Closer contacts between the two governments also facilitated 
the further development of their trade and economic ties. A 
Polish vice prime minister visited China in June 1993, in return 
for a visit made by his Chinese counterpart Zou Jiahua to Poland. 
  Some provinces in China have sent their own trade 
delegations 
to Poland during the past year.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese leaders 
Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao had separate meetings with visiting 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim here this morning. 
  President Jiang recalled his visit to Brazil last November, 
saying that Brazil, with vast land, rich natural resources and 
industrious people, has a big potential for further development. 
  In fact, the whole Latin American region holds broad 
prospects for development, Jiang added. 
  Discussing Sino-Brazilian ties, Jiang noted that the 
frequent 
exchanges of visits and direct dialogues between leaders of the 
two countries are of great importance to deepening mutual 
understanding and promoting friendly cooperation. 
  He also briefed the visitor on China's economic development 
drive. 
  Amorim hailed Jiang's Brazil tour as a new landmark in Sino- 
Brazilian relations. 
  He held that the fruitful cooperation between the two 
countries in science and technology, hydro electric power and 
agriculture has set an example for other developing countries. 
  China's experience in pushing forward its economy is useful 
reference for Brazil, he added. 
  Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau 
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, and Amorim 
exchanged views on issues of common interest.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Brazilian 
Foreign Minister Celso Luiz Nunes Amorim said here today that 
his current visit to China has been "fruitful." 
  Speaking at a press conference this evening, the foreign 
minister said that during his visit he has met with Chinese 
leaders including President Jiang Zemin and held talks with 
vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The two sides, 
he said, exchanged views on bilateral ties and international 
issues, and gained positive results. 
  Amorim said that Brazil and China enjoy good cooperative 
relations, adding that both are developing countries playing 
more and more important roles in the world. 
  Both Brazil and China work for world peace and focus on 
their 
own economic development, said Amorim. Therefore, Brazil-China 
cooperation is conducive to world peace and security. 
  The foreign minister said trade between the two countries 
has 
been developing impressively, with an annual volume surpassing 
one billion U.S. dollars. Bilateral cooperation in various 
fields, including hi-tech, has broad prospects, he noted. 
  Amorim said that Brazil has always advocated the restoration 
of China's status as a founding party of GATT, adding that China 
is a big nation in trade, and its re-entry into GATT is 
important for both China and the world. Brazil and China are 
cooperating in that regard, he added. 
  The foreign minister, who visited China in 1986, extended 
his 
congratulations on China's achievement in economic construction, 
saying that the great changes taking place in the country in the 
past eight years are great, and he was "astonished" by the 
changes. 
  Amorim and his party are scheduled to leave here for home 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- General Chi 
Haotian, Chinese state councillor and defense minister, arrived

goodwill visit to Brazil. He is the first Chinese defense 
minister to visit Latin America since the founding of the new 
China. 
  Chi Haotian issued a written statement to the press upon 
arrival at Rio International Airport. He pointed out that the 
friendly and cooperative relationship between China and Brazil 
has continued to develop in a steady way since the two countries

understanding and friendship, to promote the development of the 
relationship between the two countries and the two armies, and

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 4 Apr (XINHUA) -- General Chi 
Haotian, Chinese state councillor and concurrently minister of 
national defense, watched on 4 April brilliant training 
exercises by Brazil's most important military unit, the First 
Army Division, and troops stationed at the Military Village in 
Rio de Janeiro. 
  At 1000, Chi Haotian -- along with Lieutenant General Li 
Laizhu, commander of the Beijing Military Region; Lieutenant 
General Yu Zhenyu, deputy commander of the Air Force; and other 
members of his retinue -- arrived by car at the First Army 
Division, headquartered at the Military Village. From the 
reviewing stand, Chi Haotian inspected well-equipped units under 
the First Army Division, including motorized infantry, armored 
cavalry, field and anti- aircraft artillery, air defense, 
reconnaissance, and guard units; as well as the airborne 
infantry brigade affiliated with the Eastern Military Region. 
  Brazil's First Army Division consists of 22,000 officers and 
men. Its predecessor, the First Strategy Brigade, was founded in 
1908. During World War II, the division's troops were 
incorporated into the First Expeditionary Division and took part 
in the war against Fascism in Italy. In addition, they also 
joined international peacekeeping forces on two occasions. 
  Then, the Chinese Defense Minister, accompanied by Brazilian 
Division Commander General Leonel, watched live ammunition 
exercises performed by the division's special task battalion and 
anti-terrorist shock brigade with great interest. At the 
airborne infantry brigade's parachute training center, Chi 
Haotian also viewed paratroopers' physical fitness, skills, 
mental readiness, and simulated parachute exercises. 
  Founded in 1945, the parachute training center is mainly in 
charge of the teaching, fieldwork, and training of paratroopers; 
as well as the research and development of personnel training 
techniques and parachute materials. So far, the center has 
trained some 50,000 certified paratroopers for 10 countries, 
including Argentina, Chile, the United States, and France. 
After watching the exercises, Chi Haotian told the gracious 
hosts: "There is much in your well-equipped training center's 
hardworking soldiers and flexible training methods that we can 
learn from." 
  Chi Haotian and his retinue arrived here on 2 April to begin 
a visit. This is the first time a Chinese defense minister has 
visited Latin American countries since the PRC's founding in 
1949. Brazil is the first leg of the visit. The minister and 
his retinue will visit Uruguay and Chile.

  [Text] Spring waterlogging has emerged in our province. 
The temperature in March was fairly low, thus causing a delay 
in the wheat sowing period. According to data provided by 
meteorological departments, precipitation in our province last 
autumn and winter was greater than the average by 20 percent. 
In March this year, snowfall was 78 percent greater than the 
same period of previous years, thus making 28 counties and 
cities across the province suffer from varying degrees of spring 
waterlogging. The afflicted areas are estimated at 10 million 
mu, 5 million mu of which are areas for sowing wheat, which 
accounts for one-fourth of the total wheat sowing area. In 
addition, our province experienced low temperatures in March. 
No warm temperatures were seen before 26 March. By 27 March, 
which should be the upsurge period for wheat sowing in normal 
years, only a small number of counties and cities across the 
province had begun to tentively plant wheat. 
  Based on the information provided by the provincial 
agricultural departments, as of 4 April, less than 1 million mu 
of wheat had been planted, only accounting for one-twentieth of 
the planned sowing acreage. However, during the same period of 
last year, more than 3 million mu of wheat were planted across 
the province. The province's wheat sowing period has been 
delayed by 7 to 10 days, compared with normal years. The delay 
in the wheat sowing period will prevent us from guaranteeing a 
bumper harvest in some areas and will make us rush to plant 
other field crops. 
  In this connection, the provincial agricultural committee 
has 
issued a circular calling for concentrated planting of wheat on 
a crash basis. Specialists have proposed efforts be made to 
adopt measures to drain excess water to stop spring waterlogging.

  [Text] Recently Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, highly appraised the development of township 
enterprises achieved by Shanjingzi district in Dalian. When he 
found out that the township enterprises in the district had 
achieved sustained, rapid, and healthy development during his 
inspection tour on 1 April, he extended congratulations and 
thanks on behalf of the provincial party committee to cadres and 
the masses throughout the district. Gu Jinchi said: The key to 
the township enterprises of Shanjingzi district, which have 
entered the benign cycle of self consolidation and development, 
lies in deepening reform. Gu Jinchi pointed out: In the course 
of developing township enterprises, Shanjingzi district has 
trained a large number of new successors and entrepreneurs, 
particularly peasant entrepreneurs, have come forward in great 
numbers. This is an amazing achievement. In developing the 
economy, Shanjingzi district has set for itself the demand of 
boldly surpassing the target; realized the target set by the 
Dalian city party committee with regard to getting rid of the 
city's influence and catching up with the city's level; and 
fulfilled the target through action. Gu Jinchi urged township 
enterprises to pay attention to upgrading the scientific and 
technological content in achieving development and particularly 
to attach importance on adopting high-and-new technologies to 
truly orient themselves on a track of gaining beneficial results.

"Enforce Law Strictly, Strengthen Supervision, and Maintain 
Political and Social Stability"] 
  [Text] On 3 March, Yang Yeqin, chief procurator of the 
Liaoning Provincial People's Procuratorate, delivered a "report 
on work of the provincial people's procuratorate" at the second 
session of the eighth provincial people's congress for 
discussion by deputies. In reviewing the 1993 procuratorial 
work, he said: Last year, under the leadership of the 
provincial party committee and the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate, and the supervision of the provincial people's 
congress standing committee, procuratorial organs across the 
province conscientiously implemented the guidelines of the 14th 
party congress and of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, the work plans of the provincial party 
committee and the provincial people's procuratorate, and the 
resolutions of the first session of the eighth provincial 
people's congress, adopted a series of measures to intensify the 
legal supervisory functions, made overall plans for 
procuratorial work in line with the principle of "enforcing laws 
strictly and handling cases relentlessly," concentrated efforts 
on handling major and appalling economic offenses on corruption 
and bribery, dealt strict blows to serious criminal activities, 
investigated and handled criminal cases on infringing upon the 
democratic rights of citizens and dereliction of duty, 
strengthened supervision over law enforcement, made new 
achievements, and played a positive role in safeguarding 
Liaoning's political and social stability, guaranetting the 
smooth progress of reform, opening up, and the modernization 
drive, and promoting the development of the socialist market 
economy. 
1. We Participated Actively in the Anticorruption Struggle and 
Handled a Number of Economic Criminal Cases on Corruption and 
Bribery [subhead] 
  In 1993, procuratorial organs across the province achieved a 
fairly great success in fighting corruption and bribery. They 
accepted 4,996 economic criminal cases on corruption and bribery 
during the year, an increase of 30.9 percent over the previous 
year, 2,299 cases of which had been filed for investigation, up 
20.7 percent. Of these cases, 1,211 were criminal cases on 
corruption and bribery, 598 of which were cases involving over 
10,000 yuan but less than 100,000 yuan, 51 involved over 100,000 
yuan but less than 500,000 yuan, and five involved over 500,000 
yuan but less than 1 million yuan, and two involved more than 1 
million yuan; of the 583 cases of misappropriation of public 
funds, 27 involved over 500,000 yuan; and a number of these 
cases involving 77 cadres at and above the county section level 
were filed for investigation and handling, showing an increase 
of 89.7 percent. During the year, 955 economic criminals were 
prosecuted by procuratorial organs. Through handling the 
aforementioned cases, illicit money and bribes totalling over 
111.35 million yuan Renminbi were recovered, an increase of 
44.14 percent over the previous year. 
  On 21 October last year, after the issuance of the major 
plan 
for anticorruption struggle worked out by Comrade Jiang Zemin at 
the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission on behalf of the party Central Committee, 
procuratorial cadres and policemen across the province rapidly 
participated in the anticorruption struggle, gave priorities to 
investigating and handling cases on corruption and bribery that 
emerged in party and government organs, judicial departments, 
administrative law enforcing departments, and economic 
management departments, and concentrated energy on handling 
major and appalling cases well. Crime report work was actively 
strengthened. In four months, procuratorial organs across the 
province processed 11,237 clues reported by the people, an 
increase of 130 percent over the total of the previous eight 
months, or an increase of 450 percent over the same period of 
the previous year. We implemented a system in which chief 
procurators assumed responsibility for handling cases and a 
system of sharing responsibilies among all levels, strengthened 
unified command and coordination, and concentrated energy on 
cracking a great number of major and appalling cases. In four 
months, we filed 418 major cases each involving corruption or 
bribery of over 10,000 yuan or misappropriation of over 50,000 
yuan in public funds for investigation and prosecution, an 
increase of 32.28 percent over the same period of last year; and 
investigated and handled 59 criminal cases involving cadres at 
and above county and regimental levels, an increase of 15 times 
over the same period of last year. Chief procurators of many 
procuratorates took the lead in taking meals and living at the 
organs or in places where the cases occurred, led procuratorial 
cadres and policemen to work overtime, and investigated cases 
round the clock. Through the painstaking efforts of 
procuratorial cadres and policemen across the province, we 
witnessed a good start in the anticorruption struggle and 
achieved initial results in this aspect. 
  A. We investigated and handled a large number of criminal 
cases committed by the functionaries of party and government 
organs and particularly by leading cadres with regard to 
embezzlement and bribe-taking. The number of such criminal 
cases reached 251 and showed a 72-percent increase over 1992. 
What was startling and appalling was the case uncovered by the 
Tieling city people's procuratorate, in which the criminal ring 
on the grain front of Changtu County embezzled and diverted 
public funds, received bribes, and evaded taxes. During their 
tenure, Gui Bingquan, director of the county grain bureau, and 
Yang Maoyuan, deputy director of the county grain bureau, caused 
great losses of almost 100 million yuan to the state by 
accepting bribes in order to satisfy their personal desires. 
They were greatly generous at the state's expense by spending 
the state's subsidies to the grain front at will and issuing 
orders on several hundred occasions to various grains depots to 
buy various equipment whose quality was poor but whose prices 
were high. Thus, a large number of relevant personnel illegally 
made a large amount of money from buying these equipment whose 
prices were, several, tens, or dozens of times higher than the 
originals. The city people's procuratorate put the cases 
committed by 30 functionaries on record; arrested 17 personnel, 
including Gui Bingquan, Yang Maoyuan, and Xu Lianzhong, vice 
chairman of the county Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference committee; and recovered over 10 million yuan of 
embezzled funds. The provincial people's procuratorate directly 
cracked down and put on record the appalling bribe-acceptance 
case committed by Wang Yanling, director of the Fuxin city 
material supply bureau. The Shenyang city people's 
procuratorate put on record as well as investigated and handled 
the case committed by Hu Yongshan, secretary of the Kangping 
county party committee and acting head of the county, who 
embezzled 20,000 yuan in public funds. The Jinxi city people's 
procuratorate investigated and handled the case of "fake 
recruiters," which exerted the worst influence in society. In 
this case, Wang Tieshan, deputy director of the Huludao district 
armed forces department in Jinxi city, and Meng Fanchun, 
clerical worker of the allowance section under the Jinxi city 
civil affairs bureau, colluded with one another in accepting 
bribes by providing over 300 fake registration and physical 
examination documents for 340 fake recruiters. The case 
involved over 40 cadres of the city party and government organs, 
including the civil affairs bureau and the armed forces 
department, and over 170 personnel were associated with the fake 
recruiter incident. The Jinxi city people's procuratorate 
arrested 15 local personnel whose crimes had been proved. 
  B. We investigated and handled a large number of criminal 
cases committed by judicial personnel who violated the law while 
enforcing the law by embezzling public funds, accepting bribes, 
and practicing favoritism. In 1993 the province put on record 
the cases of various crimes committed by 102 judicial personnel, 
which showed a 64.2 percent increase over 1992. Arrested by the 
Shenyang city people's procuratorate, Ma Shiteng, leader of the 
public security brigade under the Shenyang city public security 
bureau embezzled a tremendous amount of money by illegally 
establishing another charge for public security management 
during his tenure. The province put on record as well as 
investigated and handled 27 cases throughout the year of crimes 
committed by judicial personnel in practicing favoritism and 
conducting irregularities. The number of these cases showed a 
285-percent increase over 1992 and has been the peak of such 
criminal cases over the past years. When investigating and 
handling the criminal cases committed by clandestine gangsters, 
the province discovered that every criminal case of gangsters' 
ring had involved the judicial cadres and policemen and that 
there were over 30 cadres and policemen who were involved in the 
cases, of whom, 20 had their cases of embezzlement and 
practicing favoritism put on record for further investigations. 
As for the crimes committed by the personnel of procuratorial 
organs, the provincial people's procuratorate neither tolerated 
nor yielded to them by any means and investigated and handled 
them in a timely manner as soon as they were exposed. In 
addition, the province also strictly investigated and handled a 
large number of cases committed by judicial cadres and policemen 
in obtaining confessions through coercion. Of these cases, 19 
cadres and policemen whose crimes of reprehensible conduct and 
causing serious consequences were proven, were put on record for 
their pursuit of their criminal liabilities. 
  C. We investigated and handled some cases committed by 
administrative and judicial personnel in extorting those they 
served or managed, seeking and accepting bribes, and violating 
the law while enforcing it. The number of cases that were put 
on record for further investigations reached 98 and showed a 
20.43 percent increase over 1992. Chen Shijie, director of 
pharmaceutical administration section under the provincial 
public health department, and Liu Shengxian, director of the 
medicine supervision office, accepted a tremendous amount of 
bribes on many occasions from pharmaceutical factories and in 
dealing with units by taking advantage of their special 
administrative and law enforcement rights and by bargaining 
counters in the establishment of new pharmaceutical factories 
and in the production of new medicines. Their cases were put on 
record for further investigation by the Huanggu district 
people's procuratorate in Shenyang city. Some administrative 
and judicial personnel asked for bribes to the Yixin 
construction company in the Bayuquan district of Yingkou city 
before its formal opening, which distributed a tremendous amount 
of cash to relevant personnel of the departments of commercial 
inspection, land management, railway transportation, as well as 
industry and commerce. The number of personnel who received 
bribes surpassed 20. The Yingkou city people's procuratorate put 
cases in which crimes were proven on record for further 
investigation. 
  D. We investigated and handled a number of crime cases 
involving corruption and bribery among functionaries of economic 
management departments. All criminal cases on corruption and 
bribery uncovered in the course of rectifying the financial 
order in close coordination with the policy decision of the 
party Central Committee and the State Council on strengthening 
macroeconomic regulation and control were investigated and 
handled according to law by procuratorial organs throughout the 
province. During the year, we investigated and handled over 240 
cases in financial departments, which accounted for over 10 
percent of the total number of cases filed for investigation. 
The Shenyang city Procuratorate filed for investigation the 
major case of Gao Wenxia, deputy manager of the business 
department of Liaoning branch of China Industrial and Commercial 
Bank and of Chang Xinkai, the person in charge of granting 
loans, who made use of the convenience provided by their posts 
to examine and approve of certain loans for which they accepted 
over 100,000 yuan in bribes from applicants. In line with crime 
reports from the masses, the Benxi City Procuratorate filed for 
the investigation of an appalling case in which Gao Mingqiu, 
president of Benxi branch of the China Industrial and Commercial 
Bank, Sun Maorong, Fei Zhirong, and Jiang Baofu, vice presidents 
of Benxi branch of China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and Li 
Zhende, chief of the comprehensive planning section, each 
accepted 43,000 yuan, 15,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan in bribes. 
According to initial statistics, procuratorial organs across the 
province filed for the investigation and handling of over 30 
people in a number of cases involving bank presidents and vice 
presidents, and directors and deputy directors of business 
departments of banks at all levels. The provincial 
procuratorate investigated the crimes of Guan Weiguo, vice 
chairman of the Shenyang City Commission for Economic 
Restructuring and director of the city securities supervision 
committee, who made use of the influence of his post to examine 
and approve of the establishment of shareholding enterprises and 
the issuance of stock by successively accepting 55,000 yuan in 
cash bribes from four companies. This case was brought before 
court for public prosecution. The major case of Xu Shiqing, 
chief of the securities section of Fushun city's financial 
bureau, accepting 96,000 yuan in bribes, was investigated by 
Fushun city Procuratorate and prosecuted before the city 
intermediate people's court. 
  E. We ferreted out a large number of "moths" in enterprises 
that embezzled great amounts of public property. Jiang 
Rensheng, manager of Dalian city Bohai Housing Development 
Company, took advantage of his position to commit crimes in 20 
cases and to embezzle 2.8 million yuan in public funds by 
resorting to such means as understating compensation funds for 
relocating households, creating a false payroll, and signing 
contracts on selling commodity houses at a low price but taking 
a higher payment from buyers from July 1990 to July 1993; and at 
the same time, misappropriated 1 million yuan in public funds 
for personal profit-making activities. Discovering hints of 
Jiang Rensheng's crimes, the Ganjingzi District Procuratorate in 
Dalian city adopted resolute investigation measures and caught 
him red-handed. His case was brought before the Dalian city 
Intermediate People's Procuratorare for prosecution. The case 
of Hu Lin, the person in charge of signing contracts for the 
marketing section of Fushun Steel Plant who embezzled the large 
sum of 1.11 million yuan in bribes was brought to trial for 
public prosecution by the Fushun city Procuratorate. 
  F. We expanded the degree of investigating and handling 
cases on crimes involving taxation or fake trademarks. During 
the year, we accepted 2,437 clues to tax evasion crimes, refusal 
to pay taxes, and cheating the state with tax refunds. Of 
these, 392 were filed for investigation and handling, and 30 
were major cases each involving over 100,000 yuan. During the 
year, we recovered 91.27 million yuan in tax losses for the 
state by investigating and handling criminal cases, and working 
with tax departments to safeguard tax collection. We should 
actively participate in the struggle to check fake products and 
investigate and handle the year's 134 cases on using fake 
trademarks, an increase of 143.6 percent over the previous year. 
<H5>  2. We Dealt Strict Blows to Serious Criminal Activities in </H5>
Line With the Law and Safeguarded Political and Social Stability 
in Our Province 
  Procuratorial organs at all levels across the province 
followed the unified plans of the central authorities and the 
provincial party committee, maintained close coordination with 
the public security organs, procuratorial organs, and judicial 
administrative departments, continued to uphold the principle of 
dealing heavy and rapid blows to criminals in line with the law, 
and dealt strict blows to all sorts of serious criminal 
activities. During the year, we approved the arrest of 25,459 
persons involved in various kinds of criminal cases and decided 
to prosecute 23,213 persons. In the struggle to "deal strict 
blows to criminals," we upheld the following few points: 
  First, we pinpointed some priorities for attack. We gave 
priority to dealing blows to vicious criminal activities, such 
as murder, robbery, rape, bomb-planting, and committing crimes 
armed with guns, and criminal activities involving underworld 
groups, and guaranteed the manifestation of dealing heavy and 
rapid blows in the course of investigating the cases, approving 
arrests, and bringing suits to court. Recently, crimes 
committed by underworld gangs occurred frequently in our 
province and have become a problem which we must not neglect in 
current public security. The people's procuratorates of various 
localities regarded the work of handling these cases as an 
emphasis and selected and dispatched their outstanding personnel 
to examine the cases, to approve the arrest, to check the 
indictment, and to attend the trial to support public 
prosecution. They earnestly implemented the duties of legal 
supervision and upheld the principle of tracking down escaped 
criminals and bringing supplementary suits against them so as to 
exterminate the evil thoroughly. Over the past year, the 
province has approved of the arrest of 278 members of 
underground gangsters' rings. 
  Second, we heavily and rapidly dealt serious blows at 
criminal elements. As for serious and appalling cases for which 
the masses showed concern and about which society had lodged 
strong complaints, we upheld the principle of joining in the 
investigation by public security organs and the pre-trial 
activities in advance so as to be familiar with the cases and to 
grasp evidence rapidly, to approve the arrest or to indict 
convicts rapidly within the legal date, and to rapidly put the 
abominable criminals to trial. Procuratorial organs throughout 
the province joined in the investigations of 1,750 appalling 
criminal cases in the year in advance and played active roles in 
dealing heavy, rapid, and serious blows at criminal elements. 
  Third, we actively joined in the activities of dealing blows 
at special crimes and conducting special management of public 
security. Working in close coordination with public security 
organs, we took the spring offensive by regarding as a main 
content the struggle against "train bandits and highway despots" 
and the activities of "dealing blows at criminal rings, pursuing 
and capturing escaped criminals, and cracking down on appalling 
cases." We handled a large number of cases by rapidly approving 
the arrest and indictment of convicts. A large number of 
escaped criminals were captured, brought to justice, and 
punished in line with the law. We also earnestly implemented 
the three decisions made by the standing committee of the 
National People's Congress with regard to banning narcotics and 
dealing blows at abduction, and selling and buying of 
prostitutes' services. We arrested 113 criminals for violating 
the aforementioned prohibition and indicted 108 convicts. 
  Fourth, while "dealing serious blows to crime," we actively 
joined in the comprehensive management of public security. In 
line with the activities of handling cases and the procuratorial 
function, we implemented measures in the procuratorial link with 
regard to the comprehensive management of public security and 
eliminated some factors that harmed stability. 
<H5>  3. We Enhanced the Work of Supervising Law Enforcement, </H5>
Safeguarded the Correct, and Unified Enforcement of State Laws 
  A. We enhanced supervision over investigation and 
emphatically dealt with the problems of leaving crimes unchecked 
and replacing imprisonment with fines. The people's 
procuratorates of various localities upheld the system of 
joining the investigation activities conducted by the public 
security organs in advance and of keeping up with the 
investigation activities to conduct supervision. They conducted 
supervision and correction in line with the law over the 
problems of leaving the crimes unchecked and replacing 
imprisonment with fines. They also made suggestions on putting 
on record the cases that deserved to be noted, on pursuing and 
capturing escaped criminals who deserved to be arrested, and on 
forming indictments against those who deserved to be tried. 
Over the past year we have captured 369 criminals and formed 
indictments against 147 unpunished convicts. We supervised 578 
personnel to correct their investigation activities from 
violating the law. Meanwhile, we made the decision not to 
arrest 2,755 suspected criminals whose crimes did not conform 
with the regulations of law and ensured that every criminal was 
handled with no wrong treatment or appeasement. 
  B. We enhanced supervision over criminal trials and 
emphatically dealt with the problems of giving no punishment to 
suspects who have actually committed crimes, giving light 
sentences to convicts who deserve to be heavily punished, giving 
heavy sentences to those who deserve to be lightly punished. 
Over the past year we have lodged appeals in line with the law 
for 67 cases in which the people's courts have made wrong 
decisions. We conducted macro supervision over the problems of 
trends cropping up in the criminal trials, put forward the 
procuratorial suggestion on the strict enforcement of laws, and 
corrected the phenomena of violations cropping up in the trial 
activities. 
  C. We enhanced inspection over jails and detention houses 
and 
emphatically dealt with the law-violation problems committed in 
jails or detention houses. We conducted 8,297 inspections over 
the enforcement of laws in the year, exposed 3,925 cases of 
violations in various categories, and put forward 2,663 cases 
for correction. Of these cases, 1,827 were corrected. We 
conducted inspection and supervision over the implementation of 
criminal judgment, adjudication, and of the decision on 
reformatory education. Meanwhile, we put forward the opinions 
for correction cases in which 5,386 suspects were illegally 
detained. Of these cases, 1,668 were corrected. 
  D. We enhanced inspection of the process of filing charges 
in 
court and appealing against decisions and emphatically grasped 
reexamination of appeals against court judgments and 
adjudication as well as over the no admittance of appeals by the 
procuratorial organs. We handled 1,112 cases of various 
categories with regard to filing charges in courts and appealing 
against decisions. 
  E. We enhanced the legal supervision over the trials of 
civil 
affairs cases and over administrative lawsuit activities and 
emphatically grasped the examination and the appeals against the 
judgment and adjudication on civil affairs and administrative 
cases. We accepted 315 cases in the year, put 171 cases on 
record, and corrected some wrongly decided cases. 
<H5>  4. We Upheld the Principle of Managing Procuratorial Organs </H5>
Strictly and Strengthened the Self-Development of Procuratorial 
Contingents 
  In 1993, procuratorates at all levels across the province 
continued to exert efforts to build procuratorial contingents 
with a strong sense of politics, good professional skills, 
strict discipline, and tough work style in accordance with the 
principle of "building the procuratorates in line with law and 
managing the procuratorial contingents strictly," and gave 
priorities to grasping four aspects of work: First, they 
attended to the building of leading bodies of procuratorates at 
all levels. Second, they strengthened ideological and political 
work, mobilized the enthusiasm of all procuratorial cadres and 
policemen to the fullest extent, and guaranteed the fulfillment 
of all kinds of procuratorial work. Third, they grasped 
anticorruption work among themselves. After the convocation of 
the second session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, the provincial procuratorate decided to conduct a 
struggle between two lines among procuratorial organs across the 
province, gave play to the key role of procuratorial organs 
during the anticorruption straggle, attended to the internal 
anticorruption work of procuratorial organs, and strengthened 
administrative honesty among the procuratorial contingents. 
Leading cadres of procuratorates at all levels acted strictly 
in line with the central stipulations on keeping oneself clean 
and self-disciplined, conducted self-investigation and self- 
rectification, resolutely checked and corrected all sorts of 
phenomena on discipline and law violations, strictly 
investigated and handled procuratorial personnel who violated 
law and discipline, and screened and transferred 31 
procuratorial personnel to other posts who were not suitable for 
procuratorial work. In light of the problems discovered, we 
further improved the system on administrative honesty. Through 
education and rectification, the number of cases on law and 
discipline violations involving procuratorial organs across the 
province declined noticeably. Last year only 16 cases involving 
16 persons occurred, showing a decline of 46.6 percent and 51.5 
percent respectively from the previous year, thus marking the 
year as one with the fewest incidents of crime in this category. 
Fourth, they strengthened education and training for cadres and 
succeeded in enhancing cultural and professional levels of 
procuratorial contingents. 
  We also had many problems in our work, which mainly 
included: 
The lack of even development in the work of investigating and 
handling economic criminal cases on corruption and bribery and 
the inadequate efforts in handling appalling, influential cases; 
the lack of courage in a small number of chief procurators in 
enforcing the law justly; the low level of law enforcement by 
certain cadres and policemen who could not meet the demands of 
the struggle and the frequent occurrence of careless handling of 
cases or the failure to enforce laws strictly; the overstepping 
of rights by some units in pursuing their own interests while 
handling cases; and some localities not carrying out law 
enforcement supervisory work. We will conscientiously resolve 
these problems in our future work. 
  Yang Yeqin said in conclusion: We sobemnly recognize that 
during this year the task of investigating and handling economic 
crimes on corruption and bribery will be more arduous, that more 
painstaking efforts will be demanded for dealing blows to 
serious criminal activities, and that greater courage and energy 
will be required to strengthen law enforcement and supervisory 
work. Procuratorial organs across the province have decided to 
regard Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th CPC Central Committee as the guiding 
principles, implement the guidelines of the national and 
provincial public security, procuratorial, and judicial work 
conferences and of the national work conference of chief 
procurators, uphold the principle of taking a two-handed 
approach and being tough with both, adapt themselves to the 
demands of building the socialist market economic structure, 
strengthen the legal and supervisory functions, continue to make 
overall plans for all procuratorial work in line with the 
principle of "enforcing law strictly and handling cases 
relentlessly, give prominence to handling major economic 
criminal cases on corruption and bribery, deal strict blows to 
all sorts of criminal activities, safeguard political and social 
stability, and make new contributions to safeguarding and 
promoting Liaoning's reform and opening up and realizing the 
grand objective of conducting the "second pioneering program."

  [Text] Shenyang, April 5 (XINHUA) -- An export-oriented 
economy has been developing rapidly in the commercial sector in 
Northeast China's Liaoning Province over the past year. 
  In 1993, the province's commercial enterprises alone 
attracted more than 200 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds, 
tripling the total of the past five years. 
  The operation of commercial enterprises used to be confined 
strictly to domestic traders. Since 1988, Liaoning began to 
stress the development of the export-oriented economy among its 
commercial enterprises. 
  At present, over one-fourth of the commercial enterprises in 
the province have foreign trade operations and have set up trade 
relations with more than 60 countries and regions in the world. 
  By the end of last year, the province already had 106 
foreign- funded commercial enterprises. 
  Liaoning was one of the earliest provinces in China to open 
jointly-funded hotels. At present, jointly-run Star hotels in 
the province involve an investment of some 144 million U.S. 
dollars. 
  In addition, the province sent 450 cooks and other technical 
personnel to work abroad last year. 
  With China opening wider to the outside world, commercial 
enterprises in Liaoning are also broadening their scope of 
foreign trade. 
  To promote the development of export-oriented enterprises, 
the provincial government has been strengthening foreign 
exchanges. In 1993, commercial enterprises in the province 
received more than 8,000 foreign businessmen and sent abroad 180 
visitors.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 4 (XINHUA) -- Builders from 
northeast China's Liaoning Province have established an image in 
overseas markets, according to a local official. 
  Yang Shuaibang, deputy director of the provincial 
construction department, said the construction companies in the 
province have signed 562 contracts involving 730 million U.S. 
dollars with foreign construction firms from 1988 to 1993. 
  This was 5.1 times the total value contracted in the 
previous 
seven years. Last year, the contracted investment registered a 
record high of 150 million U.S. dollars. 
  The province's cooperation with foreign counterparts has 
been 
strengthened, when builders in the province have so far set up 
ties with 41 countries and regions and the number of joint 
ventures have seen an increase from 32 to 84 since 1992, Yang 
said. 
  The local construction enterprises have also launched 45 
branches abroad. Some of them have branched out into other 
fields, including food, real estate and building materials. 
  Meanwhile, the province has seen good results in boosting 
exports in this field. The export volume just to Russia in 
recent years has amounted to 15 million U.S. dollars. 
  As their capabilities have grown, these enterprises have won 
contracts to build entire projects for foreign employers. In 
Malaysia, they have won bids for eight projects which were worth 
120 million U.S. dollars. 
  The industry in the province began to explore overseas 
market 
since the early 1980s, focusing on labour exports at that time.

  [Text] A provincial radio and television propaganda work 
conference concluded in Xining not long ago. The conference was 
held at the same time as a provincial propaganda and ideological 
work conference. 
  The radio and television propaganda work conference was 
attended by nearly 30 people, including autonomous prefectural, 
prefectural, and city radio and television bureau chiefs; 
persons in charge of the Qinghai People's Radio Station, the 
Qinghai Television Station, and the Qinghai Provincial Radio and 
Television Department; as well as the individuals in charge of 
the other departments concerned. 
  Wang Huiru, provincial radio and television department 
director, delivered a speech entitled Clearly View the 
Situation, Emancipate the Mind, Seek Truth from Facts, Live a 
Plain Life, Work Hard, and Strive To Promote the Continued 
Development of Radio and Television Undertakings. Director Wang 
Huiru reviewed the basic situation of Qinghai's radio and 
television work over the past few years, relayed the spirit of a 
recently concluded national radio and television propaganda work 
conference, called for implementing to the letter the spirit of 
a recently concluded national propaganda and ideological work 
conference and the spirit of the ongoing provincial propaganda 
and ideological work conference, and spelled out some new tasks 
and goals for Qinghai's radio and television work. 
  After conducting study and discussion, the conference 
participants unanimously said: Now that we have clear-cut 
principles and policies to follow with regard to propaganda and 
ideological work, we should strive to unify ideology, heighten 
understanding, conscientiously implement the relevant principles 
and policies to the letter, and carry out work in a 
down-to-earth manner in light of Qinghai's actual conditions. 
  The conference participants also reached consensus on a 
number of major issues and called on all comrades concerned to 
view, from the high plain of the proletarian party spirit, the 
importance and necessity of successfully relaying the central 
and provincial radio and television programs. They also urged 
that every effort be made to ensure that the central and 
provincial radio and television programs are relayed in their 
entirety. 
  In view of the fact that there are some areas in the 
province 
where people are still unable to watch radio or television 
programs, the conference called for making redoubled efforts to 
build more radio and television relay networks; sticking to the 
correct public opinion orientation; creating public opinion 
favorable to reform, opening up, socialist market economic 
structure, and socialist productive forces; whipping up public 
opinion that is conducive to urging people to live a plain life, 
work hard, and strive to build a strong and prosperous country; 
improving the people's livelihood, pushing forward social 
progress; and creating public opinion that is conducive to 
national reunification, nationality solidarity, ease of mind 
among the people, and social and political stability. 
  The conference stated: The propaganda departments should 
strengthen management by focusing on such key links as 
announcers, programs, and the like; should take resolute 
measures to wipe out substandard programs; should set a limit on 
the number of foreign movies and programs, especially in prime 
time; should conscientiously implement the spirit of advocating 
the main theme and airing varied programs; should ensure 
efficient information supply and satellite television programs 
reception; should strengthen, consolidate, and develop radio 
broadcasting networks in rural areas; should develop cable 
television networks in a planned and efficient manner, and 
should conscientiously implement all legal documents promulgated 
by the State Council and the ministry of radio, film, and 
television. 
  The participants also exchanged experiences during the 
conference.

<F P=106> ["Speech by Abulaidi Amudurexiti at the Spring Festival </F>
Greetings-Exchanging Gathering on 9 February 1994" -- XINJIANG 
RIBAO headline] 
  [Text] Comrades, friends: 
  We are gathered here today to celebrate the Spring Festival. 
On behalf of the regional party committee and government, I 
extend a Happy New Year to all comrades and friends present; as 
well as cordial greetings to all workers, peasants, 
intellectuals, office cadres, retired comrades, army commanders 
and fighters, armed police officers and men, and workers and 
staff of the Production and Construction Corps of all 
nationalities throughout Xinjiang; to all democratic parties, 
mass organizations, and patriotic people in all walks of life 
and of all nationalities; to comrades from the central 
departments and various fraternal provinces and regions working 
on various fronts in Xinjiang to help our economic construction; 
and to friends in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and foreign 
countries who have cared for and helped the region's economic 
development! I also extend heartfelt gratitude to comrades who 
stay fast at their jobs during the festival. 
  In the past year, we implemented in depth Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's important speeches made during his southern tour and 
the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines, actively carried out 
the tasks laid by the fifth plenary (enlarged) session of the 
fourth regional party committee and the first session of the 
eighth regional people's congress, and relied on and united 
cadres and people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to work hard 
and concertedly to score gratifying achievements. In 1993, the 
regional economy retained its growth momentum: In agriculture, 
we overcame natural disasters and reaped a bumper harvest for 
the 16th year in a row, industrial production recovered from the 
stagnation at the beginning of the year and gradually picked up 
monthly, basic industries and key construction projects 
proceeded smoothly, and financial revenues increased by a big 
margin. We strengthened macroeconomic regulation and control, 
stabilized financial order, deepened enterprise reform, further 
developed diversified economic sectors with public ownership as 
the mainstay, and made significant progress in opening up 
Xinjiang to the outside world. We earnestly safeguarded social 
and political stability and brought about a noticeable 
improvement in economic and social order. We scored interim 
achievements in promoting clean government and fighting 
corruption; further strengthened the comprehensive management of 
public security; steadily promoted reform in education, science 
and technology, culture, health, family planning, environmental 
protection, and sports; and continued to make headway in 
building socialist spiritual civilization, democracy, and the 
legal system. An excellent situation characterized by economic 
growth, political stability, national unity, and social progress 
prevailed throughout the region. 
  This year, we will carry forward our cause and continue to 
work together for still greater victories in Xinjiang's economic 
construction and all fields of endeavor. It will also be a 
crucial year for the people of all nationalities in Xinjiang to 
realize the second-step strategic goal and comparatively 
well-off living standards. The recent sixth plenary (enlarged) 
session of the fourth regional party committee adopted a 
"decision on conscientiously implementing the Third Plenary 
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee guidelines to 
accelerate reform and opening up to promote rapid and highly 
efficient development of Xinjiang's economy." The principles, 
policies, and focuses put forth by the session for deepening 
reform, opening up wider, and promoting economic development in 
the region are in line with the requirement for integrating the 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
guidelines with Xinjiang's realities. Meanwhile, the session 
mapped out arrangements for the work in various fields in 1994. 
We should unswervingly adhere to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the 
party's basic line, and work in a down-to-earth manner according 
to the tasks laid down by the sixth plenary (enlarged) session 
of the fourth regional party committee, so as to continuously 
promote a socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and 
socialist spiritual civilization. 
  We should continue to steadfastly make economic 
construction the central task. We should strengthen the 
fundamental position of agriculture and ensure its steady 
development. We should invigorate the county economy by 
energetically developing second and tertiary industries in rural 
areas with village and town enterprises as the mainstay. We 
should improve the hard environment for large-scale socialized 
production by accelerating the construction of basic industries 
and infrastructure, such as transportation, energy, 
telecommunications, power supply, and water conservancy. We 
should upgrade the technology of existing enterprises and 
expedite the exploitation and transformation of resources. We 
should practice multidirectional opening up and market 
diversification and step up trade, economic, and technological 
cooperation with foreign countries. We should promote local 
economic development and all-round revitalization of the 
regional economy, concentrating on prospecting and developing 
petroleum and nonferrous metals. 
  We should accelerate the pace of establishing a socialist 
market economic structure. We should change the operating 
mechanisms of enterprises and quicken the restructuring of 
existing enterprises in accordance with the basic requirements 
for establishing a modern enterprise system. We should 
energetically promote the reform of the macroeconomic regulation 
and control system, readjust the economic structure, and strive 
to nurture new points of economic growth. We should gradually 
establish a unified, open, fair, and orderly market system to 
converge the regional economy with major international and 
domestic markets. We should readjust ownership structure and go 
all out to develop nonstate sectors of economy. We should 
implement the principle of "giving priority to efficiency while 
taking fairness into account" in initiating a sound social 
security system. 
  We must always uphold the principle of "grasping two links 
at 
the same time" in effectively maintaining social and political 
stability and create sound social milieus for Xinjiang's reform 
and development. We should go all out to improve party 
workstyle, promote clean government, and fight corruption 
unremittingly. We should further encourage advances in 
ideological, cultural, and educational undertakings. We should 
strengthen national unity and unity between soldiers and 
civilians and between the army and the government. We should 
correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability; and continuously consolidate and develop the 
political situation characterized by stability and unity. 
  Comrades, friends: 
  The coming year has entrusted upon us a new mission. Time is 
running out; and we shoulder a heavy responsibility. Under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin as the nucleus and under the guidance of the spirit of the 
14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, let us further emancipate our minds, 
seek truth from facts, work hard, and forge ahead to contribute 
more to the realization of Xinjiang's goal of development, the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure, and the 
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  May you all have a happy holiday, good health, smooth 
sailing 
at work, and happiness at home.

Implementation of the 1993 Plan for Economic and Social 
Development and the Draft 1994 Plan -- delivered by Su Yongguang 
(5685 3057 0342), director of the Xinjiang Autonomous Regional 
Planning Commission, at the Second Session of the Eighth 
Xinjiang Autonomous Regional People's Congress on 24 February 
1994"] 
  [Text] Deputies, on behalf of the regional people's 
government, I now submit the report of the Xinjiang Uygur 
Autonomous Region on the implementation of the 1993 plan for 
economic and social development and the draft 1994 plan for 
examination by the present congress. 
<H5>  1. Implementation of the 1993 Plan and Forecast for Economic </H5>
Trends in 1994 Under the guidance of the important talks 
given by Comrade Deng Xiaoping when he visited the south and the 
guidelines of 14th CPC National Congress and in accordance with 
the plan adopted by a work conference of the Regional Autonomous 
CPC Committee, Xinjiang never lost sight of the central task of 
economic development, redoubled efforts to solve the glaring 
contradictions and problems arising from economic operations, 
and made marked progress in economic construction and social 
development. It is believed that most of the main targets in 
the 1993 plan for economic and social development -- which was 
adopted at the First Session of the Eighth Xinjiang Autonomous 
Regional People's Congress -- were fulfilled or overfulfilled. 
The overall situation is good. 
  First, the economy grew continuously. It is estimated that 
the 1993 total output value of goods and services for the 
autonomous region was 39.054 billion yuan (calculated in terms 
of 1990 constant price; similiarly hereinafter), up 9.5 percent 
from the readjusted 1992 figure. Total industrial and 
agricultural output value was 51.012 billion yuan, up 8.5 
percent; of which total agricultural output value rose 4.4 
percent, fulfilling the plan in spite of frequent natural 
disasters. Total grain output is estimated at 7.09 million 
metric tons, overfulfilling the plan by 1 percent and 
registering a 0.4 percent growth. The output of oil-bearing 
crops was 370,200 metric tons, overfulfilling the plan by 23.4 
percent and registering a growth of 3.9 percent; meat output was 
383,000 metric tons, overfulfilling the plan by 8 percent and 
showing a growth of 6.1 percent; and cotton output was 680,000 
metric tons, up 1.9 percent. The total output of village and 
township enterprises was 6.289 billion yuan, surpassing the plan 
by 989 million yuan. Total industrial output value rose 10.9 
percent, and growth was registered in all major industrial 
goods. It is estimated that the output of crude oil was 
10,341,100 metric tons, up 24.3 percent; the amount of crude oil 
processed was 6,425,600 metric tons, up 13.4 percent; oil 
products, 4.41 million metric tons, up 11.4 percent; cement, 
4.28 million metric tons, up 14.1 percent; machine-processed 
sugar, 331,300 metric tons, up 3 percent. Quotas for 
transportation, telecommunications, and postal services were all 
overfullfilled. The volume of railroad freight transport was 
20.17 million metric tons, overfulfilling the plan by 2 percent 
and up 6.8 percent over the previous year; of which 12.1 million 
metric tons was east-bound, up 4.4 percent. Business transacted 
by postal and telecommunications departments in 1993 totaled 397 
million yuan, up 37.9 percent. The total telephone exchange 
volume in 13 cities rose 62 percent to 254,000 lines. The total 
volume of retail sales was 18.465 billion yuan, overfulfilling 
the plan by 5 percent and registering a growth of 17.2 percent. 
The export volume was $495 million, up 22.8 percent. Total 
revenue was 3.47 billion yuan, surpassing the budget by 25.2 
percent and registering a 33.08 percent increase. Total 
expenditure was 6.45 billion yuan, up 14.92 percent. The 
natural population growth rate -- 13.85 per thousand -- was 
under target. Steady progress was made in science, education, 
culture, public health, journalism, film, television, sports, 
and social security and living standards improved. 
  Second, in line with the guidelines of document No. 6 of 
the CPC Central Committee, we consolidated order in the banking 
sector, put a stop to illegal money lending and raising of 
capital, and improved cash administration, thereby gradually 
restoring order to the once chaotic banking sector. It is 
estimated that over a billion yuan of capital was withdrawn 
during the year. From August to December of last year alone, 
bank deposits increased by 7,025 million yuan, or 105 percent of 
the total annual increase. The banks' capacity to extend credit 
increased. Some 2,106 million yuan was extended as credit for 
working capital for industry and 3,234 million yuan as loans for 
fixed assets. Ample funds were made available and no IOU slips 
were issued for the procurement of agricultural and sideline 
products. The shortage of credit was somewhat alleviated and 
the macroeconomic environment improved. 
  Third, major progress was made in capital construction, 
particularly in infrastructure facilities and basic industries. 
The completed investment in fixed assets was estimated at 23,195 
million yuan, up 36.4 percent; of which, investment by 
state-owned units was 20,875 million yuan, up 36.8 percent; by 
collectively- owned units, 1,028 million yuan, up 61.4 percent; 
and by individuals, 1,292 million yuan, up 17 percent. 
Investment in fixed assets in localities was 7,385 million 
yuan, or 110.5 percent of the plan, registering an increase of 
30.9 percent. Of which, investment in capital construction 
projects was 3,560 million yuan, or 123.4 percent of the plan, 
registering an increase of 23.9 percent. Investment in technical 
upgrading was 1,110 million yuan, or 111 percent of the plan and 
up 56.3 over the previous year. Investment in real estate, 314 
million yuan, up 89 percent. Fair progress was made in the 35 
key projects under construction in Xinjiang; last year, 11 
accomplished the yearly investment targets. They are: Xinjiang 
Soda Ash Plant, the Beitun-Dahuanshan section of state highway 
216, Kashi Class-B Hydreoelectric Station, Jinghe Heat and Power 
Plant, Shihezidong Heat and Power plant, Heizi Reservoir, 
Taxkorgan Hydroelectric Station, the Saiertun-Maanqiao section 
of state highway 314, Fukang Nickel Smeltery, Wusu Heat and 
Power Plant, and phase four of the Yili Heat and Power Plant. 
The seven key projects that were partially completed or in 
which individual works were completed are: Phase one of a 
polyester project at Wushi Chemical Complex, the Hami-Liaodun 
and Changji-Hutubi sections of state highway 312, a heat supply 
project in Guangming Road, double-tracking of the Lanzhou-Urumqi 
railway, Xinjiang Oilfield, Tarim oilfield, and Tura Oilfield. 
Among the major new additions in production capacity are: 937 
km of newly built or renovated highways, 191 km of railways put 
into operation, generating sets with a designed capacity of 
113,400 kw, 80,000 metric tons of soda ash, 42,000 metric tons 
of polyster, 2.58 million metric tons of crude oil; 2,000 metric 
tons of electrolytic nickle; and 640 million cubic meters of 
reservoir capacity. 
  Four, in the past year, Xinjiang opened up wider to the 
outside world, developed lateral cooperation eastward, and 
promoted exports westward. Xinjiang improved its investment 
environment last year to attract more foreign capital. It 
continued its efforts to expand the scope of economic and 
technical cooperation, and internal and external trade. Last 
year's second Urumqi Border Trade Fair was a success. The 
year's total volume of imports and exports was $912 million, up 
30.3 percent over the previous year. Border trade grew rapidly: 
exports are estimated at $289 million, up 75.5 percent; imports, 
$288 million, up 85.2 percent. The amount of foreign capital 
utilized during the year was $243 million, up 86.9 percent over 
the previous year. New progress was made in the development of 
technological development zones, border economic cooperation 
zones, and new-tech industrial development zones. 
  However, some conspicuous problems also existed in 
Xinjiang's economic development in the past year. They were 
mainly as follows: Structural contradictions in economic 
development remained conspicuous. Contradictions in 
infrastructure, including transportation and communications 
facilities and in basic industries, which hamper rapid economic 
development have yet to be noticeably eased. A considerable 
number of industrial enterprises encountered more difficulties; 
their economic returns were not ideal; more of them suffered 
bigger losses; the volume of exports by spot exchange decreased 
by 14.4 percent from last year; and industrial production and 
exports failed to meet requirements. The combined index of 
total retail prices of commodities in society was estimated at 
112.6 percent, surpassing the plan by 3.6 percent and posting an 
increase of 4.5 percent over the previous year. The 
contradiction between the supply and demand of funds remained 
conspicuous; the ratio of funds for construction projects 
channeled to their proper recipients was low; and the phenomenon 
of delayed payments was serious. Although the above mentioned 
problems are something encountered in the course of our march 
forward and development, and though some of them are gradually 
being solved through deepening reform, they warrant serious 
attention. We must conscientiously treat and solve them in our 
macroeconomic management, regulation, and control in the future. 
  After conducting a comprehensive analysis of various 
factors, 
we believe it is still possible for Xinjiang's economy to 
maintain a comparatively good momentum of growth in 1994. This 
year, the state will implement a series of important reform 
measures and will bring the market mechanism's role further into 
play to speed up the pace of establishing a socialist market 
economic system in all fields of endeavor. They will inject new 
vitality into Xinjiang's economy and this will be conducive to 
promoting economic development. The growth in investment demand 
and residents' consumption needs will also give an impetus to 
economic development. Tremendous potential exists in Xinjiang's 
important material, technology, labor force, and natural 
resources that support economic development. There are still a 
good number of opportunities and favorable conditions for 
foreign trade. As the investment environment is further 
improved, there will be promising prospects for Xinjiang to 
attract investment from other regions at home and abroad, and 
for cooperation. The fact the state attaches importance to 
helping poor areas shake off poverty and become prosperous, and 
to accelerating the development of village and town enterprises 
in central and western China and regions inhabited by minority 
nationalities, will play a positive role in promoting Xinjiang's 
economic development. At the same time, however, we must be 
aware of some unfavorable aspects. This year, as important 
reform measures are adopted for many fields of endeavor, 
economic entities will undergo a process of change and 
adaptation, and new situations, problems, and difficulties will 
continue to crop up. Because commodity prices rose by a 
relatively wide margin last year, the number of factors leading 
to the spontaneous rise in commodity prices will increase this 
year. It will put pressure on production and people's 
livelihood. The implementation of foreign trade and foreign 
exchange system reform will not only make Xinjiang face new and 
keener export competition, but will increase corresponding 
financial burdens for the government due to the merger of 
exchange rates. Some enterprises will still encounter many 
difficulties when they transform their operating mechanisms. We 
are still short of financial funds. Therefore, while fully 
affirming the achievements scored by Xinjiang in economic 
construction as well as this year's favorable conditions, and 
while boosting our confidence in accelerating reform and 
economic development, we must attach a high degree of importance 
to the problems and difficulties that exist and may possibly 
crop up in our current economic life. We must correctly judge 
the hour and size up the situation; continue to enhance vigor; 
continuously blaze new trails and forge ahead; and 
conscientiously and successfully solve the contradictions and 
problems encountered in our march forward and in the process of 
development, to promote rapid and highly efficient economic and 
social development in Xinjiang under the new situation. 
  2. The Guiding Ideology, Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control Targets, and Questions To Be Dealt With in the 1994 
Plan 
  The general guiding ideology for the region's 1994 economic 
plan is to act under the guidelines of the 14th National Party 
Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; comprehensively implement the guidelines of the 
national economic and planning conferences and the Sixth Plenary 
Session (Enlarged) of the Fourth Xinjiang Regional Party 
Committee; accelerate the pace of reform to establish a 
socialist market economy in the autonomous region; open Xinjiang 
wider to the outside world; strengthen and improve macroeconomic 
regulation and control; vigorously readjust the economic 
structure; improve economic efficiency; and maintain sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the region's economy. 
  Based on this guiding ideology for our economic work, the 
region's principal macroeconomic regulation and control targets 
for this year are: Total value of goods and services is to 
increase more than 11 percent over the previous year to reach 
34.3 billion yuan. The increase is 5.1 percent for primary 
industry, 13.8 percent for secondary industry, and 14.5 percent 
for tertiary industry. Total regional investment in fixed 
assets is to rise 32.7 percent to reach 9.8 billion yuan. Under 
the tax-revenue-sharing system, regional tax revenues are 
targeted at 2.448 billion yuan, expenditures at 6.615 billion 
yuan, and money supply at 5.5 billion yuan. Exports are 
expected to reach $0.55 billion in value, up 11.1 percent; 
efforts will be made to reach $0.6 billion. The increase in 
retail sales will be controlled at around 11 percent. The 
natural population growth rate will be controlled at about 17.96 
per 1,000. 
  These targets were set after taking into consideration our 
goal to accelerate Xinjiang's development to narrow its gap with 
the rest of the nation in economic development and at the same 
time paying attention to the region's conditions, its ability to 
take on the tasks, and linkage with the Eighth Five-Year Plan. 
Every effort was made to adhere to the principle of looking 
both ahead and behind, the policy of overall consideration and 
all-around arrangement, and the principle of unified planning 
and coordination with some leeway. All departments and 
localities shall base primarily on the regional macroeconomic 
regulation and control targets when formulating their own 
economic development and regulation and control plans, and shall 
make concerted efforts and cooperate closely to help accomplish 
the region's macroeconomic regulation and control targets. 
  We shall pay close attention to the following when 
implementing this year's plan: 
  1. We shall continue to strengthen agriculture as the 
foundation of our economy, stabilize the household-based system 
of contracted responsibility with remuneration linked to output 
and the dual management system that combines household with 
collective operations, and make concentrated efforts to readjust 
our rural economic structure and variety of crops. We shall 
accelerate the application of agricultural technological 
research results and actively develop a type of farming that 
provides high yields of fine quality with maximum efficiency. 
At the same time, we shall vigorously develop village and town 
enterprises in the countryside, primarily in the secondary and 
tertiary industrial sectors, accelerate the transfer of rural 
labor to nonagricultural sectors, and work hard to increase 
peasants' and herdsmen's income. 
  2. We shall persistently and continually carry out 
construction of infrastructure, basic industries, and important 
raw and semi- finished material industries to ease the 
constraints imposed by those "bottlenecks" and create a good 
environment for our economic development and opening up. At the 
same time, we shall implement a strategy to exploit our rich 
natural resources and make concentrated efforts to develop 
petroleum, petrochemical, light, textile, and food industries. 
We shall vigorously develop farm and by-products processing 
industries and gold, nonferrous metal, and coal mining 
industries that have markets and guaranteed material supply, 
require shorter construction time, and produce better economic 
benefits. We shall do so to lay a new foundation for economic 
growth and to quickly develop production capacity for a number 
of new products. 
  3. While maintaining appropriate growth in capital 
construction investment, we shall pay more attention to making 
good use of existing assets and intensifying technological 
transformation. We shall step up our efforts to change 
enterprise operating mechanism and, at the same time, use modern 
technologies to reorganize and transform our traditional 
industries to breathe new life into old enterprises. We shall 
optimize our economic structure, raise technology contents of 
our products, and improve economic efficiency, and we shall make 
this truly the focus of our efforts in accelerating economic 
development. 
  4. We shall integrate closely technological transformation 
and capital construction, focusing on meeting the need of 
Xinjiang's three major oilfields in oil exploration and 
development. We shall develop a number of related industries 
serving and supporting the oilfields to promote their 
development. We shall do so to ensure that the oilfields and 
local economy will promote each other and develop together. 
  5. While continuing to rely on the multipurpose economic 
belt north of Tianshan to accelerate our economic development, 
we shall pay more attention to economic development in south 
Xinjiang, increase investment in its capital construction 
projects, and step up efforts to support the poor so as to 
narrow the gap between north and south Xinjiang. 
  6. While upholding the policy of making economic 
construction the central task, we shall work hard to promote 
coordinated economic and social development. We shall make 
concentrated efforts to undertake certain concrete projects to 
improve water supply, medical services, and electricity supply 
-- matters that are of utmost concern to and urgently needed by 
the masses in some areas -- to enhance unity between various 
nationalities and promote social stability. 
  7. We shall seize the opportunity to accelerate economic 
development. We shall also seize the opportunity to accelerate 
reform and opening up, and promote the establishment of a 
socialist market economic structure. We shall speed up the 
reform of the planning, investment, fiscal and taxation, foreign 
trade, foreign exchange, and enterprise systems in consideration 
of Xinjiang's realities. We shall take full advantage of 
Xinjiang's abundant natural resources and good geographic 
location to further implement the strategy of opening on both 
the east and west fronts. We shall open Xinjiang wider to the 
outside world, actively open up both domestic and foreign 
markets, and develop both domestic and foreign trade. In this 
way, we shall make full use of both domestic and foreign 
resources, markets, and funds to promote economic development. 
  8. While building a number of major construction projects, 
we shall concentrate an appropriate amount of financial 
resources on the preparatory-stage construction of some new key 
projects. So, we shall build a number of projects, put 
completed projects into operation, have a number of planned 
projects in reserve, and explore some new projects at the same 
time. 
<H5>  3. Continue To Strengthen the Role of Agriculture as the </H5>
Foundation of the National Economy and Promote All-Around 
Development of the Rural Economy 
  We shall persistently put agriculture and the rural economy 
above all else and seriously implement the guidelines of the 
national rural work conference and Xinjiang's rural economic 
work principle of "stabilizing grain production, raising cotton 
output, enhancing economic efficiency, and increasing peasants' 
and herdsmen's income." We shall continue to stabilize the 
party's rural economic policies; let market demand guide 
production; accelerate the readjustment of rural economic 
structure and production structure; and actively develop 
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, 
and fishery. We shall rely on science and technology, take the 
road of high output, good quality, and high efficiency, and 
bring about all-around prosperity of the rural economy. The 
projected figures in the 1994 plan are: Total agricultural 
output value, 19.6 billion yuan, up 6 percent from 1993; total 
grain output, 7 million tonnes, roughly the same as last year; 
cotton output, 800,000 tonnes, an increase of 120,000 tonnes 
over last year; oil-bearing crops, 350,000-370,000 tonnes, the 
same as last year; beet output, 3 million tonnes, an increase of 
400,000 tonnes over last year; meat output, 410,000 tonnes, an 
increase of 27,000 tonnes over last year; aquatic products, 
30,000 tonnes, an increase of 2,000 tonnes over last year; 
afforestation, 850,000 mu; and total output value of village and 
town enterprises, 9.2 billion yuan, an increase of 2,911 million 
yuan. 
  Major attention shall be paid to the following aspects in 
agriculture and rural work: 
  -- We shall continue to readjust the mix of crop cultivation 
and food composition, and pay serious attention to animal 
husbandry. In grain production, we shall strive to increase 
both per-unit-area yield and total output. While ensuring 
regional self-sufficiency with some surplus, as well as a 
balance among various zones, we shall increase the area of 
cotton, beet, and oil-bearing crops. We should strive to 
develop the production of melons, vegetable, beans, barley, 
safflower, and other cash crops, and continue to make the urban 
"vegetable basket" project a success. We plan to grow 24 
million mu of grain; 10.7 million mu of cotton, 1.175 million mu 
more than 1993; and 1.1 million mu of beet, 180,000 mu more than 
1993. While continuing to develop grassland animal husbandry, 
we shall also develop livestock breeding in agricultural areas 
and suburban areas. We shall further readjust animal variety, 
livestock grouping, and the mix of animal husbandry products. 
We shall increase per-animal output and overall quality of 
animal husbandry products. 
  -- We shall timely increase the purchase prices of 
agricultural products according to the unified state plan and 
let peasants truly enjoy the benefits from the higher prices and 
from the policy of linking agricultural output to the supply of 
agricultural capital goods. We shall relax the control of the 
sales of agricultural products, except cotton, and guide 
peasants to take a direct part in commodity circulation and 
enter the market. We shall establish and implement the grain 
and cotton reserve system, and a grain price risk regulatory 
fund. 
  -- We shall pay more attention to economic development in 
major grain and cotton producing areas. We shall support the 
construction of a number of selected grain and cotton production 
base counties and demonstration zones of "high yield, high 
economic efficiency, and good quality" in accordance with the 
demand set by the state. 
  -- We shall seriously implement the State Council's 
"decision 
on accelerating the development of village and town enterprises 
in central and western regions," and strive to increase the 
investment in village and town enterprises to 1 billion yuan, 
including 700 million yuan of special bank loans and 300 million 
yuan of funds to be raised by village and town enterprises 
themselves. Efforts shall be made to ensure timely availability 
of both bank loans and enterprise funds. We shall make full use 
of our abundant resources to develop the mining industry and 
processing industry for famous- brand, good-quality indigenous 
products. We shall work in conjunction with the bureau of 
village and town enterprises and banking department to support a 
number of enterprises in a dozen or so selected counties, of 
which the products are highly marketable and yield high economic 
returns. We shall help those enterprises upgrade products and 
enlarge the scale of production. We shall gradually enable each 
county to have a successful major industry and each township a 
famous product, and increase the income of all counties, 
townships, peasants, and herdsmen. 
  -- We shall seriously do a good job in the supply of 
agricultural capital goods, and plan to supply 2.5 million 
tonnes of chemical fertilizer and 35,000 tonnes of plastic film 
for the coverage of 10 million mu of crops fields. We shall 
continue to practice a comprehensive price for chemical 
fertilizer to ensure an increase in both agricultural production 
and peasants' income. 
  -- We shall seriously implement the plan of providing jobs 
instead of relief to make poor regions become better off sooner. 
<H5>  4. Vigorously Grasp Industrial and Communications </H5>
Production, and Effectively Improve the Economic Results of 
Industrial Production 
  Industrial production should be persistently 
market-oriented. 
Efforts should be made to reorganize and transform industries, 
to readjust the product mix, to optimize the industrial 
structure, and to improve economic results. The region's total 
industrial output value is planned to be 36.9 billion yuan in 
1994, an increase of 13.5 percent over 1993. Of 38 major 
industrial products, the output of 34 will increase, that of 
three will remain the same as last year, and that of one will 
decrease. Major products whose output will rise include energy, 
raw and semifinished materials, marketable light industrial and 
textile products, as well as machinery and electronic products. 
The output of crude oil will amount to 12 million metric tons, 
up 15.9 percent; generated energy will be 10 billion 
kilowatt-hours, up 6.4 percent; steel production will be 598,000 
metric tons, up 11.6 percent; cement output will be 4.65 million 
metric tons, up 8.6 percent; and cotton yarn output will be 
950,000 skeins, up 31.9 percent. Rail freight transport will 
reach 23.2 million metric tons, up 17.2 percent; of this, 
east-bound freight transport will amount to 13.1 million metric 
tons, increasing 1 million metric tons. Freight transport by 
motor vehicle will reach 176 million metric tons, up 8.6 
percent. Transactions by post and telecommunications offices as 
a whole will amount to 500 million yuan, up 31.6 percent. In 
1994, 270,000 new telephones are planned to be installed in 
urban areas. Major measure are be implemented in 1994: 
  -- Vigorous efforts should be made to reform, reorganize, or 
transform industrial enterprises and to readjust the industrial 
structure, the product mix, and the organizational structure of 
enterprises. We should continue to change the operating 
mechanisms of industrial enterprises. While deepening the 
reform of enterprises' internal mechanisms, we should establish 
a modern enterprise system as the main phase of attack in the 
reform of enterprises. We should select a number of enterprises 
in which to carry out reform on a trial basis; after gaining 
experience, we should then popularize them step by step. At the 
same time, we should actively promote the shareholding system or 
the cooperative shareholding system in state-run enterprises and 
organize enterprise groups. The management of state-owned 
enterprises may be contracted out or leased to individuals, and 
some enterprises may be auctioned off. We should do a good job 
in enterprise production, operation, and management as well as 
in the development of new products, especially famous-brand 
ones. We should export more products to earn more foreign 
exchange. We should make it possible for enterprises in the 
region to increase their vigor and vitality so they will soon 
develop themselves into key enterprises and turn out top-quality 
products. 
  We should vigorously undertake technical transformation of 
old enterprises. According to the requirements for the 
readjustment of the industrial structure and the product mix, we 
should continue the technical transformation of petrochemical, 
salt-chemical [yan hua gong 7770 0553 1562], textile, 
metallurgical, energy, and communications industries. Financial 
departments, village and town enterprises, local authorities, 
and enterprises should try to raise funds themselves for 
technical transformation and infrastructure construction. This 
is one way to increase investment in technical transformation. 
Meanwhile, for the technical transformation of old enterprises, 
we should actively introduce funds, technology, and equipment 
from abroad and other parts of the country. 
  -- We should rely on the petroleum industry to nurture local 
industries, especially those serving the acceleration and 
exploitation of petroleum and relevant industries. We should do 
a good job in developing ethylene, polyester, and other 
downstream products [xia you chan pin 0007 3266 3934 0756]. Our 
tentative plan is to build 108 projects for the development of 
ethylene, polyester, and other downstream products and for the 
processing of natural gas. We should complete the construction 
of 24 such projects and put them into operation within the year; 
15 projects are now under construction. We should make 
preparations for 69 projects whose construction has yet to be 
started. We should step up our organizing and coordinating 
efforts and strive to build more projects in 1994 and 1995. 
  -- We should continue to effectively perform our work in 
coordinating and balancing production by increasing the 
production of goods in great demand, setting a limit on the 
production of goods that are not very marketable, and stopping 
the production of unsalable goods. We should make every 
possible effort to increase the production of marketable goods. 
Large and medium-sized enterprises should make continued 
efforts to put an end to their losses and increase their 
profits. We should step up the appraisal of industrial economic 
return indexes. 
  -- We should conscientiously do a good job in 
communications, 
transportation, and postal and telecommunications services, and 
tap the potential of east-bound rail transport. We should 
strengthen the organization and management of communications and 
transportation, separate highway transport from rail transport, 
and make rail transport in large quantities a success. 
  5. Maintain a Rational Scale of Investment and 
Concentrate Efforts on Restructuring Investment 
  This year, the whole society's investment in Xinjiang's 
fixed 
assets is set at 9.8 billion yuan, up 32.7 percent from the 
previous year; of which, state-owned units' investment accounts 
for 7.214 billion yuan; collective investment, 1.28 billion 
yuan; and individual investment, 1.3 billion yuan. In 
state-owned units' investment, capital construction will absorb 
4.958 billion yuan, up 39.3 percent; technical transformation, 
1.5 billion yuan and up 35.1 percent; real estate, 525 million 
yuan and up 67.2 percent; and other projects, 230 million yuan 
and up 18 percent. In the state- owned units' capital 
construction investment, 390 million yuan is from the financial 
budget; 85 million yuan draws from two loans offered by the 
People's Bank; 1.2 billion yuan is foreign capital; 1.372 
billion yuan is offered by various specialized banks in the form 
of loans; 240 million yuan is collected from the issuing of 
treasury bonds; and 1.671 billion yuan is invested or raised by 
various departments, bureaus, prefectures, autonomous 
prefectures, cities, and enterprises themselves. 
  The preliminary arrangement for capital construction 
investment is that there will be 151 projects costing over 3 
million yuan each, including 52 key projects costing over 30 
million each. Total investment is set at 7.4 billion yuan -- 
4.627 billion yuan invested by the central authorities and 2.773 
billion yuan by the local authorities. Among the 151 projects, 
43, including six projects costing over 30 million yuan each, 
will be completed this year. The six projects include the 
renovation and expansion project of the 1 August Steelworks for 
upgrading its producing capacity to 600,000 tonnes, the 
second-phase project of Manas Power Plant, the Axi Gold Mine, 
the Markit Bridge over Yarkant River, Tacheng Airport, and the 
project on collective heat supplies for Guangming Road in 
Urumqi. There will be two single or partial projects put into 
operation: The multiple track of Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and 
the third-phase expansion project of Tashidian Thermal Power 
Plant in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. Among the 151 
projects, 94 are being continued from the previous year, 
including 39 key projects with over 30 million yuan of 
investment. There are 13 newly launched projects, mainly the 
renovation and expansion project of Urumqi Airport, the 
Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan Superhighway, the No. 2 Chemical 
Fertilizer Factory of Urumqi Petroleum-Chemical Corporation 
project, the No. 9 Hongyan Battery Factory, the key water 
conservancy project of Wuluwati, the second-phase expansion 
project of the No. 2 Hami Power Plant, the Xinjiang-Tabei 
Charcoal Joint Venture, and others. There are eight preparatory 
projects and 28 key projects, including nine central-invested 
projects and 19 local-invested ones. 
  It is necessary to continue efforts to properly prepare for 
construction projects. This year, we should continue to focus 
some funds on autonomous region-level agriculture, water 
conservancy, transportation, energy resources, and important raw 
and processed materials projects; and projects with an important 
influence on the regional economy whose scale of investment is 
over 30 million yuan. 
<H5>  6. Open Wider to the Outside World, Vigorously Develop Urban </H5>
and Rural Markets, and Continue To Improve People's Living 
Standards 
  We should make full use of Xinjiang's resources and 
geographical advantages, and continue to promote opening up in 
the direction of a high-level, wide-range, and in-depth 
development. The target of this year's total export value is 
set at $550 million, including $280 million through letters of 
credit [L/C] and $270 million from border trade; we should 
strive to achieve $600 million in total export value, including 
$300 million through L/C and $ 300 million from border trade, 
respectively. The major exported goods are: 90,000 tonnes of 
cotton, 20,000 tonnes of rice, and 160,000 tonnes of maize. We 
will use $298 million of foreign funds, up 22.6 percent; this 
includes $243 million in loans and $56 million in direct foreign 
investments, up 22.7 percent and 24.4 percent, respectively. 
  This year, we should take the good opportunity of launching 
significant reform in foreign exchange and foreign trade 
management mechanisms to strive for higher exports and reverse 
declining L/C earnings. While continuing to promote the 
traditional export of bulk farm and sideline products, we should 
try to increase the export of light industrial goods, textiles, 
machinery, electronic goods, chemicals, and other processed 
products that have high-added value, and can earn more foreign 
exchange and economic returns. While consolidating and expanding 
current markets, we should actively develop markets in Southeast 
Asia, west Asia, and the Middle East. Trading enterprises 
should develop themselves into industrialized, conglomerate, and 
internationalized businesses in line with the reform of foreign 
trade system as soon as possible; and uphold the principle of 
focusing on one trade, developing a diversified economy, and 
winning victory through quality. We should actively promote the 
export agency system and vigorously support prefectural, 
autonomous prefectural, and city trading companies, large and 
medium-sized enterprises, and village and town enterprises 
entering the international market. In conducting border trade, 
we should spur exports with imports, emphatically secure the 
source of imported goods and sales, and attach importance to 
improving product quality and economic returns. 
  We shall further improve the investment environment and 
continue to expand the use of foreign capital. While building 
projects under construction well, we shall seriously ensure that 
all contracts signed for building foreign-funded projects are 
fulfilled. We shall enhance our attractiveness to foreign 
investors and invite foreign investment in a number of projects 
with high economic returns which suit domestic conditions and 
demand. According to the state and autonomous regional 
industrial policies, we shall guide more foreign investment into 
foreign-exchange-earning industries, infrastructural 
construction, basic industries, new and high-technology 
industries, and technical renovation of existing enterprises. 
We shall pay attention to effective use of foreign capital and 
ensure that foreign funds arrive in time according to contracts. 
We shall step up the feasibility appraisal for using foreign 
loans and strictly enforce the principle of servicing debts by 
borrowers. We shall build a self-restraining mechanism for all 
departments, localities, and enterprises with respect to 
borrowing foreign loans. 
  With increases in both supply and demand, we will continue 
to 
maintain a market situation characterized by brisk sales and 
basic balance between supply and demand. However, the 
contradiction between supply and demand of a small number of 
goods remains conspicuous. To ensure adequate supply of 
important commodities which have a bearing on the national 
economy and people's livelihood, such as grain, cotton, oil 
products, rolled steel, and timber, we shall strive to maintain 
a balance between total supply and demand; give different 
guidance to suit different conditions; gradually establish and 
perfect a reserve system; make up for shortages in a timely 
manner; and stabilize market prices. As for other commodities, 
we shall give full play to the role of market forces, and mainly 
let the market regulate their supply and demand. We shall 
monitor the trend of commodities of which prices are 
decontrolled, and provide information to guide their supply 
according to demand. In our plan, the total retail commodity 
sales volume is projected to be 22 billion yuan, up 19.14 
percent; and total grain purchase to be 1.5 billion kilograms, 
including 800 million kilograms from contract orders. In the 
1993-1994 cotton growing period, we plan to purchase 700,000 
tonnes. The autonomous region shall treat 5 percent of the 
purchased cotton from each prefecture or autonomous prefecture 
as the latter's retained portion, and return the income from 
sales to the prefecture or autonomous prefecture. In the 
1994-1995 cotton growing period, we will strive to purchase 
800,000 tonnes. In 1994, we will continue to require the 
autonomous regional petroleum administration and Urumqi 
petrochemical company to deliver to the state 60,000 tonnes of 
contribution oil, 202,200 tonnes of oil for making up shortages, 
and 41,500 tonnes of Zepu oil [ze pu you 3419 2528 3111]. In 
addition, the rolled steel earmarked for unified state 
distribution, and the 130,000 tonnes of rolled steel produced by 
the No. 8 Steel Mill and under the autonomous region's 
distribution, shall be subject to orders placed by the state. 
Eighty thousand cubic meters of timber shall be earmarked for 
the autonomous region's distribution. Of the cement produced by 
the Xinjiang Cement Plant, 300,000 tonnes shall be earmarked for 
the autonomous region's distribution. 
  In order to establish an integrated, open, orderly, and 
competitive market, we shall step up market cultivation and 
construction. While striving to improve existing the country 
fair market and wholesale market, we shall give high priority to 
developing autonomous regional-level and district wholesale 
markets for grain, edible oil, animal husbandry products, fresh 
and dehydrated melons and fruit, and sugar this year and next 
year. We shall build, rebuild, and expand a number of large 
and medium comprehensive and specialized wholesale markets in 
Changji, Kuitun, Yining, Korla, Kashi, and other commodity 
collection and distribution centers. According to the state 
plan, we shall actively prepare the establishment of markets for 
cotton, chemical fertilizer, and other important capital goods 
and explore the establishment of futures market for cotton. We 
shall continue to improve the services of rolled steel, 
automobile markets, and capital goods firms. We shall actively 
cultivate markets for capital, technology, labor, and other 
production factors. 
  On the basis of developing the economy and enhancing 
efficiency, the people's livelihood in both urban and rural 
areas will continue to improve. Corresponding to developments 
in production and better efficiency, workers in enterprises will 
have better incomes. Per capita net incomes for peasants and 
herdsmen will also raise considerably as a result of rural 
economic development and better prices for farm products. We 
should pay special attention to the livelihood of personnel who 
have resigned or retired, staff and workers in enterprises 
having production and operation difficulties, and peasants and 
herdsmen in poor areas by showing concern and making appropriate 
arrangements. Reform of the social security system will be 
accelerated to gradually establish a multi-pattern, multi-level 
social security system. 
<H5>  7. Attach Greater Importance to Science and Technology and </H5>
Education; Promote Overall Development of Various Social 
Undertakings 
  We should energetically push forward the plan to "develop 
Xinjiang through the application of science and technology" and 
speed up the pace of reforming the management system for science 
and technology to meet the demands of developing a socialist 
market economy. While committing ourselves to key state 
scientific and technological projects, in line with Xinjiang's 
reality we should closely link local scientific research to 
production and work out Xinjiang's own key scientific research 
and industrial experiment programs to facilitate transformation 
of scientific and technological research achievements into 
productive forces. 
  We should further strengthen elementary education, making 
sure the nine-year compulsory education system is well 
implemented. Secondary vocational education and adult education 
at different levels and in varied forms should be run well. On 
the premise of guaranteeing school conditions and teaching 
quality, higher education should be developed steadily. A 
specialization structure should be adjusted to meet the demands 
of economic development. The student enrollment targets for 
ordinary institutions of higher learning, secondary specialized 
schools, and skilled workers schools for 1994 should be 9,000, 
1.95 million, and 1 million students, respectively. 
  In strengthening the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization, efforts should be made to promote undertakings in 
such fields as culture, press, publications, radio and 
television, public health, sports, and tourism. Development of 
various social undertakings in the vast agricultural and 
pastoral areas, particularly in remote frontiers and poor areas, 
should be stepped up. In 1994 we should strive to garner a 
60-million-yuan investment to solve the water supply problem of 
600,000 people and 1.2 million head of cattle in rural areas. 
We will do what we can to solve the electricity problems in 
Markit, Bachu, and Akqi counties by trying to bring them 
supplies within the coming two years. On the question of 
building 122 new rural hospitals, the autonomous regional 
planning committee and finance office will make available 30 
million yuan to the health office to implement the projects in 
1994 and 1995 to ensure each and every village and town has its 
own hospital by the end of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan." 
<H5>  8. Deepen Reform of the Planning System and Investment </H5>
Structure 
  The Third Plenum of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided 
that, in order to accelerate the establishment of a socialist 
market economic system, it is essential to renew the planning 
concept, transform the functions of planning management, 
thoroughly deepen reform of the planning system, and establish a 
new type of system compatible with the demands of developing a 
socialist market economy. The "Decision" explicitly stipulates: 
"The tasks of planning work are to rationally define strategies 
for the development of the national economy and society; the 
objectives of macroeconomic control and industrial policies; to 
make good economic forecasts; and plan major economic 
structures, the distribution of productive forces, and 
conservation of national territories and construction of key 
projects. Planning work should concentrate on the overall 
situation, strategies, and policies, with emphasis on drafting 
medium and long-term plans, and on the comprehensive and 
coordinated use of macroeconomic policies and economic levers." 
These stipulations have clearly defined the nature, functions, 
scope, and role of planning work under a socialist market 
economic system, and have explicitly defined for us the 
direction and tasks of accelerating reform of the planning 
system. Based on the State Planning Commission's plans for 
reforming the planning system and after taking into 
consideration Xinjiang's reality, we shall put forward our 
opinions on its actual implementation. Xinjiang's basic 
thinking on deepening reform of the planning system is as 
follows: 
  First, we must change the functions of planned management 
as well as the traditional mandatory plan system, and gradually 
establish a guided-type of planned system based on the market 
situation. We must further curtail dependence on mandatory 
plans for production and circulation, formulate and implement 
guided plans capable of forecasting, giving guidance, and that 
are in line with the policy. Second, we must reform the mode of 
planned management; gradually introduce changes from mainly 
direct regulation and control of the past to mainly indirect 
regulation and control; establish an economic monitoring and 
forecasting system; and enhance the ability to regulate and 
control the economy by coordinating and comprehensively applying 
economic policies, economic laws, regulations, and economic 
leverage. Third, we must establish a scientifically sound 
planned system, further reform our annual plans, gradually shift 
the emphasis to medium- and long-term plans, attach importance 
to the formulation and implementation of industrial policies, 
and to plans for various trades, professions, and specific 
projects. Fourth, we must vigorously nurture a market system, 
improve the system for ordering and storing of important 
commodities that have a bearing on the country's economic plans 
and people's livelihood, and promptly guide and coordinate 
market operations through forecasting, information, and means of 
putting new products on the market. Fifth, we must perfect the 
new type of planned system and interdependent system; introduce 
a new auditing system for the national economy; adopt an 
openness in formulating plans; establish a system for evaluating 
plans and policies; increase openness in formulating plans; and 
enhance social participation, so that the process of formulating 
plans will become a process for the government and various 
social sectors to strive and reach a consensus, as well as a 
process for coordinating actions. 
  It is necessary to deepen reform of the investment system, 
gradually establish an investment system favorable to bringing 
the role of the market into play in distributing resources under 
macroeconomic regulation and control. In the light of economic 
efficiency, market needs, and the nature of investment 
activities, we should categorize various projects as 
competitive, basic, or social welfare in nature, and reasonably 
define the investment scope and responsibilities of governments 
at all levels for infrastructure and public welfare; while 
basically raising funds from the market in respect of projects 
which are competitive in nature. We should establish a risk 
responsibility mechanism for investment by a legal person, 
whereby the legal person initiating a construction project will 
be responsible for the entire process of planning, fund- 
raising, design, and construction, as well as for managing 
production, return of loans, along with maintaining or 
increasing the value of assets, and bear the risks involved in 
an investment. We should change the methods and procedures for 
examining and approving proposals for introducing new projects. 
Generally, one may adopt the principal part of investment 
responsibilities in respect of current investments, and then 
work out the methods for creating a project. We should 
establish a sound filing and registration system for newly 
introduced projects, speed up the establishment of a service 
system for the investment market, improve the feed-back system 
for investment information, and strengthen macro-guidance and 
control over the total amount of investment and investment 
structure. We should expand the scope for raising funds for 
construction capital through multi-channels. 
  Fellow deputies, the tasks for reform and construction in 
our 
autonomous region for the current year are extremely arduous. 
However, we firmly believe that so long as we earnestly 
implement the guidelines of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) 
of the Fourth Xinjiang Autonomous Regional Party Committee, 
properly implement the arrangements for economic work in our 
autonomous region, clearly discern the situation, brace 
ourselves, seize opportunities, deepen reform, accelerate the 
pace of development, ever explore and forge ahead, work hard, 
pay due attention, and do solid work, then we will definitely be 
able to comprehensively fulfill our national economic and social 
development plans for the current year.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 Mar (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--This year 
is the peak launching year of China's space industry. China 
successfully launched the Long March 3-A rocket carrying one 
satellite on 8 February and will launch another five domestic 
and foreign satellites with five Long March carrier rockets this 
year. 
  During the first half of this year, China will use Long 
March 
No 3 and Long March No 3-A carrier rockets to launch a domestic 
meteorological satellite, the "Fengyun No 2," and a new type of 
domestic telecommunications satellite, the "Dongfanghong No 3." 
  China has already launched two "Fengyun No 1" meteorological 
satellites. "Fengyun No 2" is the first static orbit 
meteorological satellite, and it can be used to observe an 
approximately 100 million square km of the earth surface, with 
China as the center. Compared with "Dongfanghong No 2," which 
China previously launched, the "Dongfanghong No 3" 
telecommunications satellite has a longer life and greater 
capacity. It has 24 C-wave band transmitters for television, 
telephone, telegram, and fax transmissions and other 
telecommunications operations. 
  During the second half of this year, China will launch three 
foreign satellites. A Long March No 3 carrier rocket will be 
used to launch the telecommunications satellite "Asia-Pacific No 
1," and two Long March No 2 bundled rockets will be used to 
launch the "Aussat B-3" and the telecommunications satellite 
"Asia-Pacific No 2."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Hong Xia: "Beijingers' Wages Stay Ahead </F>
of Price Rises"] 
  [Text] The average income of workers in Beijing rose 28.3 
percent last year to 4,300 yuan ($494). 
  That's an increase of 7.8 percent once inflation is taken 
into account, said officials from the Beijing Statistical Bureau. 
  The rise was a further indication of the benefits brought by 
the reforms of the last decade. 
  And this was illustrated more strongly by the fact that 
every 
100 urban families in Beijing owned 107.2 colour TV sets last 
year, 5.7 percent more than 1992. 
  They also owned 45.6 video recorders and 82.4 cameras, 9.4 
and 6.7 percent more than the previous year. 
  The living standards of the local farmers also improved. 
  There were roughly 50 television and 50 refrigerators and 76 
washing machines for every 100 rural households. They were all 
higher than the relative figures of 1992. 
  However, the income gap between the city and the rural 
suburbs also grew to 1080 yuan ($124) from 744 yuan ($86) in 
1992. 
  And more than 300,000 people, 6.2 percent of the city's 
people, were living below the poverty line which was set at 161 
yuan ($18.5) month. 
  Most of the people on low pay were from loss-making 
enterprises and so were unable to receive their full pay but 
many others had been laid off as companies restructured. 
  Various municipal departments were taking measures to help 
the poor people. 
  For instance, Beijing Trade Union was offering them handouts 
and some enterprises were encouraging laid-off workers to go 
into service industries. 
  Beijing Labour Bureau is working out a minimum wage to 
protect workers' rights. 
  And all the the low earners and redundant workers get 
welfare 
payments. 
  Most welfare payments are below 100 yuan ($11). But they are 
to be raised after the minimum wage is worked out later this 
year, said Beijing Labour Bureau.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wang Dongjin, director of the Hebei </F>
Provincial Commission for Restructuring of the Economy, on 
priorities of Hebei's economic reform for 1994] 
  [Text] [Reporter] What will Hebei emphasize in its endeavor 
to facilitate price reform this year? 
  [Wang Dongjin] Hebei will emphasize four aspects of work 
when 
facilitating price reform this year. First is to increase the 
grain and cotton purchasing prices to protect peasants' 
production enthusiasm. Beginning 1 April, we will lift the 
control on the grain purchasing price throughout the province, 
change state fixed-quota purchases into contracted purchases, 
ensure the quantity but decontrol the price, and implement the 
protection price system in the purchases of grain. Second is to 
adjust the prices of crude oil, refined oil, and electricity at 
an opportune time in line with state arrangements and lift the 
price control on coal and chemical fertilizer. Third is to 
further lift the price control on competitive commodities and 
services and properly adjust the state-controlled prices for 
some commodities and services. Fourth is to control the 
benchmark land price well and gradually establish a mechanism 
for normal real estate prices to take shape. We should 
carefully organize the implementation of the various price 
reform measures, strictly forbid unauthorized price increase, 
adopt effective measures to stabilize the prices of nonstaple 
food, and keep the general price increase within the scope 
bearable to all fields of society. 
  [Reporter] Hebei won notable achievements in cultivating and 
developing commodity markets in the past few years. What 
measures will it take to accelerate this work this year? 
  [Wang Dongjin] This year's commodity market construction 
should be focused on four aspects. First, based on local 
resources advantages, laws governing commodity circulation, and 
regional demand, we will cultivate on a priority basis a number 
of wholesale markets for farm and sideline products, such as 
grain, vegetables, fruits, aquatic products, meat, poultry, 
eggs, and livestock, that meet local demands and have their own 
characteristics to clear the channels for the circulation of 
farm and sideline products and to resolve peasants' 
"difficulties in purchasing and marketing." We will open a 
number of specialized wholesale markets for industrial goods in 
the areas where these goods are produced, marketed, or 
transferred, and we will open a number of tourist, recreational, 
and catering markets. Second, we will develop the markets for 
the means of industrial and agricultural production at various 
levels and through various channels in line with the principle 
of letting those who invest gain the ownership and interests and 
establish, throughout the province as soon as possible, a 
pattern of the markets of means of production in which the 
regional wholesale markets in the key energy and raw material 
producing areas are placed in the lead, the markets of means of 
production in the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the 
province are the channels, and those in county seats are the 
mainstay. We will also develop the commodity circulation 
organizations and production and marketing forms that help 
stabilize the relations between production and marketing to 
serve industrial and agricultural production still better. 
Third, we will build large retail outlets more rapidly. Cities 
directly under the jurisdiction of the province should 
particularly develop a number of large, multi-purpose, and 
fairly well-known shopping centers that provide a good shopping 
environment, have competitive edges, and create high economic 
efficiency to satisfy people's ever growing consumption demand. 
Fourth, in compliance with the State Council requirement for 
"standardizing the beginning and experimenting with all work," 
we will work hard to create favorable conditions, train 
high-level personnel for futures management, and draw up plans 
for experiments to be submitted to the State Council Securities 
Commission in order to strive to establish two pilot futures 
markets. 
  [Reporter] The focus of the current endeavor to cultivate 
and 
improve the market system is to develop the markets for 
essential elements of production. Please give us specific 
details about it? 
  [Wang Dongjin] We should put the cultivation of the markets 
for essential elements of production in a prominent position 
this year and expedite building of the markets for money, labor 
forces, personnel, technology, real estate, information, and 
enterprises' property rights. 
  We will develop and improve the money markets with banks' 
money-lending as the major form, actively develop the 
standardized inter-bank lending and the markets for discounted 
bills, improve and define the business scope of the provincial 
money-lending center, and establish its branches in some cities 
directly under the jurisdiction of the province. We will 
further develop the securities markets, prepare for establishing 
securities trading centers in Shijiazhuang and Tangshan cities, 
and establish securities trading agencies in the cities directly 
under the jurisdiction of the province and securities transfer 
agencies in county-level cities. We will actively raise funds 
by issuing bonds and stocks, create favorable conditions for 
issuing trust profitable securities and investment fund 
securities to satisfy the needs of investors and raise more 
funds for construction projects. 
  We will give full play to the role of the market mechanism 
in 
rationally distributing urban and rural labor resources. We 
will expand and improve the functions of labor markets to enable 
them to provide integrated multi-purpose services for offering 
jobs, employment consultation, unemployment insurance, and 
pre-employment training. We will provide active support for all 
fields of society to establish employment agencies and gradually 
establish a service network composed of the labor markets at 
city, county, and township (neighborhood) levels and those built 
by all fields of society so that we can provide conditions for 
enterprises to employ workers and laborers to choose jobs by 
themselves. Cities directly under the jurisdiction of the 
province should expedite construction of the facilities for 
labor markets and connect all the markets in the province into 
an integrated network. We should strengthen regional labor 
service cooperation and guide the orderly mobility of rural 
labor forces. 
  We will accelerate construction of personnel markets and 
change, as soon as possible, the personnel management methods 
characterized by departmental ownership and unified and 
guaranteed job arrangements. All cities and prefectures should 
build and improve personnel markets, strengthen their services, 
and realistically develop the role of the markets in regulating 
the supply and demand of personnel. We will facilitate the 
reform of the scientific and technological system and greatly 
develop technology markets. We will promote the restructuring 
of scientific and technological departments, the transformation 
of their mechanisms, and the diversion of their personnel in 
line with the principle of "holding fast to one end and leaving 
the whole field open." We will transform scientific research 
institutes engaged in technological development into enterprises 
more rapidly and encourage scientific and technical personnel to 
establish nongovernmental enterprises engaged in scientific and 
technological development. We will establish an open technology 
market network to encourage the scientific and technical 
personnel and scientific research achievements of scientific 
research institutes, colleges, and universities to enter urban 
and rural technology markets. We will develop the various forms 
of technology trading activities to transform technological 
achievements more rapidly into commodities and to industrialize 
them. 
  In 1994, we will prepare for building the provincial-level 
economic information market and connect it with the information 
markets of the cities directly under the jurisdiction of the 
province so as to establish a provincewide economic information 
market network. We will build specialized markets for 
information on medicinal herbs and building materials to service 
the production and operation of Hebei's medicinal herbs and 
building materials industries. 
  Hebei will prepare for building an enterprise property 
rights 
trading center to meet the needs in the adjustment of the 
organization of enterprises. All cities and prefectures should 
also establish property rights trading markets to provide 
service for enterprises to deal with property rights. 
  [Reporter] Deepening the reform of the foreign economic 
relations system and opening wider to the outside world are the 
strategic measure for building an economically strong province. 
What are the major measures Hebei will take this year for this 
work? 
  [Wang Dongjin] We will continue to unswervingly implement 
the 
policy of opening to the outside world and open still wider. We 
will exert more efforts to achieve success in the opening up of 
Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and Cangzhou, the development belt along 
the Beijing-Shenzhen Expressway, and the various regional 
central cities, link them to the world market as soon as 
possible, and fully develop their radiating and leading role. 
We will adhere to the principle of developing foreign economic 
relations, foreign trade, and foreign capital simultaneously and 
accelerate the development of the export-oriented economy. We 
will strive to make foreign-funded enterprises successful; 
broaden the channels for using foreign capital; coordinate the 
work to bring in funds and technology from abroad with the 
adjustment of the industrial structure and the renovation of old 
enterprises; develop on a priority basis technology-intensive 
enterprises and the enterprises that produce import substitutes 
and earn foreign exchange through exports; increase the 
proportion of foreign investment made in infrastructural 
facilities, basic industries, and high- and new-tech projects; 
and attach importance to bringing in funds from abroad through 
issuance of capital stocks and securities. We will make the 
best of Hebei's abundant labor resources to undertake 
construction projects and labor service cooperation abroad 
through various channels and measures. We will establish a 
pattern of multi-directional opening up step by step. 
  We will further deepen the reform of the foreign trade 
system 
in line with the principle of unified policies, open business, 
competition on an equal footing, sole responsibility for profits 
and losses, integrated management of industry and foreign trade, 
and wide application of the agency system. We will speed up 
transformation of the operating mechanism of the import and 
export enterprises of various categories and reorganize the 
state-owned foreign trade enterprises according to the modern 
enterprise system. Large and medium-sized enterprises where 
conditions permit should actively apply for and use well the 
import and export authority. Those without the necessary 
conditions for dealing with imports and exports for the time 
being may "borrow ships to go to sea," actively promote the 
integrated management of industry, commerce, technology, and 
agriculture with foreign trade, and develop the 
internationalized, industrialized, and conglomerate trading 
companies. In this way, more enterprises will be able to enter 
the world market. We will encourage establishment of 
enterprises outside the border and improve the export tax refund 
system. We will further lift control on import and export 
commodities and gradually distribute the quotas through bidding 
and auction the small number of import and export commodities 
under quota management in a fair and open manner while 
considering their efficiency. We will make the city, 
prefectural, and county foreign trade management systems more 
rational and delegate financial management powers to lower 
levels to stimulate the enthusiasm of grass-roots enterprises. 
  [Reporter] What is your opinion on accelerating the reform 
of 
the social security system and the housing system? 
  [Wang Dongjin] We will follow the principle of "unified 
management and separation of government administration from 
functions of institutions" to make the social insurance 
management system more rational and gradually establish the 
multi-layered social security system. The focus of this year is 
to accelerate the reform of the urban social insurance system to 
strengthen the social service function and reduce the burdens on 
enterprises; and to encourage various types of social mutual aid 
and actively develop commercial insurance to satisfy the needs 
of various levels. We will consolidate and improve the 
provincial-level unified planning for the old-age insurance 
premiums of state-owned enterprises and accelerate the unified 
planning of society for the old-age insurance premiums of the 
staff members and workers of collective enterprises to make sure 
that the unified planning will cover more than 85 percent of the 
staff members and workers this year. We will further expand the 
coverage of the old-age insurance and gradually include all the 
temporary workers, Chinese staff members and workers of 
foreign-funded enterprises, staff members and workers of private 
enterprises, and self-employed laborers in the insurance. We 
will actively experiment with the reform of the calculation and 
issuance of the old-age insurance premiums of staff members and 
workers and explore the ways to combine unified planning of 
society with individual accounts to gradually make enterprises 
and individuals share the insurance premiums together. We will 
further establish and improve the unified unemployment insurance 
system that cover all staff members and workers of enterprises 
of various categories, including the Chinese staff members and 
workers of foreign-funded enterprises, exercise integrated 
management, establish the unemployment insurance premium system 
at the provincial level and city or prefectural level, and 
coordinate unemployment insurance with employment service to 
promote social stability. We will continue the experiment with 
the reform of medical insurance, industrial injury insurance, 
and maternity insurance of women workers. Based on peasants' 
voluntary participation, we will institute the old-age insurance 
derived from accumulation of individual accounts. We will 
develop and improve rural cooperative medical service. We will 
strengthen the management and public supervision of various 
insurance funds. 
  We will conscientiously implement the State Council decision 
on accelerating urban housing reform; sell, lease, and build 
houses simultaneously, with the focus on selling houses; 
actively but prudently promote sales of public houses; and 
strictly implement the principle for fixing prices defined by 
the State Council. We will continue to raise public house rent, 
expedite urban housing construction in coordination with the 
implementation of the "live-in-peace project," greatly develop 
economical and practical houses, and promote fund-raising and 
cooperation in housing construction. We will extensively apply 
the accumulation fund system to housing construction. We will 
develop money lending for houses and issue mortgage loans for 
people to buy houses. 
  [Reporter] Hebei is a large agricultural province, and the 
issue on agriculture, rural areas, and peasants is a basic issue 
concerning our economic development and modernization drive. 
How will Hebei further deepen the rural economic reform this 
year? 
  [Wang Dongjin] To deepen the rural economic reform, we 
should 
stabilize the party's basic rural policies and establish more 
rapidly the systems for the operation and management of the 
rural economy that meet the needs of the socialist market 
economy and that aim mainly at cultivating the mainstay of the 
market, strengthening macroeconomic guidance, intensifying 
protection of agriculture, and increasing peasants' income. We 
should stabilize the household-based output-related contract 
responsibility system and further improve the dual management 
system that combines unified management with independent 
management. On the premise that land is owned by the 
collective, we will conscientiously implement the central 
stipulation of extending the land contract another 30 years 
without change. The term of the contracts for reclaiming barren 
hills, wasteland, sandy land, and beaches for developmental 
production may be even longer, and inheritance of such contracts 
and paid transfer of land use rights according to law are 
permitted. Based on the voluntary participation of the masses, 
the small number of localities with fairly developed economies 
may develop the optimal-scale operation through the transfer of 
contracts or purchases of stocks to improve agricultural labor 
productivity and land productivity. We should facilitate the 
development of township enterprises in line with the principle 
of "providing active support and correct guidance and ensuring 
their continuous improvement and gradual standardization." We 
should particularly develop the shareholding cooperation system 
and innovate their property right system and operating system to 
further enhance their vigor. After clarifying property rights, 
we will promote the flow and organization of the essential 
elements of production between different communities so that a 
more reasonable enterprise layout will take shape. Meanwhile, 
we will intensify planning to develop concentrations of township 
enterprises in certain areas. We will make active efforts to 
achieve success in the experimental reform to urbanize rural 
areas to accelerate the progress of the urbanization. We should 
speed up development of county-level cities, and the counties 
which possess the scale of a city and the conditions for 
building themselves into cities should actively apply for 
abolishment of the counties and establishment of cities. In the 
meantime, we should make the best use of and renovate the 
existing small cities and towns and build new ones. We will 
gradually reform the residence registration management system of 
small cities and towns and allow peasants to develop industrial 
work, commercial business, and the tertiary industry in small 
cities and towns to promote the transfer of surplus rural labor 
forces. 
  [Reporter] The market economy, in a certain sense, is a 
legally codified economy. How will Hebei step up establishment 
of the laws and regulations for the economic reform this year? 
  [Wang Dongjin] We will further establish and improve the 
laws and regulations compatible with the socialist market 
economy system, coordinate the policies for reform with those 
for legislation, and step up establish of the local laws or 
regulations on standardizing the mainstay of the market, 
safeguarding the market order, strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control, improving social security, and promoting 
opening to the outside world. We should conscientiously 
organize the enforcement of relevant laws issued by the state 
and draw up corresponding methods or detailed principles for 
their enforcement that are suitable to the provincial 
conditions. Meanwhile, in view of the continuously deepened 
reform in Hebei, we will step up establishment of the 
regulations on the management of private enterprises, 
shareholding cooperative economies, shareholding enterprises, 
and property right deals. We will clean up the laws, 
regulations, and policy documents incompatible with the 
establishment of the socialist market economy system and do a 
good job in "abolishing and amending them and formulating new 
ones." 
  We should strengthen and improve administration of justice, 
administrative law enforcement, and supervision of law 
enforcement and resolutely investigate, handle, and correct the 
failure in abiding by laws, strictly enforcing laws, and 
investigating law breaches, the abuse of power, and the law 
breaches committed for benefiting one's own department, 
locality, and small group. 
  The provincial party committee and government have placed 
great emphasis on the work to strengthen leadership over reform. 
Proceeding from the overall interests, all levels and all 
departments should truly embrace the guiding thought of 
promoting development through reform and truly concentrate the 
attention to accelerating development on deepening reform. 
Governments at all levels should pay close attention to the 
reform in key areas, carefully organize it, formulate specific 
plans and implement them meticulously, and study and address in 
a timely manner the new conditions and new problems emerging in 
the process of reform.

<F P=106> [Work report of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court </F>
delivered by Ping Yijie, president of the provincial higher 
people's court, at the second session of the eighth provincial 
people's congress on 1 March] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  I will now present a report to this session on the major 
work 
carried out by the people's court in 1993. 
  In 1993, people's courts at all levels in the province, 
under 
the leadership of party committees and the supervision of 
people's congresses and with the support of pertinent government 
departments, persistently took Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, 
conscientiously implemented the party's basic line consisting of 
"one central task and two basic points," faithfully enforced the 
Constitution and laws, carried out judicial work in an 
all-around manner focusing on strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control, opposing corruption, and safeguarding 
social stability, and fulfilled the various judicial tasks 
fairly successfully. In the past year, they concluded 191,013 
cases in first and second trials and judicial supervision cases, 
which showed an increase of 15.92 percent over the preceding 
year. Of the total, 20,201 were criminal cases, 123,605 were 
civil cases, 45,445 were cases on economic disputes, and 1,762 
were administrative cases. The judicial work of the people's 
courts played a positive role in safeguarding social stability, 
protecting the legal rights and interests of citizens and legal 
persons, and promoting reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  1. We sternly cracked down on serious criminal offenses to 
safeguard social stability. 
  Last year, people's courts at all levels in the province 
continued to implement the principle of meting out strict and 
prompt punishment according to the law to strictly crack down on 
criminal elements endangering public security. They handled 
17,969 criminals cases of first trial in the year, and concluded 
17,204 cases, or 95.74 percent of them. Judgments on 9,561 
cases came into legal effect, and 14,691 persons were sentenced. 
  To penetratingly promote the struggle to "deal strict 
blows," 
the provincial court, beginning early last year, made overall 
arrangements for all the courts in the province to carry out 
this struggle and then sent working groups to conduct 
investigations and study on how work had been done. In August, 
it held a work conference on strictly cracking down on serious 
criminal offenses and production and marketing of fake and 
inferior goods. Focusing on the priorities of the crackdown, 
people's courts at all levels added impetus to resolutely and 
sternly punish according to law, criminals with serious 
offenses, such as murder, robbery, rape, hooliganism, arson, 
bombing, and serious theft, especially habitual and repeat 
offenders, offenders on the move, and chief criminals of 
criminals rings. Meanwhile, in view of the public security 
situation of their own localities, all courts closely 
coordinated with public security and procuratorial organs to 
actively wage struggles against theft and timely special 
struggles against bus and train marauding and waylaying, damage 
of power equipment, kidnapping, abduction, and trade of women 
and children, and production and marketing of fake and inferior 
products. Courts in the province concluded 6,718 cases which 
seriously endangered public security and punished 7,894 
criminals, showing an increase of 1.58 and 3.18 percentage 
points, respectively, over the preceding year. Criminals guilty 
of the most heinous crimes were resolutely sentenced to death. 
  In order to accelerate the rate of handling cases, timely 
and effective blows were dealt to serious criminal offenses. 
Courts at all levels continued to uphold the effective method of 
intervening in the cases earlier than schedule, found out the 
situation of major cases that were brought to court for 
prosecution beforehand, discovered problems, offered suggestions 
in a timely manner, and avoided repeating procedures in handling 
cases. After the cases were brought to courts for prosecution, 
they deployed the judicial force scientifically, assigned cases 
to individuals as quickly as possible, read the cases 
conscientiously, handled them locally, and rapidly ended the 
cases on the premise of clarifying the basic facts and grasping 
the basic evidence, and realistically guaranteeing the quality 
of handling cases. Last year, of the cases accepted by courts 
for public prosecution, excepting the small number of 
complicated cases whose time for trial was extended, over 97 
percent were completed within the legal time limit. 
  To expand the social effect of handling cases, courts in all 
localities paid attention to selecting major and typical cases, 
and went deeply to places where the cases occurred to conduct 
public trials, to promote the legal system, to frighten the 
criminals, and to educate the masses. Last year, courts across 
the province held 531 open trials to try 2,161 cases involving 
3,425 criminals, with nearly 8 million people listening to the 
trials. Particularly, during the "4th May" and "1st October" 
periods and before New Year, the provincial court organized 
courts across the province to conduct activities on dealing 
blows to criminals in a concentrated manner. Courts in all 
localities made careful plans and arrangements, successively 
held large-scale public trials, extensively conducted propaganda 
through television, broadcast, and press media, dampened the 
arrogance of criminals, and showed up the strength of the 
people's democratic dictatorship. 
  Criminal offenses comprehensively reflect all kinds of 
passive factors. To solve public security problems, we must 
mobilize all social forces to participate in the comprehensive 
management of public security. While punishing criminals and 
doing a good job in trying civil, economic, and administrative 
cases, the people's courts at all levels actively participated 
in comprehensive management of public security through various 
means. First, they conscientiously tried cases on delinquents. 
Courts at all levels across the province established collegiate 
benches for trying cases involving delinquents, and some courts 
also established special tribunals to try this category of 
cases, educated delinquents through trials, paid attention to 
establishing relations with families and schools, implemented 
all measures to help and educate delinquents, and succeeded in 
educating, helping, and saving misguided youths. Second, they 
maintained close ties with grass- roots mediation organs, 
promptly grasped the symptoms of disputes, caught up with the 
work on their own initiative, resolved the contradictions during 
the budding stage, and prevented contradictions from turning 
into crimes. Last year courts across the province resolved a 
total of 1,993 contradictions of this category. Meanwhile, they 
strengthened the professional guidance for mediators and helped 
them enhance the ability to settle disputes. Third, in line 
with the problems that emerged in the course of trials, they 
offered judicial suggestions for relevant units in a timely 
manner, urged them to stop the loopholes, improved system, 
strengthened management, and took preventive measures. Last 
year courts across the province offered a total of 4,869 
judicial suggestions. Fourth, they monitored the acts of 
criminals under probation or control so as to help and educate 
them, purposefully transformed them through education, and urged 
them to turn over a new leaf and to start a new life. Fifth, 
they coordinated with the reform-through-labor departments to 
transform and educate criminals serving their prison term, and 
determined the reduction of prison terms or release on parole of 
criminals who showed repentance or made contributions in line 
with the reports of the reform-through-labor departments in an 
effort to promote the transformation of criminals. 
  2. We strictly punished and handled the serious economic 
criminals and promoted the thorough development of the struggle 
against corruption. 
  Crimes in the economic field and particularly those 
committed 
by state functionaries embezzling public funds by taking 
advantage of power and position and accepting bribes seriously 
broke the socialist economic order and damaged the relationship 
between the party and the people. In order to deal blows to 
crimes, to punish and prevent the corrupt, and to implement the 
demand set by the central authorities with regard to scoring 
periodical achievements in this regard in the near future; the 
people's courts at all levels throughout the province tried and 
handled a large number of serious economic criminals by 
earnestly implementing the guideline of strictly punishing and 
handling criminals in line with the law and the principle of 
"first being resolute, second cautious, and third accurate in 
handling criminals." They accepted 1,921 cases in 1993, tried 
and wound up 1,804 cases, and sentenced 1,947 economic convicts. 
Of these criminals, 335 had more than 10,000 yuan of illegal 
gains and 30 had more than 100,000 yuan of illegal gains. 
Through trials these courts recovered 13.96 million yuan of 
economic losses for the state and collectives. In dealing blows 
to economic crimes, the people's courts at all levels grasped 
the trial of serious and appalling cases; realistically enhanced 
leadership over the trial; and made careful arrangements for the 
trial. The first leading personnel of these courts took 
personal charge of the trial, paid attention to grasping the 
progress of the administration of justice, and frequently 
conducted inspection and supervision. They also studied and 
dealt with the problems and difficulties cropping up in the 
administration of justice and encouraged or supported the 
personnel in charge of trials to uphold the principles, to 
eliminate the interference, and to do things strictly in line 
with the law. Meanwhile, the report system for serious and 
appalling cases was established and the responsibility system 
for personnel in charge of trials was improved or implemented. 
Based on clarifying the base number and in making backbone 
personnel arrangements for trials, these courts fixed the 
specific assignment of personnel for trials; fixed the number of 
cases for judges; and fixed the date for winding up cases in 
order to try and to wind up the cases as soon as possible. To 
ensure the quality of the administration of justice and to deal 
sure, accurate, and relentless blows at economic crimes, the 
people's courts at all levels successfully made strict checks on 
facts and evidences and accurately and adequately applied the 
law. They paid special attention to setting up a demarcation 
line between economic crimes and the general violation acts 
cropping up in reform, opening up, and the establishment of 
socialist market economic systems. They also carefully handled 
the cases whose crimes are not clearly covered by the 
regulations of the law and policies so as to truly enable their 
trials to play a role of dealing blows to crimes, protecting 
reform, and punishing or preventing the corrupt. In addition, 
the people's courts at all levels paid attention to reinforcing 
the dynamics in the propaganda work and selected the serious and 
appalling cases that have a typical significance to broaden the 
social effect by holding open trials. In October 1993, the 
provincial higher people's court dispatched five work teams to 
respectively go to various prefectures and cities to carry out 
investigation and study and to supervise them to handle the 
serious and appalling cases. The people's court of various 
localities concentrated their time and efforts and took unified 
action in holding open trials for economic crimes. Last 
November, the provincial higher people's court and some 
intermediate courts, respectively, held press briefings to 
disclose their handling of serious and appalling economic cases, 
during which they vigorously built up a momentum; revealed with 
their practical deeds the determination made by the central 
authorities and the provincial party committee in punishing and 
preventing the corrupt; and played an active role in promoting 
the through development of the struggle against corruption. 
Difficulties encountered in investigating and handling the 
economic cases were large and time spent on investigating and 
handling these cases was long. The number of economic cases 
that were prosecuted in the court showed a 21.91 percent 
decrease compared to 1992. Along with the through struggle 
against corruption, some economic crimes are successively being 
exposed, investigated, and handled. Cases that will be 
prosecuted in the court will increase. Punishing or handling 
economic criminals and particularly trying the serious and 
appalling economic cases will become an important and protracted 
task. 
  3. We comprehensively strengthened the trial of the 
economic cases and the fulfillment of the tasks to serve the 
macroeconomic regulation and control and the development of the 
economy. 
  Along with the far-reaching progress of reform, opening up, 
and economic construction, various categories of economic 
dispute cases rose by a big margin. Thus, the people's courts 
at various levels increasingly undertake heavier tasks for 
trying economic cases. Last year, the courts across the province 
conducted first trials on 45,251 economic dispute cases, an 
increase of 44.09 percent compared to the previous year; and 
concluded 42,723 cases, an increase of 45.46 percent. Some 
2.245 billion yuan were involved in the lawsuits, an increase of 
20.69 percent. The people's courts at various levels 
ceaselessly intensified the awareness of conscious and active 
services; and accurately handled the relations between active 
service and strict enforcement of laws, between basing 
themselves on trials and expanding the scale of service, and 
between legal standards and productive force standards. By 
trying and handling a large number of economic disputes and 
offering various forms of lawsuit services, the people's courts 
ensured the smooth implementation of the measures for regulating 
the economic relations, safeguarding the economic order, and 
ensuring macroeconomic regulation and control. First, the 
people's courts persistently placed on file, prudently handled, 
and rapidly concluded the cases concerning the disputes over 
loans that took place in the course of rectifying the financial 
order, clearing up unreasonable loans, and violating regulations 
to use inter-bank loans; the cases concerning the collective 
economic disputes that cropped up by straightening out the 
problems of wantonly collecting funds and wantonly issuing 
enterprise bonds; and various categories of cases that were 
closely related to the enhancement of the macroeconomic 
regulation and control. In line with the situation that the 
financial departments' failure to withdraw larger amounts of 
loans affected the turnover of capital, the people's courts 
actively worked in cooperation with the financial departments to 
extensively disseminate laws and policies to enable the debtors 
actively return their loan, brought their trial functions into 
play, conscientiously examined and handled the disputes over 
loan contracts, and helped withdraw the overdue loans according 
to laws. Last year, the courts concluded 15,556 cases of this 
category, and 765 million yuan were involved in the lawsuits. 
Second, the people's courts timely and appropriately accepted 
and handled the cases of the disputes over purchasing and 
marketing, processing on a contracted basis, transfer of 
techniques, and management on a leasing basis so as to help 
enterprises promote the deepening of reform and the development 
of production. Last year, the courts at various levels 
concluded 13,792 cases of this category. The courts at various 
levels positively helped enterprises clear up "debt chains" so 
that enterprises could free themselves from the debt chains as 
soon as possible and enhance their development vitality. The 
people's courts first examined and handled the major cases 
involving larger amounts of money and seriously affecting the 
production and management of enterprises, particularly the cases 
relating to the state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises 
so as to have the enterprises be extricated from the strained 
circumstances and restore vitality. At the time when 
enterprises cooperated with one another for management, 
amalgamated with others, and declared bankruptcy, they timely 
applied legal means to help sort out property and clear up debts 
so as to promote the readjustment of the industrial structure 
and the change of the enterprise managerial mechanism. Third, 
they positively and steadily handled various categories of 
disputes over rural contracts and served the rural areas' social 
stability and economic development. By examining and handling 
1,989 cases relating to the disputes over rural contracts, 
particularly the disputes over contracts for fruit gardens and 
mountain forests, that had the symptoms to intensify the 
contradictions, that would easily cause the collectives to make 
visits, and that would easily affect the stability of society, 
the courts at various levels persistently relied on the support 
of the local party committees, people's congress, and 
governments to positively persuade the persons concerned and 
timely and prudently examined and handled their cases according 
to the laws. Fourth, people's courts at all levels adopted 
various measures to provide legal service to economic 
development. Last year, they established "economic dispute 
mediating centers" to resolve economic disputes speedily with 
simple methods. Many courts established ties with enterprises 
and conducted investigation and study at enterprises on a 
regular basis to help amend and improve economic contracts and 
to help enterprises train law personnel through training classes 
and by using certain cases to explain laws. In this way, they 
carried out positive work to prevent and reduce economic 
disputes. 
  Difficulty in executing the judgments remained a conspicuous 
problem in the work of the people's courts and also a "notorious 
problem" about which various circles of society had many 
complaints. To safeguard the authority of the judgments and the 
sanctity of laws, courts all levels established and improved the 
executive organs, replenished the executive personnel, and 
overcame numerous difficulties to greatly strengthen the 
execution of judgments. Courts in the province handled 52,222 
cases concerning the execution of judgments, and judgments on 
46,866 cases, or 89.74 percent, were executed, which involved 
490 million yuan. In executing the judgments, courts at all 
levels firmly embraced the idea of service; paid attention to 
properly handling the relations between executing the judgments 
and supporting the survival and development of enterprises and 
the relations between executing the judgments according to law 
and stabilizing the overall situation; kept social effect in 
mind when executing judgments according to law and with 
civility; analyzed cases in a specific manner; and treated 
different cases with different measures. Those capable of 
repaying debts but refused to do so were forced to repay 
according to law; those who refused to repay debts and whose 
activities obstructed public affairs and constituted crimes had 
their criminal liabilities pursued according to law; and 
enterprises which were unable to repay debts for the time being 
but had development prospects were helped to increase vigor and 
enhance capacity instead of "having their geese that laid golden 
eggs killed" so that they would make profits to repay debts. In 
view of the practice of making no distinction between trials and 
execution of judgments, wanton execution of judgments, and 
wanton arrests of people, the provincial court held two 
telephone conferences to emphasize the need to check law 
breaches in the executive work and act strictly according to 
law. Following the guidelines of the conferences, courts in all 
localities earnestly made corrections, strengthened management, 
and further established and improved various rules and systems 
to reinforce the mechanisms for restraint and supervision. To 
promote the judicial cooperation with the courts of other 
provinces and municipalities, eliminate the interference of 
local protectionism, and maintain the unity of the legal system, 
the provincial court signed an agreement on judicial cooperation 
with the seven neighboring provinces, municipalities, and 
autonomous regions in 1991 and attended in September 1993 a 
symposium on cooperation in courts' executive work attended by 
Hunan and 15 other provinces, municipalities, and regions, thus 
strengthening judicial cooperation on a larger scale and 
alleviating, to a certain extent, the difficulty in executing 
judgments in other localities. Last year, Hebei's courts were 
entrusted by the courts of other provinces, municipalities, and 
regions or to execute or to help them execute the judgments of 
854 cases involving 58.71 million yuan. Courts of other 
provinces, municipalities, and regions were entrusted by Hebei's 
courts to execute or to help them execute the judgments on 406 
cases involving 43.54 million yuan. Thanks to the unremitting 
efforts, people's courts made substantial progress in the 
execution of judgments. However, they still encountered great 
difficulties. In particular, when executing the judgments on 
economic disputes that involved different administrative areas, 
cadres and policemen of courts were frequently attacked and 
beaten, and sometimes even their lives were not guaranteed. To 
realistically and effectively safeguard the sanctity of laws, 
people's courts should continue efforts to improve work and 
raise their judicial level, and all circles of society should 
also provide more understanding, support, assistance, and 
coordination. 
  4. We conscientiously tried civil and administrative cases 
and realistically safeguarded the legal rights and interests of 
citizens, legal entities, and other organizations. 
  In 1993, courts across the province accepted 121,642 civil 
cases for first trial, an increase of 14.46 percent over the 
previous year, and concluded 116,165 cases, an increase of 15.15 
percent over the previous year. The number of civil cases was 
big and was increasing every year. Last year civil cases 
accepted by courts across the province for first trial accounted 
for over 65 percent of the total number of cases accepted by the 
courts, making the judicial tasks very heavy. This kind of cases 
involved many families and were closely related with the 
production and living of the people. Particularly, it is very 
meaningful to handle these cases well in the situation of 
establishing the socialist market economic structure. Courts 
at all levels conscientiously implemented the "general rules of 
civil codes," the "law on civil administrative procedures," and 
all kinds of other civil laws and regulations. Through trying 
57,719 cases on marriage and inheritance, they safeguarded 
social stability and family harmony, promoted socialist morality 
and practice, and promoted socialist spiritual civilization; and 
by trying 42,822 cases on disputes concerning debts, mountain 
forests, land, and water conservancy, they regulated the 
relations of various rural economic sectors and promoted the 
development of rural economy; and by trying 8,907 cases on 
compensation for damages, intellectual property rights, and 
labor disputes, meted out punishment for civil law-breaking acts 
and safeguarded the legal rights and interests of the persons 
concerned. In the course of handling cases, courts at all levels 
strictly filed cases for investigation, opened court sessions, 
confronted the accused with his accusers, conducted debates, and 
handled other aspects of work in line with legal procedures. 
They conscientiously implemented the principle of settling 
civil cases on a voluntary and legal basis, mediated civil 
disputes, and urged the persons concerned to conclude an 
agreement on the basis of consultation on an equal term and 
mutual understanding. Last year courts across the province 
mediated and concluded 74,531 cases, accounting for 64.16 
percent of the total number of concluded civil cases. 
Meanwhile, they unceasingly summed up experiences in trials, 
reformed the form of trying cases at courts, stressed the 
responsibility of persons concerned to give evidence, guaranteed 
the quality of handling cases, and enhanced the rate of handling 
cases. Furthermore, the broad masses of civil judicial cadres 
also exerted efforts to improve work style, often toured the 
rural areas to handle cases, and in addition to concluding a 
great number of civil cases, also handled 7,969 easy cases on 
disputes, reduced the accumulated number of lawsuits from the 
masses, and stabilized social order. 
  During trial of administrative cases, courts at all levels 
conscientiously implemented the "law on administrative 
procedures," and other administrative laws and regulations, 
upheld the principle of allowing persons concerned to have equal 
status in taking lawsuits, safeguarded the legal rights and 
interests of citizens, legal entities, and other organizations, 
and supervised and supported administrative organs to exercise 
their powers in line with the law. In order to implement the 
central directives on reducing the burdens of peasants, courts 
at all levels actively accepted cases on adding burdens to 
peasants, such as unwarranted pooling of funds and arbitrary 
collection of donations of fees, involving administrative 
organs, accelerated the trials, and paid attention to the social 
effect while handling cases. Last year, courts across the 
province accepted 1,463 administrative cases for first trial and 
concluded 1,384 cases. Of the concluded administrative cases, 
the adjudication of 399 cases made by administrative organs were 
maintained, accounting for 28.83 percent, that of 279 cases were 
canceled, accounting for 20.16 percent; and the lawsuits of 489 
cases were canceled, accounting for 35.33 percent. While 
properly handling all sorts of administrative disputes, courts 
at all levels also actively helped administrative organs train 
administrative law enforcing cadres, visited administrative 
organs on their own initiative, jointly analyzed the reasons for 
winning or losing the lawsuits in line with the cases, studied 
and resolved all problems which they met in the course of 
enforcing administrative law, offered judicial suggestions, and 
enabled administrative organs to perform their work in line with 
the law. Some courts also established special collegiate 
benches to handle land and traffic cases in line with the local 
reality, and in addition to handling administrative cases, also 
went regularly to administrative organs to give all kinds of 
legal services. 
  5. We made efforts to supervise lawsuits, appeals, and 
trials; safeguarded, according to the law, the persons' relevant 
legal rights; and upgraded judicial quality. 
  To ensure the quality of the cases to be handled, upgrade 
the 
judicial quality, and ensure fair judgments, the courts at 
various levels vigorously strengthened the supervision of 
lawsuits, appeals, and trials. Last year, the courts at 
various levels accepted 84,624 visitors, handled 25,426 incoming 
letters from the masses, and concluded 3,021 cases of various 
categories under judicial supervision. The intermediate and 
higher courts concluded 10,516 cases of various categories in 
second trials. First, they firmly attended to the lawsuit work; 
made efforts to eliminate the masses' difficulties in bringing 
lawsuits; timely placed, according to laws, on file the lawsuits 
lodged by the persons concerned and that conformed to the laws 
and regulations; and delivered, according to the principle of 
"separating the placement of files from trials," the lawsuits to 
the relevant judicial organs for examination and handling. As 
for the lawsuits without legal conditions for being placed on 
file and those that were not managed by the courts, they also 
conscientiously assumed responsibility to make explanations and 
positively helped the persons concerned solve their 
difficulties. Simultaneously, they regarded the acceptance of 
visitors and the handling of incoming letters from the masses as 
a window to establish contacts with the masses and to discover 
problems and made efforts to improve their work according to the 
masses' opinions and suggestions. Second, according to the 
principle of seeking truth from facts and correcting mistakes, 
they conscientiously examined and handled the relevant persons' 
appeals and applications for retrial and the procuratorial 
organs' protests, actively examined the judgments that became 
effective, and corrected the wrong judgments according to the 
judicial supervision procedures. Last year, the courts across 
the province corrected the wrong judgments on 624 cases, 
patiently had those who lodged unreasonable lawsuits withdraw 
their lawsuits, and adopted forceful measures against those who 
willfully made troubles and affected the social stability. The 
courts at various levels focused their efforts on handling the 
appeals lodged by the aged. The provincial court regularly sent 
personnel to the Supreme People's Court to understand the 
situation of the old visitors in the province and worked in 
cooperation with the lower-level courts to study and work out 
methods for solving their problems one after another. Last 
year, the number of visitors delivering appeals to the courts 
was reduced by 27.97 percent from the previous year. Third, as 
for the appeals lodged by the persons concerned who had 
complaints about the first trials and the protests made by the 
procuratorial organs, the second-trial courts comprehensively 
and conscientiously examined the facts, evidences, and legal 
means that had been applied during the first trials; and handled 
the appeals according to laws. Of the second-trial cases 
concluded by the provincial court and various intermediate 
courts last year, 5,022 cases maintained the original judgments, 
1,786 judgments were corrected, and 1,390 cases were reexamined. 
  6. We achieved the self-construction, strengthened 
scientific 
management, and ensured the smooth progress of the trial work. 
  Over the past year, the people's courts at various levels 
made efforts to achieve their self-construction in the spirit of 
reform, ceaselessly strengthened scientific management, improved 
the law enforcement environment, ensured the strict enforcement 
of laws, and laid a foundation for smoothly accomplishing 
various trial tasks. 
  A. The people's courts conscientiously strengthened the 
ideological work and upgraded the political quality of the 
cadres and policemen. The courts at various levels organized 
cadres and policemen to conscientiously study the documents of 
the 14th party congress and the third plenary session of the 
14th party Central Committee, the guidelines of the second 
plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission, 
and the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping;" 
persistently armed the heads of the cadres and policemen with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with 
Chinese characteristics; ideologically and practically acted in 
unison with the party Central Committee; and made the trial work 
not be divorced from the political orientation. They regularly 
conducted the education on the party's line and purpose, the 
outlook on life, the outlook on value; resolutely resisted the 
influence of money worship, hedonism, and out-and-out egoism; 
conducted the education on the party's fine traditions and work 
styles, including the arduous struggle and the mass line; kept 
close contacts with the masses; firmly fostered the idea of 
serving the people wholeheartedly; conducted the education on 
the party discipline and regulations and the state laws; 
ceaselessly enhanced the senses of party spirit, discipline, and 
legal system; and resolutely safeguarded the unity and dignity 
of the party discipline, the political decree, and the laws. By 
conducting the education of multiple categories, we enabled the 
broad masses of cadres and policemen to further upgrade their 
understanding on the position and role of the people's courts in 
the course of establishing the systems of socialist market 
economy and to enhance their sense of historic mission and 
political responsibility. Their quality in political affairs 
was continuously being upgraded. Cadres and policemen in the 
people's courts throughout the province have scored a large 
number of moving deeds over the past year by overcoming 
difficulties, being cautious and conscientious, and selflessly 
making contributions. There were 510 units and 3,156 cadres and 
policemen who were appraised as advanced collectives and workers 
or were conferred with citations and prizes. The Dingzhou city 
people's court and the Fengnan county people's court were 
gloriously commended by the Supreme People's Court with the 
Merit Citation Class I. 
  B. We did a good job in grasping the professional study and 
conducting guidance over our subordinate courts and upgraded the 
professional quality of cadres and policemen. 
  The people's courts at all levels actively encouraged and 
supported cadres and policemen to study various laws and 
policies and to particularly study the newly issued laws, 
regulations, and rules, as well as the relevant policies of the 
market economy so as to enable them to meet the demand of a new 
situation and to better serve the economic construction. On the 
one hand, they unswervingly and successfully conducted the 
education on the legal courses in universities and in 
specialized institutions; and adopted various styles, such as 
holding professional training classes and conducting mobile 
lectures for cadres and policemen, on the other hand. They also 
upgraded step by step the specialized professional level of 
cadres and policemen in the people's courts on a long-term basis 
and in a planned manner. In the second half of 1993, the 
provincial higher people's court assigned its judicial officers 
in charge of economic cases, who had had experience gained from 
judicial practice and known well the legal affairs, to hold 55 
mobile lectures across the province on the practical problems 
cropping up in the trials of economic cases. Almost 2,000 
cadres attended the lectures. To further upgrade the judicial 
level and to ensure the quality of handling cases, higher 
people's courts vigorously enhanced their professional guidance 
over their subordinate courts. They adopted the method of 
"going down to low-level units and inviting the low- level 
personnel" to jointly hold discussion and consultation on 
handling serious, appalling, and knotty cases. They also further 
perfected the systems of asking for instruction and making 
reports, exchanged their work situation in a timely manner, 
summarized their work experience, and formulated the 
standardized opinions for trials in line with the judicial 
reality. Based on the deep-going investigation and study, the 
provincial higher people's court put forward the guiding 
opinions in 1993 for handling the death penalty cases; for 
setting up demarcation lines among different economic cases; and 
for handling the traffic accidents cases as well as the disputes 
over house lighting, over the compensation of medical faults, 
and over real estate. It also promoted the upgrading of quality 
and efficiency in handling cases by having standardized the 
judicial activities. 
  C. We realistically enhanced the construction of leading 
bodies and promoted the development of court work in various 
fields. Over the past year, we have grasped the construction of 
leading bodies of the people's courts at all levels by regarding 
the construction as a strategic measure. We have also urged the 
leading personnel of people's courts at all levels to set 
example in studying the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the theory of socialist market 
economy and in opposing to corruption and protecting the 
administrative honesty, to change their work style, to 
industriously conduct the administrative work for the people, 
and to be a good public servant. The leading personnel were 
urged to uphold the principle of democratic centralism and the 
staffers of leading bodies were urged to respect, support, and 
understand one another as well as to foster a joint force. 
Leading bodies were also urged to be responsible for their 
subordinate units, to set an example for them, and to bring 
along them in work. In 1993 the provincial higher people's 
court held a two-month training class of specialized legal 
knowledge for the presidents of grass-roots level courts, who 
were newly elected during the term-shift election. The class 
has laid a foundation for further and successfully conducting 
the court work at grass-roots levels. After the combination 
conducted between 12 prefectures and cities across the province 
in the second half of 1993, the provincial higher people's 
court actively helped and coordinated with local party 
committees to complete the work for combination. It made 
all-out efforts to grasp unity among new leading bodies and to 
promote work link after the combination as well as stressed that 
coordination among personnel even requires the thinking with one 
heart and one mind. After the combination, the leading bodies 
of intermediate people's courts successfully fulfilled the 
various tasks of trials by making concerted efforts and 
cooperating with one another. 
  D. We firmly and unswervingly maintained administrative 
honesty, opposed corruption, and strictly enforced laws. The 
provincial court positively consolidated and straightened itself 
out in line with the opinions and suggestions raised by people's 
congress deputies in the activities of appraising the work of 
the provincial court that was organized by the provincial 
people's congress standing committee in 1992. Courts at all 
levels conscientiously implemented the "eight forbiddens" set by 
the Supreme People's Court and the "10 regulations" formulated 
by the provincial court, constantly perfected the system 
concerning administrative honesty, strengthened the 
self-restriction mechanism and the external supervision 
mechanism, subjected the court work to the supervision by the 
numerous masses, and strived to maintain administrative honesty 
and strictly enforce laws. In line with the arrangements of the 
provincial party committee and the Supreme People's Court, the 
provincial court waged a struggle against corruption, banned 
court departments from collecting 12 items of unreasonable 
charges and from pooling funds to do business or run 
enterprises, and strictly punished the cadres and policemen who 
violated laws and disciplines. In the fourth quarter, the 
provincial court conducted a general inspection on enforcement 
of laws and disciplines and launched the activities of "lower 
levels appraising higher levels." During the activities, 
various courts at the grass-roots level appraised the work of 
intermediate courts, and grass-roots courts and intermediate 
courts appraised the work of the provincial court. At the same 
time, leaders of higher-level courts led work teams to go deep 
into various localities to inspect their work and solicit 
opinions. The provincial court received a total of 36 opinions 
and suggestions from lower-level courts, researched these 
opinions and suggestions one by one, earnestly conducted 
rectification and correction, and answered and resolved all 
questions and cases. 
  E. We paid attention to self-construction, strengthened 
scientific management, and improved law enforcing environment. 
Courts at all levels, within the scope permitted by laws and 
policies, carried out reform boldly, realistically, and 
carefully. First, we positively pressed forward the reforms in 
the fields of organizational setup, rules and systems, and work 
methods of courts, thus making organizational setup perfect, the 
relations between different sectors reasonable, tasks definite, 
and work efficiency better. The provincial court was making 
efforts to organize and build the second judicial tribunal, 
conducted the service other than legal proceedings through 
diverse channels in the course of fulfilling the judicial tasks, 
vigorously strengthened the guidance to lower levels, and 
further promoted the trying of economic cases among all courts. 
Second, we reformed and perfected the form of opening court 
sessions to try cases, standardized the procedures of opening 
court sessions to try cases, better exploited the functional 
role of collegiate bench, and stressed the evidence providing 
responsibility of the parties involved in civil and economic 
cases. At the same time, we conducted positive explorations and 
experiments for separating registration from trying of cases and 
for separating adjudication from execution. Third, we perfected 
work systems of the economic disputes mediation center, such as 
the system with regard to registration and mediation of cases 
and the system with regard to collection of fees, defined the 
nature and duties of the center, strictly executed the relevant 
regulations on civil procedures law. Fourth, we straightened 
out the tribunals and law execution agencies stationed at 
administrative organs, clarified boundaries between the judicial 
power and the administrative power, prevented judicial personnel 
from participating in administrative behaviors beyond their 
powers, and also prevented administrative personnel from holding 
judicial posts in order to ensure the independent execution of 
judicial powers by people's courts. In the course of building 
themselves well, courts at all levels strengthened scientific 
management by tapping their own potentials, and strived to seek 
better efficiency and higher level from scientific management. 
In the field of material construction, courts at all levels 
carried forward the fine tradition of arduous struggle, tried 
every possible means to overcome difficulties, and made new 
progress in building judicial courts and people's courts and in 
building traffic, communications, and equipment installations. 
In addition, courts at all levels strengthened the judgment by 
legal medical experts, investigation and study, and file 
management, thus creating conditions for improving the level of 
adjudication. 
  Hebei's courts scored fairly good achievements in 1993, 
which, however, should be attributed to the leadership of party 
committees, the supervision of people's congresses, the support 
of pertinent government departments, and the concerted efforts 
of their cadres and policemen. There were also problems and 
deficiencies in our work. The major ones were the failure in 
fully suiting our thinking and concepts to the new situation in 
the socialist market economy system and the failure in fully 
performing our functions to serve reform, opening up, and 
economic construction; some localities' failure in strictly 
enforcing laws, making fair judgments, and handling cases in a 
timely manner; and the problems in law-enforcement conditions 
that need to be further improved and the funds for handling 
cases that need to be guaranteed with intensified measures so 
that a good environment can be created for law enforcement. 
  Fellow deputies, 1994 is a crucial year for promoting the 
package reform of the economic structure and making 
breakthroughs in key areas. Seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability constitute the overall 
interests of the work of the entire party. The new situation has 
set new and still higher demands on the work of people's courts, 
which, in summary, are to create momentum in "dealing strict 
blows," to achieve good results in handling major and serious 
cases, to make substantial progress in regulating economic 
relations, and to comprehensively raise the judicial level. In 
compliance with the requirements of the party Central Committee, 
the provincial party committee, and the Supreme People's Court, 
the basic tasks for the people's courts in 1994 are, guided by 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the third plenary 
session of the 14th party Central Committee, to continue dealing 
strict blows to serious criminal offenses, to do a better job in 
trying major and serious cases, especially major and serious 
economic cases, to greatly regulating economic relations, to 
conscientiously safeguard the legal rights and interests of 
citizens, legal persons, and other organizations, to strictly 
enforce laws, to raise judicial level, and to serve the 
endeavors of safeguarding social stability, promoting 
administrative honesty, and establishing the socialist market 
economy system more rapidly. To fulfill these tasks, we should 
achieve success particularly in the following work: 
  First, we should strictly crack down on the criminal 
offenses 
that endanger state safety and social security to safeguard 
state and social stability. Courts at all levels should 
profoundly understand the strategic idea of "attending to two 
tasks simultaneously and being competent in both," further 
strengthen the function of dictatorship over enemies, and 
resolutely punish the criminals who seriously endanger state 
security. We should adhere to the principle of meting out stern 
and prompt punishments to continue the struggle of "dealing 
strict blows," clarify the focuses of attack, and wage special 
struggles at opportune times and concentrate efforts on the 
crackdown of certain crimes to create momentum and achieve 
notable social effect. Meanwhile, we should actively 
participate in the comprehensive management of public security. 
  Second, we should continue cracking down on serious economic 
offenses to promote honesty in administration. Focusing on 
punishing corruption and bribery, we should sternly punish 
criminals with serious economic offenses to promote the in-depth 
development of the anticorruption struggle. We should muster 
efforts and organize meticulously to achieve a breakthrough in 
trying major and serious cases. 
  Third, we should regulate the relations in various economic 
sectors in line with law and promote the establishment of the 
socialist market economic structure. We should fully apply the 
judicial means, serve the cultivation and development of the 
market economic structure, promote the establishment of the 
modern enterprise system, protect the decisionmaking rights of 
enterprises in line with the law, safeguard the responsibility 
system with the family-based output-related contract 
responsibility system as the mainstay, and promote comprehensive 
economic invigoration in the rural areas. We should pay great 
attention to investigating and handling new cases involving 
foreign countries, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan emerging in the 
course of deepening reform of the economic structure and strive 
to make new breakthroughs in economic trails. 
  Fourth, we should give full play to the functions of courts 
in civil and administrative trails and realistically safeguard 
the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal entities, and 
other organizations. It is necessary to properly handle the 
internal contradictions among the people, promote stability, 
unity, and the building of socialist spiritual civilization. 
  Fifth, we should strictly enforce the law and raise the 
level 
of judicial work. We should uphold the principle of 
independently exercising judicial rights, based on facts, and 
taking law as the criterion under the leadership of the party 
committee, strengthen judicial supervision, strictly enforce 
judicial discipline, and conscientiously implement the 
responsibility system in handling cases and reinvestigating 
wrong cases. It is necessary to actively accept supervision 
from the people's congresses at all levels, unceasingly improve 
law enforcing activities, and raise the level of judicial work. 
  Sixth, we should unceasingly sum up experience and deepen 
reform in courts. With the spirit of emancipating the mind, 
seeking truth from facts, making experiments actively, and 
advancing steadily, we should follow the legal principles, 
principles that are conducive to unifying the legal system, the 
principle of making things convenient for the masses to make 
lawsuits and to bring the cases to courts for trial, and the 
principle of safeguarding the legal rights and interests of the 
people concerned, and continue to grasp reform in line with the 
characteristics of courts. We should actively strengthen 
grassroots courts, particularly the work and building of 
people's courts, give full play to their role of being close to 
the masses and making things convenient for them to make 
lawsuits, discover and settle disputes in a timely manner, 
safeguarded social stability, and accelerate the pace of serving 
economic development. 
  Seventh, we should strengthen the contingents and raise the 
political and professional level of cadres and policemen. 
Further efforts should be made to strengthen the study of 
political theories, deepen the anticorruption struggle, and 
resolutely check unhealthy trends among courts. We should do a 
good job in improving the ideology and work style of court 
leading bodies at all levels, and enable them to become a strong 
core of leadership with high political awareness, good work, and 
good work style. With a strategic insight, we should continue 
to grasp the education and training of cadres, enhance the 
integrated professional quality of court cadres and policemen 
across the province and pay attention to cultivating a number of 
judicial officers specializing in the work of this field so as 
to meet the needs of the development of situation. 
  Deputies, in the new situation of establishing the socialist 
market economic structure, people's courts have to undertake 
more arduous tasks and heavier responsibilities. We must 
further emancipate the mind under the leadership of the party 
committees and the supervision of the people's congresses, renew 
concepts, unite as one, work hard, give better play to the 
functional role of judicial organs, and make greater 
contributions to maintaining social stability in our province, 
guaranteeing reform, expanding opening up, promoting 
development, and building an economically strong province.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Northern China's 
important port city of Tianjin is expanding its economic 
cooperation through joint development efforts far and near. 
  Located on the Bohai Sea, Tianjin is effectively cooperating 
with Beijing city, Shanxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Shandong 
Provinces as well as with Yunnan, Guangxi and Xinjiang in the 
remote areas. 
  Statistics show that a total of 11,420 cooperative projects 
were signed last year, attracting capital of 967 million yuan 
from other areas. 
  Officials said that regional cooperation, which began in 
recent years, has effectively helped local economic growth. 
  Various organizations to promote regional cooperation were 
established and expanded. The association of mayors of cities 
around the Bohai Sea, for instance, now has 17 member cities. 
The Tianjin Municipal Government has set up representative 
offices in a number of other provinces. 
  At present, the city is cooperating with the coal-rich 
Shanxi 
Province in the development of coal, transportation and raw 
materials industries. 
  The cooperation projects with Qinghuangdao city in Hebei 
Province not far from Tianjin have come to some 50, involving a 
total investment of 38.70 million yuan. Local products 
including cloth shoes, carpets and tableware are exported via 
Tianjin port. 
  The city has also opened many specialized markets for such 
products as petrochemical materials, textile raw materials and 
automobile industrial products. 
  In addition, a major market network is taking shape, 
covering 
capital, technology, labor and information services. 
  By the end of 1993, the number of capital goods markets 
totalled 28, attracting many large industrial and commercial 
ventures all over China. The transaction volume topped 20 
billion yuan last year, according to figures from the Tianjin 
Municipal Government. 
  A few large trans-regional joint ventures were also 
established. Some Tianjin factories with quite advanced 
technical levels, especially in such fields as chemicals, 
electronics, machinery, textiles and automobiles, have begun 
offering machinery for processing strawberries, wild apples and 
other local produce to North-west China. 
  The Tianjin Welding Electrode Company, for instance, has set 
up 25 joint ventures in eight provinces and autonomous regions. 
In Xinjiang alone the joint ventures achieved a net profit of 7 
million yuan last year. 
  Officials said that Tianjin has now established many raw 
materials bases in other parts of China. 
  Tianjin also offered technical and other forms of help to 
many poor areas. It has arranged 33 projects of technology 
transfer, personnel training and commodity exchange with 
localities around the Three Gorges areas in Central China. 
  In addition, it has signed more than 600 technical and 
economic cooperation projects with North-west China's Gansu 
Province, benefiting both parties.

Backs Out; Xi's Father Hopes Hong Kong's National People's 
Congress Deputies and Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference National Committee Members Will Attend the Trial as 
Observers"] 
  [Text] MING PAO reporter Xi Yang's family has encountered 
setbacks in finding a lawyer to appeal Xi's case. A lawyer, who 
originally had promised to defend Xi Yang, suddenly changed his 
mind and said he was not competent for the job. Nevertheless, 
MING PAO has stressed that it will continue its efforts in the 
coming days to help Xi's family to find a suitable lawyer to 
appeal the case. 
  On the day before yesterday, Xi's family met with a 
responsible official from the China Solicitors' Office and 
reached a verbal agreement: A lawyer from the solicitors' 
office will appeal Xi's case. 
  Xi's family presented the name of the lawyer, who had 
indicated he was willing to defend Xi Yang, to the court the day 
before yesterday, and the process of Xi's appeal was set in 
motion. When MING PAO chief editor Chang Hsi-hung accompanied 
Xi's family to sign the official agreement at the solicitors' 
office, the lawyer suddenly said that he was not competent for 
the job, without giving any specific reason. It has been 
reported that a responsible official from the solicitors' office 
did not want the lawyer to take on the job of defending Xi Yang. 
  When Xi's family presented the name of the lawyer to the 
court on Monday [4 April], a court official revealed that Xi 
Yang had said two things regarding the search for a lawyer: 
First, his family should try to get a lawyer for him; and, 
second, if his family is unsuccessful, the court may do so on 
his behalf. The court official also said that, if the lawyer 
invited by the family cannot attend the court for personal or 
other reasons, he will naturally lose the opportunity to defend 
Xi Yang. The court will then have to assign a lawyer to defend 
Xi Yang. Xi's family nonetheless still wanted to try to find a 
lawyer for Xi Yang. 
  Despite the setbacks encountered in their search for a 
lawyer, Xi's family said that they will do their utmost to find 
a qualified lawyer in the next day or two to defend Xi Yang. 
  Xi Yang's father, who is currently hospitalized, appealed to 
the authorities to allow him to meet his son Xi Yang in the 
course of the appeal and let him attend the second trial as an 
observer. Xi Yang's father also expressed his hope that Hong 
Kong's National People's Congress [NPC] deputies or Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] members could 
attend the trial as observers.

  [Text] Taipei, April 5 (CNA) -- Calls continue to mount 
here for the government to take tough action against Beijing 
over what many are claiming is the mainland's inappropriate 
handling of the March 31 boat incident in which 24 Taiwan 
tourists died. 
  The tourists, along with six mainland crew members and two 
guides, died in a fire on board a tourist vessel during a cruise 
on Qiandao Hu, or Thousand Island Lake, in the central province 
of Zhejiang. News of the mishap was suppressed for two days. 
  The ire of the relatives of the victims was further raised 
when they learned that autopsies had been carried out on the 
bodies on Monday [4 April] without their permission. 
  The relatives' demands to examine the boat and to move the 
corpses to Hangzhou, from where they could be flown back to 
Taiwan, were also rejected by mainland authorities. Instead the 
relatives were restricted to a hotel by the authorities. 
  Chinese New Party legislator Jaw Shau-kong, in a written 
inquiry to the Executive Yuan, said the government should not be 
hesitant to suspend the ongoing private exchanges across the 
Taiwan Strait should Beijing fail to resolve problems arising 
from the incident. 
  "The denial of the relatives demands is consistent with the 
Chinese Communists' ignorance of human rights," Jaw said. "The 
government should not sit idle, but should help the relatives." 
  Chin Han-sheng, director of the Kuomintang Cultural Affairs 
Department, also lambasted the mainland officials. "Beijing has 
every responsibility to clarify the myths surrounding the 
deaths, but all it has done over the past few days has been 
muddleheaded and careless. 
  Meanwhile, the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] held an 
emergency meeting Tuesday to draw up countermeasures. After the 
meeting, MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian issued a statement 
saying, "the mainland authorities should carefully handle the 
matter so as not to hurt the feelings of Taiwan residents and 
the ties between the two sides. 
  He also said Taiwan reporters should be allowed to report on 
the incident, and that officials of the Straits Exchange 
Foundation (SEF) should be permitted to go to the mainland to 
provide the relatives with humanitarian assistance. 
  The semi-official SEF was organized to handle private 
exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland in the absence of 
official contacts.

  [Text] Nanjing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Farmers' cash income in 
East China's Jiangsu Province increased by 206.2 yuan on average 
last year, a record provincial high for the 1990s. 
  In 1993, farmers in Jiangsu, one of China's richest 
provinces, registered a per capita net income of 1,266.9 yuan, 
an increase of 19.4 percent over the previous year. After 
deduction of price rises, average income grew by three percent. 
  Last year was the first year for the market economy to be 
introduced into every economic sector of the province. 
  Township enterprises contributed the bulk of the increased 
income. 
  Last year, township enterprises in the province reported an 
industrial output value of more than 40 million yuan, an 
increase of 5.4 percent over that of the previous year and 
accounting for about 75.5 percent of that of the province's 
entire rural economy. 
  In 1993, one out of every five local farmers worked in 
township enterprises or worked as transient laborers in 
wealthier provinces. 
  Statistics show that more than half of local farmers' added 
income came from township enterprises. 
  Brisk markets are creating more sources for cash income for 
farmers. 
  In the past, Chinese farmers relied almost entirely on 
farming for cash income, and their income was mainly in the form 
of crops and grain. 
  In 1993, cash income accounted for 70.3 percent of a Jiangsu 
farmer's total income, a slight increase over that of the 
previous year, while his cash income from selling grain 
decreased. 
  The facts indicate that farmers are profiting more from 
industry, commercial ventures and the service sector. 
  In addition, some farmers have started investing in treasury 
bonds and stocks.

comprehensive development of a few large economic zones covering 
a total of 219 sq km in the southwestern part of the city. 
  Inside the urban districts, Guangzhou will accept foreign 
funds in the construction of industrial and urban infrastructure 
such as its subways and a new international airport. 
  With regard to industry, foreign investment will be 
encouraged for the high-tech and export-oriented sectors, 
service trades involving information and consultancy, finance 
and business and tourism, and the upgrading of old enterprises.

  [Text] United Nations, April 5 (XINHUA) -- It is an urgent 
task for the United Nations to establish a set of guiding 
principles to ensure a solid political and legal foundation for 
peace-keeping operations, said a Chinese delegate here today. 
  Addressing the U.N. General Assembly's Special Committee on 
Peace-Keeping Operations, Zhang Yan said it is highly important 
and timely for the committee to re-examine the issue in all 
aspects so as to sum up experience and seek improvements. 
  Zhang said the Chinese delegation believes that the 
following 
four issues should be focused on. 
  -- Strict observance of the purposes and principles of the 
U.N. Charter. Involvement in whatever forms should help 
maintain the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the 
country concerned, conform the common desire of the people in 
the country and obtain the prior agreement of the parties 
concerned. 
  -- Adherence to the principle of settling disputes by 
peaceful means and refraining from using force. The attempt to 
stop war by expanding it is undesirable. 
  -- The key to improving the effectiveness of peace-keeping 
operations lies in the full preparedness and acting within 
capacity. The Security Council must act prudently in its 
decision-making and set forth specific and feasible mandates and 
appropriate timetable. 
  -- Assurance of the U.N.'s leading role in command and 
control in peace-keeping operations. A collective U.N. action 
based on the will of its member states must be under the 
exclusive operational command of the U.N. 
  U.N. peace-keeping operations have witnessed unprecedented 
development and reached an all-time high in terms of number, 
scale and scope of their mandates, Zhang added. 
  Despite their achievements, U.N. peace-keeping operations 
are 
encountering many new problems as they develop so rapidly. 
  The U.N. has 71,816 military and civil police peacekeepers 
deployed in the world's hot spots for 17 operations, including 
30,500 in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.

  [Text] Moscow, April 4 (XINHUA) -- The Russian Defense and 
Foreign Ministries have agreed to build partnership ties with 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), according to 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  Speaking today after talks with U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali in Moscow, Grachev added that President Boris 
Yeltsin also supported the proposal. 
  On Thursday a spokesman for President Yeltsin indicated that 
although Russia might take six or seven months to make a final 
decision on joining the NATO partnership he (the president) 
believed that Russia should join it but with certain conditions. 
  However, Grachev said: "We hope that this month Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev will sign a framework agreement in 
Brussels on Russia's membership of the Partnership for Peace 
Program." 
  Membership of the NATO peace partnership plan was suggested 
to Russia by U.S. President Bill Clinton in January and has 
resulted in heated debate in Russian corridors of power. 
  The defense minister said that on the whole he did not see 
any differences between the governmental and presidential 
departments on this issue. 
  So far fourteen East European countries have signed the 
partnership plan, which involves a program of joint exercises 
and military cooperation with NATO members. 
  Meanwhile, Grachev, who is also the commander of the Russian 
Army, said he would make a trip to the former Yugoslavia 
together with the French and Belgian defense ministers to 
inspect the peacekeeping forces deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and Croatia.

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (AFP)--China denied Tuesday [5 
April] it was sending a high-level delegation to North Korea to 
mark the 82nd birthday of Kim Il-Sung on April 15. 
  "We have never heard something like China sending a 
high-level delegation to North Korea to attend President Kim's 
birthday celebrations," said a foreign ministry spokesman 
contacted by telephone. 
  He was denying a report by South Korea's YONHAP news agency 
which said that members of the delegation would have talks with 
Kim about the nuclear standoff following Pyongyang's refusal to 
allow full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections 
of its nuclear sites. 
  On Monday North Korea officially rejected an appeal by the 
United Nations Security Council to open its sites to IAEA 
inspectors. 
  China is the North's closest ally and so far has refused to 
put any pressure on Pyongyang over the nuclear affair or to 
support moves to impose international sanctions.

  [Text] Paris, April 5 (XINHUA) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur said here today that his upcoming visit to 
China is aimed at promoting the traditional bilateral relations 
to a new level in keeping with the aspirations of the two 
peoples. 
  In an interview with XINHUA reporters on the eve of his trip 
to China, Balladur said that although the French-Chinese 
relations encountered some difficulties in the past few years, 
30 years of fruitful exchanges have laid a sound foundation for 
such relations. 
  He said the two countries should now try their best to boost 
the positive atmosphere that has reappeared between them. 
  He said he will discuss with Chinese leaders major 
international issues, especially the situation in Asia and 
Europe. 
  He stressed that the two countries should build a more 
trusting relationship on a new basis. 
  It is important for France and China, both of them permanent 
members of the UN Security council, to exchange views on major 
international issues and to closely cooperate in international 
affairs such as the settlement of regional crisis, the prime 
minister added. 
  He believed that the development of bilateral relations also 
conforms to the fundamental interests of the two countries. 
  Balladur hoped that his visit, though a political one, could 
help strengthen economic ties. 
  He also said that France supports in principle China's 
efforts to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade 
(GATT).

  [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of 
China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, met 
with Dr. Kurt Waldheim, former U.N. secretary general and 
president of the U.N. Association of Austria, here this 
afternoon. 
  Waldheim, also former federal president of Austria, and his 
delegation arrived here on Monday [4 April] for a 10-day visit 
to China at the invitation of the U.N. Association of China. 
  During the meeting Qiao and Waldheim exchanged views on a 
wide range of issues including the development of Sino-Austrian 
relations and international issues of common interest. 
  On China-Austria ties, both expressed the hope for 
furthering 
bilateral cooperation in every field, especially in 
infrastructure development. 
  They agreed that there exist great possibilities and broad 
prospects for expanding such cooperation. 
  Qiao reaffirmed China's consistent adherence to the 
principles of equality in handling state-to-state relations and 
its stand for the settlement of international disputes through 
peaceful means. 
  If these principles are departed from, he said, 
contradictions will be accelerated and problems can not be 
settled. This will contribute nothing to world peace. 
  Waldheim said he agreed with Qiao's view. 
  During the meeting the two also exchanged views on the 
position and roles of the U.N. and the regional situation as 
well. 
  This evening Huang Hua, as the first leader of the Chinese 
delegation to the U.N., hosted a dinner in honor of Mr. Waldheim

  [Text] On the morning of 2 April, Sun Weiben, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, and some other leading comrades 
inspected the work sites of nine roads and nine bridges under 
construction in Harbin city. They fully affirmed the 
achievements scored by Harbin city in urban construction. 
  On the morning of 2 April, accompanied by Tian Fengshan and 
Suo Changyou, principal leaders of Harbin city, some leading 
comrades of the provincial party committee, including Sun 
Weiben, Ma Guoliang, Shan Rongfan, and Wang Xianmin, inspected 
by car (Nanji) Street, (Dafangli) Street, (Didao) Bridge, 
(Dacheng) Bridge, (Hongshi) Grand Street, and (Chunyang) 
Overpass. When dwelling on the tremendous changes taken place 
in Harbin city over the past few years, Sun Weiben, from the 
position of being a former resident of Harbin, said: Harbin is 
really getting more and more beautiful, and this makes Harbin 
people feel a sense of pride. The eight roads and five bridges 
built last year and the nine roads and nine bridges whose 
construction just begun are greatly significant in rapidly 
enhancing Harbin's function as a carrier, in promoting the 
common prosperity of both urban and rural areas, in improving 
the tense communications situation, in meeting the demands of 
the Asian Winter Games, and in building Harbin into an important 
international commercial and trade city of Northeast Asia. At 
the same time, the construction of these projects has provided 
enlightenment to the construction of other cities. In building 
these nine roads and nine bridges, Harbin has followed the 
guiding principles of acting according to its capability, doing 
its best, considering long-term interest, and persisting in 
standards. To gradually form a modernized communications 
pattern of embracing two axes, four rings, and ten lines, this 
year Harbin city will complete the building of nine roads and 
nine bridges with a total length of 45 km. The nine bridges 
will cover a total length of 1.5 km. These nine bridges will be 
completed and open to traffic by the end of October this year. 
  During the inspection, Secretary Sun Weiben also suggested: 
In urban construction, Harbin city should combine rebuilding 
with the development of production. In building small 
districts, the city should pay attention to the building of 
subsidiary facilities, kindergartens and primary schools in 
particular. Secretary Sun Weiben specially mentioned about the 
control of Majiagou He. He pointed out: The situation of 
Majiagou He discords with the modernization of the city. 
Therefore, Harbin city should try its best to rebuild it. 
  Ma Guoliang and Shan Rongfan, leaders of the provincial 
party 
committee, also fully affirmed the urban construction of Harbin 
city and offered opinions.

<F P=106> [Report by Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party </F>
committee, at the second enlarged plenary session of the seventh 
provincial party committee on 16 December: "Profoundly Implement 
the Guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and Rapidly Set Up the Socialist Market 
Economic System"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of this year, party 
organizations at all levels in the province have guided the vast 
numbers of cadres and masses to implement conscientiously the 
guidelines of the important speeches made by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping during his south China trip and the guidelines of the 
14th CPC Congress, to execute firmly the party's basic line, and 
to promote positively reform and opening up as well as the work 
in various fields around the central task of economic 
construction, thus overcoming all sorts of difficulties and 
gaining the good situation characterized by in-depth reform, 
economic progress, and social stability. The summary of the 
1993 work and the priorities of the 1994 work of the provincial 
party committee, which will be submitted to the current session 
for examination and discussion, and the provincial economic work 
conference, which is scheduled to open on 23 December, will set 
forth specific arrangements for the various tasks on the 
provincial economic and social development in 1994 on the basis 
of summarizing the work of 1993. The current plenary session of 
the provincial party committee is primarily devoted to studying 
the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, discussing and defining the province's 
specific opinions on implementing the "decision" of the third 
plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and 
mobilizing all party committees and Communist party members to 
lose no time to accelerate the pace of reform and opening up and 
the pace of setting up the socialist market economic system. 
Hereafter, I want to dwell on three issues in line with the 
discussed opinions of the standing committee of the provincial 
party committee. 
<H5>  1. Profoundly Implement the Guidelines of the Central </H5>
"Decision," and Enhance the Sense of Responsibility and the 
Sense of Urgency in Deepening Reform and Accelerating Development 
  Since the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, based on the profound summarization of the great 
practice of reform and opening up, guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and in line with the objectives and principles 
for the economic structural reform put forward by the 14th CPC 
Congress, the CPC Central Committee has adopted the "decision on 
several issues concerning the socialist market economic system" 
and has set up the outlines for the action of accelerating 
reform and opening up during the 1990's for the whole party and 
the people throughout the country. If we say that 15 years ago 
the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee 
realized the shift of the work emphasis of the whole party and 
helped push our country to the historical period of reform and 
opening up, then, today's third plenary session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee has sketched the blueprint and defined the 
basic framework for China's socialist market economic system and 
has pushed China's reform to a completely new stage of 
proceeding in an all-around manner and making breakthroughs in 
key aspects. 
  Successful implementation of the "decision" will certainly 
consolidate and perfect the socialist system further and make 
socialism with Chinese characteristics even more vigorous and 
superior. 
  In implementing the "decision," we must proceed from the 
reality of our province and enhance the sense of urgency in 
establishing the socialist market economic system. Through more 
than 10 years of reform and opening up, the pattern of common 
development of all sectors of the economy, with the state-owned 
sector predominant, has been formed; breakthroughs have been 
made in changing the operational mechanism of large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises and in the property rights 
reform of small enterprises; market cultivation and construction 
have been accelerated; the commodity prices have been gradually 
decided by markets; the rural management system has been 
perfected and the collectivized service system and the 
trade-industry-agriculture organizations have developed greatly; 
and even more border areas have been opened to the outside world 
and the pattern of opening to all directions has been formed 
gradually. This has not only laid a good foundation for 
accelerating the transition from the planned economic system to 
the socialist market economic system, but has also promoted the 
development of the national economy. This year, the province's 
gross national product has increased steadily, grain output has 
reached a record high, structure has improved, total supply and 
demand have gone up, and efficiency has improved. In addition, 
township and town enterprises have developed in a sustained and 
rapid manner, and their output value has surpassed agricultural 
output value for the first time. The total amount of import and 
export has increased and the amount of foreign funds utilized 
and the number of foreign-funded enterprises of three types has 
doubled and redoubled. Markets have been brisk, purchases and 
marketing have been thriving, and the current situation 
continues to develop in a good direction. 
  In the process of development, however, we have also 
encountered some conspicuous difficulties and problems. Major 
ones are a long period of shortage of investment, with the 
investment in fixed assets lower than the national average for 
10 successive years; outdated equipment and technology; heavy 
burden accumulated in history; and the lack of vitality in 
market competition of state-owned large-and medium-sized 
enterprises, which support the province's economy; and the lack 
of major projects to promote the economy and the relatively 
sluggish economic development rate. These problems have 
resulted both from the shackles of the traditional systems and 
from the lack of sufficient dynamics in doing work. As far as 
the systems are concerned, the central revenue and the local 
revenue were separated in 1980, and 74.5 percent of the profits 
and taxes turned in by the country's industrial enterprises 
owned by the people have been allocated to local authorities. 
In our province, however, merely 23.5 percent of the profits 
and taxes are put under the local authorities, 51 percent lower 
than the national average. Heilongjiang's per capita national 
income is 28.5 percent higher than the national average, but its 
per capita revenue is 24.2 percent lower than the national 
average, thus making the province's finances a typical example 
of "finance to feed the people." The proportions of the 
allocations for fixed assets and circulating funds have declined 
by a large margin, and that of the allocations for 
administrative funds and various subsidies have notably 
increased. Due to the limit imposed by the traditional 
investment system on the use of investment, state investment has 
been focused on coal, timber, oil, and other basic and heavy 
industries, while that of the province has been focused on light 
industry and infrastructural facilities, making the ratio of 
investment in heavy industry to that in light industry 9 to 1 
for a long time. Due to the abnormal ratio of investment, 90 
percent of our investment has been used mostly in maintaining 
reproduction or in resource producing industries during the 
recession period. This has made us merely capable of 
maintaining a zero growth rate and preventing a minus growth 
rate and made it difficult for us to establish a fairly large 
production capacity. Using the remaining 10 percent of the 
investment to support the light industry, which accounts for 
32.7 percent of our total industry, we are merely capable of 
maintaining simple reproduction, making it more difficult to 
restructure the industry. The serious barriers between the 
industrial enterprises of different regions and different 
departments and the separate development of the enterprises 
directly under the central authorities and local enterprises 
have made it difficult to work out overall plans for and achieve 
overall balance in the operation of the industry. The limit 
imposed on the dissemination of the products and technology, as 
well as the promoting role of key enterprises have led to a 
broken industrial chain and the obstacles to the development of 
local industry. Due to the price distortion resulting from the 
traditional price system 
and the double-track price system, which has existed for a long 
period, adjustment of the prices of such primary products as 
coal, timber, grain, and oil have been sluggish or stagnant. 
This has not only caused a large loss of efficiency every year, 
but also made the mining and raw material industries, which 
account for more than one-third of our total industry, dwindle 
every year and made it difficult to develop the follow-up 
industries and substituting industries. As far as our work is 
concerned, although we have come to understand that structural 
contradictions are the deep-seated reasons for the sluggish 
economic development, we still lack significant measures for the 
transformation of enterprise property rights, the development of 
the nonstate sectors of the economy, and the in-depth reform of 
local monetary, investment, and planning systems because of a 
lack of conditions for macro reform and a lack of courage. 
Also, although we have come to understand that the bottleneck 
restrictions imposed by fund shortages and the structural 
restrictions imposed by underdeveloped processing industry have 
seriously affected economic development, we have failed to 
achieve notable results in solving problems because of a lack of 
unremitting efforts, a pioneering spirit, and a down-to-earth 
work style. We might not be the only one to blame for the zero 
or minus increase rate in coal, timber, oil, and other mining 
industries, but it is our work that has caused the lack of vigor 
in local industries and the sluggish economic development. 
There might be numerous reasons for the slow technical 
transformation and equipment renewal of state-owned large-and 
medium-sized enterprises, but it is our lack of project 
development and lack of efforts to win projects from higher 
authorities that have caused the shortage of important 
projects to promote our economy for 10 successive years. The 
above-mentioned conditions and problems show that the 
fundamental way to resolve the system and structural 
contradictions restricting economic development; to accelerate 
economic development and promote the province's economy to a new 
height lies in speeding up the transition to the socialist 
market economy and in pooling the efforts of the people 
throughout the province to promote development through reform. 
The central authorities have decided to establish the socialist 
market economy system. This has provided unprecedented 
conditions and a historical moment for us to resolve the 
structural contradictions and difficulties in economic 
development. As the major trend of the new round of reform is 
coming near in the country, those who have made full 
preparations will win the conditions for accelerating 
development; and those who have seized the opportunity will gain 
the initiative. As long as we firmly implement the "decision" 
of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee, uplift our spirit, emancipate our minds, seize the 
opportunity to advance, and deepen reform in an active and 
prudent manner, we will be able to create a new situation in 
reform and development. 
  To study and implement the central "decision," we must 
comprehensively and deeply understand the guidelines of the 
"decision" and grasp the grand objectives, basic frame, and main 
links of the socialist market economic system. According to the 
progress of reform and opening up and the provincial reality, we 
should pay particular attention to understanding five important 
viewpoints: 1) Really understand the viewpoint of linking the 
socialist market economic system with the basic socialist 
system, further change the confused ideas of setting the market 
economy against the socialist system, and define that the key to 
speeding up economic development is to bring into full play the 
market's fundamental role in distribution of resources and that 
setting up the socialist market economic system is consolidating 
and developing socialism. Only when we actually stand from the 
high plane of the times and the party spirit, further emancipate 
the mind, and expand the extent of reform will we be able to 
promote the transformation of the economic system. 2) Really 
understand the viewpoint that public ownership should play a 
dominant role in the national economy on the premise that some 
localities and industries are allowed to have the difference in 
this aspect, change the mechanical thinking of using the 
proportion of quantities to define the position of the public 
ownership, and define that there are various ways to realize 
public ownership and that the market economy is one in which 
various sectors of the economy vie with one another for equal 
development. Therefore, we should further firmly proceed from 
the provincial actual conditions and proceed from the principle 
of giving full scope to the strong points and making up for the 
shortcomings to optimize the ownership structure and to 
encourage the full development of the nonstate economic sectors. 
3) Really understand that setting up the modern enterprise 
system is the foundation for the socialist market economic 
system; change the old habits that the property rights are not 
clear, the responsibility for profits and losses is not clearly 
defined, scientific management is ignored, and government 
functions are not separated from enterprise management; and 
define that enterprises have the decisionmaking rights to manage 
the property of legal persons. Only when we set up the modern 
enterprise system characterized by well-defined property rights 
and duties, separation of government functions from enterprise 
management, and scientific management will we be able to 
actually liberate and develop the state-owned large and 
medium-sized enterprises. Only by so doing will we be able to 
boldly promote the reform of the enterprise property right 
system and comprehensively enliven state-owned enterprises. 4) 
To actually understand the socialist market economy, we should 
perfect the viewpoint of the macroeconomic regulation and 
control system, change the lopsided understanding that the 
market economy is a free economy to expel the macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and define that strengthening the 
central macroeconomic regulation and control rights is conducive 
to maintaining the basic balance of the overall economy, 
ceaselessly optimizing the economic structure, and promoting a 
coordinate economic and social development. Therefore, we 
should further consciously implement the central decision on 
strengthening the macroeconomic regulation and control. 
Simultaneously, we should proceed from the actual conditions 
and strive to set up a macroeconomic regulation and control 
system in coordination with the central macroeconomic regulation 
and control system and suitable for the objective requirements 
for local economic development. 5)Really understand the 
viewpoint that the principle of distribution according to work 
must be dominated by efficiency and be carried out by giving 
consideration to equality and change the tendencies of unfair 
distribution and distribution according to the principle of 
equality. Therefore, we should further positively implement the 
policy on encouraging some localities and individuals to be rich 
before others through honest labor and legal management. 
  Simultaneously, the individuals are allowed to have their 
production factors participate in the distribution of benefits. 
Simultaneously, we should further appropriately regulate and 
handle the relations of distribution between different stratums 
and between the groups of different benefits and gradually seek 
common wealth. In short, only when we study the central 
"decision" closely in line with the local practice of reform and 
development and the work reality of departments and clearly 
understand the decision's basic viewpoints and basic 
requirements of great practical significance, will we be able to 
strengthen the awareness and firmness of implementing the 
central "decision." 
  The next several years is a period of critical importance 
and is a stage to tackle difficult problems. Fulfilling the 
tasks of this stage is of extreme significance. In line with 
the reform priorities defined by the "decision" of the CPC 
Central Committee, we have to make plans for all fields, make 
breakthroughs for major aspects, promote work in an all-around 
manner, make full preparations, be careful in doing the linking 
work, and, in particular, resolutely put in place the reform 
measures that will be set forth next year. This requires us to 
persist in the fundamental criterion of facilitating the 
development of vocalist productive forces, facilitating the 
strengthening of the comprehensive strength of the state, and 
facilitating the improvement of the people's living standards 
and require us to emancipate the mind in the course of seeking 
truth from facts. In establishing a socialist market economic 
system, there are no precedents in the history of socialist 
development. Because reform foundations and implementation 
conditions vary from place to place, we must proceed from 
realities in implementing the "decision" of the CPC Central 
Committee. We should further emancipate the mind, continue to 
carry forward the spirit advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping of 
daring to think, try, and go ahead, and should boldly support 
the grass-roots areas and the masses in blazing new trials. We 
should boldly absorb all the useful reform experiences gained by 
coastal areas and by other provinces and regions in the country, 
especially the successful experience in invigorating large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises. We should boldly absorb 
and use as reference all the management and operation forms of 
developed countries that facilitate the development of 
productive forces. We should exploit our initiative and 
creativity to constantly create work advantages and new 
conditions for accelerating development. We should persist in 
the principle of promoting development by carrying out reform 
and concentrate our energy on beefing up economic construction. 
The fundamental purpose of reform is to accelerate economic and 
social development and to constantly improve the people's level 
of material and cultural livelihood. Development is the 
foundation for solving all social problems and for deciding if 
the people are for or against reform. We must pay attention to 
the organic combination of reform and development and regard the 
difficult points we have met in development as the focal points 
on which we concentrate to make breakthroughs. In adopting 
major reform measures, we should fully consider if the mainstay 
of the national economy -- production and management -- can 
adapt themselves to the measures. The implementation of 
economic development strategy should facilitate in-depth reform. 
While meticulously organizing the reform, we should uphold the 
central task of economic construction and make all the work 
manifest the principle that only development is the essential 
criterion. We should give prominence to developing precision 
and deep processing and developing new and high-technology 
industries to enhance the level of industries and extend the 
chains of production. We should also give prominence to 
developing high-output, fine-quality, and high-efficient 
agriculture, as well as township and town enterprises to improve 
the economic efficiency of 
the countryside. We should pay equal attention to key projects 
and technological transformation projects to improve the general 
quality of the national economy. We should strive to ensure the 
investment that facilitates the upgrading of industries, expand 
the scale of production that has a large market, and develop as 
quickly as possible efficient production. We should persist in 
the principle of submitting to the overall situation and 
conscientiously organize the various reforms that help 
strengthen the macroeconomic regulation and control of the 
state. Only when the market economic system takes shape 
throughout the country, can economic structural reform succeed 
in localities. Only when a strong and effective macroeconomic 
regulation and control system takes shape throughout the 
country, can we thoroughly solve the problems of barriers 
existing between different departments or regions, market 
blockade, and uneven development in different regions. Only 
when the central authorities strengthen financial capacity and 
the regulation and control capacity can they make industrial 
policies truly favor old industrial bases and major grain 
production areas. Although the reform of financial, tax, 
banking, investment, and planning systems, which will be carried 
out next year, will bring about some new circumstances, we 
should also submit ourselves to and support the overall 
situation and conscientiously do the work arranged by central 
authorities. The special situation and practical difficulties 
of the province should be reported to the central authorities 
voluntarily and repeatedly in order to garner the support of the 
state. This is also an important link to do the partial work 
well and to support the overall work. 
  We should persist in integrating the effort to deepen 
reform with that to safeguard social stability to ensure the 
smooth progress of reform. Only by seizing the favorable 
opportunity to deepen reform, open wider to the outside world, 
and accelerate development, can we consolidate the stable and 
united political situation; and only when social stability is 
maintained, can we ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening 
up, and economic development. Therefore, in the crucial period 
for reform and the period for tackling the most difficult 
problems, we should make particular efforts to safeguard social 
stability. When adopting major reform measures, we should fully 
consider the extent the masses approve, attach importance to 
their vital interests, and protect their enthusiasm. When 
trying to achieve breakthroughs in key areas of reform, we 
should pay attention to improving supporting measures, carry out 
ideological and political work successfully, and reduce social 
fluctuations as much as possible. In particular, following the 
deepening of enterprise reform, enterprises that are closed down 
and suspended or go bankrupt may increase within a short period 
of time. We should implement guaranteeing and preventive 
measures in advance and adopt every means to arrange well the 
life of the workers who are laid off. We should persist in the 
principle of promoting economic structural reform and political 
structural reform in a coordinated manner and step up efforts to 
improve the socialist legal system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping 
pointed out on many occasions that the corresponding reform in 
the political structure is an important condition for the 
ultimate success in the reform of the economic structure. 
Practice of reform and opening up proved that the development 
of the market economy has set a still higher demand on improving 
socialist democracy and the legal system. We should further 
improve the people's congress system and the system of 
multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the 
leadership of the Communist Party and establish and improve a 
democratic and scientific policy-making system. Focusing on 
establishing the socialist market economy system, we should 
facilitate the reform of the party and government administrative 
systems at the same pace, change the functions of party and 
government organs, simplify them, and raise their efficiency. 
We should step up economic legislation and upgrade the levels 
in acting according to law and strictly enforcing laws. We 
should achieve progress in grass-roots democratic politics and 
respect and protect the mainstay of the market and the 
democratic rights of the masses. We should conduct reform and 
opening up on the one hand and crack down on crimes and punish 
corruption on the other and do a good job in party building and 
the building of the spiritual civilization to create a good 
social environment for deepening reform and establishing healthy 
and progressive social conduct. 
<H5>  2. Deepen Economic Structural Reform and Accelerate </H5>
Establishment of the Socialist Market Economy System 
  In Heilongjiang, where large- and medium-sized enterprises 
are concentrated, the large proportion of basic industries, 
especially the industries related to resource production, the 
extensive and long period coverage of mandatory plans, and the 
serious barriers between different regions and different 
departments have established a special method for economic 
operation and a special economic structure. When implementing 
the "decision" of the party Central Committee, we should proceed 
from this special feature of the province and, focusing on 
establishing a modern enterprise system, regard them as the 
priorities of reform to transform the property right of 
state-owned enterprises, to change government functions, to 
cultivate the markets for the essential elements of production, 
and to establish unemployment and old-age insurance systems, 
facilitate the supporting reform in other fields simultaneously, 
and strive for breakthroughs next year. In about five years of 
time, we should strive to build a basic framework for the 
socialist market economy system, complete the transition from 
the planned economy system to the market economy system by the 
end of this century, and establish an initial administrative 
system and operating mechanism that meet the needs of the 
socialist market economy to promote a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development in the province. 
  A. We should speed up establishment of the modern enterprise 
system focusing on the reform of the property rights of 
state-owned enterprises. We should popularize the corporation 
system more rapidly and achieve success in the reform of the 
property rights of state-owned large- and medium-sized 
enterprises in an active and orderly manner. After 
standardizing the existing shareholding enterprises, we should 
select a number of large- and medium-sized enterprises provided 
with necessary conditions, especially industrial enterprises, to 
implement the shareholding system. We should increase the 
number of the enterprises implementing the shareholding system 
to 150 by next year. 
  We should define the responsibility for undertaking the 
projects for "grafting" transformation according to the 
agreements of intention signed during the outside-the-border 
business introduction activities sponsored by the provincial 
government on two occasions and firmly organize forces to 
fulfill the projects. We should strive to expand the scale of 
"grafting" transformation. Enterprises are allowed to conduct 
"grafting" transformation wholly and partially and to carry out 
the policy of one enterprise, several systems. We should strive 
to introduce more businessmen and capital from developed 
countries. We should pay attention to bringing in not only 
capital but also advanced technologies and managerial forms so 
as to accelerate the pace of "grafting" transformation. To 
speed up the progress of setting up enterprise associations, we 
should persist in linking enterprise self-participation with 
government guidance and have key enterprises play a key role in 
organizing large trans-regional enterprise associations that 
have industrial and product advantages and involve various 
trades. Next year, we should concentrate efforts on grasping 
the organization of the petrochemical industrial, dairy product, 
and machine tool enterprise associations. The existing 
enterprise associations should balance, as soon as possible, 
their internal relations; perfect the organizational structure 
and the management system; and actually bring their advantages 
into play. We should clearly understand, one by one, the 
situation of the small number of enterprises with serious 
losses; merge them into the enterprises with advantages; or have 
them 
resolutely declare bankruptcy. Next year, the province and all 
cities and prefectures should make solid strides for 
experimenting with the auction of large and medium-sized 
enterprises and the work of having the enterprises with serious 
difficulties declare bankruptcy. According to actual provincial 
conditions, we should coordinate the reform of property rights 
with technological transformation, solve the problems of a lack 
in motivation by 
defining property management rights of legal persons of 
enterprises to conduct enterprise technological transformation, 
encourage and restrict enterprises to speed up the pace of 
technological transformation and the upgrading and updating of 
products, coordinate the reform of the property rights system 
with the enhancement of the enterprise internal power, solve 
extensive management problems by setting up a scientific 
management system, and encourage and restrict enterprises to 
strengthen management and increase economic results. 
  We should accelerate the pace of system reform, and the 
lease 
and sales of enterprise property rights, and comprehensively 
reform the property rights of small public enterprises. In the 
next one or two years, we should strive to comprehensively 
fulfill the tasks for reforming the property rights of 
state-owned large enterprises with the shareholding cooperation 
system, lease management, and the marketing of property rights 
so that they comprise the mainstay. Enterprises with good 
economic records are allowed to convert their assets into stocks 
and to sell the stock wholly or partially to staff members, 
workers, and legal persons so that the enterprises are managed 
by legal persons and enterprises' staff members and workers with 
stock, or collectively by the staff members and workers with 
stocks. As for money-losing enterprises where it is impossible 
to halt deficits from forming, their staff members and workers 
can obtain the enterprise property rights by taking up the debts 
and risks instead of paying money, and then managing the 
enterprises through stocks. The enterprises without conditions 
for carrying out the shareholding cooperation system are allowed 
to carry out the leasing management system. That is, this type 
of enterprise can be managed wholly on lease or be divided into 
several relatively independent parts for separate leasing. In 
the method of managing 
the enterprises first on lease and then buying the property 
rights, we should reasonably define rent and sell the enterprise 
property rights in a step-by-step manner. We should openly sell 
off the property rights in society. The enterprises without 
hope for halting deficits and with difficulties in paying the 
debt in kind and transferring the property rights must 
resolutely declare bankruptcy according to laws. 
  We should speed up the change of the enterprise managerial 
mechanism and create conditions for setting up the modern 
enterprise system. We should continue to conscientiously 
implement "regulation" and the "detailed rules" of the province 
and implement to the letter various rights and duties of 
enterprises. We should further deepen the enterprise internal 
reform and scientifically set up the labor, personnel affairs, 
and wage system. We should comprehensively check up on 
enterprise property, creditors' rights, and debts; define 
property rights; check the amount of property obtained by the 
enterprise legal persons; and lay a good foundation for 
generally carrying out the company system. We should positively 
explore effective ways for strengthening the supervision and 
management of public property and protecting and increasing the 
value of public property. The province, cities, and prefectures 
should respectively select some enterprises to carry out the 
modern enterprise system on a trial basis so as to provide 
experience for various categories of enterprises in carrying out 
the modern enterprise system. 
  B. We should give priority to the cultivation of markets 
with essential production factors and accelerate the building of 
a united and open market system with orderly competition. As a 
big province rich with natural resources, our province is 
located in the central part of the Northeast Asian Economic 
Circle with conditions for becoming the center of distribution 
for commodities and essential production factors of the 
Northeast Asian Region. Therefore, the orientation of 
cultivating and developing the market system must be placed in 
the commercialization, monetization, and marketing of all 
essential factors and concentrate efforts on the cultivation and 
development of the markets with essential production factors. 
First, we should develop the money market. In the four central 
cities of Harbin, Qiqihar, Mudanjiang, and Jimusi, we should 
build the money markets to serve the whole province. We should 
also develop the second-grade stock markets in Harbin city, 
accelerate the cultivation of foreign exchange regulation 
markets and become a center for money lending. Meanwhile, we 
should expand the scale of issuing of stock on the market. 
Second, we should develop the labor market. Industrial cities 
should run special technology and personnel markets to serve the 
main bodies of production and operation, in particular, the 
township enterprises. The agricultural areas should give 
priorities to running markets of labor forces for promoting the 
transfer of idle labor forces in the rural areas and the 
development of non-agricultural industries. Border cities and 
counties should establish labor service export intermediary 
organs to serve places outside the territory. All cities and 
counties may open employment agencies in a planned manner and 
gradually turn them into the whole province's network for the 
supply and demand of information on labor forces. Third, we 
should develop the technology and information markets. All 
cities and prefectures may establish permanent technology 
markets or science and technology streets, proceed from reality 
and develop science and technology fairs and technology 
management organs in the rural areas. It is necessary to 
establish a modern information network linking domestic areas 
with foreign countries. Fourth, we should develop the real 
estate markets. We should turn the renovation and real estate 
development of large and medium-sized cities and county seats to 
the market and implement open bidding and competition on an 
equal basis. We should combine the renting of land with the 
paid utilization of land and housing reform and make the real 
estate industry become an important pillar industry in the 
development of cities. Fifth, we should develop the property 
right markets. In places where the environment for inviting 
business and investments are fairly good and the conditions for 
becoming centers for information and commodity distribution are 
favorable, we should step up efforts to establish property 
rights markets to serve state-owned enterprises. It is 
necessary to further develop all sorts of commodity markets, 
give priority to grasping the estabishment and operation of 
grain, cereal oil, meat, fruit, vegetable, coal, furniture, and 
sugar wholesale markets in the province. Continued efforts 
should be made to improve the operation of timber markets in the 
northern region, the Daqing petrochemical market and the 
provincial markets of machinery and electric products and light 
industrial and dairy product and expand their scope of 
influence. We should raise funds to build the provincial-level 
futures markets and improve the transportation markets. We 
should include the building of market system into the overall 
plan for national economic and social development. We should 
uphold the principle of adopting a unified plan, building the 
markets with the efforts of all sectors and allowing them to 
enjoy benefits before drawing profits from them, and the 
principle that whosoever builds and invests in the markets will 
enjoy the benefits and encourage all localities and departments 
to run the markets. We should accelerate the establishment of 
market law and regulation system, issue stipulations for market 
building in our province as quickly as possible and guarantee 
that all markets will be managed and operated in line with the 
law. In addition, we should cultivate market intermediary 
organs in a planned manner, perfect the arbitration and notary 
organs and improve the market functions. 
  We should accelerate pricing reform according to the changes 
of relations in the supply and demand of commodities and the 
marketing of essential production factors. Regarding the prices 
managed by the province, except the products of monopolized 
industries and commodities implementing the protective prices, 
we should decontrol the prices of all other commodities and let 
enterprises set their own prices in line with market supply and 
demands. We should gradually reduce and stop the dual-tracking 
pricing system for the means of production and implement the 
ceiling price in the means of production for agricultural use. 
It is necessary to establish the money system for regulating 
prices, improve the method of collecting and using the funds and 
strengthen the government's capacity to stabilize market 
commodity prices. We should step up efforts to formulate laws 
and regulations for local prices, improve the market price 
management system and standardize the prices of enterprises. 
  C. We should improve the system for economic regulation and 
control, with the focus on changing government functions. The 
state will start reform of the financial and tax, monetary, 
investment, and planning systems next year. We should achieve 
success in the work we need to do and take advantage of this 
moment to establish, as soon as possible, an economic regulation 
and control system that coordinates the macroeconomic regulation 
with the control system of central authorities. This requires 
that we speed up change in government functions, turn the 
microeconomic administration into macroeconomic administration, 
and put the focus of work on making overall plans for the 
economy, implementing macroindustrial policy, keeping total 
supply and total demand stable, and solving problems that cannot 
be solved merely through the market mechanism. We should focus 
work on indirect administration, such as regulation and control 
of economic levers and improving economic laws and regulations, 
mainly through economic, legal, and necessary administrative 
means instead of administrative means alone and guide and 
regulate enterprises' economic activities to operate in line 
with market regulations and the general targets of the economy. 
All departments should examine their powers of screening and 
approving before the first quarter of next year, delegate to 
lower levels those that should be delegated, and return to 
enterprises those that should be returned. We should accelerate 
institutional government reform to change from a government 
characterized by a mix and overlap of government functions with 
business into one characterized by separation of government 
functions from business, unity, and efficiency, and establish a 
multi-purpose, flexible, and highly efficient administrative 
system. The plan for the provincial-level institutional reform 
will be issued and implemented next year, and experimental 
institutional reform will be conducted in cities and prefectures. 
  We should actively promote financial and tax reform and 
strive to cultivate and expand financial resources. Based on 
the tax assignment system and the changes resulting from a 
system wherein the central fiscal authority returns and 
transfers payments to local authorities, we should deepen the 
reform of the local financial and tax systems to enhance our 
capacity to create and accumulate financial resources. In line 
with the principle of making the grass 
roots affluent first before making the province prosper and the 
principle of properly enhancing the provincial-level capacity 
for regulation and control, we should establish the provincial 
tax assignment system to support the accelerated economic and 
social development of all localities and to guarantee the funds 
to support key construction projects within the province and 
poverty-stricken areas. We should pay attention to the 
coordination with the important financial and tax policies the 
provincial party committee and government issued in the past, 
implement the policies on supporting prosperous counties, 
poverty-stricken counties, and border cities and counties to 
accelerate development, and continue the policies related to 
some enterprises' reform experiment until the end of 1995. To 
enhance local economic and financial strength, we should 
particularly support the technical transformation and new 
product development of the large tax and profit payers among the 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to ensure the 
steady growth of the local revenue; speed up the development of 
the intensive processing industry to increase the income tax 
revenue from local enterprises; expedite the development of 
transportation, telecommunication, construction, tourism, 
catering trade, service trade, and other trades of the tertiary 
industry to increase the business tax revenue; expedite the 
development of the agriculture with high economic results to 
increase the farm, forestry, and special product tax revenue; 
expedite the development of individual and private economies to 
increase the personal income tax revenue; and accelerate the 
development of real estate to increase house property tax, land 
use right tax, and real estate business tax revenues. While 
cultivating financial resources, we should conscientiously 
implement the industrial policy of the state and the province 
and avoid ill-considered and overlapping construction. We 
should use the lever of local tax rate to promote local economic 
development. We should complete establishment of local tax 
institutes as soon as possible and conscientiously do a good job 
intax collection and management. We should actively support the 
state 
in the establishment of tax institutes. 
  We should accelerate the reform of the financial system and 
further expand the channels for circulating capital. The 
provincial government should work in coordination with various 
specialized banks to organize the circulation of capital and to 
ensure various specialized banks change into commercial banks. 
In line with the method of separating policy-lending loans from 
commercial loans, the majority of the enterprises in the 
province are designated to use commercial loans. We must 
appropriately designate the nature of loans granted to the 
forest, coal, and war industries; and study and also adopt 
effective measures for changing specialized banks into 
commercial banks. Based on the existing city credit 
cooperatives, we should firmly attend to setting up the city 
cooperative banks to serve the local economy and small-and 
medium-sized enterprises. Based on the rural credit 
cooperatives and the rural cooperative funds, we should firmly 
attend to setting up rural cooperative banks to serve 
agriculture and town and township enterprises. We should also 
make positive efforts to have the state policy-lending bank and 
the central credit industrial bank to establish branch offices 
in our province and to have the Communications Bank of China 
establish branches in the central cities of the province. It is 
necessary to deepen the reform of the investment and planning 
systems and to intensify the investment risk-taking restriction 
mechanism. In line with the problems that the mainstay of 
investment is weakening, the investment in fixed assets is 
increasing at a slow speed, and the investment structure is not 
reasonable, we must standardize the mainstay of the investment 
in line with three major investment spheres -- the competitive 
projects, the projects of infrastructural facilities, and the 
social welfare projects. We should delegate the right to 
examine and approve investment items to the governments at 
various levels to further expand city and prefectural 
governments' rights. We should use the registration system for 
the record to replace the administrative examination and 
approval system in competitive projects. Beginning in 1994 we 
should carry out the system that representatives of legal 
persons should assume responsibility for the investment in the 
fixed asset projects of the industrial enterprises and carry 
out, on a trial basis, the system that representatives of legal 
persons should assume responsibility for the investment in 
infrastructural facility projects. The representatives of legal 
persons, as soon as they are designated, have decisionmaking 
power to charge the entire process of collecting funds, inviting 
and determining bidders, engaging in construction and 
management, managing production after operation, and returning 
loans; and also assume the responsibility for taking the risk. 
The representatives of legal persons should be relatively 
stable and 
must not be changed easily. To speed up the development of the 
basic industries and the intensive and precision processing 
industries, we should firmly attend to studying ways for 
building investment group companies in the province. We should 
further change the functions for planned management; strengthen 
the coordination with the economic lever departments; calculate 
and monitor the macroeconomic operation; coordinate the 
investment orientation and the investment structure according to 
the industrial policies; particularly strengthen the functions 
for development and scientific management of projects; set up a 
project tank including the ongoing projects and reserve 
projects; accelerate development of a group of key projects with 
technologically high-quality starting points, great influential 
functions, good economic results, and short construction 
periods; and make positive efforts to strive for 
more projects. 
  D. We should set up and perfect the social guaranteeing 
system with the focus on unemployment insurance and the 
insurance for providing for the aged. Next year we should make 
breakthroughs in perfecting the unemployment insurance system 
and the system for insurance for providing for the aged to 
promote the reform of the enterprise property right system and 
the reasonable flow of production factors. We should expand the 
scale of unemployment insurance work and gradually set up the 
insurance and service system for the staff and members of 
state-owned, collective, and private enterprises, as well as the 
Chinese staff members and workers of the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises. We should expand the implementation 
of the unemployment insurance system from some staff members 
and workers of state-owned enterprises to all staff members and 
workers of state-owned enterprises. We should carry out the 
system of setting up unemployment insurance funds among the 
enterprises of various ownerships, strengthen the management of 
the funds, and ensure that special funds should be used for 
special purposes. The specialized training bases and the 
production self-salvation bases should bring their functions 
into play, enhance the unemployed staff members and workers' 
employment ability and the awareness of participating in social 
insurance, and expand the channels for arranging jobs for 
jobless staff members and workers. 
  We should gradually establish a system wherein the basic 
old-age pension insurance, enterprises' supplementary old-age 
insurance, and the old-age insurance derived from workers' 
individual accounts are combined and should develop old-age 
insurance for the workers of the enterprises of various 
ownerships and urban self-employed workers. In rural areas, 
support of the aged should be shouldered chiefly by their 
families and supplemented by community assistance, and the 
old-age insurance derived from accumulation of individual 
accounts should be gradually popularized so as to expand the 
coverage of insurance. We should establish city and prefectural 
basic old-age pension insurance reserve funds and gradually 
unify the management of retirement funds. We should rationalize 
the social security management system and, in coordination with 
institutional reform, establish a unified provincial social 
security management organization. Distribution of social 
property is the most sensitive issue of the economics of 
society. We should establish a reasonable system for the 
distribution of personal income, gradually standardize the 
mechanism for the formation of income, and reduce the 
opportunity for a small number of persons to take advantage of 
their special positions or privilege to win excessive profits. 
We should improve the collection and management of personal 
income tax, establish and improve the system to issue receipts 
during transactions, the bank account system, and the personal 
taxable income declaration system, and prevent too large a 
difference in final personal income. We should lift the limit 
of the total payroll of enterprises in line with the principle 
of giving priority to efficiency while considering fairness and 
guide the distribution of income to tilt favorably to managers, 
people adept at business, backbone technicians, and skilled 
producers. We should sell, lease, and build houses 
simultaneously to accelerate urban housing reform, with the 
focus on selling public houses. Except for the houses that 
governments think are not suitable to be sold, all urban public 
houses may be sold to urban staff members and workers. We 
should continue to promote the house rent reform and gradually 
raise house rent according to the changes in market housing 
prices. We should attach importance to the development and 
construction of the houses suitable for economic development and 
provide necessary support in such areas as distribution of land 
for construction, dismantling of houses, relocation of people, 
taxes, and credit to the enterprises responsible for the 
development and construction of such houses. 
  E. We should further improve the rural operation system 
focusing on the cooperative shareholding system. The 
household-based output-related contract responsibility system 
and the dual-management system combining unified operation with 
independent management are the basic economic systems for rural 
areas. The rural work conference held by the provincial party 
committee has decided to extend the household-based 
output-related contract system another 30 years without change 
and the term for agricultural developmental production contract 
another 50 years without change. The optimal- scale operation 
of land should be developed on the premise that nonagricultural 
trades are developed correspondingly and rural labor forces are 
transferred reasonably and by establishing a land circulation 
mechanism compatible with the requirements of the market 
economy. We should allow peasants to transfer with 
compensation, mortgage, buy shares with, or lease out their land 
use right before their contracts expire. Institutionalizing of 
the cooperative shareholding system is another important reform 
of the rural operation system. We should apply this system 
extensively to the establishment of new township enterprises and 
to the transformation of the existing rural collective 
enterprises. Business entities engaged in the coordinated 
development of farm and animal products, the distribution of 
farm and sideline products, and rural socialized service should 
adopt the cooperative shareholding system step by step. This 
system may also be tried in developing the superior industries 
of certain localities, in establishing the entities engaged in 
the integrated management of trade, industry, and agriculture, 
and in accelerating the construction of small cities and towns. 
Business entities that have already adopted the system should 
standardize and systematize it so that their shares can be 
established in a reasonable manner, their organizations are 
sound, their management systems are perfect, and their 
distribution of interests is proper. Integrated management of 
trade, industry, and agriculture will help in guiding and 
organizing peasants to enter the market, in developing 
specialized production and optimal-scale operation, and in 
upgrading the industrialization of the rural economy. We should 
develop more rapidly the organizations engaged in the integrated 
management of trade, industry, and agriculture and exert great 
efforts to establish the production and management systems that 
closely coordinate farming and breeding with the processing 
industry, production and supply with marketing, domestic trade 
with foreign trade, and agricultural and industrial production 
with commerce. 
  We should break with the regional barriers, combine the raw 
materials production zones with the processing bases and 
commodity distributing areas in accordance with the principle of 
the economic zones and efficiency and give priority to 
developing foreign trade-industry-agriculture integrated 
organizations with the serial development of grain, animal 
by-products and flax. We should also give priority to 
cultivating and expanding leading enterprises, accelerate the 
pace of developing other new products, markets and technological 
transformation, and enhance their influential capacity. 
Continued efforts should be made to accelerate the building of 
the socialized service system, strengthen the service 
consciousness and functions of agricultural-related departments, 
support rural production and management experts to take the lead 
in running all sorts of special associations, develop community 
service organizations, strengthen the building of county and 
township agricultural stations (centers), and gradually realize 
socialized service in the whole course of production, operation, 
circulation, and consumption in the rural areas. We should 
accelerate the system of cultivating and building farm product 
markets, do a good job in coordinating and preparing for the 
reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system, establish 
the grain risk-taking fund system, improve the grain reserve 
system, give priority to building special wholesale markets with 
the advantages of regional products, actively develop country 
trade fairs in counties and townships, and effectively link the 
rural economy with domestic and international markets. It is 
necessary to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and 
control in the rural areas, make rational plans and adjust the 
distribution of rural productive forces and promote coordinated 
development in various industries and regions, as well as the 
economic and social sectors. 
  F. We should give priority to deepening reform of the 
foreign 
trade system in an effort to promote a strategic escalation of 
opening up. Since our province has the advantages of opening up 
the border areas, accelerating the establishment of foreign 
economic trade operational mechanisms that meet the needs of the 
socialist market economy will be the strategic priority of our 
province's reform and development. Next year the country will 
establish a market-based manageable floating exchange rate 
system, abolish the mandatory plan in foreign trade enterprises, 
implement the foreign exchange remittance system and the system 
of converting Renminbi for regular projects with favorable 
conditions, place the export tax refund under the unified 
allocation of the central departments, further decontrol the 
management of export commodities in an orderly manner, expand 
the foreign business power of industrial and foreign trade 
enterprises with favorable conditions, develop transcountry 
companies that integrate industry with agriculture, science, 
foreign trade, and so forth. Generally speaking, these 
measurers are helpful to our province to expand the degree of 
opening up. We must implement them well in accordance with the 
central plans. In view of the fairly great changes in the 
foreign economic and trade environment, governments at all 
levels, and all economic and foreign trade departments and all 
sorts of foreign trade enterprises should conscientiously study 
the market trend outside the territory and the demands of 
domestic and foreign markets, strengthen market forecast and 
development, know how to manage things according to 
international practices, and strive to make foreign economic and 
trade work conform to the objective law of the market economy. 
We should induce foreign trade enterprises to develop in line 
with the orientation of becoming integrated industry-foreign 
trade ones and expand the foreign economic and trade bodies that 
serve as mainstays. Foreign economic and trade enterprises 
should gradually expand their business from simple commercial 
activities to such production spheres as developing various 
industries, projects and natural resources; production 
enterprises should cooperate with and jointly do business with 
foreign trade enterprises, expand the foreign trade sphere and 
the export quotas and make use of the advantages of products to 
directly participate in competition in the international market; 
enterprises of the same category that lack competitive power 
should organize associations that combine production with 
processing and marketing or enterprise groups with superior 
enterprises in the lead and production chains as the link in 
line with the principle of mutual benefits and enhance their 
capacity to participate in the international market competition. 
We should exert efforts to adjust the foreign economic and trade 
forms and enhance the competitive ability of border and local 
trade enterprises on the international markets. In face of the 
changes in the external environment of border and local trade 
and the stagnation in barter trade, on the basis of stabilizing 
the development of economic and trade cooperation with Russia, 
we should accelerate the implementation of various market 
strategies. While stabilizing barter trade, we should gradually 
expand ordinary spot exchange trade to reduce the business 
risks. We should change the dislocation between foreign 
economic relations and foreign trade, turn pure trade into 
multidirectional economic and technological cooperation, and 
establish long-term and stable foreign economic and trade 
cooperation relations. We should make great efforts to adjust 
the export product mix and accelerate the export-oriented 
economic development. We should continuously develop marketable 
new products to meet the changes in the world market, speed up 
development of export-oriented agriculture and export processing 
industry, and expand the exports of the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises to promote the steady growth of 
large-scale exports. We should adopt resolute measures to block 
the channels for the exports of counterfeit and inferior 
commodities and promote barter trade. We should seize the 
opportunity presented by the expansion of the foreign trade 
autonomy of enterprises to strive to grant more large- and 
medium-sized enterprises import and export rights so that more 
enterprises can enter the world market. We should establish a 
unified and smooth work mechanism for foreign economic relations 
and trade and unify the management of ordinary spot exchange 
trade, barter trade, foreign capital utilization, and 
development zone construction so that foreign economic relations 
and trade can be coordinated and promoted simultaneously. 
  G. We should speed up the close integration of science, 
technology, and education with the economy, with the focus on 
commercializing and industrializing scientific and technological 
achievements. We should be steadfast in implementing the 
guiding thought of relying on science and technology in 
developing economic construction and gearing scientific and 
technological work to economic construction, facilitate the 
development of science, technology, and education, and deepen 
the reform of the educational system and the scientific and 
technological system. We should comprehensively implement the 
strategy of "developing the province with science, technology, 
and education" and establish a scientific and technological 
system and an educational system that conforms to the 
development of the socialist market economy and the laws 
governing the development of science, technology, and education. 
While intensifying basic research and regular education, we 
should step up construction of the Harbin and Daqing High- and 
New-Tech Development Zones focusing on the development of high 
and new technology and relevant industries. The Harbin 
Development Zone should emphasize integration of machinery and 
electronic industries, biological medicine, and new materials, 
and the Daqing Development Zone should emphasize the petroleum 
industry, the chemical industry, and the integration of optical 
instrument, machinery, and electronic industries. They should 
step up the work to bring in projects from outside and to start 
up the projects developed by themselves. In particular, it 
should bring in and develop the projects that reflect the 
characteristics of the development zones and create high 
additional value for products and strive to build in two to 
three years a number of pillar enterprises whose output value 
exceeds 100 million yuan and profits and taxes exceed 10 million 
yuan. We should integrate science, technology, and education 
with the economy, with the focus on transforming scientific and 
technological achievements. Scientific research institutes and 
schools of higher learning provided with favorable conditions 
should strengthen joint management and cooperation with 
industrial and trade enterprises and, by converting their 
scientific research achievements and personnel into shares, 
cooperate with the enterprises to establish enterprise groups 
engaged in development, production, and marketing of new 
products. With government support and through shareholding 
cooperation, we should prepare for establishing in Harbin an 
intermediate experiment base for scientific research 
achievements. We should be determined to train a contingent of 
science and technology brokers to facilitate the entrance of 
scientific and technological achievements into the market. By 
next year we should complete transforming developmental 
scientific research institutes into business entities. The 
Harbin Engineering Institute New Technology Park should 
emphasize its functions of experimentation of scientific 
research achievements and development of high- and new- 
technology industries, and more of its funds should be used in 
developing high- and new-technology industries. We should 
support institutes of higher learning to develop their 
advantages in personnel and technology and to adopt different 
methods to develop high- and new-technology industries. We 
should thoroughly implement the 36-point policy on developing 
the role of intellectuals and encourage scientific research 
personnel to establish by themselves or in cooperation with 
others scientific and technological development enterprises and 
information service enterprises or to lease and contract for the 
management of small state-owned enterprises, neighborhood 
enterprises, and urban collective enterprises. We should 
promote the development of new products, with the focus on 
adjusting product mix. In line with the requirement for 
developing ten major projects in the province, we should 
organize scientific research units and processing enterprises to 
develop the new products that are based on a high technological 
starting point, create high additional value, and have good 
market prospects and strive to enable our several leading 
industries to create brand name products that dominate the 
domestic market and open up the world market. 
<H5>  3. Strengthen and Improve Party Leadership, and Provide a </H5>
Reliable Guarantee for the Establishment of the Socialist Market 
Economic System 
  The third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central Committee 
has initiated the new period of China's socialist modernization 
drive. To effect the historical change from old to new systems, 
and to establish the socialist market economic system, we must 
further strengthen and improve party leadership, strengthen the 
party's cohesive forces and fighting capacity, and persist in 
the principle of taking a two-handed approach and being tough 
with both hands in order to provide a strong and effective 
social and political guarantee for deepening the reform. 
  A. We should profoundly study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics to lay a 
solid ideological foundation for implementing the "decision." 
Party organizations at all levels in the province should give 
top priority to organizing party members and cadres to study the 
theory of building the socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
We should combine the study of Volume Three of the Selected 
Work of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the "decision" of the 
CPC Central Committee, emphatically grasp the quintessence of 
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, and 
appropriately handle the relations between reform and 
development, between speed and efficiency, between plans and 
markets, between the present and the future, and between the 
part and the whole. We should grasp the main line that "only 
development is the essential criterion," clearly understand that 
liberating and developing productive forces is the essential 
demand of socialism, and always persist in the central task of 
economic construction without any deviation. We should guard 
against the right but primarily prevent the "left." We should 
extricate ourselves from the fixed traditional modes of thinking 
and get rid of the disease of fearing capitalism to maintain the 
continuity and stability of the policies concerning reform and 
opening up. To study well Volume Three of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping, we must strengthen the study among the central 
groups of party committees at all levels. The standing 
committee of the provincial party committee plans to schedule a 
certain period of time to study Volume Three of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping around the major issues concerning the 
province's reform and development in order to seek unity of 
thought and mobilize party members and cadres throughout the 
province to profoundly study the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics. We should run theory discussion 
classes for leading cadres of party and government 
organizations, run study classes for leading cadres of 
enterprises, and run training classes for reserve cadres. We 
should combine the study of Volume Three of the Selected Works 
of Deng Xiaoping with the study of the basic knowledge on market 
economy. We should continue to break with the old ideas and old 
concepts taken shape under traditional systems and should set up 
the new ideas and new concepts that suit the socialist market 
economy so that we can push forward the cause of reform and 
opening up with one heart and one mind. 
  B. We should strengthen leading bodies at all levels and the 
grass-roots organizations and should build up the ranks of 
cadres that meet the demands of the socialist market economy. 
Deepening reform and accelerating development have set an even 
higher demand on the leading and work level of party 
organizations at all levels. To meet this demand, we must 
persist in the party's centralism and actually strengthen 
leading bodies at all levels in line with the principles of 
making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger, 
better-educated, and professionally more competent. We should 
use and promote cadres based on their political achievements. 
Through the reform of party and government organizations, we 
should strive to train, choose, and promote a number of cadres 
who have both ability and political integrity and who have been 
outstanding in official performances, and should provide 
sufficient and competent cadres for leading bodies of all levels 
of party and government organizations. We should regard the 
building of the ranks of modern entrepreneurs and the 
improvement of the quality of the ranks of grass-roots cadres as 
work priorities of strategic significance. We should bring in 
the competitive and incentive mechanisms to break with the 
restrictions from ownership systems and administrative grades. 
We should not stick to one pattern in choosing and promoting 
outstanding talents in order to truly promote the talents, who 
are familiar with market economy and are good at scientific 
management, to leading posts of enterprises and promote the 
cadres, who have the spirit of blazing new trials and working 
practically and who are able to lead the masses to achieve 
prosperity commonly, to leading posts of grass-roots 
organizations. We should realistically strengthen the 
construction of the ideology and work style of the leading 
bodies at various levels, and concentrate energy on solving the 
problems in which the leading cadres stand high above the masses 
and remain indifferent toward the masses' weals and woes and the 
grass roots' difficulties. All leading cadres should go deep to 
the grass roots and the masses to help directly solve their 
practical problems. We should solve the problems of trying to 
skirt round difficulties, shifting responsibility onto others, 
and not assuming responsibility; set up a definite system of 
responsibility for fulfillment of the targets; and ensure that 
all levels take on their own duties. The problems of shifting 
responsibility onto others, putting blames onto others, and 
never undergoing self-criticism should be solved. 
Simultaneously, we should foster the awareness of personal 
responsibility and creatively do our duties well. Doing away 
with the tendency of blaming everyone and everything but oneself 
and being negative and pessimistic, we should boost morale and 
be inspired with enthusiasm. The cadres who do not stress party 
spirit and principles and refuse to do solid work must neither 
be put in important positions nor be promoted. Cadres who 
create bad consequences due to the negligence of duties or the 
failure to implement the decisions of higher levels should be 
readjusted from their leading posts resolutely. Those who 
damage unity must be punished strictly according to party 
discipline and administrative discipline. We should be 
determined to build grass-roots organizations into fighting 
forces and unite with and guide the masses to realize the 
fighting goal of the party. The party committees at various 
levels should try to clearly understand, one after another, the 
weak and lax situation of the grass-roots organizations; and 
adopt measures to consolidate them in stages into groups. Party 
organizations of enterprises, rural areas, organs, and 
institutions should strengthen self-construction and bring their 
functions into play in line with the requirements for setting up 
the modern enterprise system, increasing the income of the 
peasants, serving the grass roots and the masses, and 
implementing the strategy of relying on science and education to 
rejuvenate the province. Simultaneously, we should improve the 
work forms of the grass-roots party organizations, further 
investigate and study the new situation and new problems, and 
positively explore new ways to set up party organizations and 
conduct activities in various sectors of economic organizations 
under market economic conditions. 
  C. We should realistically strengthen the construction of 
the socialist spiritual civilization and strive to create the 
social practice of opening to the outside world in a civilized 
manner and making progress healthily. To set up the socialist 
market economic system, we should persist in the principle of 
paying equal attention to spiritual and material civilizations, 
ensure the accurate orientation of reform and opening up by 
strengthening the construction of the spiritual civilization, 
and simultaneously ensure the provision of powerful ideological 
theory, a democratic legal system, science and culture, and 
social practice. The theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, the basic line of the party, patriotism, 
collectivism, socialism, the people's creativity in reform, 
opening up, and modernization, and the fine traditional ethics 
of the Chinese nation should be regarded as the focal points of 
propaganda work and ideological and political work, and 
vigorously carry forward the main melody of socialism. Papers, 
magazines, and books should use key pages to prominently and 
vigorously expand the reaches of propaganda on the main melody. 
The radio and television stations should also use prime viewing 
time to do so. Enterprises, neighborhood committees, and 
campuses should develop cultural activities. It is also 
necessary to conduct mass cultural activities and strengthen the 
construction of civilized villages and units. We should 
persistently take the main melody as the keynote and ensure that 
the cultural activities are not only varied and colorful but 
also healthy and progressive. We should notice that along with 
the ceaseless deepening of reform and opening up, the people's 
thinking and the social practice are changing positively in line 
with the requirements for social progress. However, some 
negative, backward, and corrosive things that undermine the 
nature of socialism continue to spread unchecked. In 
particular, money worshipping, out-and-out egoism, corrosive 
lifestyles run rampant and have become extremely prominent 
problems. If these phenomena are spread unchecked, not only will 
it damage the prestige of the party and the government but it 
will ruin the future of reform, opening up, and modernization as 
well. All communist party members with the sense of 
responsibility for the cause of the party and the people must 
not turn a blind eye to these phenomena. On the contrary, they 
must be the first to eliminate these phenomena at their posts 
and departments, and realistically strengthen the construction 
of the spiritual civilization. We should strengthen the 
education on having an accurate outlook on life and an accurate 
outlook on value and strive to form a practice of respecting 
advances and stressing contributions. We should adopt various 
effective educational forms and conduct education on patriotism, 
collectivism and socialism among the masses of cadres, 
especially young people. The media and propaganda departments 
should adhere to a correct media guidance, give prominence to 
publicizing advanced and typical cases of diligent and honest 
administration and selfless dedication and gradually make 
selfless devotion become the guidance of value and the highest 
moral standard of the whole society. We should exert efforts to 
promote the spirit of devotion to work and strive to form a 
practice of paying full attention to one's post and working 
painstakingly. Party and government organs and all social 
departments should strengthen education on professional ethics 
in line with the characteristics of their own work, induce the 
people to work hard, compete with one another on an equal basis, 
give civilized service and observe law and discipline. Through 
conducting all sorts of activities on fostering the enterprise 
spirit, we should induce the people to enhance the sense of 
responsibility, dedicate themselves to their own business and 
work in a down-to- earth manner. We should actively induce the 
people to spend their money in a sound manner and strive to form 
a habit of practicing economy. On the basis of conducting 
investigations and studies, we should adopt policies, laws and 
regulations as well as economic and administrative measures to 
effectively check the spread of abnormal social consumption and 
the trend of lavish spending. Leading cadres at all levels 
should take the lead in promoting the spirit of building the 
country and running the households industriously and thriftily. 
We should resolutely check the repulsive social phenomena and 
strive to purify the social environment. Continued efforts 
should be made to deal blows to feudal superstitions, gambling, 
drugs trading and taking, prostitution and visit to prostitutes 
and other repulsive social phenomena, organize efforts to ban 
all sorts of pornographic services and gambling activities in 
recreation and service places and strictly handle the managers 
in line with law. 
  D. We should continue to deeply conduct anticorruption 
struggle and use the actual results in fighting corruption and 
promoting honesty to guarantee the smooth progress of reform, 
opening up and economic construction. Fighting corruption and 
strengthening the building of clean politics is the necessary 
conditions for building the socialist market economic system. 
Since the issuance of the central authorities' important 
anticorruption plans, party and government organs at all levels 
across the province have adopted a resolute attitude, taken 
action actively, and witnessed a very good trend in the 
anticorruption struggle. Places where this work has been fairly 
good have achieved fairly remarkable results in carrying out the 
three central tasks and enhanced the confidence of masses of 
cadres in fighting corruption. We should continue to expand 
the degree of work, consolidate the expected results of the 
previous stage, and guarantee the realization of the three 
anticorruption tasks on schedule. Leading cadres at all levels 
must implement the relevant stipulations on keeping oneself 
self-disciplined and honest in places where needed, pay further 
attention to holding democratic life activities of leading 
bodies with emphasis on honesty, self- discipline and 
self-investigation and self-correction, compare their work one 
by one with the relevant central and provincial stipulations, 
examine their own problems in a fact-seeking manner, report 
their cases and criticize them within a certain scope and place 
them under mass supervision. We should conscientiously handle 
cases on law and discipline violations, strictly handle all 
verified corruption cases and never tolerate them. Discipline 
inspection, supervision and judicial organs at and above the 
county level should select typical cases that affect a large 
area and cause strong complaints from the masses for public 
trial. Regarding the central proposal on checking the recent 
unhealthy trends in various trades and the problems which all 
localities and departments have determined to solve on a 
priority basis, we should grasp them through to the end until 
good results are achieved. In fighting corruption, we must 
rely on education and the legal system, proceed from deepening 
reform and the building of systems and fundamentally guard 
against and check the corrupt phenomena. We should solve the 
unhealthy trends in cadre personnel affairs, real estate 
development and contract of projects by adopting the methods of 
holding public examinations, employing workers in the public and 
inviting tenders; solve the problems of using public funds to 
build houses above set standards and selling public houses at a 
higher price by deepening reform of the housing system and 
collecting unhealthy trends in housing distribution; prevent the 
problems of abusing one's powers to seek personal gain in the 
course of distribution of funds by deepening reform of the 
financial, tax and banking systems; and solve the problem of 
spending public funds lavishly and wastefully by setting 
standards for cadres' wages and for reception that conform to 
reality. In addition, we should also strengthen inner party 
supervision, legal supervision, media supervision and mass 
supervision, study and explore effective ways to exercise 
supervisory power under the market economic conditions, and 
gradually institutionalize and legalize the anticorruption 
struggle. While successfully grasping the anticorruption 
struggle, we should rectify the ideology and work style among 
party and government organs at all levels with opposing 
bureaucracy, liberalization and formalism as the main content. 
  E. We should exert conscientious efforts to maintain social 
stability to provide a good social environment for deepening 
reform. In the current economic activities, both difficulties 
and destabilizing factors are rather numerous. In addition, 
many major reform measures will be put into practice next year. 
This makes it a very important task to maintain social 
stability. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should regard it as a major task to show concern for the life of 
the masses and maintain social stability, concentrate efforts on 
tackling in a timely manner the social problems that affect 
stability, and strive to nip the hidden destabilizing factors in 
the bud to maintain and develop the stable and united political 
situation. To achieve this, we should, first, pay attention to 
people's ideological fluctuations, if any, emerging in the 
process of reform and ease people's feelings and resolve 
contradictions in a timely manner. Leading cadres at all levels 
should go deep into the grass-roots level and the masses to 
intensify the investigations and analysis of public opinion and 
people's mind-set, learn about their thinking, do a timely and 
good job in education and persuasion, guide the people to 
correctly understand reform and to enhance their mental 
preparations for it, and conscientiously lead, protect, and 
develop well the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Second, 
we should exert particular efforts to solve the problems in the 
life of the staff members and workers of loss-making 
enterprises. Party and government leading organs at all levels 
should adopt a highly responsible attitude toward the people 
and, dividing work among themselves, conduct study of the ways 
to guarantee the basic life of the staff members and workers of 
the enterprises under their charge which have stopped or 
postponed wage payment. They should also study the ways to 
reassign the laid-off staff members and workers of the closed or 
suspended enterprises. Labor departments should strengthen 
coordination for the unemployment insurance work and put the 
focus of social insurance business on the enterprises which have 
lost money for a long time. Trade unions, the Communist Youth 
League [CYL], and women's federations are the channels and 
bridges for the party to establish ties with the masses. They 
should fully develop their role, further represent and safeguard 
the interests of workers, report workers' desires and demands to 
party committees and governments in a timely manner, and help 
party committees and governments in the ideological work for 
workers to safeguard social stability. Meanwhile, they should 
conscientiously institute the system of responsibility for 
helping and supporting poverty-stricken localities, implement 
the aid-the-poor measures in every village and household, and 
encourage rural party and CYL members to support the poor all 
the year round. As the year is drawing to an end, all 
localities should make good arrangements for the life of 
poverty- stricken households to make sure that they have a happy 
New Year and Spring Festival. Third, we should further reduce 
the burdens on enterprises and peasants. The "enterprise law" 
and the "regulations" should be conscientiously enforced, and 
exaction of fees and wanton requisition of donations from 
enterprises and their workers should be checked. By 
transforming enterprises' property right system and operating 
mechanism and improving the social security system, the burdens 
on enterprises should be gradually shifted to the society. 
Effective measures should be adopted to continuously implement 
the regulations of the central authorities as well as the 
provincial party committee and government on reducing the 
burdens on peasants to prevent reemergence of the burdens. We 
should intensify publicity of policies to familiarize the masses 
with the laws and regulations on lightening the burdens on 
peasants so that they will resist the irrational burdens 
according to law. Fourth, we should keep price rises under 
control. There will be plenty of factors for price hikes next 
year, and if we fail in regulation and control, prices will 
still rise by a large margin. Therefore, we should attach great 
importance to prices, strengthen supervision and control to 
prevent monopolization of the market, random jacking-up of 
prices, and pursue of huge profits in a timely manner, and exert 
utmost efforts to bring next year's price rises under control. 
Fifth, we should do a good job in comprehensive improvement of 
public security. We should strictly crack down on gangs of 
hooligans and thieves, bus and train marauding and waylaying, 
and serious criminal elements. We should strengthen management 
of the public security in public places to safeguard normal 
social order. We should achieve success in mediating in civil 
disputes to prevent contradictions from becoming intense. We 
should earnestly handle people's complaints exposed in their 
visits and letters and strive to solve problems at grass-roots 
levels and in the places where they arise so as to reduce 
bypassing of immediate leadership to present complaints to 
higher levels. We should apply the leadership responsibility 
system to public security and make public security a decisive 
factor in appraising the work of a locality so as to create a 
stable social environment for reform and construction.
