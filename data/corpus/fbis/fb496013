<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Tianjin municipal statistical </F>
bureau on the development of the national economy and society in 
1993; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Various fronts throughout the municipality deeply 
and earnestly implemented the important speech of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping, the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress, and the tasks 
adopted at the sixth municipal party congress and the first 
session of the 12th municipal people's congress in 1993. Cadres 
and the masses across the municipality accelerated reform and 
opening up by emancipating their minds, seeking truth from 
facts, seizing the opportunity, and boldly engaging in practice. 
Based on the former foundation, they also achieved new 
developments in economic construction and various social 
undertakings by persistently combining the tasks between 
increasing the total supply and demand and upgrading the quality 
of economic operation; between reinforcing the dynamics in 
reform and opening up and accelerating the economic development; 
between vigorously switching losses to profits and upgrading the 
economic quality as a whole; and between enhancing the macro 
readjustment and control and promoting the readjustment of 
economic structure. The actual living standards of both urban 
and rural residents were further upgraded. A good trend of 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national 
economy as a whole was maintained. The major economic targets 
were overfulfilled and the increased scales in this regard 
surpassed those of 1992. Some of the increased scales reached 
previous peaks. According to initial statistics, the municipal 
GNP in 1993 reached 50.3 billion yuan and showed an 11.8 percent 
increase calculated in term of 1992 comparable prices. This has 
been the second rapid growth scored by the municipality in this 
regard since the enforcement of reform and opening up. Of this 
rapid growth, the added value of the tertiary industry reached 
17.9 billion yuan and showed an 11.8 percent increase over 1992. 
Its proportion reached 35.6 percent of the GNP. The per capita 
GNP exceeded 5,000 yuan and increased from 4,696 yuan in 1992 to 
5,700 yuan in 1993. The annual local financial revenue reached 
7.315 billion yuan and showed a 21.8 percent increase calculated 
in terms of 1992 comparable prices. This has been the fastest 
growth in this regard over the past 10 years. The municipality 
took a new step in conducting reform in the economic systems in 
1993 and the construction of various markets was accelerated. 
The enterprise reform was further deepened. The municipality 
achieved progress in implementing and enforcing the "enterprise 
law" and "regulations" and approved 58 enterprises that took up 
the pilot work of reform in share-holding systems. Over 60 
percent of the commercial enterprises across the municipality 
enforced the system of "allowing the state-owned enterprises to 
be run by individuals." The reform in the three internal systems 
of enterprises was accelerated. Major problems cropping up in 
economic operation are as follows: The economic development is 
not sufficient, the light and textile industries as well as the 
tertiary industry are not developing fast enough, the economic 
results scored by some enterprises are poor, the income of some 
staff members and workers is relatively low, and the scale of 
markets needs to be further expanded. 
<H5>  1. Agriculture </H5>
  The agricultural economic sector achieved stable 
development. 
The municipality further enhanced the basic position of 
agriculture in 1993, actively implemented various agricultural 
policies, and pushed forward the reform in various styles and 
the establishment of socialized service systems for rural areas. 
It also vigorously carried out the activities of having science 
and technology make agriculture prosperous; readjusting the 
structure of planting undertakings; promoting the development of 
agriculture with high yield, fine quality, and high benefit; and 
developing the commodity economy to promote the stable 
development of the agricultural economic sector. The annual 
added value of agriculture reached 3.1 billion yuan and showed a 
1.4 percent increase over 1992. The structure of farm products 
was readjusted somewhat. The 1993 acreage of farmland on which 
grain and cash crops were planted decreased and that of melons, 
fruits, and vegetables increased. The municipality has 
consecutively reaped a bumper grain harvest over the past 10 
years in spite of the serious natural disasters. The total 
grain output in the year reached 1.998 billion kg and topped the 
previous peak again. The per mu yield of grains reached 295 kg. 
The output of cotton decreased somewhat due to the decrease of 
sowed farmland of cotton crop. The production of major 
non-staple foodstuffs showed a stable increase. 
  Output of major agricultural and sideline products was as 
follows: 


                            1993                      Percentage increase over 
                                                      1992

Pigs slaughtered            1,249,700 head            -5.2 


  Agricultural input increased, and agricultural production 
conditions improved. In 1993, financial institutions in the 
municipality newly granted 1.605 billion yuan of more loans to 
agriculture, an increase of 1.5 percent over 1992. By the end 
of 1993, the aggregate power of farm machinery reached 4,700,500 
kilowatts, an increase of 4.7 percent over the figure at the end 
of 1992. There were 23,900 heavy-duty trucks, an increase of 
12.8 percent. Rural consumption of electricity was 2.311 
billion kilowatt hours, an increase of 5.9 percent over 1992. 
New achievements were scored in the drive of invigorating 
agriculture through science and technology. Fine varieties of 
corn, dry farming and thin planting of rice, growing of cotton 
seedlings with plastic sheeting, and transplanting of aquatic 
products began to be popularized. 
  The commodity rate of agricultural products was raised 
further. In 1993, the total value of agricultural commodities 
was 5.34 billion yuan, an increase of 15.6 percent over 1992, 
and the commodity rate rose from 74.3 percent in 1992 to 75.6 
percent. Of this, the commodity rate of cropping products rose 
from 63.4 percent to 64.6 percent, and that of livestock 
products rose from 87.8 percent to 90.1 percent. 
  The rural economy developed comprehensively. In 1993, the 
total product of rural society was 65.199 billion yuan, an 
increase of 38.9 percent over 1992. Of this, the total output 
value of agriculture was 6.056 billion yuan, an increase of 4.6 
percent. In 1993, there were 30,800 township and town 
enterprises in the municipality, with a total employment of 
885,700 persons. The total income of these enterprises was 
37.121 billion yuan, an increase of 33.6 percent over 1992. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>
  In 1993, under the guidance of market mechanism, industrial 
enterprises vigorously increased the dynamics of reform, 
readjusted product mix, attended to the work of halting deficits 
and increasing profits, and improved economic efficiency, thus 
maintaining the trend of rapid development. In 1993, the added 
value of industry was 26.65 billion yuan, up by 13.2 percent 
over 1992. Total industrial output value was 124.666 billion 
yuan, up by 24.5 percent, a record high in terms of increase 
margin since the commencement of reform and opening up. Of 
this, output value of state-owned industrial enterprises 
increased by 5.3 percent; that of collectively owned industrial 
enterprises, 23.7 percent; that of the three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises, 90.0 percent; that of township and 
town industrial enterprises, 40.4 percent; and that of large and 
medium-sized industrial enterprises, 8.6 percent. 
  The industrial structure was further readjusted and the 
light industry achieved overall development. The total output 
value scored by industrial enterprises at or above the township 
level across the municipality in 1993 reached 83.957 billion 
yuan and showed a 17.9 percent increase over 1992. Of the total 
output value, that of heavy industrial enterprises reached 
48.424 billion yuan and showed a 25.2 percent increase over 
1992. The newly increased output value of heavy industrial 
enterprises accounted for 76.5 percent in that scored by 
industrial enterprises at or above the township level in the 
year. Of the newly increased output value, that of the auto 
industry showed a 36.8 percent increase; that of 
machine-building industry, a 32 percent increase; and that of 
electronic instrument industry, a 32.9 percent increase. The 
production of light industry showed a stable increase over 1992. 
The annual total output value scored by light industrial 
enterprises reached 35.533 billion yuan and showed a 9.3 percent 
increase over 1992. In addition, non state-owned industries in 
which township enterprises and the "three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises" are of main parts have become the 
new growing points of the municipal industrial economic sector. 
The newly increased output value scored by township enterprises 
and the "three types of foreign-funded enterprises" in the year 
accounted for 83.1 percent in that scored by industrial 
enterprises at or above the township level across the 
municipality, which have become new forces in the municipal 
industrial development. The proportion of output value scored 
by non state-owned industrial enterprises increased from 33.6 
percent in 1992 to 40.7 percent in 1993. In line with the 
demands of markets, the output of some major industrial products 
increased in 1993 and that of some other industrial products 
decreased. 
  The output of major industrial products was as fellow:

  The marketing rate of industrial products clearly 
increased. In 1993, the sales volume of industrial enterprises 
at or above the township level totaled 80.442 billion yuan, up 
by 20.3 percent over 1992; and the marketing rate of the 
products of these enterprises reached 98.99 percent, up by 3.25 
percentage points over 1992. Of this, the marketing rate of 
heavy industrial products was 99.44 percent, up by 2.18 
percentage points over 1992, and that of light industrial 
products was 98.17 percent, up by 4.46 percentage points. 
  Rapid progress was made in developing new products. In 1993, 
industrial enterprises put 1,400 varieties of new products into 
production, and developed 26,400 new patterns and new designs 
for light and textile products, of which, 22,100 were put into 
production. The output value of new products was 7.17 billion 
yuan, up by 38.4 percent over 1992. The rate of output value of 
new products rose from 12 percent in 1992 to 14 percent. 
  The industrial economic efficiency improved somewhat, and 
some results were achieved in the work of halting deficits and 
increasing profits. In 1993, industrial enterprises at or above 
the township level that exercise independent accounting realized 
7.2 billion yuan in profit and tax, up by 21.2 percent, of 
which, 2.49 billion yuan was profit, up by 5.1 percent. The 
state-owned industrial enterprises covered by local budget 
realized 3.388 billion yuan in profit and tax, up by 13.9 
percent over 1992, of which, 1.264 billion yuan was profits, up 
by 0.2 percent. The upward trend of losses sustained by 
enterprises was checked. 
  Construction trade production developed further. In 1993, 
the construction trade fulfilled 2.65 billion yuan in added 
value, up by 11.3 percent over 1992. Economic efficiency of 
construction enterprises picked up in an all-around manner. The 
number of enterprises suffering losses decreased, with the range 
of deficits dropping from 25 percent in 1992 to 17.4 percent, 
and effecting an increase of 148 percent in profits. 
<H5>  3. Domestic Commerce (Goods and Materials) and Market Prices </H5>
  In 1993, along with the development of the socialist market 
economy, the construction pace of the market structure was 
accelerated, the scale of commodity circulation was expanded 
further, the supply of goods was ample, and the marketing of 
goods was brisk. The annual added value of commerce, catering 
service, and goods storage trade was 5.05 billion yuan, up by 
12.8 percent over 1992. The total volume of goods purchased by 
commercial units was 54.922 billion yuan, up by 22.7 percent; 
and the total volume of goods marketed by these units was 54.041 
billion yuan, up by 24.5 percent. 
  The retail market was brisk and stable. The total volume of 
retail sales was 22.772 billion yuan, up by 18.4 percent over 
1992. After deducting the price factor, the actual increase was 
3.6 percent. Of this, the retail volume of consumer goods was 
21.744 billion yuan, up by 20 percent. The consumption 
mentality of residents was relatively stable. Considering the 
marketing of consumer goods of various categories, retail volume 
of food increased by 11.1 percent, that of clothes increased by 
25.4 percent, and that of articles for daily use increased by 
27.2 percent. Consumers continued to favor fine quality, 
brandname, and new but cheap commodities. 
  The means of production market was brisk in both buying and 
selling, and a new breakthrough was made in building the market 
for production elements. In 1993, the total volume of 
commodities purchased by goods supply and marketing enterprises 
was 19.614 billion yuan, up by 35.5 percent over 1992, and the 
total volume of commodities marketed by these enterprises was 
21.032 billion yuan, up by 38.6 percent. A number of large 
wholesale markets, such as the Beiyang rolled steel market, the 
chemical industrial market, the textile raw materials market, 
and the motor market, started business one after another. By 
the end of 1993, there were 28 markets for means of production 
in the municipality, of which, six were state- level markets, 
and four were regional markets. According to the statistics 
compiled from 19 markets for means of production, in 1993, the 
total value of commodities that were put on market for the first 
time was 12.4 billion yuan, the business volume of the 
commodities that were put on market for the first time was 12.1 
billion yuan, and the total trading volume of commodities was 
21.462 billion yuan. Service functions and the service sphere 
were expanded further. 
  Price reform was promoted steadily, and the market role in 
forming prices was notably enhanced. Tianjin's price reform was 
extended fairly greatly in 1993, price control on grain, oil, 
and perishable commodities were lifted, and prices regulated by 
the market were further expanded. 
  Various 1993 price indexes were as follows (when regarding 
those of the preceding year as 100):

<H5>  4. Foreign Economic Relations and Regional Cooperation </H5>
  Tianjin achieved a new breakthrough in opening to the 
outside 
world in 1993, with the areas opened to the outside world 
continuously expanding, the investment climate further 
improving, and an initial pattern of multiform, multi-layered, 
multi-channel, and multi-directional opening to the outside 
world taking shape. 
  Tianjin used more foreign capital and became a hot spot of 
foreign investment. Trans-national companies of the world 
represented by the 10 famous electronic companies, such as 
Motorola Company of the United States, Nippon Electronic Company 
(NEC), and Samsung Corporation of ROK, came to Tianjin to make 
investment one after another, and the countries and regions 
where foreign investors came from increased from some 50 in the 
preceding year to more than 70. In 1993, Tianjin signed 
contracts on establishing 3,538 foreign-funded enterprises of 
the three types, up 110 percent form the preceding year; and the 
foreign investment involved totaled $2.256 billion, up 85 
percent. Both figures exceeded the total amounts of the 
preceding 14 years. Of these foreign-funded enterprises, 2,007 
were invested exclusively by foreign firms, and they involved 
$982 million of foreign investment, up 150 and 59.4 percent, 
respectively. Among the foreign investment projects signed in 
the year, 1,745 were related to the tertiary industry, and the 
contracted amount of foreign investment in these projects 
totaled $1.178 billion, up 190 and 120 times, respectively, from 
the preceding year; and their proportions increased from 35.7 
and 43.5 percent, respectively, in the preceding year to 49.3 
and 52.2 percent, respectively. By the end of 1993, Tianjin had 
signed contracts for 6,136 foreign-funded enterprises of the 
three types, which involved $4.27 billion in foreign investment. 
Tianjin directly used $541 million of foreign capital in 1993, 
up 130 percent. 
  The development zone, bonded zone, and district and county 
small development zones developed more rapidly. In 1993, the 
development zone signed contracts on 909 foreign-funded 
enterprises of the three types, and the contracted amount of 
foreign investment totaled $1.236 billion, up 96.8 and 76.5 
percent, respectively, from the preceding year. The industrial 
output value of the development zone was 7.025 billion yuan in 
the year, and its export $292 million, up 120 and 82.5 percent, 
respectively, from the preceding year. The area of the bonded 
zone was expanded from 1.2 square km to 5 square km. It signed 
contracts on 1,221 foreign-funded enterprises of the three types 
in 1993, foreign investment involved in the contracts was $552 
million, and the goods imported and exported from the zone since 
it was put into operation was valued at $1.06 billion. The 12 
district and county small development zones developed 
vigorously. They signed contracts on 339 foreign-funded 
enterprises of the three types in 1993, and the amount of 
foreign investment involved was $209 million. 
  Further development was made in import and export trade. 
The total value of imports and exports through the Tianjin 
Customs Office in 1993 reached $12.504 billion and showed a 20 
percent increase over 1992. Of the total value, that of imports 
reached $5.901 billion and showed an 18 percent increase over 
1992 while exports reached $6.603 billion and showed a 29 
percent increase over 1992. The role of the municipal harbor 
was further brought into play. The increase scored in the 
municipal exports of foreign trade was somewhat accelerated. 
The annual total value of foreign-trade exports reached $1.928 
billion and showed a 10.9 percent increase over 1992. This has 
been the fastest growth in this regard over the past five years. 
The "three types of foreign- funded enterprises" have become an 
important force in broadening the municipal exports. These 
enterprises exported commodities worth $420 million that showed 
a 90.8 percent increase over 1992. The proportion of their 
exported commodities in foreign trade in the total volume of the 
municipal foreign-trade exports increased from 13.1 percent in 
1992 to 22.5 percent in 1993. 
  Economic and technical cooperation with foreign countries 
achieved obvious progress and development. The municipality 
newly signed contracts worth $190.26 million on construction 
projects and labor cooperation with foreign countries in the 
year. It honored contracts worth $102.449 million that showed 
an 83 percent increase over 1992. 
  The regional economy achieved faster development and the 
economic results scored by setting up economic associations with 
domestic localities and by bringing in foreign funds were 
obvious. The municipality signed contracts for 11,420 projects 
on economic and technical cooperation in the year and honored 
the contracts of 11,357 projects. Of these projects, 827 are 
for economic cooperation in which 10,336 talented personnel were 
exchanged. Fraternal provinces and cities established 478 
offices or economic entities in the municipality in 1993. Thus, 
the municipal radiation network affecting both domestic 
localities and foreign countries was broadened. The total 
investments made in opening business firms, engaging in 
large-scale land development, and building infrastructures in 
the municipality, through the projects of economic associations 
and the introduction of foreign capital, were worth 967 million 
yuan. 
  The international tourism achieved faster development. The 
municipality received 135,000 international tourists in 1993, 
which showed a 23.5 percent increase over 1992. The 
foreign-exchange incomes earned from the tourist business were 
worth 372 million yuan Renminbi and showed a 31.5 percent 
increase over 1992. 
<H5>  5. Communications, Transportation, and Post and </H5>
Telecommunication 
  Along with having accelerated economic development, the 
municipality further achieved development in the undertakings of 
transportation as well as of post and telecommunication. The 
volume of airway transport and harbor loading and unloading 
increased on a large scale. The annual increased value of 
undertakings in transportation as well as in post and 
telecommunication reached 4.26 billion yuan and showed a 14.7 
percent increase over 1992. 
  The volume scored by various transportation means was as

1993 plan of the municipal government were completely realized. 
Thus, the residents' living environment was further improved. 
  Note: 
  1) The added value is the value newly created from the 
production and management activities within a fixed period of 
time by the enterprises, institutions, administrative units, and 
individual managers under various national economic departments. 
  2) The gross domestic product, the added value, and the 
total output value of rural society are calculated according to 
the constant prices, the growth rate, and the comparable prices. 
  3) All statistic figures are preliminary.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by Zhejiang Provincial Bureau of </F>
Statistics on 8 March 1994: "Statistical Report on National 
Economic and Social Development"] 
  [Text] People in Zhejiang achieved noticeable success in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction as well as in 
strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control 
in 1993, thanks to following through with the guidelines 
contained in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and the 
14th National CPC Congress; emancipating their minds; seeking 
truth from facts; and pressing forward with an exploratory 
spirit. People in the province enjoyed fast economic growth, 
social prosperity and progress, political unity and stability, 
and better living standards. According to preliminary 
statistics, the province's gross domestic product [GDP] 
increased 25 percent, reaching 164.5 billion yuan. Of this 
increase, the value of secondary industries increased 38.5 
percent, reaching 97.5 billion yuan; and the value of tertiary 
industries increased 14.4 percent, reaching 39 billion yuan. 
Noteworthy economic problems were the substantial rise in market 
prices; conspicuous shortage of funds; some enterprises' 
inability to withstand changes in the external environment; and 
a fairly weak agricultural foundation as the establishment of 
rural markets failed to keep pace with development. 
1. Agriculture [subhead] 
  Agricultural production went through the severe test of the 
removal of control over grain purchasing and marketing as well 
as grain prices, and the test was used as an opportunity to 
accelerate structural reform. Gratifying results were achieved 
in promoting high output of quality agricultural products 
yielding high returns. In 1993, the value of agricultural 
production increased 39 billion yuan, or 1.9 percent higher than 
that a year before. 
  The mix of agricultural products was readjusted quite 
substantially, and more foodgrain of good quality was produced. 
Of the output of major agricultural products, the output of 
fruits, sugarcane, and tea was higher than that of the preceding 
year. However, because of a relatively weak agricultural 
foundation, the output of grain, cotton, and other major 
agricultural crops declined in one way or another.

  Forestry construction continued. In 1993, 631,000 hectares 
of land was afforested, and the quality of afforestation was 
better. 
  Livestock production was basically stable. The supply of 
meat, poultry, and eggs was basically ensured. But both the 
inventory of pigs and the number of pigs slaughtered declined. 
The output of major livestock products and the number of 
livestock still in inventory by the end of the year is as 
follows: 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Fishery production maintained its good momentum of 
development. The output of aquatic goods reached a higher level. 
The output of aquatic products in 1993 increased 11.5 percent, 
reaching 1.893 million tonnes. Of this output, the output of 
freshwater aquatic goods reached 332,000 tonnes, an increase of 
12.5 percent; and the output of seawater aquatic goods increased 
11.3 percent, reaching 1.561 million tonnes. 
  Conditions for agricultural production were further 
improved to a certain extent. During 1993, 320 million man-days 
were used to build water conservancy works and 270 million cubic 
meters of earth and stone work were completed, a decrease of 6.7 
percent and 8.5 percent respectively, compared with the previous 
year. As of end of 1993, the total power of agricultural 
machinery reached 14.023 million kw, an increase of 3.7 percent 
over the previous year. Total electrical power used in rural 
areas during 1993 was 11.54 billion kwh, an increase of 17.7 
percent over the previous year. The total amount of chemical 
fertilizers (equivalent to pure chemical fertilizers) used in 
1993 was 856,000 tonnes, a decrease of 11.1 percent compared 
with the previous year. The wanton occupation of farmland and 
existence of idle farmland is still quite conspicuous, which is 
unfavorable to the steady growth of agricultural production. 
<H5>  2. Industry and Construction </H5>
  Industrial production increased rapidly. In 1993, the added 
value of industry was 87 billion yuan, up 40 percent over 1992. 
Among all industries, state-owned enterprises increased by 14 
percent; collective enterprises by 49 percent, of which township 
enterprises increased by 52 percent; individual industrial 
enterprises increased by 110 percent; and "joint ventures" 
increased by 89 percent. The growth of large and medium-sized 
enterprises was 25 percent. The growth rate of light industry 
was faster than heavy industry. Among industries at the village 
level and above, the growth of light industry was 35 percent and 
heavy industry 32 percent. 
  In 1993, the whole province implemented the "Regulations on 
Changing the Way State-Owned Industrial Enterprises Operate," 
delegated decisionmaking power to enterprises, achieved a 
breakthrough in ownership system reform, and promoted the 
in-depth development of enterprise reform. The production 
structure of various industries was adjusted. Some 12.4 billion 
yuan was spent on renovating enterprises at the township level 
and above, and some 19,000 new products were developed in 1993.

  Economic returns for enterprises continued to increase. The 
six industrial economic indexes under state evaluation rose from 
103.3 percent in the previous year to 107.9 percent. Of them, 
the sales rate of industrial products increased from 95.68 
percent to 96.01 percent, the profits and tax rates of 
industrial funds increased from 13.24 percent to 13.93 percent, 
the velocity of funds circulating increased from 2.02 times to 
2.14 times, the rate of net industrial output value rose from 
23.5 percent to 25.5 percent, and the full-member labor 
productivity (calculated on the basis of net output value) rose 
from 9,339 yuan to 14,945 yuan per worker. In addition to the 
above five indexes, the rate of new product output value rose 
from 7.8 percent in the previous year to 9.6 percent, and the 
overall energy consumption for every 10,000 yuan of output value 
decreased by 17.6 percent. However, overall industrial economic 
efficiency remained poor, and overstocked products and 
operational losses in some enterprises remained serious 
[sentence as published]. 
  The building industry continued to develop. In 1993, its net 
output value was 10.5 billion yuan, up 27 percent from the 
previous year. The economic efficiency of construction 
engineering enterprises continued to improve. The annual 
full-member labor productivity of state-run and 
urban-collective-run construction engineering enterprises 
(calculated on the basis of net output value) was 7,586 yuan per 
worker, up 41.2 percent from 1992. 
  New achievements were made in geological surveying and 
prospecting. In 1993, the geological and mining department 
completed 195.000 meters in core drilling, and discovered one 
mineral deposit spot with seven different minerals. 
<H5>  3. Investment in Fixed Assets </H5>
  Investment in fixed assets increased by a wide margin. 
Zhejiang's completed investment in fixed assets in 1993 was 60 
billion yuan, an increase of 66.2 percent over 1992. The 
investment of state-owned units was 29.3 billion yuan, up 89 
percent; that of collective units was 21.7 billion yuan, up 76.4 
percent; and individual investment was 9 billion yuan, up 8.4 
percent. Of the investment of state-owned units, capital 
construction investment was 13.15 billion yuan, up 66.3 percent; 
technical updating and transformation investment was 7.25 
billion yuan, up 50.1 percent; commercial housing investment was 
8.31 billion yuan, up 243 percent; and other investment was 640 
million yuan, up 69.1 percent. However, there was a very 
conspicuous contradiction between the scale of construction and 
the supply of construction funds. There were 10,839 capital 
construction projects and technical updating and transformation 
projects by the state-owned units which were under construction 
in 1993, or 2,444 projects more than the year before. These 
10,839 projects had a total investment of 63.1 billion yuan, or 
54.3 percent more than in the previous year. 
  Of the total capital construction and technical updating and 
transformation investment of state-owned units, investment in 
primary industry took 550 million yuan, down 5.4 percent; and 
its share in total investment decreased from 4.5 percent in 1992 
to 2.7 percent. Investment in secondary industry took 9.6 
billion yuan, up 33.1 percent; its share in total investment 
decreased from 56.6 percent in the previous year to 47.1 
percent; and a breakdown shows that the share of investment in 
energy and raw and processed materials industry decreased from 
29.3 percent to 21.5 percent. Investment in tertiary industry 
took 10.25 billion yuan, up 107.3 percent; its share rose from 
38.9 percent to 50.2 percent; and a breakdown shows that the 
investment in transport, post and telecommunications was 3.8 
billion yuan, up 136.8 percent, and its share rose from 12.6 
percent to 18.6 percent. 
  The building of key construction projects proceeded 
smoothly. 
In 1993, an investment of 4.09 billion yuan was put into 38 
state and provincial key construction projects and 97.4 percent 
of the annual investment plan was fulfilled. The 125,000-kw 
generator set at the Xiaoshan power plant, the main structure of 
Nantaitou sluice gate on the Hangjia Hu, and 10 other key 
construction projects were completed and put into operation. 
The construction of some other key construction projects was in 
full swing. They included the Jinhua-Wenzhou Railroad, the 
Hangzhou-Ningbo express highway, and the Beicang mineral ores 
dock. 
  The state-owned units completed and put into operation a 
total of 2,760 capital construction projects in 1993, including 
six large and medium projects and 1,451 technical updating and 
transformation projects. In 1993, the newly-increased fixed 
assets amounted to 11.27 billion yuan, up 38.9 percent from 
1992; the completed buildings and housing projects totalled 13.6 
million square meters in floor space, up 53.4 percent; and the 
housing projects alone were 7.97 million square meters, up 89.1 
percent. 
  4. Transport, Post and Telecommunications 
  The development of transport, post and telecommunications 
services was accelerated. Zhejiang's investment in transport 
was the largest in 1993, with investment made by state-owned 
units alone exceeding 2.5 billion yuan. A large number of key 
transport projects were either successively completed or under 
construction, and the completed projects have played a positive 
role in alleviating the strained transport situation in some 
areas. The net output value of transport, post and 
telecommunications services in 1993 was 6.8 billion yuan, up 
17.5 percent from the previous year. However, there were still 
serious bottlenecks in transport, post and telecommunications. 
  The volume of transportation by various means was as 
follows: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|Volume of Transportation                                                     |

  Business transactions of post and telecommunications service 
in 1993 totalled 2.75 billion yuan, up 65.9 percent over 1992. 
Telephone subscribers at the end of 1993 reached 1,129,000, up 
59.4 percent. Of the total, urban subscribers totalled 782,000, 
up 60.9 percent; and rural subscribers totalled 347,000, up 56.1 
percent. At the end of the year, there were 32,000 cellular 
phone subscribers, up 430 percent; and the volume of beeper 
service rose 200 percent. Program-controlled telephones 
accounted for 98.6 percent of the total in 1993, while they 
accounted for 76 percent in 1992. 
<H5>  5. Domestic Trade, Supply and Marketing of Materials </H5>
  Both urban and rural markets were brisk. The total value of 
retail sales was 75.87 billion yuan, up 33.2 percent over 1992 
(after adjustment for inflation, the actual increase was 14.1 
percent). The retail sales of consumer goods were 67.84 billion 
yuan, up 37.4 percent, of which 33.28 billion yuan worth of 
commodities were sold in urban areas and 34.56 in rural areas, 
up 44.5 percent and 31.1 percent respectively. In terms of 
economic sectors, the total retail sales of the state-owned 
retail units were 25.58 billion yuan, up 30.9 percent; those of 
the collective units were 18.38 billion yuan, up 14.9 percent; 
those of individual units were 21.32 billion yuan, up 50.6 
percent; sales by farmers to non- agricultural residents were 
10.07 billion yuan, up 47 percent; and the transactions at urban 
and rural market fairs totalled 65.1 billion yuan, up 103 
percent. 
  The sales of almost all consumer goods increased. The sales 
of food items rose 37.2 percent; clothing, 42.2 percent; and 
items for household use, 35.6 percent. 
  The reform of commercial enterprises was deepened and the 
economic efficiency of commerce was enhanced. In 1993, the 
profit delivery and tax payments made to the state by 
enterprises under the provincial department of commerce and 
supply and marketing cooperatives in the province totalled 1.696 
billion yuan, up 73.9 percent from 1992. 
  The market for the means of production turned from brisk to 
sluggish. In 1993, supply and marketing cooperatives at and 
above the county level bought 79.4 billion yuan worth of means 
of production, up 49.1 percent; and sold 85.37 billion yuan 
worth of them, up 52.6 percent (after adjustment for inflation, 
the actual capital goods increase was 19.9 percent). However, 
the annual retail sales of means of production were 8.03 billion 
yuan; and after adjustment for inflation, the sales actually 
registered a 6.4 percent decrease. 
  A larger step was made in the reform of the pricing system. 
In 1993, the province decontrolled the prices of grain and 
cotton, and readjusted the prices of some basic products, 
housing rents, and travel expenses. New steps were taken in the 
reforms of the housing system and public medical care system. 
The prices of industrial products under the provincial 
authorities' control were basically decontrolled. The ratio of 
market-regulated prices further increased, rising to around 90 
percent in the total sales of means of production and around 95 
percent in total retail sales. 
  On the whole, market prices rose by a wide margin, 
especially the living costs of urban dwellers, and the prices of 
certain capital goods and services. 
  The range of various price increases in 1993 (percentage):

<H5>  6. Economic Relations With Foreign Countries </H5>
  Import and export volumes expanded. According to custom's 
office statistics, in 1993 total exports increased 21.1 percent 
over the preceding year, reaching $4.32 billion; and the year's 
total imports increased 68.8 percent, reaching $2.41 billion. 
The mix of both imported and exported goods continued to 
improve. Of the goods exported by foreign trade departments, 
the percentage of machinery and electronics goods rose from 14.9 
percent in 1992 to 16.4 percent in 1993. Of the total exports, 
the exports of foreign-invested enterprises increased 64.5 
percent, reaching $850 million. The percentage it accounted for 
in the total exports rose to 19.2 percent from 14 percent a year 
ago. The amount of foreign exchange incomes from businesses 
other than trade was $100 million, a decline of 1.9 percent. 
  The amount of foreign capital used increased rapidly. In 
1993, the establishment of 4,487 new foreign-funded enterprises 
was approved, which was a 91.9 percent growth from that a year 
ago; new agreements on using $4.04 billion -- an increase of 
24.6 percent -- were signed; and $1.21 billion -- an increase of 
197 percent -- was actually used. Of the amounts of money 
agreed to be used, $3.75 billion was foreign businessmen's 
direct investments, and $1.03 billion was actual investment. 
They represented a growth of 28.8 percent and 251 percent, 
respectively. 
  Economic and technical cooperation with foreign countries 
continued to develop. In 1993 a total of 453 new contracts on 
construction projects and labor services were signed with 
foreign countries. These contracts involved $80 million, an 
increase of 34.1 percent over a year ago; and turnover increased 
28.2 percent, reaching $38.7 million. 
  International tourism developed steadily. In 1993, the 
province received 728,000 foreign tourists, an increase of 2.5 
percent over 1992; and the amount of foreign exchange income 
from tourism increased 14.4 percent, reaching $120 million. 
<H5>  7. Banking and Insurance Businesses </H5>
  In 1993, earnestly following through with the central 
authorities' guideline of strengthening and improving 
macroeconomic regulation and control, Zhejiang put banking 
operations in order and concentrated its resources to ensure the 
needs of priority projects, thus providing the support the 
province needed for achieving sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. By the end of the year, the amount of 
bank savings increased 18.87 billion yuan over that a year ago. 
Of this amount, savings by enterprises increased 5.13 billion 
yuan, savings by urban and rural dwellers reached 66.46 billion 
yuan, topping that of a year ago by 15.01 billion, or 22.6 
percent. The balance of bank loans increased 16.66 billion from 
that registered at the end of 1992, including 11.16 billion yuan 
for circulating funds and 3.21 billion yuan for fixed assets. 
  Further development was made in the insurance service. Last 
year 53,000 enterprises participated in enterprise property 
insurance programs, 5.626 million households participated in 
household property insurance programs, and 11 million people in 
life insurance programs. Insurance companies handled 224,000 
cases of claims on domestic property loss and paid an indemnity 
of 1.29 billion yuan for settled cases. Another 460 million 
yuan was paid to 306,000 people as reparations in life insurance 
programs. 
<H5>  8. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sport </H5>
  The ranks of scientific and technical personnel further 
expanded. There were 731,000 professionals and technicians of 
all specializations working in state-owned enterprises and 
institutions by the end of 1993, up 3.4 percent over the figure 
at the end of 1992. There were 163 state-owned independent 
research and development institutions, with another 43 research 
institutions affiliated to universities and 460 research 
institutions under large and medium industrial enterprises. A 
total of 213,000 people were engaged in scientific and 
technological work. 
  Financial input into scientific and technological activities 
increased. The expenditure of research institutions, 
universities, and large and medium industrial enterprises on 
scientific and technological activities in 1993 was 1.54 billion 
yuan, up 14.4 percent, of which expenses on research and 
development took up 400 million yuan, representing a growth of 
21.2 percent. 
  Vigorous development was scored in science and technology. 
The province gained 876 scientific results, which were 
appraised and approved by the Provincial Science and Technology 
Commission. Of these results, one received the state natural 
science prize; 14, the state science and technology progress 
prize; four, the state invention prize; and six, the state Spark 
Prize. The provincial science and technology progress prize 
went to 279; and the provincial Spark Prize, to 49. The patent 
offices in Zhejiang received 3,343 patent applications, and 
2,946 applications were approved, up by 4.7 percent and 86.8 
percent respectively. 
  Further development was made in cartography, quality 
inspection, standardization, and weather forecasts. In 1993, 
surveying and mapping departments prepared 13,000 maps of 
varying scales; and at the end of the year, there were 100 
institutions responsible for the inspection and supervision of 
the quality of manufactured products. A total of 152 provincial 
public standards in 44 items and 10 categories were formulated 
or amended, and 64 super-shortwave transmitting stations in the 
weather warning and service system and one weather forecast and 
calling station were established. 
  Markets for the transfer of technology became more active. 
During 1993, some 16,000 contracts on the transfer of technology 
were signed, involving a transaction value of 715 million yuan, 
up by 24.5 percent and 131.9 percent respectively as compared 
with those in the previous year. 
  Continued progress was made in educational undertakings. 
Institutions of higher learning enrolled 1,375 new post-graduate 
students and 27,700 new undergraduate students, up 35.5 percent 
and 30.6 percent, respectively. Secondary specialized schools 
enrolled 35,900 new students, up 32.1 percent from the previous 
year. A total of 796 post-graduate students and 16,000 
undergraduate students were graduated from, and 73,600 students 
were enrolled in institutions of higher learning; 22,800 
students were graduated and 84,800 students were enrolled in 
secondary specialized schools. 
  Basic education was further strengthened, and secondary 
vocational and technical education continued to develop. The 
nine- year compulsory education program was implemented on a 
total of 35.62 million population in 1,377 towns and townships; 
and 17 counties and cities passed the first provincial 
acceptance test for implementation of the nine-year compulsory 
education program and elimination of illiteracy among young and 
middle-aged people. The enrollment rate of primary-school-age 
children was 99.5 percent and their attendance rate was 99.6 
percent; and, 92.4 percent of primary school graduates continued 
their study in secondary schools, as compared with 91.7 percent 
in the previous year. The drop-out rates for students in junior 
secondary schools and in primary schools was 5.3 percent and 0.4 
percent, respectively. There were 240,000 students studying in 
secondary vocational and technical schools at the end of 1993 
(including 32,000 students in technical workers' training 
schools), accounting for 51.4 percent of the total student 
enrollment at senior secondary school level. 
  Adult education developed rapidly. In 1993, institutions 
of adult higher education took in 15,500 new students of both 
regular and specialized courses, up 74.6 percent from 1992; and 
10,100 students graduated from them in the same year. There 
were 26,200 students in adult secondary specialized schools, up 
51.1 percent; and 13,000 students graduated from them in the 
same year. In addition, there were 1,283,000 students in adult 
technical training schools. In 1993, 90,000 illiterate people 
became literate. 
  Cultural undertakings developed steadily. In 1993, Zhejiang 
produced one feature movie and 20 short films, distributed 194 
new, feature length movies, and produced 28 television dramas 
with a total of 173 episodes. By the end of 1993, there were 89 
artistic groups, 12 art galleries, 84 cultural centers, 81 
public libraries, 58 museums, 111 archives, 3,600 
film-projection units of various types, 28 radio broadcasting 
stations, and 55 television stations at the county level and 
above. A satellite-relay station for television programs was 
completed and put into operation, making Zhejiang's television 
programs cover 41 countries and regions. In 1993, Zhejiang 
published 905 million copies of newspapers, 58 million copies of 
magazines, and 220 million copies of books, maps, and charts. 
  The year 1993 saw continued development of public health 
undertakings. By the end of 1993, there were 6,796 medical 
facilities with a total of 104,000 hospital beds, up 2.3 percent 
over the end of the previous year; 140,000 full-time health 
workers, up 1.1 percent, of whom 61,000 were doctors, up 0.6 
percent; and 31,000 nurses, up 2.7 percent. Some headway was 
made in sports. Last year Zhejiang athletes won 60 gold medals 
in major domestic and international competition (including 8 
world champions, 10 Asian champions, and 5 world youth 
champions). The "National Standards for Physical Exercises" 
were practiced in 94 percent of schools in the province and 91.2 
percent of students were rated as up to standard. 
<H5>  9. Population and Standard of Living </H5>
  According to a sample survey of population changes, the 1993 
birth rate for Zhejiang was 13.61 per thousand, and the death 
rate was 6.58 per thousand, resulting in a natural growth rate 
of 7.03 per thousand. The total population was 43.35 million 
(42.66 million being permanent residents) by the end of 1993, or 
310,000 more than at the end of 1992. 
  The residents' income increased rapidly. Data from sample 
surveys showed per-capita cash income of urban residents that 
could be used for living expenses was 3,371 yuan, up 39.6 
percent over the previous year, or a real growth of 15 percent 
if increases in prices were excluded. The per-capita net income 
of rural residents was 1,746 yuan, up 28.5 percent, or a real 
growth of 10.3 percent if increases of commodity prices were 
excluded. However, the income differences between regions and 
between different trades and professions widened, and the living 
standards of a small number of residents became lower. 
  Reforms in the field of labor were accelerated, and the 
employment service system further developed. By the end of 
1993, there were 631 employment agencies in the province; 53,000 
people were given jobs in cities and towns; and the unemployment 
rate was 2.6 percent. By the end of the year, staff and workers 
in Zhejiang numbered 4.957 million, or 43,000 persons more than 
at the end of 1992. Of this total, the number of workers 
employed on a contract basis was 1.1 million, or 12.7 percent 
more than the previous year. There were 520,000 individual 
workers and private enterprise employees in urban areas, up 35.8 
percent. Social security coverage continued to expand. By the 
end of the year, 3.5 million workers and staff members and 
retired personnel were under coverage. 
  Wages for workers and staff members increased further. The 
total wage bill for staff and workers in 1993 was 17.74 billion 
yuan, up 28.5 percent; the per-capita wage was 3,360 yuan, an 
increase of 26.9 percent 
  Urban and rural living conditions further improved. By the 
end of 1993, the per-capita floor space for urban residents was 
10.52 square meters, up 2.6 percent; while that for rural 
residents was 32.62 square meters, up 4.1 percent. 
  Social welfare work continued to develop. At the end of 
1993, there were 24,000 beds in 1,353 social welfare 
institutions in Zhejiang, with 19,000 clients. A total of 
179,000 people in need received relief aid from the state. 
  Environmental protection undertakings continued to develop. 
By the end of 1993, there were 2,600 staff members in the 
environmental protection department, and 89 environmental 
protection monitoring stations. In the year, the province 
completed 504 environmental pollution control projects, with a 
total investment of 65.9 million yuan; and established 68 urban 
smoke and dust control zones and 34 noise control zones, with 
total areas of 443 and 52 square km respectively.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji respectively met 
visiting French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and exchanged 
views with him on promoting Sino-French relations here this 
afternoon. 
  Jiang emphasized that it is very important to maintain a 
sound cooperative relation between China and France in a complex 
and volatile world. 
  Zhu said it takes time and energy to restore and improve 
Sino-French trade and economic relations. He believes they will 
grow quickly through joint efforts. 
  Balladur said the two countries have identical or similar 
views in many fields, and there is a large room to improve 
bilateral ties. 
  Jiang hailed the normalization of Sino-French relations, and 
appreciated Balladur's efforts in restoring and improving 
bilateral ties after he took office. 
  Jiang believed that Balladur's current tour will lead to 
further development of Sino-French relations. 
  Jiang said China and France, with long history and splendid 
cultures, have contributed greatly to the world civilizations, 
and the two peoples enjoy traditional friendship and friendly 
cooperations. 
  Jiang said since China and France established diplomatic 
ties 
some 30 years ago, effective cooperation in the fields of 
politics, economy and trade, science and technology and culture 
have been conducted, despite the difficulties and bumps facing 
the two countries. 
  "We consider it very wise and foresighted decision made by 
late Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and General de 
Gaulle to cement diplomatic ties when looking back the 
development of Sino-French relations," Jiang said. [sentence as 
received] 
  He emphasized that as permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, China and France should contribute more to safeguarding 
world peace and security, he said. 
  China and France have good basis of cooperation given that 
they have no fundamental interests conflicts while holding 
identical or similar views on many major international issues, 
he said. [sentence as received] 
  The two countries are complementary economically, which 
provide good conditions for trade and economic cooperation, 
Jiang said, adding that he believe Sino-French trade and 
economic cooperation will rise to a new height and a lot more 
concerned will be done once a favourable political atmosphere is 
created and bilateral political relations improved. 
  Balladur extended President Mitterrand's greetings to Jiang 
and invited him to visit France on behalf of Mitterrand. 
  Balladur said Mitterrand looked forward to further 
development of France-China relations. 
  Jiang thanked for the invitation and asked Balladur to 
convey 
his greetings to Mitterrand. 
  In another meeting, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji told Balladur 
that China appreciates his speech in Paris that France-China 
relations have entered a new phase. 
  Zhu added that China is willing to exert efforts to develop 
its relations with France. 
  Balladur said his talks with Premier Li Peng yesterday 
indicated that France and China share many identical or similar 
views, there is a great potential for improvement of bilateral 
cooperation. 
  Zhu and Balladur exchanged views on how to develop 
Sino-French trade and economic relations in a sincere and 
friendly atmosphere. 
  He also briefed the guest on China's reform and opening-up. 
  Among those present at the meeting were chairman of the 
Chinese Government Reception Committee and Minister of Power 
Industry Shi Dazhen, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and 
Minister of Industry, Posts, Telecommunications and Foreign 
Trade Gerard Longuet. 
  Besides meeting with Chinese leaders, the French Prime 
Minister visited Beijing Zhong-Pu Electro Refractory Co., Ltd. 
and the Forbidden City this morning. 
  Zhong-Pu is the first joint venture in the Chinese electro 
refractory industry, co-sponsored by the original Beijing Glass 
Refractory Factory and S.E.P.R., a French company taking a 
leading position in the electro fused industry world-wide. 
  Balladur expressed his admiration when seeing the 
well-preserved Forbidden City, saying "Chinese, like other 
peoples in the world, have bestowed new vitality on history." 
  Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress, today met and hosted a banquet for 
the two vice-presidents of France's National Assembly, Gilles de 
Robien and Pierre-Andre Wiltzer, accompanying Balladur to China.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur today expressed his hope that France-China 
relations will be further strengthened. 
  Speaking at a press conference here this evening, the prime 
minister said that during his stay in Beijing, he had met with 
Chinese leaders and during the meetings they all expressed their 
satisfactions over the current Sino-French relations. They 
pledged to conduct more political dialogues and establish closer 
relations of cooperation in economy, science and technology 
between the two countries, Balladur said. 
  He said that France will pay close attention to the economic 
development in the Asian region, and enhance its exchanges with 
Asian countries, especially with China. 
  Since both France and China are nuclear powers and permanent 
members of the U.N. Security Council, Balladur noted, they 
should play a more important role in international affairs to 
safeguard world peace. 
  He said that he had in-depth discussions with the Chinese 
leaders on world political situation and the Asia-Pacific region 
in particular. In the discussions, he said, both he and the 
Chinese leaders hoped that France and China would cooperate more 
closely in world affairs. 
  Now the opportunities for the two countries to establish 
closer cooperation in economic and other fields are ripe, he 
said, adding that the two should grasp them with joint efforts. 
  On issues of China's re-entry in GATT, Balladur said that 
China was a signatory party in GATT and now it is playing a more 
and more important role in the world trade. Therefore, he said, 
its request for the restoration of its status of a signatory 
party in the organization is quite logical and reasonable. 
  Answering questions concerning the human rights issue, 
Balladur said that France attaches importance to the issue, 
adding that it holds that specific conditions of each nation 
should be taken into consideration. 
  Balladur and his party are scheduled to leave here for 
Shanghai tomorrow.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (AFP)--French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur said Friday discretion was more effective than 
publicity in promoting human rights and refused any comment on 
the second detention within a week of a leading Chinese 
dissident. 
  "In this matter, discretion is a more effective approach 
than 
publicity," the prime minister told a press conference at the 
end of a two-day stay in Beijing. 
  Balladur repeatedly declined to provide any details of a 
20-minute closed-door meeting on human rights with his Chinese 
counterpart Li Peng and their respective foreign ministers, 
stressing that he had "said in private all that I had to say." 
  "I said it in private because I thought it was more useful," 
he added. His remarks followed the detention Friday of leading 
dissident Xu Wenli and the arrest one week ago of China's most 
celebrated pro-democracy activist Wei Jingsheng. 
  Xu's detention was particularly embarrassing to the French 
government, given the dissident's known interest in France, 
especially its revolutionary history. 
  Balladur, on the first official visit here by a French 
premier in 16 years, refused to say if he had discussed Wei's 
detention or handed a list of dissidents to the Chinese 
authorities. He also confirmed that he had handed a letter to 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin from his French counterpart 
Francois Mitterrand, inviting him to visit France. However, in 
an apparent departure from usual protocol, no invitation was 
extended to Li Peng.

Chinese side to make explanations at once. 
  Besides, the reporter said, French Foreign Minister Alain 
Juppe had asked the Chinese side to explain the actions before

  [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (AFP)--France on Saturday called 
for an "explanation" from China after the arrest of another 
Chinese dissident as French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur 
arrived in Shanghai on an official visit. 
  Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told journalists that the 
request had been decided after the arrest Friday evening of 
dissident Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Shanghai-based 
Chinese Human Rights Association. 
  "This is now rather a lot, and we are starting not to 
appreciate it," Juppe said. "We have asked for an explanation, 
and we are awaiting a reply." 
  Only hours after Wang's arrest, another leading dissident, 
Bao Ge, was picked up by police in Shanghai, a dissident source 
said. Bao was the fifth pro-democracy campaigner to be detained 
in China in eight days. 
  Balladur told journalists that he may make a public 
statement 
on the wave of arrests later Saturday.

  [Text] After the arrest of two dissidents in Beijing, there 
have been reports that two more dissidents were arrested in 
Shanghai just before the arrival in town of the French prime 
minister. The French delegation immediately demanded 
explanations from the Chinese authorities, only to be told that 
these arrests had not taken place. Here is the reaction of 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe: 
  [Begin Juppe recording] We demanded an explanation, and that 
explanation was given to us by the minister who is accompanying 
Mr. Balladur, by the deputy mayor of Shanghai, and by the 
Chinese ambassador in France, who all formally told us that no 
dissidents had been arrested in Shanghai in the last few hours. 
This is what was told to us by official sources. We have taken 
note. [end recording] 
  Things are not, however, as simple as that. Journalists 
pressed Juppe to comment on the fact that the dissidents' 
families had said they had been arrested, but at this point the 
prime minister himself stepped in to put an end to the 
conversation: 
  [Begin recording] [Balladur] To convince you once and for 
all, I would advise you to get in touch with the Chinese 
ambassador in Paris, and if perchance he should say the same 
thing as the French foreign minister, then you will be perfectly 
informed and reassured. I hope so at least. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Are you convinced by their 
explanations? 
  [Balladur] Yes. 
  [Correspondent] Is that a diplomatic yes? 
  [Balladur] Those are your words. Why do you ask? How would 
you describe your lack of conviction? [end recording] 
  What has happened exactly? The Chinese authorities deny that 
there were any arrests. We spoke, however, to the father of Bao 
Ge [not further identified by name], who insisted that his son 
was arrested in Shanghai: 
  [Begin recording] [Bao Ge's father, in Chinese with 
superimposed French translation] He was taken away this morning 
at 0900 by eight policemen, and he has still not come back to 
his home in Shanghai. [end recording] 
  That interview was carried out by our Chinese service.

<F P=106> [Caroline Puel report: "Balladur Touches on Human Rights in </F>
Beijing"] 
  [Text] Beijing -- A hint of malaise went through the 
French delegation when Tienanmen Square resounded to the 19-gun 
salute against the background of the Marseillaise and then the 
Chinese national anthem. Standing in a brisk wind alongside 
Prime Minister Li Peng, Edouard Balladur had time to contemplate 
the historic esplanade of Beijing which was deserted. He 
probably thought about the cynicism of realpolitik which meant 
that, less than five years after the repression of the Chinese 
democratic movement, firmly condemned at the time by France, he 
was standing next to Li Peng, who is held responsible for the 
massacre of hundreds of Beijing's citizens on this same 
Tienanmen Square. This was one of the prices to be paid for 
this four-day visit by the French Government chief to China, 
which enabled the Chinese television commentator to stress 
yesterday evening that "relations between France and China have 
entered a phase of complete normalization," expressing the hope 
that these relations "will be stabilized in a long-term view." 
  The element which would have made it possible to finally 
close the Tienanmen chapter -- an invitation to Li Peng to visit 
France, for which the Chinese were hoping -- did not come. "We 
did not specifically discuss that question," Chinese spokesman 
Wu Jianmin said, although he pointed out that "the two countries 
decided to step up the rate of high-level visits." Indeed, the 
French Government does not want the Chinese prime minister to 
make an official visit during the presidential campaign and 
hopes to find a diplomatic means of inviting President Jiang 
Zemin instead or at least of only issuing the Chinese with an 
invitation in theory, without any specific name or date. 
  The question of human rights in China and Tibet was 
nonetheless the subject of a "select committee" meeting, at 
French initiative, which brought together Li Peng and Edouard 
Balladur, and Qian Qichen and Alain Juppe, the two foreign 
ministers. No detail had filtered through yesterday evening on 
this four-man meeting, which lasted around 20 minutes at the end 
of the general meeting, which had been attended by around 30 
participants. In particular, it was impossible to ascertain 
whether or not Edouard Balladur handed over a list of political 
prisoners and raised the case of Wei Jingsheng, the main Chinese 
dissident who was again arrested on Tuesday. 
  Wei had been released last September after spending more 
than 
14 years in Chinese prisons for having called for democracy back 
in 1979. Four Nobel Prize winners and around 40 prominent 
French people asked Edouard Balladur to intervene on the 
dissident's behalf. Yesterday, the Chinese spokesman described 
Wei Jingsheng as a "fringe element, cut off from the real 
Chinese situation," and expressed appreciation of the fact that 
"France does not intend to interfere in Chinese internal 
affairs" -- the customary expression when human rights is under 
discussion. 
  During the general meeting which took place "in a very 
constructive atmosphere," to cite French spokesman Bernard 
Brigouleix, the two sides discussed economic questions more than 
expected. Li Peng accepted the idea that the French presence in 
Canton "should be strengthened" in a form yet to be defined. 
The Chinese authorities had ordered the closure of the French 
consulate in Canton in January 1993, thus punishing Paris 
following the sale of French fighter planes to Taiwan. China 
also announced that the second phase of work on the Daya Bay 
nuclear power station will be carried out "in cooperation with 
France." Purchases of wheat, a dam on the Yellow River, and 
projects in the energy sphere (especially oil) and 
telecommunications sphere were also mentioned. 
  Other projects were to be discussed by French Trade Minister 
Gerard Longuet who is due to return to Beijing before the summer 
at the head of a large delegation of industrialists, the two 
sides announced. "French enterprises are not competitive with 
regard to prices or quality," the Chinese spokesman nonetheless 
said in a statement reported by Beijing television. This remark 
stresses that the "success" of the visit is not yet certain, 
notably because of France's failure to issue an invitation to Li 
Peng.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Chen Jiaying (7115 1367 3841)] </F>
  [Text] Lisbon, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- When interviewed by 
XINHUA on the eve of his visit to China, Portugal's Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva stressed that the Portuguese Government 
hopes relations with China can develop further in all areas. 
  The Portuguese prime minister said his trip to China has two 
major purposes: namely, promoting the development of bilateral 
relations, including economic relations, and commemorating the 
seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint 
Declaration on the Macao issue. 
  Silva indicated that one priority of Portugal's foreign 
policy is to develop relations with China. He said the Chinese 
Government also attaches great importance to developing 
relations with Portugal; this can be proved by Premier Li Peng's 
visit to Lisbon in 1992 and President Jiang Zemin and Vice 
President Rong Yiren's visits in 1993. 
  Silva maintained that China, being a major country in the 
Far 
East and the world, deserves full access to worldwide economic, 
political, and cultural relations. He said China has achieved 
tremendous success in economic development, reform, and opening 
up; China's impressive economic growth will help the merger of 
China and the world's economies. 
  As regards bilateral relations, Silva said the fact that 60 
Portuguese entrepreneurs will join him in visiting China shows 
that Portugal hopes to expand the two countries' trade volume 
and develop cooperation between Portuguese and Chinese 
enterprises in making direct investments and establishing joint 
ventures. He indicated the future is extremely favorable for 
Portugal and China to develop economic and trade relations, and 
the two countries can develop cooperation in telecommunications, 
banking, infrastructure, and other areas. This should be a new 
way for promoting the development of the two countries' economic 
relations, he stated. 
  On the Macao issue, Silva stressed that the signing by 
himself and the Chinese premier in April 1987 of the Joint 
Declaration by the Chinese and Portuguese Governments on the 
Macao issue was an important historical event because a 
historical problem was resolved as a result of the declaration. 
He said that, regarding the Macao issue, the Portuguese 
Government has three basic objectives to achieve: stability, 
progress, and building confidence in the future. He said: "The 
operations of the Portuguese-Chinese Liaison Group are 
proceeding normally. The second half of Macao's transitional 
period will be a smooth one." 
  Commenting on international issues, the Portuguese prime 
minister said the Asia-Pacific region--particularly China--has 
become a world center enjoying high economic growth, and the 
gradual integration of Asia-Pacific economies has intensified 
these countries' extraordinary development. The development of 
economic and trade relations between the European Union and 
Asia-Pacific countries will be beneficial to both sides. 
  Silva pointed out that although the European Union has 
encountered certain problems and obstacles in its construction, 
it still has achieved significant progress. He expects the 
economy of West Europe will be able to begin a new cycle of 
growth by the end of this year. 
  In conclusion, Prime Minister Silva stressed that Portugal 
attaches great importance to problems between the north and 
south, and that Portugal has constantly reminded European 
countries not to forget the south.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and 
visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said that 
their governments will pursue more effective cooperation for a 
smooth transition of Macao and for its stability and development. 
  The two leaders made the pledge at a ceremony marking the 
seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint 
Declaration on Macao here today. 
  They agreed that the declaration is "a historic document 
with 
far-reaching significance." 
  Li noted that Silva's visit, which began yesterday, bears a 
special significance as it coincides with the seventh 
anniversary of the joint declaration. 
  He continued that the declaration has set an example for 
other countries in settling problems left behind by history. 
  Over the past seven years, he said, China and Portugual have 
enjoyed very good cooperation, particularly on the question of 
Macao, as both sides have implemented the joint declaration 
earnestly. 
  As a result, Macao enjoys social stability and economic 
growth with its residents living a peaceful and happy life, Li 
added. 
  He stressed that China and Portugal share the common goal 
and 
common interests in ensuring Macao's smooth transition, 
stability and development. 
  Li expressed the conviction that with continued joint 
efforts 
and more effective cooperation, Macao's smooth transition and 
power transfer will be realized. 
  Prime Minister Silva said that the joint declaration he 
signed seven years ago together with his Chinese counterpart 
accords with the two sides' common desire of resolving the Macao 
question through frank, sincere and friendly dialogue between 
the two governments. 
  Such a spirit still works today and will be carried forward 
by the two governments, he said. 
  He continued that the ways and means for the settlement of 
the Macao issue enshrined in the joint declaration have two 
objectives: to ensure Macao's stability and economic and social 
progress as well as its residents' confidence in the future, and 
to boost Portugual-China relations from a new angle. 
  The reason for the two sides to mark the seventh anniversary 
of the joint declaration lies in the fact that the declaration 
has been implemented smoothly, he said. 
  He reaffirmed that the Portuguese Government will earnestly 
implement the stipulations of the joint declaration so as to 
ensure Macao's stability and progress and to maintain the 
residents' way of life and the special features of their culture 
after 1999. 
  He expressed the conviction that portugal and China will 
fulfill their historical obligations and make stronger the link 
between the two peoples by way of ensuring Macao's stability, 
especially as Macao is the strongest point of the link. 
  Prior to the ceremony, Premier Li Peng presided over a 
welcoming ceremony in honor of Prime Minister Silva.

<F P=106> [XINHUA "Roundup": "Fruitful Sino-Portuguese Cooperation"] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, April 10 (XINHUA) -- The China visit by 
Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva will give a new 
impetus to existing fruitful cooperation between the two 
countries, official sources said here today. 
  Silva, who signed the historic China-Portugal Joint 
Declaration on the question of Macao during his first visit to 
China seven years ago, arrived here by air this morning on a 
week-long official visit to China at the invitation of Chinese 
Premier Li Peng. 
  The sources described Silva's visit as "a major event in the 
history of Sino-Portuguese relations." 
  China and Portugal are far apart geographically, but 
friendship brings them closer. Since the two countries 
established diplomatic ties 15 years ago, contacts between the 
countries' high-ranking officials have been increasing 
noticeably. 
  Foreign ministers of the two countries exchanged visits 
while 
Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Vice 
President Rong Yiren paid visits to Portugal on separate 
occasions. 
  This has not only promoted mutual understanding, but also 
pushed forward bilateral ties in every field. 
  With concerted efforts and friendly consultations, the 
question of Macao left behind by history is being properly 
settled. 
  The two governments formally signed a joint declaration on 
the question of Macao on April 13, 1987 after four rounds of 
talks over nine months. 
  The two sides confirmed that China will resume its exercise 
of sovereignty over Macao from December 20, 1999. 
  Since the Joint Declaration was signed, the two governments 
have conducted good cooperation with fruitful results. 
  The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has convened 
nineteen 
meetings at which the three major questions in the transitional 
period of Macao, namely the localization of public servants, law 
and official institution of the Chinese language, have been 
discussed in depth. 
  The two foreign ministers reached a consensus in February 
1991 that the Chinese and Portuguese languages share the same 
status in Macao and that Portuguese will also be an official 
language after 1999. 
  In December of 1991, the Portuguese side finished 
legislative 
procedure on the above-mentioned issue. Progress has also been 
made in localization of public servants and laws. 
  Both China and Portugal have taken a sincere and friendly 
cooperative attitude toward the question of Macao, which has 
given rise to a good environment for Macao's social stability, 
economic development and residents living and working in peace 
and contentment. 
  Last year, the two countries successfully settled the issue 
of financing the Macao International Airport and the model for 
aviation agreement. 
  Now the Macao International Airport, with a total investment 
of 7.3 billion patacas, is under construction. The principal 
part of the airport lounge and runway have been built. It is 
expected that the project will be completed in July next year. 
  In addition, the second largest bridge in Macao has been 
erected and three advanced refuse burners with a total 
investment of 600 million patacas newly built in the region. 
  The prime minister will take part in a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony for the bridge in Macao after his visit to China. 
  Over the past few years, trade between the two countries has 
risen by a big margin. Statistics show that the volume of trade 
between the two countries last year amounted to 110 million U.S. 
dollars, a 64.4 percent increase over 1992, hitting an all-time 
high. 
  In March this year, the two sides signed a contract on the 
joint investment of a winery with an annual output of 4,500 tons 
in north China's Hebei Province. Seventy percent of the wine 
will be exported. 
  In addition, the two countries also signed agreements on 
economic, industrial and technical cooperation and on the 
protection of investment. 
  In March last year, the Portuguese Minister of Trade and 
Tourism Fernando Faria de Oliveira headed a delegation composed 
of industrialists and businessmen to visit China. In September 
of that year, the mixed Committee for Economic Cooperation and 
Trade between the two countries held a meeting in Lisbon. 
  Today the Portuguese prime minister has brought nearly 60 
industrialists and businessmen, including leaders of nearly 40 
major Portuguese enterprises, to China. 
  During the visit, they will hold business talks with about 
200 Chinese entrepreneurs, exploring new ways for further 
expansion of bilateral cooperation. 
  All these demonstrate that Sino-Portuguese cooperation is 
advancing healthily. The Chinese people hope that Silva will 
make fresh contributions to the growth of bilateral ties 
established on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
  They also feel that with the approaching of 1999, it is 
imperative to accelerate the pace for the early settlement of 
the three major issues concerning the transitional period of 
Macao so as to create good conditions for the stable transition 
and smooth transfer of power.

  [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva and his extensive 
entourage have arrived in Beijing, but had an easy start to the 
visit. 
  [Correspondent] In addition to China the trip also includes 
Hong Kong and Macao. This is the largest group ever to travel 
with the prime minister, with more than 60 businessmen -- a trip 
of great economic significance. Cavaco Silva returns to China 
seven years after the signing of the Macao Joint Declaration in 
Beijing. The accord has contributed to the stability of the 
territory, according to the Chinese ambassador to Portugal: 
  [PRC ambassador in Mandarin with Portuguese subtitles] "The 
two governments have enjoyed good cooperation during the 
implementation of the Joint Declaration since its signing seven 
years ago. They have contributed to the stability and 
prosperity of Macao." 
  [Correspondent] After 1999, Macao will be an integral part 
of 
China, a situation which raises many questions. Two such 
questions are whether the death penalty will apply in the 
territory and the other is the nationality of the residents. 
The Chinese ambassador believes that appropriate solutions will 
be found for these two questions. 
  [PRC ambassador] "The Portuguese descendants who live in the 
territory have joined their efforts to help with Macao's 
economic and social development. We hope that even after 20 
December 1999, they can remain in Macao in peace. It is certain 
that the Macao Special Administrative Region will protect their 
customs and cultural traditions in accordance with the Basic 
Law. China will apply the nationality law bearing in mind the 
historic reality of the territory in such a manner as to find an 
appropriate solution to the situation. 
  "In relation to Macao, we believe that after the transition 
period the problem will be studied bearing in mind the social 
reality. The opinion of the residents on the death penalty will 
be sought and only then will the appropriate law on this matter 
be drawn up." 
  [Correspondent] The Orient Foundation, created before the 
signing of the Joint Declaration and based in Lisbon, has been 
one of the problems in this period of transition. China wants 
the foundation headquarters to be directly accountable to it. 
So far no decision has been reached. 
  [PRC ambassador] "The Orient Foundation funds come from 
Macao 
and should serve Macao. The contract, which gives part of the 
gambling profits to the Foundation, was signed before the Joint 
Declaration and will go beyond 1999. This question should be 
looked at by the Sino-Portuguese Liaison Group during the 
transition period. We are certain that through friendly 
negotiations we will find the appropriate solution."

  [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
(CPPCC) National Committee, met with visiting Finnish Prime 
Minister Esko Aho here today. 
  Extending Aho a welcome on the CPPCC's behalf, Li expressed 
the belief that Aho's China visit will greatly boost the 
existing friendship between the two countries. 
  Li said China is now focusing its attention on modernization 
construction and that it has achieved a lot in every field over 
the past decade. 
  However, as a large and populous country, China faces many 
difficulties in striving toward modernization, Li said. 
  China needs a stable and harmonious domestic situation as 
well as a peaceful and friendly external environment, Li said. 
  He noted that despite all the changes on the world stage, 
the 
relations between China and Finland remain as good as ever and 
that these ties can be described as a model of friendly 
cooperation between countries with different social systems. 
  He expressed the hope that both sides make efforts to expand 
cooperation and further consolidate and develop friendly 
bilateral ties. 
  Aho expressed agreement with this. Finland and China have 
been cooperating in political and economic and trade fields for 
a long period of time, aho said. 
  The two economies are complementary and have great potential 
for cooperation, he said, adding that his visit is sure to 
further promote the development of these and other ties. 
  During the meeting, Li also briefed the guests on the 
CPPCC's 
national role, China's economic restructuring and its political 
reform. 
  Also today, Zheng Hongye, chairman of the China Council for 
the Promotion of International Trade, hosted a luncheon in Aho's 
honor. 
  The Finnish prime minister told all the participants that 
Finnish-China cooperation in infrastructure, telecommunications, 
environmental protection and other fields has great potential.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin 
said here today that China and Finland should tap their economic 
cooperation potentials and further boost all-round ties. 
  Finland has its own features in many areas and its economic 
cooperation with China should be expanded, Jiang told visiting 
Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho here this afternoon. 
  China and Finland enjoy ties of friendship and mutual 
respect, and in recent years the bilateral exchanges and 
cooperation in fields of economy and trade, science and 
technology and culture have been further developed, he said. 
  "We are satisfied with this," Jiang told the Finnish prime 
minister. "Your current visit will further promote Sino-Finnish 
relations in all fields," he added. 
  Aho noted that the long geographical distance does not 
constitute a hindrance to the high-level contacts between the 
two countries. 
  On the contrary, extensive political and economic relations 
of cooperation have been established between the two countries, 
Aho said. 
  He described his current visit here as "an important 
milestone" in the history of Finnish-Chinese friendship. 
  Finland supports China's re-entry into the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Aho said, adding that the re-entry 
will make a significant impact on Finnish-Chinese economic 
relations and the global economy. 
  Aho also told Jiang that the visit had impressed him deeply. 
  During the meeting, Jiang asked Aho to convey his best 
regards to Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and to pass on his 
invitation to the president to visit China.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Esko Aho had talks today with 
Jiang Z.emin, Chinese president and party leader. According to 
him, political reforms in China are starting up in a tranquil 
way because China wants to remain stable to secure economic 
reforms. According to Prime Minister Aho, Finland did not raise 
the issue of human rights in China in a condemning way even 
though it was discussed. Chinese President Jiang Zemin invited 
President Martti Ahtisaari to visit China. Prime Minister Aho 
also acted as a spokesman for Finnish industry during this 
official visit. Sinikka Arteva reports: 
  [Arteva] Prime Minister Esko Aho had talks lasting an hour 
with the Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Zhongnanhai, the 
closely guarded area of Chinese leaders in Beijing. The Chinese 
president was in a very good mood and assured the Finnish 
journalists before Aho arrived that relations between our two 
countries have always been good. [passage omitted] 
  The prime minister's official negotiations in China are now 
over. Aho said that he believed that the trip has speeded up 
economic projects. According to Aho, the economic change in 
China has turned out to be much greater than he had imagined or 
read about in Finland. Because of what he saw, he said he 
supports the opening of a consulate in Shanghai. Tomorrow, Aho 
will visit the Great Wall and the Forbidden City.

has 
unique advantages in forestry, wood-processing, paper-making and 
other traditional industries, and that the two countries 
cooperate in the energy, metallurgical industry, 
telecommunications and environmental protection fields. 
  There exists "great potential" for cooperation between 
Finland and China in economic, trade and other areas, he said. 
  The delegation noted a lot of opportunities for bilateral 
economic and trade cooperation, Aho said.

  [Text] Washington, April 8 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today telephoned Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa and conveyed his regret at the prime minister's 
decision to resign. 
  Clinton told reporters that he told Hosokawa he was 
"personally very sorry to see him step down." 
  Clinton "commended him for his commitment to political and 
economic reform in Japan," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee 
Myers said in a statement. 
  "The President expressed his hope that the process of reform 
would continue in Japan," she said, "the President stated that 
he is confident that our strong bilateral relations with Japan 
will continue." 
  Clinton praised the prime minister for his "many 
achievements" during his tenure in office and described Hosokawa 
as "a historic figure", State Department Spokesman Mike McCurry 
said at today's news briefing. 
  McCurry noted that Hosokawa's government passed historic 
political reform legislation that will have long-range effects 
on Japan's political organization. 
  The Hosokawa government "made important contributions to 
bringing the Uruguay Round to a successful conclusion, including 
the opening Japan's rice market," he added. 
  The spokesman expressed hope that the prime minister's 
successor and the new government of Japan will continue the 
"strong and cooperative working relationship" between the U.S. 
and Japan. 
  McCurry also stressed, the United States "continue to look 
for meaningful steps by Japan to reduce its current account 
surplus and address market access barriers."

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Song Heads Team to U.S. for </F>
Technical Cooperation"] 
  [Text] State Councillor Song Jian leaves for Washington 
today on a two-week official visit that looks to enhance 
technical trade between the United States and China. 
  Song will co-chair the sixth meeting of the Sino-US Joint 
Commission on Scientific and Technological Co-operation. 
  The minister of the State Science and Technology Commission 
is the highest-ranking Chinese official to visit the United 
States since President Jiang Zemin's trip to Seattle last 
November. 
  He leads a nine-member senior delegation to the biannual 
meeting scheduled for Tuesday. 
  Song and John H. Gibbons, Assistant to the U.S. President 
for 
Science and Technology, will co-chair the commission, which was 
set up 15 years ago by senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and 
U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
  Song will focus his talks with Gibbons and other U.S. 
officials on enhancing Sino-American co-operation in such key 
areas as hygiene, environmental protection, energy and raw 
materials. 
  Both sides are expected to sign framework agreements on 
future cooperation in science and technology, the State Science 
and Technology Commission said. 
<H5>  Potential </H5>
  "There is a great potential in developing scientific and 
technological cooperation between the largest developed country 
and the largest developing country," it said. 
  China has already supplied the U.S. with more than 12,000 
scientific and technical research products on agriculture, 
contributing to American research on disease-resistant plants. 
  And the Chinese Government has signed agreements with the 
U.S. in at least 29 sectors involving education, agriculture, 
marine, hygiene, environmental protection, scientific research, 
chemicals and energy. 
  These agreements outline more than 1,000 projects in science 
and technology, with talent exchanges of more than 10,000 people. 
  After staying in Washington until Wednesday, Song plans to 
visit Boston, New York and Detroit to meet local leaders and 
businessmen, further networking for high-tech contacts. 
  Also on the trip are Hu Qiheng, Vice President of the 
Chinese 
Academy of Sciences, Liu Jiang, Agriculture Minister and others 
from the State Environmental Protection Agency, the China 
National Bureau of Oceanography, and the State Science and 
Technology Commission.

<F P=106> [From Simon Beck in Washington] </F>
  [Text] When a delegation of senior State Department and 
immigration officials arrives in Beijing tomorrow, their meeting 
with Chinese counterparts will not be taking place under the 
best of circumstances. The United States had hoped to be doing 
nothing more painful than smoothing over minor disputes with the 
Chinese on how to combat alien smuggling, and on arrangements 
for sending more of the sorry boatloads back home. But the 
talks will now be taking place in the shadow of the mysterious 
ship which dropped off more than 100 Fujianese at the Virginia 
coast last month and disappeared into the night, embarrassing 
authorities who had congratulated themselves that last year's 
alien smuggling crisis was over. 
  Intelligence reports indicate that other boats may be at sea 
bearing human cargoes whose eventual destination is the United 
States. It is clear last year's high-profile defeats for the 
smugglers -- most notably the Golden Venture and East Wood 
incidents -- plus China's reported crackdown on activities on 
home soil have put only temporary hurdles in the smugglers' path. 
  Quite apart from last week's raids in Maryland and New York, 
which revealed the safe passage of the latest boat, the SUNDAY 
MORNING POST has learned smuggling activities are still rampant. 
  More than 100 illegal Chinese immigrants have been rounded 
up 
by border patrol officers in Puerto Rico this year. All had 
taken a one-day boat journey from the nearby Dominican Republic 
after tortuous round-the world routes via Hong Kong, Europe and 
South America. The island has become the latest target of the 
smuggling gangs because of its easy access by sea, its less 
heavily-patrolled waters, and the fact that it comes under U.S. 
jurisdiction, meaning the immigrants can fly on to the U.S. 
mainland without needing documents. "It's a very nice way of 
coming in the back door," one immigration intelligence official 
said. 
  Last week, 38 Chinese, mostly Fujianese, were discovered on 
a 
beach in early morning -- presumably waiting for their guide to 
turn up. They told investigators they had flown from Hong Kong 
either to London or Paris, then on to the Dominican Republic. 
There they waited several weeks before taking a small boat for 
the short trip to Puerto Rico. Another group discovered in 
January said they had spent many weeks passing through Brazil 
and Bolivia before reaching the Dominican Republic. 
  Investigators believed smugglers began using the new entry 
point after the failure of huge shiploads to make it safely to 
the U.S. However, the authorities believe that for every person 
caught, scores may be passing through undetected. 
  Investigators are finding that the aliens probably left 
China 
with valid exit documents, but acquired fake visas to enter 
transit countries in Europe and South America. 
  One immigration official said the authorities had been 
caught 
unawares by the audacity of the smugglers. "From my 
perspective, there has been a false sense of security. I think 
we may have let our guard down," the official said. 
  "The feeling was, we had some successes like the East Wood 
(intercepted last year off the Marshall Islands), and the Golden 
Venture, which was terrible publicity for the smugglers. But 
the series of victories was more luck than anything else. The 
smugglers have since changed their tactics, using smaller loads 
and different routes." He said that tough legislation, promised 
last year by President Bill Clinton, had "lost its momentum". 
  Although the record on catching smugglers has been 
reasonable, the punishments inflicted are not great. For 
instance, the captain and crew of the Golden Venture have been 
allowed to plead guilty to minor alien smuggling charges, and 
may escape with a few months in prison. 
  Likewise, many of the 15 or so alleged members of the New 
York- based Fuk Ching gang said to be behind the transporting 
and kidnapping of last year's boatloads -- are negotiating 
guilty plea bargains with prosecutors. 
  A recent Justice Department memorandum confirms the 
administration has partly retreated. In it, Assistant 
Attorney-General Sheila Anthony suggests tagging certain 
provisions, such as increased penalties for alien smuggling, to 
existing bills rather than putting forward a controversial new 
set of laws. 
  Streamlining of the asylum process is occurring without the 
need for new legislation. 
  The problem is being attacked only after the illegal 
immigrants have been smuggled in. Gangs appear unconcerned by 
plans to deny work permits to asylum seekers for longer periods, 
or to charge applicants a processing fee. The immigration 
official said the alien smugglers worked under such a "complex 
web" of contacts and alliances that the only way to beat them 
was to put resources into intelligence work. 
  "I do think we will see more boats this summer. They've had 
time to regroup," he said. "But patrolling the shores is only 
really a last resort. The key is criminal intelligence, getting 
informants and penetrating the gangs." 
  Last week's raids on the safe houses came after a relative 
of 
one illegal immigrant tipped off the FBI that the group was 
being held hostage and threatened for the US$30,000 (HK$232,000) 
smuggling fee. Without the call, the aliens would eventually 
have melted seamlessly into the shadowy underworld that 
contained millions of illegal workers like them.

the provincial, city, and county people's governments must abide 
by the previous paragraphs governing their authority to examine 
and approve the requisitioning of the land involved. In 
addition, with regard to the total number of mu in one 
requisition approval, the respective governments must not exceed 
their authority to approve the requisitioning of `other types of 
land.' 
  "Efforts must be made to avoid capital farmland protection 
zones when infrastructural construction projects such as 
transportation, water conservation, energy, and communications

requisition capital farmland, approval must be obtained from the 
provincial people's government. Where approval has been obtained 
for a construction project, land requisition examination and 
approval must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of 
the `Procedures.'"

and government organs, mass organizations, schools, mines, and 
factories--or where their land is to be used for other purposes, 
the opinion of the competent department should be sought, and 
permission must be obtained according to law from the people's 
government at and above the county level in the locality where 
the land is located." 
  4. The first paragraph of Article 31 is amended to: 
  "According to development plans of towns (townships) and 
villages, where cultivated land or state-owned land is to be 
used in the construction of housing for rural residents, an 
examination should first be conducted by the town (township) 
people's government, and the matter must be reported to the 
people's government of a country level for approval; where the 
original housing land or other nonarable land is to be used, the 
town (township) people's government may grant approval. 
  "Cultivated land within capital farmland protection zones is 
not allowed to be used for the construction of housing for rural 
residents." 
  5. The first paragraph of Article 46 is amended to: 
  "Administrative disciplinary action laid down in the 
`Procedures' shall be decided and executed by the unit to which 
the party involved belongs or by a higher-level organ. 
Administrative penalties, the dismantling within a prescribed 
period of time of structures and other facilities on land used 
illegally, or the confiscation of the structures and facilities 
stipulated by the 'Procedures,' shall be decided by the land 
administrative departments of the people's governments at and 
above the county level, but they may also be decided and 
executed by a town (township) people's government according to 
law. Where the party involved does not agree with the penalty 
decision, it may, within 15 days after receiving the decision, 
appeal for reconsideration to an organ one level higher than the 
organ which made the penalty decision. If the party involved 
does not agree with the reconsideration decision, it may, within 
15 days after receiving the decision, file an appeal with a 
people's court. The party involved may, within 15 days after 
receiving the penalty decision, directly file an appeal with a 
people's court. If the party involved neither applies for a 
reconsideration nor files an appeal at the end of 15 days after 
receiving the penalty decision, and also refuses to carry out 
the penalty decision, the organ which made the penalty decision 
shall file an application with a people's court to force the 
execution of the decision." 
  These procedures take effect on the day of promulgation.

  [Text] At a forum with representatives of teachers and 
students from Shandong Industrial University held on the morning 
of 9 April, Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, stressed: The institutions of higher learning across 
the province should work closely line with the overall situation 
of grasping favorable opportunities, deepening reform, expanding 
the scale of opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability to fulfill the three tasks, such as reform, 
development, and stability; to catch up with the pace of the 
times; to meet with the requirements as set forth by the new 
situation and the new tasks; and to make new, greater 
contributions to the building of the socialist modernization. 
  Together with Han Xikai, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee; Zhang Ruifeng, vice governor of the provincial 
government; and Cui Weilin, vice chairman of the provincial 
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference and chairman of the provincial education commission, 
Comrade Jiang Chunyun arrived at Shandong Industrial University 
at 0830. They first watched the exhibition on the achievements 
made during the monthly scientific and technological campaign 
organized by the Communist Youth League committee of the 
university as well as the achievements made in the first applied 
scientific and technological invention contest, and fully 
affirmed the achievements. Then, they went to the [words 
indistinct] laboratory and heard the introduction of the 
situation. At the mess hall of the university, the comrades, 
including Jiang Chunyun, tried to understand, in detail, the 
situation relating to the varieties of dishes and the prices of 
the food. Comrade Jiang Chunyun visited two student dormitories 
and the houses of two teachers to understand their living and 
housing conditions. After that, at the sports center of the 
university, the comrades, including Jiang Chunyun, held a forum 
with representatives of teachers and students of the university. 
  After hearing the reports by the university leaders and the 
speeches by some teachers and students, on behalf of the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government, 
Comrade Jiang Chunyun set forth five requirements for how to 
improve the work of the institutions of higher learning. 
  First, the institutions of higher learning should cultivate 
more skilled persons for the development of the socialist market 
economy. To suit the demands of the socialist market economy, 
universities should cultivate more qualified skilled persons in 
a rapid manner so as to satisfy the needs of the socialist 
modernization. 
  Second, institutions of higher learning should bring into 
full play the advantages of wisdom and intelligence so as to 
make greater contributions to Shandong's economic and social 
development. We should positively explore ways for linking 
science and technology with the economy, accelerate the 
transformation of scientific and technological findings, and 
make greater contributions to comprehensively implementing the 
strategy of relying on science and education to rejuvenate 
Shandong and the provincial strategic goals for economic 
development. 
  Third, the deepening of reform has injected new vitality 
into 
the higher education. The reform of the higher educational 
cause should be conducive to the adherence to the school-running 
orientation of socialism, the mobilization of the broad masses 
of teaching and administrative staff members' working 
enthusiasm, the cultivation of increasingly more skilled 
persons, the stability of the campus order, and the 
self-development of institutions of higher learning. According 
to the requirements of the socialist market economy, we should 
further readjust the structure of specialized courses, optimize 
teaching contents and teaching methods, pay attention to the 
students' quality and ability, and make the students better suit 
the social demands. 
  Fourth, we should show concern for the working, studying, 
and 
living conditions of the teachers, the students, and the 
administrative staff members; and realistically help solve their 
practical difficulties and problems. The party committees and 
governments at various levels and relevant departments should 
pay attention to helping schools eliminate difficulties and do 
more concrete and good deeds for the teachers and students. 
Appropriate jobs should be arranged for the students graduated 
this year so that they will bring their talents into full play. 
The school should issue certificates of graduation to the 
students who are not covered in the recruitment quotas so long 
as they pass the examinations. The province will allocate 
special funds to subside the small number of the students with 
living difficulties due to the price hikes. 
  Fifth, we should adopt realistic and effective measures to 
maintain the stability of institutions of higher learning. The 
departments concerned and all social fronts should proceed from 
the overall situation of social stability, carry out the system 
of responsibility for stability, and ensure the university 
should have a stable social environment. We should guide the 
broad masses of teachers, students, and administrative staff 
members to take the overall situation into consideration, 
observe discipline, and concentrate energy on their teaching and 
studying. The broad masses of teachers and students should 
consciously resist the influence of bourgeois liberation and 
corrosive ideas; firmly foster accurate ideals, convictions, 
outlook on life, and outlook on value; and be persons of the new 
generation with ideals, morality, education, and a sense of 
discipline. 
  Jiang Chunyun finally urged that the broad masses of 
teachers 
and students of the university should work and study hard; build 
the university into a center especially training senior 
engineers and technicians, a high-tech research center, and a 
new high-tech development center; and make greater contributions 
to Shandong's economic development.

  Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee; 
Zhao Zhihao, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee 
and provincial governor; Han Xikai, deputy secretary of the 
provincial party committee; and Dong Fengji, member of the 
standing committee of the provincial party committee and 
director of the propaganda department, attended the conference. 
  The conference was presided over by Comrade Han Xikai. 
Comrade Jiang Chunyun gave a report at the conference, 
entitled: Base Ourselves on the Overall Situation, Serve the 
Central Task, and Enhance our Province's Propaganda and 
Ideological Work to a New Height. 
  Jiang Chunyun said: Since the third plenary session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, particularly during recent years, 
the general situation on our province's propaganda and 
ideological front has been good and the achievements have been 
remarkable. Today's good situation in the whole province's 
reform and development must not be separated from propaganda and 
ideological work because comrades on the provincial propaganda 
and ideological front have made important contributions in this 
aspect. The provincial party committee are satisfied with the 
propaganda and ideological work, and have fully affirmed the 
achievements. 
  Jiang Chunyun pointed out: The more we conduct reform and 
opening up, the more we should strengthen propaganda and 
ideological work, and the more we develop the market economy, 
the more we should strengthen spiritual civilization. At 
present, China is in the crucial period of promoting socialist 
modernization. In safeguarding this year's overall situation of 
the whole party's and the whole country's work defined by the 
party Central Committee and implementing the three major affairs 
of reform, development, and stability, the propaganda and 
ideological front has to shoulder a particularly important 
mission and responsibility. It has to give play to its strong 
and forceful guaranteeing role and its media supporting role. 
He said: It is necessary to submit ourselves to and serve the 
overall situation of the work of the whole party and the whole 
country and to prominently grasp four major tasks well: 
  1. We should persist in regarding Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the 
fundamental guiding principle of propaganda and ideological work 
and the study of volume no.3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping as the fundamental ideology, and grasp them firmly and 
successfully. The study must be carried out at all levels and be 
specific. It is necessary to attend to the study work of 
leading cadres at all levels, particularly the leading bodies at 
and above the county level, and to rotationally train cadres at 
above the county and section levels within this year. 
  2. We should uphold the party's basic line and do a good job 
in media guidance. In press and media propaganda, we must 
resolutely implement the party's basic line which takes economic 
construction as the central task and upholds the four cardinal 
principles, reform, and opening up, adhere to the principles of 
unity, stability, and boosting of enthusiasm, and of conducting 
propaganda with positive examples, and do a good job in guiding, 
protecting, and giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses of 
people and of all sectors, and inspire, encourage, and guide the 
masses of people to display their talent and make contributions 
to reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  3. We should strengthen and improve ideological and 
educational work with the education on patriotism, collectivism, 
and socialism as the main subjects, actively promote the 
64-character pioneering spirit of the new period advocated by 
Comrade Jiang Zemin, lead the people, particularly the broad 
masses of young people, to cultivate a correct ideal, 
conviction, and the concepts on value and on outlook on life, 
advocate in the whole society the socialist habits of giving 
consideration to the overall situation, making selfless 
dedication, promoting unity and mutual help, and observing 
discipline and law, actively publicize the heroic deeds and 
lofty character of the advanced persons who are ready to take up 
the cudgels for a just cause and who sacrifice themselves to 
save the others, and promote the mass activities on learning 
from Lei Feng Xu Honggang and the advanced persons to become a 
common practice. 
  4. We should place the project on creating good works in the 
lead, actively invigorate the socialist literature and arts, 
conscientiously implement the orientation of serving the people 
and socialism and the principle of letting a hundred flowers 
blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend, actively 
advocate all ideologies and spirit that are conducive to 
promoting patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, promoting 
reform, opening up, and modernization, and promoting national 
unity, social progress, and a happy life on the people, and 
strenuously advocate the ideologies and spirit of striving for a 
good life through honest and hard work. 
  Jiang Chunyun stressed: We should uphold the basic 
experience which we have gained since reform and opening up and 
actively explore new ideas for conducting propaganda and 
ideological work. We must carry out propaganda and ideological 
work in close connection with the central task of economic 
construction, give full play to its role in emancipating the 
mind and seeking truth from facts, regard the training of 
persons of a new socialist type with ideals, ethics, culture, 
and a sense of discipline as the basic task, uphold the basic 
channel of respecting, guiding, and inducing the people to 
participate in this work, give play to the integrated 
advantages, and form a socialized large-scale propaganda force. 
  Jiang Chunyun emphatically pointed out: Propaganda and 
ideological work has a bearing on the overall situation of 
building the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. 
Doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work under the 
new period is a major political task of the whole party. Party 
committees at all levels must participate in propaganda and 
ideological work, realistically strengthen and improve 
leadership over it, and enable it to play a more important role 
in reform, opening up, and modernization. It is necessary to 
unswervingly implement the principle of taking a two- handed 
approach and be tough with both, place propaganda and 
ideological work high on the agenda, take active and reliable 
steps to promote reform in propaganda and cultural work, 
conscientiously implement the cultural and economic policies 
defined by the central authorities, increase input in propaganda 
and cultural undertakings, and exert strenuous efforts to build 
the propaganda and ideological work contingents. 
  Comrade Zhao Zhihao also addressed the conference. He gave a 
briefing on the whole province's economic and reform situations. 
Zhao Zhihao pointed out: It is necessary to successfully 
conduct propaganda and ideological work in close connection with 
the central task of economic construction. The priorities and 
difficulties in economic work are also the priorities of 
propaganda and ideological work. This year, on the basis of 
implementing the 20-character principle of the central 
authorities, we should properly handle the relations of reform, 
development, and stability, do a good job propaganda and 
ideological work, uphold the correct media guidance, improve 
work quality, adhere to the materialist dialectics, and pay 
great attention to the propaganda results. 
  Zhao Zhihao called on governments at all levels and all 
departments to regard their attention to propaganda and 
ideological work as their bound duties, and hoped that comrades 
on the propaganda and ideological front will clearly recognize 
their mission, make unremitting efforts to make their work a 
greater success, and make greater contributions to Shandong's 
reform, opening up, and modernization. 
  Responsible comrades of the party committees and directors 
of 
the propaganda departments of various cities and prefectures and 
of large enterprises and institutions of higher learning in 
Jinan, directors of propaganda departments of various counties, 
cities, and districts, and responsible comrades of 
provincial-level departments, committees, and bureaus in charge 
of propaganda and ideological work attended the conference. 
Comrades attending the provincial conference on cultural, radio 
and television, press and publication, and external propaganda 
work, and cadres at and above the section level of various units 
under the provincial-level propaganda departments also attended 
the conference.

  [Text] Jinan, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Loans provided by the 
World Bank have gone a long way to promote the economic 
development, especially the development of infrastructure 
facilities in Shandong, a key economic province in East China. 
  The province is one the earliest to use the World Bank loans 
after 1980 when the bank resumed its operations in China. 
  By the end of 1993, the province had used 26 batches of 
loans 
totalling 824 million U.S. dollars and more than 40 percent of 
the loans have been used in energy development, 30 percent in 
agriculture and the rest in transportation, industry and social 
sectors. 
  Agriculture is the main area using the World Bank loan. The 
province has built and developed six farm projects with a total 
investment of 2.5 billion yuan, including loans totalling 262 
million U.S. dollars from the World Bank. 
  These projects, spreading in 64 counties and cities, cover 
construction of farm and irrigation facilities, animal 
husbandry, processing of farm and sideline products, development 
of coastal lower-lying areas and the breeding of aquatic 
products. 
  So far four projects have has been completed and the rest 
are 
proceeding smoothly. 
  The first World Bank loan project -- the North China plain 
agricultural project -- began in 1982 and was completed in 1987. 
  Costing 198 million yuan including 29.6 million U.S. dollars 
in loan, the project involved the harnessing of river courses 
and the building of irrigation facilities. 
  As a result, the irrigation areas have been expanded from 
51,000 hectares to 80,700 hectares, accounting for 93 percent of 
the total cultivated areas; 33,000 hectares out of the 43,000 
hectares of the saline-alkali areas have been ameliorated; and 
9,300 hectares of waste land reclaimed. The tree coverage rate 
has risen from 6.2 percent to 16.3 percent. 
  Another World Bank loan project is the comprehensive 
agricultural development in the province. 
  The province has completed investment of 1.014 billion yuan, 
95 percent of the planned amount and transformed 187,000 
hectares of lower-yield farmland and developed lower-lying areas 
to raise aquatic products. 
  The social development projects using the World Bank loan 
include improvement of medical services, training of medical 
personnel, development of preventive medicine, the improvement 
of school conditions, teaching facilities and laboratories, 
totalling nine, with a total World Bank loans running up to 
43.53 million U.S. dollars. 
  Two forestry projects and five industrial projects have also 
yielded satisfactory results.

cities' exchanges. Its trading at present is only available for 
U.S. dollars and HK [Hong Kong] dollars and its opening hours

  [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Shanghai Stock 
Exchange in this largest economic center of China has mounted a 
sophisticated operating system that combines computers, 
satellite telecommunications and other modern high-tech means. 
  The exchange began its business with a super micro-computer 
network soon after its founding in 1990. 
  By the end of 1992, the exchange had replaced all its 
computer terminals with HP-900 series of 827-type computers, 
which can handle 1,800 transactions per second as against six by 
the old system. 
  The Shanghai Stock Exchange has continuously improved its 
distance telecommunications system. 
  Last year the exchange invested about eight million U.S. 
dollars in laying a fiber optic cable which is the world's most 
advanced in the world in terms of technology. 
  "The use of the sophisticated technology has doubled and 
redoubled its handling capacities," an official in charge of the 
exchange said. 
  At present, the exchange has more than 500 members as 
against 
25 in 1990. The number of registered investors has risen from 
25,000 to over five million, and the daily transactions jumped 
from 105,000 yuan in 1990 to three million yuan in 1991, 17.5 
million yuan in 1992, and about 900 million yuan last year. 
  The application of modern science and technology has created 
the conditions to set up a unified national stock exchange, 
according to the official. 
  So far the Shanghai Stock Exchange has linked its computer 
network with that of stock exchanges in six cities including 
Fuzhou, capital of Southeast China's Fujian Province, Shenyang, 
capital of Liaoning Province in Northeast China, and Haikou, 
capital of Hainan Province in South China. 
  "This has made it convenient for local stock investors, and 
paved the way for establishing a national securities exchange," 
the official noted. 
  With an advanced operational system, the Shanghai Stock 
Exchange has displayed its due role in selling the state 
treasury bonds. 
  The exchange contracted for 75 billion yuan of state 
treasury 
bonds and within 12 days, it sold 15 billion. 
  It was estimated that the Shanghai Stock Exchange has helped 
the state reduce the cost of issuing treasury bonds by 700 
million yuan. 
  The Shanghai Stock Exchange plans to purchase a special 
purpose satellite in the near future in order to elevate its 
operations to a higher plane.

managerial expertise and market information, he said. 
  To date, local businesses have opened 420 firms in 60 
countries and regions with the company's help, he said, adding

Chinese-built machine tools to 100 American customers. 
  The official said that his company will also help overseas 
firms expand into multi-national companies combining production 
with trade.

Western Europe, and new subsidiaries in Singapore, the Republic 
of Korea, Africa and Southeast Asia later this year, he said.

internationally accepted practices in managing overseas firms 
launched by local enterprises, he said.

  [Text] Shanghai, March 9 (XINHUA) -- East China's Shanghai 
has achieved steady economic growth in the first quarter this 
year, providing great momentum for its future development. 
  This was recently stated by Cheng Bulin, director of the 
Statistics Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government. 
  Statistics show that the value of goods and service produced 
in Shanghai during the first quarter totalled 42 billion yuan 
(about five billion U.S. dollars according to current exchange 
rates) with a growth of 13.1 percent over the same period last 
year calculated in terms of comparable prices. 
  The Pudong New Area has continued its high development speed 
with all of its economic quotas clearly higher than the city's 
average. 
  As the pillar of the local economy, Shanghai's industry has 
seen overall sales topping 81 billion yuan and the rate of sales 
against production reaching 94 percent during the period. 
  Cheng Bulin also said that local exports, once the burden of 
Shanghai's economic development, have made a fresh start this 
year with the export trade volume soaring to 1.7 billion U.S. 
dollars worth, a rise of 22.3 percent over the same period last 
year. 
  The scale of foreign investment and the fields involved in 
it 
in Shanghai have both been expanded. Meanwhile, more overseas 
capital has poured into industrial and high-tech projects. 
  State investment in fixed assets all over the city during 
the 
last three months was 7 billion yuan, a growth of 60 percent 
over the same period in 1993. Major infrastructural projects 
are going smoothly. 
  Price-control measures implemented by the municipal 
government has effectively checked inflation and made shanghai's 
margin of increase of prices one of the lowest in the country's 
35 large and medium-sized cities. 
  Sound development of the local economy at the beginning of 
this year can be largely attributed to the firm foundation laid 
during economic flourishing in recent years and high demand for 
local investment. 
  According to Cheng Bulin, deepening of reform in fields 
including finance, banking, housing and social insurance is 
expected to further invigorate the local economy. 
  But Shanghai is also facing problems such as scarcity of 
floating funds, high prices of some key raw materials, 
increasing of loss- making enterprises and marketing snags with 
certain consumer products, the director said.

<F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporter Li Zhenghong (0632 2973 1347) </F>
and correspondent Li Xuewu (2621 1331 2976): "Shanghai Acts 
`Against Staggering Profits'"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 2 Apr (XINHUA) -- On 1 April, the day 
that Shanghai's "Interim Provisions Against Price Fraud and 
Staggering Profits" became effective, the municipal commodity 
price department and industry and commerce administration 
inspected a number of major restaurants, cafes, amusement 
centers, and emporiums in the commercial district. 
  In the morning, when inspection personnel visited a garment 
store inside an exquisite commercial building, they noticed a 
large sign reading "40 perecent discount on all goods at this 
counter" on some counters. However, prices marked on the 
commodities gave no further explanation. Take, for example, a 
suit priced for 800 yuan. People were confused as to whether or 
not the price included the 40 percent discount. As a matter of 
fact, the discount was given on certain commodities only. 
  Hence, inspection personnel decided that such a "misguided 
price mark" constituted price fraud. In accordance with the 
provisions "against fraud and staggering profits," selling 
commodities with false bargain, discount, and minimum prices is 
price fraud. 
  At noon, at a Sino-foreign cooperative fast food restaurant, 
inspection personnel saw the menu's price for Italian spaghetti 
as 40 yuan; black pepper pork chops, 40 yuan; and seafood salad, 
30 yuan; and one line of small words at the bottom saying: 
served with soup, bread, salad, and coffee or tea. A customer 
complained that because of the vague connotation of the prices, 
he once spent over 100 yuan in ordering three main courses at 
the restaurant. After some inquiry, it was learned that the 
prices were those for a complete dinner. In other words, each 
main course should be served with soup, drink, and other side 
dishes. Therefore, a customer who mistakenly ordered more than 
one main course would not be able to finish the dinner. Under 
such circumstances, the service personnel would leave the 
mistake uncorrected and make the best of it by serving the side 
dishes for only one main course. Law enforcement officials 
believed that such equivocal practices of pricing by the 
management in fact encroached upon consumer interests and, from 
a different perspective, was aimed at reaping staggering profits. 
  At some restaurants and cafes catering to average consumers, 
the prices of drinks were generally found to be exorbitant. A 
bottle of high-grade Shaoxing rice wine was selling for 30 yuan; 
Dynasty white grape wine, for 80 yuan; and Great Wall white 
grape wine, for 80 yuan; whereas their prime costs were 4.2, 22, 
and 21 yuan, respectively. 
  There were also pricing irregularities such as "Maotai 
[spirit], 400 yuan." Was the 400 yuan the price for a bottle or 
glass? How many ounces? 
  The commodity price department and industry and commerce 
administration have already instructed on-the-spot those having 
violated the provisions on pricing to correct them or to remedy 
them in a specified time limit; and have meted out harsh 
punishments depending on circumstnces. In accordance with the 
provisions "against price fraud and staggering profits," 
lawbreakers were ordered to refund their illegitimate incomes to 
consumers and were given a fine from one to 10 times the 
illegitimate income. 
  Shanghai has implemented these provisions with a view to 
standardizing pricing activities following market deregulation. 
These detailed and supplementary rules of the relevant state 
regulations reflect Shanghai's tough approach to supervise 
pricing according to the law and to perfect the legislation of 
pricing. Nevertheless, an authoritative source has emphasized 
that the implementation of the provisions is by no means 
tantamount to returning the previous practice of direct price 
controls. He has urged consumers in general to conscientiously 
apply the provisions to protect their interests. It is 
understood that very few complaints against activities of "price 
fraud and staggering profits" in markets were filed yesterday.

  [Text] The enforcement of the Shanghai Municipal Price 
Bureau's interim provisions against price cheating and schemes 
to reap exorbitant profits began throughout the municipality on 
1 April. Acts of price cheating and acts of seeking exorbitant 
profits are clearly defined by the provisions. 
  The following practices -- setting false prices by passing 
inferior goods as high-quality ones, cheating on measurements or 
weights, mixing up specifications, and lowering quality; 
cheating buyers and promoting sales through such means as 
selling at false preferential or discount prices; using false 
price tags that do not match the quality of products; cheating 
buyers by providing false market price information; and selling 
products through the application of force or buying products 
through extortion -- are acts of price cheating and acts of 
seeking exorbitant profits. 
  Henceforth, the price administrative departments will take 
action to punish these acts in accordance with complaints filed 
by the masses.

<F P=106> ["Hosokawa Quits Over Diet Stalemate"] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa announced his resignation today to "take moral 
responsibility" for money scandals that have stalled Diet 
(Parliament) debate on the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Hosokawa said at a news conference he decided to step down 
after new allegations were revealed about financial dealings 
involving his private office. 
  The new allegations came to his attention Thursday [7 April] 
night, Hosokawa said, adding that he made up his mind to quit 
his job after barely eight months to pave the way for resuming 
the Diet business. 
  Hosokawa said the new allegations include receiving interest 
on a 100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) loan from the 
scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery group as political 
contributions and obtaining profits via dealings by using 
political contributions. 
  He asserted that he was not aware of any of the alleged 
deals. 
  Hosokawa said his office allegedly made the profits for 
several years from 1981. 
  Hosokawa, 56, became prime minister of a seven-party 
coalition government last August, ending the 38-year-long grip 
on power by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Hosokawa opened his 30-minute news conference with a brief 
statement on a list of achievements and unfinished jobs under 
his administration. 
  The announcement came only two days after a media frenzy 
over 
reports on his joking about resigning, which he strongly denied. 
  Prior to the news conference, he suddenly summoned the 
leaders of the coalition to his official residence and told them 
he was quitting. 
  At the emergency cabinet session, Hosokawa reiterated that 
he 
repaid the 100 million yen loan in 1982 from Sagawa and denied 
that he was personally involved in a 1986 Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. share purchase, which claimed was a deal by his 
late father-in-law. 
  But he said he should take the responsibility for the 
current 
political turbulence triggered by the wranglings between the 
coalition and the opposition camp over his questionable 
financial affairs. 
  The LDP has been boycotting the debates on the state budge 
for fiscal 1994, which began on April 1, at the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee, it has demanded a Diet 
testimony of Hosokawa's former secretary, who was in charge of 
his financial affairs when he borrowed the money from Sagawa. 
  The government is currently running on a 50-day stopgap 
budget. 
  "However, to my regret, I could not fully address the issues 
of drastic educational reform and administrative reform for the 
new era," Hosokawa said at the press conference. 
  During his eight-month term as premier, Hosokawa achieved 
political reform and helped conclude the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. 
  However, he has yet not finished such jobs as tax and 
pension 
reforms, decentralization and greater transparency of government 
operations. 
  Hosokawa said it is "extremely regrettable" that the 
financial affairs involving his office and his late 
father-in-law have stalled the Diet business. 
  Meanwhile, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, is widely viewed here as the most possible successor 
to Hosokawa.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata today denied that he has the intention of 
succeeding Morihiro Hosokawa to become prime minister, KYODO 
NEWS SERVICE reported. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister, told a hastily arranged 
press conference at the Foreign Ministry that he considers it is 
more important to make adjustments within the ruling coalition 
government than to become the next prime minister, KYODO said. 
  He also said the next cabinet must be a stable and 
full-fledged one, according to the news agency. 
  However, a senior member of Shinseito, a powerful party in 
the coalition government, said it would push for its leader Hata 
as the next premier, TV reports said. 
  But Hajime Funada, former state minister for economic 
planning, had this to add, "there is the question of how we 
should address this within the current coalition framework. It 
is a delicate thing to find a balance."

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Hosokawa's Resignation </F>
Deepens Political Turmoil"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's sudden announcement today to resign because of his 
alleged financial deals sent shock waves throughout Japan and 
further deepened the country's political turbulence, observers 
say. 
  Hosokawa's decision was triggered by further revelations 
yesterday of his earlier financial deals and delays in the Diet 
(parliament) debate over the country's 1994 fiscal policy, which 
has been stalled for over a month. 
  It could also speed up the polarization of the seven-party 
ruling coalition, already on the verge of division. 
  Public attention is now focused on who will be named to 
succeed Hosokawa, who took office last August, whether his 
coalition can retain its clamp on power and whether his action 
will prompt a major political regrouping. 
  The coalition is fast polarizing into two groups -- 
Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government Party] and 
their supporters in Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) on the one 
hand, and the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the United 
Socialist Democratic Party (USDP) and their JNP backers on the 
other. 
  Observers say if the division becomes permanent, Hosokawa, 
still JNP leader, and Ichiro Ozawa, Shinseito co-leader, may 
abandon the latter group and seek out opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) members who are critical of the ability 
of their party leadership to form a new government. 
  If this forecast materializes, Japan's political 
reorganization would sweep into act 2 of a drama which began 
last summer with the ending of the LDP's 38-year-long grip on 
power. 
  The Diet was sent into a spin by Hosokawa's alleged shady 
financial deals, which go back to the early 1980's when he was a 
House of Councillors member. Suspicions have grown largely 
because Hosokawa's own account of the events have kept changing. 
  In 1982, he borrowed 100 million yen (950,000 U.S. dollars) 
from Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm. He 
claimed the cash was for repairs to his home in Kumamoto 
Prefecture and has insisted that the loan was repaid in full. 
  But the opposition camp has pointed to irregularities in the 
papers Hosokawa presented to the Diet, such as entries in Sagawa 
account books that list transactions on days when the firm was 
closed or on dates that do not show up on the calendar, such as 
Sept. 31. 
  In addition, a document Hosokawa claims is a receipt for 
repayment has no company seal or signatures. Such discrepancies 
have critics doubting the authenticity of the papers. 
  Hosokawa has admitted some of the documents are "not in 
order", but said they were papers given to him by Sagawa after 
his own records of the transaction could not be found. 
  Hosokawa is also plagued by allegations that he, and not his 
late father-in-law as he maintains, purchased 300 shares of 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986. 
  Of the 300 NTT shares officially registered with the 
father-in-law, 199 shares were sold after the stock was listed 
in early 1987, while the remaining 101 were passed on to 
Hosokawa's wife after her father's death. 
  Announcing his resignation at a press conference, Hosokawa 
said he made the decision after new allegations were revealed 
about financial dealings involving his private office. 
  He said he should take moral and political "responsibility" 
for the dealings, even though he was not aware of them. 
  However, observers say Hosokawa's resignation came after the 
former Kumamoto governor failed to dismiss the mounting doubts 
over his own financial affairs. As one senior LDP official has 
said: "I find it hard to believe that the prime minister 
refuses to actively take the necessary steps to dispel the 
suspicions surrounding him." 
  Hosokawa's resignation has ended the continuing rift between 
the ruling coalition and the opposition camp over the premier's 
dubious deals, thus paving the way for the Diet to start, at 
last, deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, which began 
on April 1. 
  The row has delayed the start of the budget debate and the 
government is currently running on a 50-day stopgap budget. 
  Analysts says that the Diet faces a number of pressing 
issues 
that need addressing, including stimulation of the sluggish 
economy, reconciliation of the strained Japan-U.S. relationship 
caused by the impasse in the bilateral trade framework talks and 
handling of growing tension over the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsular. 
  Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata was scheduled to 
leave for Marrakech, Morocco, next Tuesday for the signing 
ceremony of the new global trade agreement concluded last 
December under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  It is, however, not known whether Hata, the most powerful 
candidate for the premiership, can now actually go to Morocco 
amid such political turmoil at home, observers say. 
  They say the domestic political unrest will in turn affect 
Japan's ties with the United States, over which a shadow has 
already been cast by the breakdown of the trade talks in 
February.

<F P=106> ["Japan Socialists To Accept Coalition Consensus on New </F>
Premier" -- XINHUA headline] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The Social Democratic 
Party of Japan (SDP), the largest political force within the 
ruling coalition government, said today it will accept a 
consensus among the ruling parties on who should become the next 
prime minister to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the remarks when he met 
reporters shortly after Hosokawa announced he was resigning. 
  The SDP differs from Shinseito, another powerful group 
within 
the seven-party coalition, over major policies including defense 
and tax. 
  However, asked what the SDP would do if Shinseito leader and 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is picked up as new premier, 
murayama said if the coalition parties reach an agreement on it, 
"we will cooperate with the agreement." 
  A meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition 
partners is currently under way to discuss who will succeed 
Hosokawa. 
  Murayama also said the coalition government should not 
change 
its present seven-party structure.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Japan's coalition 
government ended a closed-door meeting today without reaching a 
decision on the choice of a new prime minister to replace 
Morihiro Hosokawa who announced his shock resignation yesterday. 
  However, leaders of the ruling coalition, attending the 
session without Hosokawa, said they have agreed in principle to 
form a new government within one week and pick a new leader. 
  Hosokawa refused to predict who will be his successor, 
saying 
that it is imprudent to name the next premier, or even to take 
part in discussions to name him. 
  Meanwhile, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, is widely viewed here as the most possible successor 
to Hosokawa. 
  The opposition Liberal Democratic Party, who governed for 
nearly four decades until they were toppled by Hosokawa's 
coalition last year, were trying to determine if the unexpected 
turn of events would give them a chance to again seize control. 
  There has also been speculation that former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe could defect from the Liberal Democrats, 
bringing his faction into the coalition and making a bid for its 
leadership and thus the prime ministership. 
  Hosokawa, the 56-year-old prime minister who took office 
last 
August, stepped down amid mounting pressure over alleged past 
financial improprieties. 
  Debate over the scandal has blocked parliamentary business 
for the past month, halting work on the budget for this fiscal 
year and other issues. 
  During his eight-month term as premier, Hosokawa achieved 
political reform and helped conclude the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. 
  However, he has yet not finished such jobs as tax and 
pension 
reforms, decentralization and greater transparency of government 
operations.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Choice of Hosokawa's </F>
Successor Splits Coalition"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 10 (XINHUA) -- While coalition leaders 
stressed today that the framework of the current coalition 
should be preserved, many analysts doubt whether the coalition 
government will be able to agree on a new leader, let alone 
solidly unite behind one. 
  The coalition is deeply divided over Japan's future 
political 
alignment. 
  It is also doubtful whether a new coalition leader will be 
able to effectively tackle a horde of issues such as winning 
Diet (parliament) approval for the fiscal 1994 budget, 
implementing economic reforms, deregulating government controls 
on businesses and defusing Japan-U.S. trade tensions. 
  As representatives of the seven ruling coalition parties 
ended talks today aimed at picking a successor to outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, discord among them over who should 
be chosen and how to choose is pushing an already fragile 
alliance to the verge of division. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest political 
force in the coalition, proposed holding a meeting of coalition 
leaders on Monday [11 April] to name a successor, party 
officials said. 
  The SDP, new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) are fighting the proposal by Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government Party) to 
pick Hosokawa's successor through representative dialogue. 
  The SDP told other coalition partners it was skipping the 
next round of talks, scheduled for this afternoon. 
  Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura, who is also chief 
cabinet 
secretary in the Hosokawa administration, has said that talks 
among party representatives are no longer functioning. He has 
proposed that coalition leaders meet to discuss the formation of 
a post- Hosokawa cabinet. 
  Rivalry within the eight-month-old coalition has intensified 
over the selection of a successor since last Friday when 
Hosokawa abruptly decided to step down and take responsibility 
for dubious financial dealings, and for the month-long deadlock 
in the Diet over the state budget for fiscal 1994. 
  Although coalition leaders agreed Saturday to pick 
Hosokawa's 
successor and to form a new cabinet by the end of this week, the 
SDP is resisting a move to name Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
one of the most promising candidates for the premiership, as new 
prime minister. 
  The Shinseito party, led by Hata, and the Komeito party 
envision a new government made up of parties which are in full 
accords on key issues such as tax reform and the nuclear 
situation in the Korean peninsula. 
  The SDP disagrees with this stand, saying that the top 
priority should be how to maintain the framework of a unified 
coalition and keep it in power. 
  According to political analysts, in the event of a new 
realignment of political parties, former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe and former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, both from the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), may emerge as front 
runners for the premiership. 
  Watanabe has maintained close relations with Ichiro Ozawa, 
Shinseito co-leader and the main strategist of the coalition, 
even through Ozawa bolted the LDP last summer to form the 
Shinseito party. 
  Appearing on television today with Hata and two other 
coalition leaders, Watanabe, also a former vice premier, 
signaled his willingness to run for prime minister if there are 
a "comfortable" number of LDP members who will support him. 
  However, SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama voiced skepticism 
about working together with the LDP saying, "there is no such 
possibility." 
  Differences in political outlook among coalition leaders 
became clear one month ago when discussions began on coalition 
members forming a single party. 
  Plainly put, the second act of Japan's political regrouping 
is now in progress. Act one was the fall of the LDP, which had 
dominated Japan's scandal-ridden political world for an 
uninterrupted 38 years, and the birth of the Hosokawa-led 
coalition government. 
  There now appears to be two options for the second 
realignment, political sources said. One would be the formation 
of a triangular structure made up of the LDP, a group 
encompassing Shinseito and Komeito, and a third bloc comprising 
the SDP, the DSP, and Sakigake. The other option would lead to 
two large conservative parties, one led by the LDP and the other 
by newer conservatives. 
  Power struggles between the Shinseito-Komeito-JNP [Japan New 
Party] camp on one hand and a group comprising the SDP, the DSP 
and Sakigake on the other has intensified as the former has 
tried to unify the coalition members into one party. 
  They maintain that the coalition must unite as one party 
under a new electoral system to prevent the opposition LDP from 
recapturing power in the next general election. 
  Some analysts have long predicted that the Hosokawa 
government was doomed because political reform was achieved in 
January focusing on the introduction of a new single-seat 
electoral system for the House of Representatives. 
  After accomplishing this reform, Hosokawa charted new 
political terrain by proposing economic and administrative 
reforms as new policy goals. Since then, the coalition 
government has been troubled by internal divisions. 
  The Hosokawa cabinet will remain as caretaker until a new 
prime minister is chosen by the end of this week. No matter who 
takes the reins of the new government, there is a bumpy road 
ahead for the ruling coalition.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 7 (XINHUA) -- Malaysia's 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi today met with visiting 
Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. The two sides 
expressed during the meeting the confidence that the existing 
bilateral friendly relations would be enhanced. 
  Abdullah and Tang reviewed with satisfaction the all-round 
fruitful cooperation between the two countries since their 
establishment of diplomatic relations on May 31, 1974. 
  Both believed the bilateral cooperation was very important 
to 
the prosperity of the two countries and the stability of the 
region. 
  Tang arrived here on Tuesday [5 April] to attend the third 
round of consultation between officials of the foreign 
ministries of the two countries. 
  During a consultation meeting yesterday, Tang and Ahmad 
Kamil 
Jaafar, secretary-general of the Malaysian Foreign Ministry, 
exchanged views in a friendly and cordial atmosphere on 
bilateral, regional and international issues, and reached a 
broad consensus. 
  The two sides also discussed the issue of the Nansha 
[Spratly] Islands and arrived at understanding to some extent. 
  The Chinese side pointed out that the Nansha Islands have 
been China's territory since old times, judging either from the 
historic origins or legal principles. China holds indisputable 
sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and their surrounding sea 
waters. 
  He said that countries concerned should seek peaceful 
solution to the dispute over Nansha through negotiations. In 
this respect, he proposed, the sole effective way towards a 
possible solution and to peace and cooperation is to shelve the 
dispute for joint exploitation of Nansha. 
  The Chinese side noted that this proposal was entirely based 
on the consideration of advancing Sino-Malaysian friendship and 
maintaining peace and stability in the region. 
  Tang also put forward several principal viewpoints on the 
subject for the Malaysian side to consider. 
  Kamil Jaafar expressed his consent to the idea for a 
solution 
of the Dispute over Nansha in a peaceful manner through dialogue 
and consultation. 
  He said the Malaysian side will seriously study the views of 
the Chinese side, and will further discuss within a bilateral 
framework with the Chinese side the joint exploitation of Nansha 
by shelving the dispute. 
  The Chinese vice-minister and his party left here for Brunei 
today.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reiterated here today that 
China would hope concerned parties take more flexible and 
practical steps for comprehensive progress in the peace process 
of the Mideast. 
  Qian made the remarks when holding talks with Faruq Qaddumi, 
foreign minister of the State of Palestine, who arrived in 
Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a six-day visit to China. 
  Qian said that disputes between countries can only be 
settled 
through peaceful negotiations, which he said was well 
demonstrated by the signing of an agreement between Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on implementing a 
declaration of principles for Palestinian self-rule on the West 
Bank and in Gaza. 
  The Mideast issue is a regional conflict which has lasted 
longest, ever since the end of the Second World War, Qian said, 
and the road to peace is still long and difficult. 
  He said that the Hebron massacre which occurred this 
February 
shows it an urgent issue to settle Palestinian question. 
  Qian said that China firmly supports the Mideast peace 
process and will, as always, support the just cause of the 
Palestinians. 
  Qaddumi, also director of the Political Department of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, offered a detailed account of 
negotiations between Palestine and Israel as well as between 
other Arabian countries and Israel, and the situation in the 
occupied territory. 
  Qaddumi stressed that the security of the Palestinians in 
the 
occupied territory should be guaranteed according to the 
resolutions adopted by the United Nations, and his organization 
will continue to make efforts for a political settlement of the 
Palestinian issue. 
  He also called for an early military pull-out by Israel so 
as 
to ensure a smooth implementation of the agreement on 
Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in Gaza. 
  The Palestinian foreign minister extended his thanks for the 
support from the Chinese Government and the Chinese people for 
the just cause of the Palestinian people. 
  Following the talks, the two ministers signed an agreement 
on 
economic and technical cooperation between the two countries, 
according to which China will provide an interest-free loan of 
75 million yuan renminbi. 
  This is the second loan China has granted to Palestine. Last 
year, it offered a loan of 30 million yuan renminbi to 
Palestine, which is also free of interest. 
  According to an exchange of letters which was also signed 
today, China gave half a million U.S. dollars in cash as a gift 
to Palestine.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Apr (XINHUA) -- During a meeting with 
Qaddumi, foreign minister of the State of Palestine and chairman 
of the Political Department of the PLO, at the Great Hall of the 
People this morning, Vice President Rong Yiren said China has 
consistently stood for seeking a political solution to the 
Middle East question on the basis of the United Nations' 
relevant resolutions. 
  Rong Yiren said: The signing of an agreement on autonomy 
between Palestine and Israeli shows that the Palestinian issue 
can be solved through peace talks. 
  He said: China hopes the relevant resolutions on the 
situation in the Palestinian occupied territories, which were 
adopted by the United Nations Security Council recently, will be 
implemented, and hopes that all relevant parties will continue 
to work hard for realizing all-around peace in the Middle East 
region at an early date. 
  Rong Yiren said: China supports the peace process in the 
Middle East and, as always, supports the Palestinian people's 
cause in restoring their legitimate national rights. China 
believes that the traditional friendship and friendly 
cooperation between the people of the two countries will 
continue to develop. 
  Rong Yiren asked Qaddumi to convey President Jiang Zemin's 
and his personal regards to President 'Arafat. 
  Qaddumi conveyed President 'Arafat's regards to Jiang Zemin, 
Rong Yiren, and other Chinese leaders. 
  The foreign minister also briefed Rong Yiren on the current 
situation in the Middle East and noted that the PLO will strive 
to continue the peace negotiations patiently in order to realize 
the Palestinian people's legitimate national rights at an early 
date.

  [Text] Beijing, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Faruq Qaddumi, 
foreign minister of the State of Palestine, said that the 
Palestinian issue should be solved according to relevant U.N. 
resolutions, and that the Palestine Liberation Organization 
(PLO) will continue to make efforts for a political settlement 
of the issue. 
  Qaddumi, also director of the PLO Political Department, made 
the remarks in an interview with XINHUA yesterday. 
  Qaddumi arrived in Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a 
six-day visit to China as guest of Chinese Vice Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and left here today for Tianjin, a 
north China port city. 
  Qaddumi told XINHUA that his current visit here is to 
further 
strengthen the friendly cooperative relations with China and the 
traditional friendship between the Palestinian and Chinese 
peoples. 
  He said that during his stay in Beijing, he held talks with 
his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen and met Chinese Vice 
President Rong Yiren, and exchanged views with them on the 
Middle East issue while briefing them on the negotiations 
between Palestine and Israel as well as between other Arab 
countries and Israel, and the situation in the occupied 
territory. 
  Qaddumi stressed that Israel should withdraw from the 
occupied territory so as to ensure a smooth implementation of 
the agreement on Palestinian self-rule on the West Bank and in 
Gaza. 
  He said that the PLO will make efforts and continue peaceful 
negotiations for an early realization of the legitimate rights 
of the Palestinians. 
  The foreign minister, who has visited China eight times, 
expressed his thanks for the consistent support from the Chinese 
Government and the Chinese people for the just cause of the 
Palestinian people. 
  He regarded the Palestine-China agreement on economic and 
technical cooperation signed by him and Vice Premier Qian as an 
important result of his current visit, according to which China 
will provide an interest-free loan of 75 million yuan renminbi.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The Bosnian Serb 
military command last night strongly protested against an 
earlier NATO air strike and decided to suspend all its contacts 
with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROROR) in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  NATO's two American F-16 warplanes bombed artillery 
positions 
of the Serb forces south and southeast of Gorazde, a 
Serb-besieged Muslim enclave, yesterday evening. 
  It was the first time during the two-year Bosnian war that 
the United Nations requested attacks on ground positions. In 
late February, NATO war planes shot down four Serb aircraft 
which violated the "no-fly zone" over Bosnia. 
  The attack, launched under the U.N. request, aimed to 
protect 
12 U.N. military observers in the Gorazde region from threatened 
Serb shellings, said the U.S. Defense Ministry [as received]. 
  However, the headquarters of the Serb forces said in a 
statement that there was no threat at all to the UNPROFOR in 
Gorazde and the NATO air attack was "groundless." Therefore the 
raid had led the United Nations into the civil war of Bosnia, it 
added. 
  The statement noted that NATO's attack was mounted to rescue 
the Muslims from defeat in their spring offensives and to block 
the realization of the Serb proposal for a "perpetual ceasefire 
throughout Bosnia." 
  The Serb statement went on to say that the U.N. action was 
one for encouraging the Muslim forces, whose aim in launching 
the offensive was to provoke Serbs' counter-attacks and make 
them a pretext for foreign military intervention. 
  In conclusion, the statement said that the Serbs were not to 
be cowed but would use every possible means to defend themselves.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- A series of measures 
taken by the Chinese Government has managed to check illegal 
entrepot trade of textiles, an official said here today. 
  Addressing the fourth national conference on cracking down 
on 
activities of illegal entrepot trade of textiles, Vice-Minister 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said 
that in the recent period, the Chinese Government has 
strengthened its work on striking back at illegal entrepot trade 
activities. He added that leading members of departments of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation, customs and departments 
for inspection of import and export commodities throughout the 
country as well as various textile companies have strengthened 
their leadership over the work and have laid down a series of 
rules and regulations on it. 
  Meanwhile, Vice-Minister Shi said, many documents are being 
distributed and the mass media are being used to publicize the 
significance of the work to allow more enterprises to understand 
the severe harmfulness of illegal entrepot trade of textiles. 
  He explained that illegal entrepot trade of textiles refers 
to those activities of enterprises or individuals trying illegal 
methods to bypass the administration of textile rations and 
export Chinese-made textiles through a third country or region 
to those countries and regions which ration the quantity of 
imported Chinese-made textiles. 
  Vice-Minister Shi stressed that China will continue to 
actively cooperate with the governments of countries and regions 
concerned to crack down on activities of illegal entrepot trade. 
  The current conference was sponsored jointly by the Ministry 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General 
Administration of Customs and the State Administration for the 
Inspection of Import and Export Commodities. 
  Zhou Keren, director of the Department of Trade 
Administration of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, announced at the conference today that four 
enterprises in Liaoning, Fujian and Guangdong Provinces have 
been severely punished for their activities in illegal entrepot 
trade of textiles. 
  Shankou Company under Dongmao Industrial Co. Ltd. in 
Shenyang, Capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China, 
signed in August 1993, with a Hong Kong company to export 6,200 
dozens of cowboy shorts and 1,980 dozens of pajamas for ladies 
to Singapore. The products were made by three factories in 
Shenyang, in Guangdong Province and in Yingkou city. However, 
they were labelled Fijian- made and were transited to the United 
States in October and November in the same year. 
  The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation has decided to confiscate all the earnings from the 
business of Shankou Company, cut off all its quotas of export 
textiles from the business, and deprive it of its right to apply 
for such quotas in 1994. Besides, the ministry also ordered the 
Shenyang city committee of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation to have all the business activities of the company 
suspended. The ministry also suggested that the departments in 
charge of the company should sanction disciplinary actions for 
those people who are responsible for the illegal business. 
  The other three enterprises punished were Guangyu Xiamen Co. 
Ltd. in Fujian Province, and Shifa Garment Co. Ltd. and Yongjia 
Garment Co. Ltd., both in Shantou city, south China's Guangdong 
Province.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Zheng Degang (6774 1795 0474) and </F>
XINHUA reporter Jiang Jun (1203 6511)] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 10 Apr (XINHUA) -- Four enterprises in 
Shenyang, Fujian, and Guangdong have been sternly punished by 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] 
for engaging in illegal entrepot trade in textile products. 
  At the fourth national conference held today to crack down 
on 
illegal exports of textile products through transit trade, Zhou 
Keren, director of the MOFTEC Control Department, announced the 
circular on the decision to punish the four enterprises. 
  The circular said: In August 1993, the Shankou branch of the 
Dongmao Industrial Company in Shenyang singed a contract with 
the Zhuoxing Company in Hong Kong to export 6,200 dozen jeans 
shorts and 1,980 dozen knitted women's pajamas to Singapore. 
This batch of goods was processed and manufactured by the 
Fulong Garment Plant in Guangdong's Zhongshan, the Xiangjing 
Woolen Garment Plant in Shenyang, and the Warp Knitting Plant in 
Yingkou City. The goods were labeled "made in Fiji." In 
October and November last year, the goods were shipped in 
batches to Singapore and then re-exported to the United States. 
The goods were tracked down and seized by the U.S. Customs. 
The MOFTEC has decided to confiscate the income of the Dongmao 
Industrial Company derived from this business deal; to cancel 
all its textile product export quotas as well as its right to 
apply for a textile product export quota for 1994; and to order 
Shenyang City's Commission of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation to suspend all business activities of the Shankou 
branch of this company. The MOFTEC has suggested that the 
competent department mete out administrative punishment to those 
who are directly responsible for this matter. 
  In June 1993, the Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company in 
Fujian signed a contract with Taiwan's Jianru [Chienju] 
Enterprise Company, Limited to export 8,500 towel coverlets to 
Taiwan. In accordance with the request of this Taiwan firm, the 
Guangyu Shareholding Xiamen Company attached labeles saying 
"made in Thailand," provided by the Taiwan firm, on the customs 
declaration, invoice, and packing list. In July of the same 
year Qingdao customs discovered the goods when the company 
submitted its customs declaration. The MOFTEC has decided to 
fine the company a sum of 20 percent of the value of the 
contract, suspend its textile product export right for two 
years, and correspondingly reduce Xiamen city's textile export 
quota for 1995. 
  The two other companies receiving punishment are garment 
plants in Guangdong Province's Shantou City. One is Shantou 
city's Shifa Dress-Making Company, Limited. In the crevices of 
the "washable" labels of 1,560 cotton shorts it manufactured for 
export were stitched made in Hong Kong" labels. In September 
1993, this batch of goods was discovered and seized by a product 
inspection organ. The company had been punished. The other was 
the Yongjia Garment Manufacturing Company, Limited in Shantou 
city. All 4,080 pair of cotton shorts it processed and 
manufactured for export were sewn with "made in Hong Kong" 
labels covered by offset printing paper printed with the words 
"made in China." In December 1993, this batch of goods was 
seized by a goods inspection organ, and the company had been 
punished. 
  The penalties meted out to these two enterprises by the 
MOFTEC were: suspending the two companies' textile product 
export rights for two years; correspondingly reducting 
Guangdong's textile export quota for 1995; and suggesting that 
the competent department mete out administrative punishment to 
those directly responsible for the fraud. 
  The circular urged the relevant foreign trade and economic 
cooperation commissions in the areas mentioned in the circular 
to concentrate on checking the textile product and garment 
processing enterprises in their respective areas to prevent 
recurrences of similar incidents, and asked customs not to 
handle export customs declarations for these few enterprises 
whose textile product export rights have been temporarily 
suspended.

  [Text] Shanghai, 4 Apr (XINHUA) -- The China Foreign 
Exchange Trading Center [CFETC] officially began its trading 
operations here today. 
  This means that beginning today the interrelation between 
supply and demand reflected on the national foreign exchange 
open market with this center as the core will become the 
authoritative basis for deciding exchange rates in China; and 
that the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Market, which was established 
in 1988 as a regional trading center, has been promoted to a 
national foreign exchange trading center. 
  This national unified foreign exchange trading system, which 
links up with such big cities as Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, 
Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, began operation at around 0900. Only 
the dollar was traded today. On a huge computer screen, the 
opening rate was displayed as 8.681 yuan to the dollar; the 
day's high, 8.7265 yuan; the day's low, 8.681 yuan; and the 
weighted average, 8.6967 yuan. At 1100, trading closed for the 
day at a rate of 8.6908 yuan to the dollar. 
  Dressed in yellow vests, traders representing some 70 
brokerages and operators [zi ying shang 5261 3602 0794] took 
part in the first trading session today. Liu Guanghua [0491 
0342 5478], a trader from the international business division of 
the Agricultural Bank of China's Shanghai City branch, told this 
reporter in the trading hall: "Trading was relatively smooth 
and steady throughout the day." As a broker, he concluded on 
behalf of his clients two buying contracts amounting to $50,000 
at the respective rate of 8.68 and 8.69 yuan to the dollar, and 
17 selling contracts worth a total of $840,000 at rates ranging 
from 8.71 to 8.72 yuan. 
  According to an authoritative person from the center, the 
official inauguration of trading at the CFETC is a major step of 
substantive significance in China's financial reform this year 
and has laid solid material groundwork for establishing in China 
a single, managed floating exchange rate system based on supply 
and demand. 
  The reform of the foreign exchange system launched at the 
beginning of the year has passed its transitional period 
smoothly in the first quarter. With the unification of the 
dual-track renminbi exchange rates, steady market operations, 
and stable exchange rates during the transitional period, the 
transitional goal has been basically attained. Coming into the 
second quarter, we are to carry out full-scale reform of the 
foreign exchange control system and implement a system of 
interbank exchange settlement and selling. The CFETC was 
officially inaugurated in conjunction with this process. 
  According to a briefing, the CFETC, adopting an independent 
accounting system and a membership system, is a nonprofit, 
self-managed market organization, in which designated foreign 
exchange banks act as the main traders. With its advanced 
communications network and computer system, the center becomes 
the first of its kind in the world to be able to simultaneously 
conduct transactions and settlements based on the principle of 
"separate price quotations -- matching and transacting -- 
centralized settlement." The U.S. and Hong Kong dollars are the 
two currencies traded there for the time being. 
  It has been learned that 13 major domestic banks and more 
than 80 other Chinese and foreign banks and nonbank financial 
institutions will become members of the CFETC. Existing foreign 
exchange swap markets at various localities across the country 
remain open after the trading center was put into operation.

  [Text] The country's first interbank foreign exchange 
market has been operating smoothly since it started trading on 
Monday. 
  And the price of the U.S. and Hong Kong dollars remained 
fairly steady the past two days at the Shanghai-based China 
Foreign Exchange Trading Centre. 
  The US dollar opened at 8.6889 yuan and edged up to 8.6948 
yesterday. 
  The average weighted price of the U.S. dollar yesterday was 
8.6999 yuan, slightly higher than the previous average of 8.6967 
yuan. 
  Total transaction value on Monday and Tuesday was $89.77 
million. 
  More than 2 million Hong Kong dollars ($256,000) changed 
hands yesterday and the average price closed at 1.1275 yuan, 
slightly up from 1.1273 on Monday. 
  The centre only handles U.S. and Hong Kong dollar 
transactions. 
  But it has been hailed by market analysts as a major step 
forward in China's foreign exchange reform. 
  They say it will help make the country's rate truly reflect 
the supply and demand of foreign exchange. 
  Daily trading prices quoted on the market are referred to 
the 
central bank to set the next day's rate. 
  The central bank adjusts the exchange rate by buying and 
selling hard currencies on the market. 
  The official said it is hard to predict how the rate will 
change in the coming months, adding that its stability depends 
on the economy.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Pei Jianfeng: "Faint Hopes for Balancing </F>
Trade"] 
  [Text] Even though the growth in exports accelerated in 
the first two months of 1994, government experts are not 
optimistic about the prospects of balancing China's foreign 
trade this year. 
  Exports grew 13.6 percent during the first two months, 11.3 
percentage points higher than the same period last year. 
Imports, meanwhile jumped 20.5 percent, down 2.5 percentage 
points from a year ago. 
  Still, this left a trade deficit of $1.24 billion. 
  "From past experience, the beginning of a year is usually a 
period for more exports because commodities for export, 
especially agriculture products, are abundant at the time," said 
Wang Huaian, an economist with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation (Moftec). 
  At the same time, seasonal imports usually ebb because most 
domestic units are still drawing up plans for the year's 
imports, he said. Wang added that imports usually peak in the 
latter half of the year. 
  "It will be difficult for China to achieve a 1O percent 
growth in exports this year because there exist some 
unfavourable factors," Wang said. 
  The domestic market will continue to be brisk this year, he 
said, deterring enterprises from exporting their goods. 
Domestic price hikes squeeze exports by making them more 
expensive and trimming profit margins. 
  The devaluation of the renminbi, brought by the unification 
of the dual-track exchange rate system, has also reduced its 
purchasing power at home and pushed up the cost of exports, Wang 
said. 
  He noted that the pressure for imports is still rather 
strong 
this year. 
  The government hopes to slow down the growth of the economy. 
The official target this year is 9 percent growth in the gross 
domestic product. 
  But many local authorities are staking their plans on higher 
growth. 
  Such an economic expansion will surely stimulate the demand 
for imports, he said. 
  China wishes to set up more foreign-funded enterprises to 
bring in large quantities of imported equipment. 
  To improve its chances of re-entering the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), he said, China is opening its 
markets wider to worldwide competition. The government has 
lowered tariffs and cancelled import licenses and quotas for 
numerous products. 
  Because of these factors, Wang said a trade deficit seems 
inevitable this year. 
  But the deficit could be slashed from last year's $12.2 
billion because of some positive factors, he said. 
  The rapid growth of industrial and agricultural production 
will provide more products for export, and the convergence of 
renminbi exchange rates can facilitate exports and curb imports.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xie Jinhu (6200 6855 5706)] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Hu Ping, director of the 
State Council's Special Economic Zone [SEZ] Office, said after 
his inspection of the Pudong district: From now on, the 
development of special economic zones should shift from relying 
on preferential policies to relying on their own functions. 
  After a nine-day inspection, Hu Ping described Pudong's 
development and opening up as having very good momentum and 
being full of promise. He said: SEZ's should compete with one 
another in their development and opening up. Relying on 
preferential policies in development and opening up was a 
historical step of the past. Of course, the existing 
preferential policies will remain unchanged, but SEZ's should 
rely on their own functions in development hence. Pudong, as 
China's largest development zone, is making efforts to do so. 
For instance, it is taking a further step to improve 
foreigners' living environment, including providing a better 
shopping environment for foreign employees' wives and first-rate 
educational facilities and faculty for their children. These 
are the developments of their own functions, in relying on a 
superior environment of intangible factors to attract more 
investors. 
  Hu Ping said: The State Council has all along supported 
Pudong through its loan policy, and this support will not 
change. However, the development of Pudong has been proceeding 
very rapidly, and attention should be paid to making effective 
use of limited funds. I do not think that the present 
difficulties concerning a shortage of funds will affect Pudong's 
speed of development.

  [Text] Shenzhen, April 8 (CNS) -- Shenzhen, the special 
economic zone city in Guangdong Province, has seen rapid 
economic development in the past years, jumping to be the fifth 
strongest city in terms of economic strength in the country. 
  According to statistics from the municipal statistical 
bureau, Shenzhen was listed fifth in comparison and appraisal of

above-mentioned four big cities, its economic growth, however, 
was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than those of the four 
municipalities. 
  The city's GDP was only RMB 9.05 billion less than that of 
Tianjin. 
  Last year the city realized an export value of U.S.$8.335 
billion, ranking it first among the big cities in country with 
U.S.$953 million more than that of Shanghai which was listed

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (CNS) -- According to relevant 
departments, China will formulate a law to standardize 
government purchasing. 
  Purchasing by government includes the purchasing and leasing 
of equipment or projects and various related services by 
government organs and their subordinate units as well as by 
state-owned enterprises using public funds. There are several 
reasons for the legislating of this law. First, the purchasing 
of equipment by government with public funds can guarantee the 
construction of the state's key projects, make the most 
reasonable use of public funds and assure the preservation of 
value and increase of state-owned assets. Second, it is aimed 
at implementing the socialist market economy and introducing the 
competition mechanism into government purchasing in a bid to 
raise transparency and practising an open, equal and fair means 
of purchasing through public bidding. Third, the invitation of 
tenders can put government officials' behaviour under public 
supervision to avoid corruption. Fourth, the implementation of 
public bidding is beneficial to the orderly development of 
internal and international trade, offering opportunities to 
domestic and foreign businessmen. Fifth, the practice of public 
bidding make possible the keeping of enterprises' behaviour 
under legislative control, a move beneficial to enterprise 
self-construction. And sixth, the law will have a broad 
influence in socialist market legislation and great significance 
for the improvement of economic legislation in the country.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Government 
will suspend the approval of new futures corporations and 
re-examine the qualifications of existing futures firms, 
according to a senior Chinese official. 
  These are China's latest steps to avoid a possible 
"overheating" of the futures market and to bring the fledgling 
industry onto a healthy development track. 
  According to Zhu Li, secretary-general of China Securities 
Regulatory Committee, which was entrusted by the State Council 
last December to guide and monitor all futures trading in China, 
the country will also tighten the crackdown on underground 
futures trading. 
  The past two years have seen more than 500 futures 
corporations spring up across the country, of which 50 are 
Sino-joint ventures, and over 200 are unregistered ones. 
  At present there are 30 futures markets or trading centers 
in 
operation; trading items range from crude oil, farm produce, 
non-ferrous metal to black metal, building materials and 
treasury bonds. 
  However, many of these markets and corporations are not up 
to 
the required standards, Zhu said. 
  Moreover, some of the joint corporations are run for 
speculative purposes. They have employed whatever means 
possible to deceive Chinese clients, "resulting in the huge 
outflow of foreign currencies and great economic losses." 
  Zhu said that in the absence of a legal framework and 
international expertise, the futures trading at present in China 
should be done under strict supervision. 
  "Rushed experiments could only incur economic losses and 
even 
social unrest," said Zhu. 
  He revealed that the securities regulatory committee is 
working with relevant government departments in mapping out a 
more detailed plan to redress the disorder in the futures market.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Ding Jianming (0002 1017 6900)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State-Owned Property 
Administrative Bureau recently issued an urgent circular on 
state shares and share allocation, emphasizing that listed 
companies must uphold the rights and interests of 
state-shareholders during the new share allocation. 
  It is reported that some listed companies recently gave 
different treatments to state-shareholders, 
corporate-shareholders, and individual-shareholders with respect 
to new share allocation. Some companies ask state-shareholders 
to give up their right to new share allocation and let 
individual-shareholders enjoy the right exclusively. Other 
companies give state-shareholders cash dividends while 
allocating dividend shares to other shareholders. Such 
different treatments to shareholders hurt the legitimate rights 
and interests of state-shareholders. Besides, they do not 
conform to standards and international practices. 
  For this reason, the State-Owned Property Administrative 
Bureau, after consulting the China Securities Supervision and 
Administration Committee, issued the urgent circular calling on 
state-shareholders to effectively exercise their shareholder's 
rights and protect the interests of state shares at 
shareholders' meeting with respect to new share allocation. 
State-shareholders are urged not to blindly approve of new 
share allocations unless the company indeed needs more capital, 
unless issuing shares is the best way to raise the capital, 
unless the shares are issued at shareholders' request so as to 
maintain proper shareholding ratio, and unless 
state-shareholders have the ability to buy additional shares. 
Only under these conditions should state-shareholders agree to 
the allocation of new shares by listed companies. 
  The state-shareholders should use their veto power to stop 
new share allocations if the purpose of the capital fund-raising 
is unclear, if share allocation is not the best option, or if 
the state-shareholders do not want to make additional 
investments. If they are unable to stop the new share 
allocation, they should manage to buy the allocated shares, or 
sell their share allocation rights. Under no circumstances 
should they give up their share allocation rights. If the 
listed company is subject to the control of state- shareholders, 
the sale of the share allocation rights should not affect the 
controlling status of the state-shareholders. 
  The urgent circular emphasized: Presently the best way to 
sell the state-shareholders' share allocation rights is through 
negotiation, unless the securities supervision organ has other 
stipulations. 
  The urgent circular unequivocally demanded: At the 
shareholders' meeting, the state-shareholders should oppose the 
practice of giving state-shareholders cash dividends while 
giving other shareholders dividend shares, and stress the 
principle of same treatment to all shareholders. If the 
shareholders' meeting of a listed company decides to turn the 
common reserve funds belonging to all shareholders into new 
shares, it should allocate the new shares to all shareholders in 
proportion to the number of shares they are holding. Failure to 
allocate new shares to state-shareholders will violate their 
right to the common reserve funds and reduce the proportion of 
state shares. For this reason, state-shareholders should 
clearly and definitely oppose such a practice at the 
shareholders' meeting, and should not agree to the unilateral 
reduction of the proportion of state shares under any pretext. 
  The urgent circular emphasized: Local state-owned property 
administrative departments and the State Council's functional 
departments, if without proper authorization, are not permitted 
to approve the request of state-shareholders for giving up the 
new share allocation right, accepting unequal share and dividend 
distribution plan, or unilaterally reducing the proportion of 
state shares. 
  The person in charge of a relevant department of the 
State-Owned Property Administrative Bureau pointed out during an 
interview with this reporter that the urgent circular was issued 
to protect the rights and interests of state-shareholders and to 
promote a healthy development of the stock market and those 
enterprises selected for experiment on the shareholding system. 
He said: The permission given to transfer of 
state-shareholders' new share allocation rights through 
negotiation does not mean the right may be sold in open market. 
Its sole purpose is to correct the old practice which does not 
conform to standards and international practices.

<F P=106> [Fifth of seven question-and-answer talks sponsored by the </F>
State Economic and Trade Commission and the State General 
Administration of Taxation, chaired by Jiang Qiangui, director 
of the State Economic and Trade Commission's Enterprise 
Department: "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' 
Implementation of the New Tax System" -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [video begins with a wide shot showing two women 
and three men seated in a row: Jiang Qiangui; Chen Jie, deputy 
director of the State General Administration of Taxation's 
Turnover Tax Department, who answers questions asked by the 
moderator and other participants; Zhang Qipeng, chief accountant 
of the Beijing Municipal Automobile Industrial Corporation; Liu 
Jian, deputy director of the Beijing Medical Radiographic 
Equipment Plant; and Wang Zhiyu of the Policy and Regulations 
Section of the Ministry of Coal Industry] 
  [Jiang] Viewers, comrades: Today we are presenting the fifth 
lecture of the "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' 
Implementation of the New Tax System." In this lecture, we will 
mainly discuss consumption and resource taxes. Although 
consumption taxes will only be levied on products of (?11) major 
categories, they have drawn strong responses. Enterprises, 
especially mining enterprises and other resources-exploitation 
enterprises, are very concerned about resource taxes. Because 
consumption taxes were proposed, many comrades have asked: Both 
consumption and value-added taxes [VAT] are levied on some 
products. Is this a kind of double taxation? Director Chen, 
would you please explain this? 
  [Chen] First, I have to admit that this does involve double 
taxation. Why does the new taxation system stipulate that 
consumption taxes are to be levied on a small group of 
commodities because VAT is levied on the production and sales of 
all commodities? We call this method an integration of general 
regulation and special regulation -- this method currently has 
been adopted quite widely by many countries. From the viewpoint 
of enterprises' production and business operations, under market 
economic conditions, enterprises themselves should mainly decide 
what and how they want to produce. The undesirable effects of 
taxes and other economic polices on enterprises should be 
minimized. [passage omitted] 
  Why do we have to add consumption taxes? Why do we permit 
double taxation? First, we want to restrict the production and 
consumption of some products; second, we want to place 
restrictions on some products of which the supply has 
outstripped the demand; third, we want to ensure that taxes on 
some products will be considerably reduced within a specific 
period. Incidentally, consumption taxes will be grouped into 
two major categories in the future. The first category will be 
routine, or fixed, taxes, such as those on cigarettes and 
liquor, which will be limited by means of a special regulation. 
The other category is [words indistinct], which may be 
readjusted from time to time in the future, depending on the 
economic development situation. [passage omitted] 
  [Jiang] Many people, especially mining enterprises and other 
resources-exploitation enterprises, have expressed their 
opinions about the resource taxes. Some of them have said after 
the new system is instituted, it will be better to buy minerals 
than to excavate them. Would you please give your opinion on 
this? 
  [Chen] The new central taxation system still maintains its 
function of regulating resources. However, there are some 
differences in form. In the past, there was only one list of 
taxation rates, which was applicable to all mining enterprises. 
The new system provides two lists: The first one is the 
Provisional Regulations on Resource Taxes, which were 
promulgated by the State Council, and the other is an auxiliary 
tax rates list which sets the lowest and highest tax rates for 
each kind of mineral product. The State Council's regulations 
contain stipulations concerning the tax rates for nearly all 
kinds of products applicable to enterprises. But these 
regulations are a basic law, so they do not provide specific 
stipulations. [passage omitted] 
  [Wang] The resources tax rates are not very high and are 
considered local taxes. But, according to the Constitution and 
the Law on Mineral Resources, mineral resources belong to the 
state. Because of what reasons does the State General 
Administration of Taxation consider resource taxes to be local 
taxes? 
  [Chen] Resource taxes are regarded as local tax revenues. To 
be frank with you, the State General Administration of Taxation 
did not make the decision. The Finance Ministry studied the 
issue, and the central authorities made the decision. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Chain stores, a 
management method of modern commerce, are now cropping up in 
some large and coastal cities in China. 
  Chains spread into China in the 1980s when the "Kentucky 
Fried Chickens" and "California Beef Noodles" were allowed to 
set up chains in the country. 
  As the state-run commercial enterprises could not monopolize 
the market any longer, some commercial enterprises started to 
adapt themselves to the market economy and learned to establish 
their own chain stores at the end of the 80s and beginning of 
the 90s. 
  By now, some 200 enterprises from Shanghai have set up over 
800 chain stores in more than 20 provinces and cities; in 
Beijing, Xifu chain stores sell grain and local products in 
every corner of the city's residential areas; some 200 chain 
stores are scattered over the Pearl River Delta, an economically 
advanced area in south China. 
  Most of these chain stores are in fast food. 
  Some experts say that the development of chain stores in 
China is still in the primary stage and needs time to become 
fully-fledged. But an official from the Ministry of Internal 
Trade said that the government has an encouraging attitude to 
the chain stores and will assist their development.

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (CNS) -- Despite efforts made by 
the Chinese authorities at various levels to settle the problem 
of surplus rural labourers, the urban unemployment rate last 
year increased to 2.6 percent, up from 2.4 percent. 
  An official of the Ministry of Labour estimated that urban 
unemployment would reach three percent. Four reasons are seen 
as the cause of this rise. First, the supply of labourers 
surpasses the demand. Second, the growing number of bankrupt or 
closed enterprises, leading to the rising number of unemployed 
and the prolonging of unemployment. The unemployed this year 
are estimated to reach five million with 1.8 million of them 
needing financial relief. Third, surplus rural labourers have 
speeded up their migration and are now put at 20 million. 
Fourth, difficulties facing settlement of the unemployed have 
increased. 
  Competition and profit-seeking has brought employment 
difficulties in forestry, mining, railway labour and the defence 
industry.

  [Text] Wuhan, April 9 (XINHUA) -- A new society was founded 
on Friday [8 April] in Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei 
Province, to study how to speed up economic growth in the Chang 
Jiang River valley, one of the most developed areas in the 
country. 
  Qian Zhengying, vice-chairman of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 
serves as the honorary president of the newly established 
Yangtze [Chang Jiang] Society of Technological Economics. Guo 
Shuyan, vice-minister in charge of the State Planning 
Commission, serves as the president. 
  The society has five academic committees specializing in the 
study of developing energy resources, harnessing the Chang Jiang 
River and its tributaries, improving shipping services, 
promoting regional economic development and invigorating major 
state-owned enterprises. 
  The society was founded jointly by the Hubei Provincial 
Government, the Wuhan City Government, a subsidiary of the 
Chinese Ministry of Water Resources and a subsidiary of the 
Ministry of Communications. 
  The Chang Jiang River Valley, which produces 40 percent of 
China's gross domestic product, currently has 17 new- and 
high-tech development zones, a third of the nation's total. 
  The valley is expected to become China's economic center, 
with the construction of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, at the 
mouth of the Chang Jiang River, and the undertaking of the 
gigantic Three Gorges project on the river's middle reaches.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Dai Songcheng: "Foreign Capital Paves </F>
Way for Roadworks"] 
  [Text] China is attracting foreign investment and 
co-operation in building four trunk loads linking the country's 
east with the west and the north with the south. 
  The arteries will run from Tongjiang in Heilongjiang 
Province 
south to Sanya in Hainan; from Beijing south to Zhuhai in 
Guangdong; from Lianyungang in Jiangsu west to Huoerguosi in the 
Xinjiang Uygur autonomous Region; and from Shanghai west to 
Ghengdu in Sichuan. 
  They are expected to be completed by the year 2000, 
according 
to Minister of Communications Huang Zhendong. 
  The roads, with a total length of 140,000 kilometres, will 
go 
through more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions and link 
more than 100 major cities and important hubs. 
  Huang told the China Bidding Magazine that by the year 2000, 
China's roads will stretch 1.2 million kilometres, of which 
18,500 kilometers will be of high grade. 
  To speed up the construction of roads, which are still the 
lifelines of the country's communications system, China is 
poised to encourage more foreign investment and co-operation, 
Huang said. 
  The minister said a big influx of overseas capital is 
expected this year as investors from the United States, Canada 
and Western Europe swarm in seeking business opportunities. 
  "China not only welcomes foreign investors to co-operate 
with 
Chinese partners to invest in, construct and operate the roads, 
but also supports foreign involvement in the development of 
communication infrastructure through the `Build, Operate and 
Transfer' arrangement," Huang said. 
  "Build, Operate and Transfer" refers to a scheme in which 
foreign businessmen invest in the construction of a project, 
manage it for a fixed time, then hand over management and 
ownership to Chinese hands. 
  Huang said foreign investment has helped China build 1,700 
kilometres of roads, of which 370 kilometres are expressways or 
high-grade roads. 
  From 1991 to 1996, another 1,600 kilometres of highways and 
high-grade roads are expected to be completed with foreign 
co-operation. During this period foreign investment will also 
help build 3,000 kilometres of roads in rural areas and ordinary 
roads, Huang said. 
  Meanwhile, 23 provinces, municipalities and autonomous 
regions have used or will use loans from international financial 
institutions and foreign governments to build 7,000 kilometres 
of roads. 
  The total value of these loans amounts to about $1.7 
billion. 
  In addition, Huang said that the construction of ports, 
which 
was opened to foreign investors before road work, has also 
absorbed significant foreign investment. 
  To lure more overseas capital, he said, China now allows 
foreign investors to co-operate with their Chinese partners in 
building and operating public wharves, loading and unloading 
cargo, and leasing docks. 
  They are also allowed to build wholly-invested special 
channels and docks that are limited to the use of the owners. 
  Huang said that by the end of 1992, $1.66 billion in foreign 
capital had been used in building 29 ports. Of the 29 projects, 
nine have been completed. 
  Huang said that by 2000, China will have 1,100 berths of at 
least medium size, of which 650 will be in deep water.

  [Text] A few days ago, the State Council's commodity price 
inspection team arrived in Hubei to inspect the province's 
implementation of the national commodity price inspection effort 
and to keep abreast of market price developments. Since the 
State Council held a telephone conference on launching national 
commodity price inspection, the province's commodity price 
inspection work has been carried out intensely and in an orderly 
manner. Some cases of wanton price hikes and wanton collection 
of fees have been discovered, and 2,803 cases of price 
discipline violations have been handled. These cases involved 
funds totalling 36 million yuan, and funds derived from economic 
sanctions imposed on the cases total approximately 26 million 
yuan. Hubei Province's present commodity price situation is 
still quite grim. The provincial government has taken and is 
taking measures to regulate and control the situation. The 
measures included: On behalf of the provincial government, we 
will promulgate the provisional regulations of Hubei on 
combating exorbitant profits, and establish a grain, coal, and 
oil reserve system, a system of risk funds, and a system of 
regulatory funds for major foods such as meat, eggs, poultry, 
vegetables, and sugar and agricultural means of production. 
  The inspection team of the State Council will go to the 
rural 
areas, enterprises, and marketplaces of Wuhan, Jingzhou, Shashi, 
Yichang, and other localities to gain on-the-spot information 
about the prices of grain, coal, and oil, and of agricultural 
means of production, and to learn about the peasants' burdens, 
general market prices, and the prices of energy and raw and 
semifinished materials.

  [Text] At a provincial symposium on the utilization of 
foreign capital, which ended yesterday afternoon, Governor Zhu 
Senlin urged participants to seize opportunities, meet 
challenges, set a clear aim, and uplift the province's 
utilization of foreign capital to a new level. The governor 
pointed out: In utilizing foreign capital, our province should 
work hard to attain three goals this year: 1. We should 
actually utilize $10 billion in foreign capital and accelerate 
the transformation of old enterprises and the upgrading of 
products by using foreign capital. 2. We should continue to 
focus the utilization of foreign capital on infrastructure, such 
as the energy industry, communications, and telecommunications; 
on basic industries, such as the petroleum, chemical, iron and 
steel, electronic, and auto industries; on the development of 
agriculture which earns foreign exchange; and on the 
construction of poverty-stricken mountain areas. 3. Through 
various kinds of investment-attracting activities, we should 
attract more internationally well- known big enterprises and 
financial groups to invest in Guangdong, while continuing to do 
a good job in cooperating with medium-sized and small overseas 
enterprises.

  [Text] Zhuhai, April 8 (CNS) -- Zhuhai, a special economic 
zone city in Guangdong Province, plans to transfer a batch of 
well-known enterprises' shares rights worth at least RMB 
[renminbi] 1 billion to foreign businessmen, a move being seen 
as an important measure for collecting funds for construction in 
the city. 
  An official from the municipal government said that the 
enterprises with their shares rights transferred to foreign 
businessmen would be pillar ones in the city. They are now 
making good economic profits and their products already enjoy a 
broad market. The Dongda (Holding) Company, for example, has 
over one million square metres of land and is producing a range 
of famous daily-use chemicals and electrical and machinery 
products. 
  The news of the transferring of enterprise shares rights has 
aroused the strong interest of businessmen overseas with three 
enterprises' shares rights being sold to businessmen from 
foreign countries including Singapore and it is expected that 
another ten enterprises' shares rights will be purchased by 
foreigners within this year.

  [Text] According to a regional meeting held today to 
commend those who had made contributions to anti-smuggling work, 
success has been achieved in rounding off a stage of the 
anti-smuggling operation which the region launched in 1992 on 
instruction from the party's central authorities and the State 
Council. Now large-scale maritime smuggling activities have 
been basically quelled in the region. Over the past two years, 
a total of 236 smuggling cases were cracked, in which more than 
500 million yuan worth of smuggled goods were seized. 
  The purpose of this commendation meeting sponsored by the 
regional leading group for anti-smuggling operation is to sum up 
experience gained from anti-smuggling work in this region over 
the past two years, to commend those who performed 
outstandingly, and to further forward the anti-smuggling 
struggle in the region. Commended at the meeting were the Beihai 
customs office and 17 other outstanding collectives, as well as 
Peng Zhonglian and 46 other outstanding individuals. 
  Cheng Kejie, chairman of the regional government; Ding 
Tingmo, deputy secretary of the regional party committee; Yuan 
Zhengzhong and Liu Hong, vice chairmen of the regional 
government; as well as the person-in-charge of the National 
Anti-Smuggling Office, attended and addressed the meeting. 
  Chairman Cheng Kejie noted: Now the situation is excellent 
in reform and opening up in our region, and the region is 
enjoying social stability. In order to keep this trend, we must 
continue to do a good job in anti-smuggling work. It is 
necessary to uphold a resolute attitude in the anti-smuggling 
struggle, to make sure that investigations into major and 
important cases are precise, and to work together to push ahead 
the anti-smuggling struggle in this region by encouraging the 
public to report smuggling cases and by counting on the close 
support from departments concerned. 
  In their speeches, Deputy Secretary Ding Tingmo and Vice 
Chairman Liu Hong expressed full appreciation of the 
achievements made by the region in the anti-smuggling struggle. 
They stressed that leading people at all levels must have a 
thorough understanding of the role of the anti-smuggling 
struggle as an important, long-term, and complicated task, place 
anti-smuggling work on the order of the day, and strengthen 
leadership over the task. In this connection, it is necessary 
to launch and step up a comprehensive anti-smuggling operation 
by administrative, legal, economic, and educational means, to 
intensify operations, and to speed up investigations in major 
and important cases. Law-enforcing departments, such as the 
customs, border defense, and industrial and commercial 
administration sectors, must give full play to their respective 
functions, cooperate more closely with each other, and join 
forces in the anti- smuggling operation. 
  According to a plan mapped out by the National Leading Group 
Against Smuggling, an operation will be launched in the near 
future to examine the enforcement of anti-smuggling laws. The 
anti-smuggling sector and other related judicial departments in 
the region must play an active part in and give support to this 
operation. 
  During the meeting, Vice Chairman Yuan Zhengzhong briefed 
the 
participants on the progress the region has been making in 
reform and opening up, and on the development of various fields 
in the region. 
  Also present at the meeting were principal leading people of 
prefectures, cities, and counties along the border and the coast 
of the region, and people-in-charge of member units of the 
regional anti-smuggling leading group, the Liuzhou railway 
bureau, and the departments concerned directly under the 
regional authorities.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, when delivering a speech at 
the Fourth Session of the Discipline Inspection Commission of 
the Yunnan Provincial CPC Committee, Pu Chaozhu, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, emphatically pointed out: 
Strengthening the building of clean government and opposing 
corruption is a necessary condition and an important guarantee 
for the establishment of a socialist market economic structure. 
It is also a major issue which has a bearing on the success or 
failure of reform and the future and fate of the party and the 
state. He said: Since the central authorities issued the 
mobilization call to thoroughly wage a struggle against 
corruption in August, the provincial party committee and the 
provincial discipline inspection commission have attached great 
importance to the anticorruption struggle and all localities 
have given mobilization talks and made effective arrangements 
for the struggle. Achievements have been scored, in varying 
degrees, in the three tasks set by the central authorities: 1) 
Leading cadres at the county and office level have conducted 
inner-party democratic activities quite conscientiously and 
earnestly and carried out self-examination and self-correction 
in terms of incorruptibility and self-discipline. 2) Initial 
advances have been made in investigating and handling major and 
important cases. 3) Some unhealthy practices have been checked 
and initial success has been scored in rectifying selected 
departments. The whole struggle against corruption is 
progressing in depth and healthily. Facts have proved that our 
party is completely able to get rid of corruption by relying its 
own strength and the support of the masses. He said: As an 
important measure to maintain political stability, 
anticorruption work must solve the current outstanding problems 
in the improvement of party style and building of clean 
government in an active, reliable, and down-to-earth way; 
alleviate and eliminate social hot points; strive to create a 
stable social environment; ensure the smooth progress of reform 
and opening up to the outside world; and promote the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. 
  Pu Chaozhu emphatically pointed out: In regard to the 
anticorruption struggle, on the basis of continuing to 
consolidate what has been achieved in the three tasks of 
anticorruption in the previous phase, we should concentrate 
efforts, in a selective way, on the new contents given by the 
party Central Committee and the State Council to the three tasks 
for 1994 and give them a great deal of attention to ensure their 
gradual implementation. Leadership over anticorruption work 
should be effectively strengthened. The entire party should be 
mobilized and principal party and government leaders should 
personally take charge of anticorruption work and carry out the 
work level by level downward, with each level being responsible 
to the authorities above it. We should work hard to achieve 
marked results in implementing the three tasks, continue to do a 
good job of the issue of incorruptibility and self-discipline 
with cadres at the county and office levels, continue to devote 
great efforts to investigating and handling cases, and continue 
to check unhealthy practices. 
  As far as the struggle against corruption is concerned, we 
should encourage all members of society to participate in the 
struggle, combat corruption in a comprehensive way and by taking 
both radical and stopgap measures, and do a good job of 
anticorruption work by fully following the mass line and by 
relying on the masses. We should work out rules and 
regulations, augment the building of the legal system, 
strengthen supervision and inspection through publicity and 
education and the news media, give wide publicity to model 
individuals and advanced collectives honestly and diligently 
performing official duties for the people, foster a spirit of 
uprightness, make public corrupt behavior that is highly 
influential, combat evil trends, and teach all party members and 
the vast numbers of cadres to push the anticorruption struggle 
forward. 
  Present at yesterday's meeting were He Zhiqiang, Ling Huan, 
Yin Jun, Zhao Shumin, Lang Dazhong, Li Jiating, Zhang Baoshan, 
Meng Jiyao, Wang Tianxi, Zhao Tingguang, (Li Qun), (Li Lingge), 
(Li Lingde), and other leading cadres.

<F P=106> [Commentator's article "Control Population Growth and Build </F>
an Economically Strong Province"--marking the fifth anniversary 
of the promulgation of the "Hebei Provincial Regulations on 
Family Planning"] 
  [Text] It has been five years since the "Hebei Provincial 
regulations on family planning" were issued and put into effect. 
Formulation of the regulations indicated that Hebei began to 
manage its family planning work according to law. 
  Over the past five years, party committees and governments 
at 
all levels in the province have regarded enforcement of the 
"regulations" as an important part of the endeavors to 
strengthen the legal system and to disseminate laws and as the 
foundation for making family planning work successful. People's 
congresses and governments at all levels have made it a system 
to supervise the enforcement of the "regulations." Based on the 
"regulations," Hebei has also issued detailed rules for 
enforcement, methods for explanation and enforcement, 
comprehensive management measures, methods for managements of 
transients, and other supporting documents. Law-enforcement 
contingents for family planning have been established at all 
levels from higher levels downward. Nearly 50 percent of 
Hebei's counties and cities have established courts for 
implementation of family planning to protect the legal rights 
and interests of the masses. The extensive and intensive 
publicity and enforcement of the "regulations" through various 
measures have enabled the masses to understand and abide by 
laws, restrict their child births with the "regulations," and 
greatly raise their awareness in implementing family planning. 
The "regulations" have helped stabilize the family planning 
policies, standardize the government behaviors, and maintain 
close cadre-populace ties. The promulgation and implementation 
of the "regulations" have helped gradually change the passive 
situation in family planning work and effectively control the 
inordinately large population growth. Since 1991, Hebei has 
fulfilled the state-assigned population plans for three years in 
a row. During the third baby boom when the number of women at 
the peak child-bearing age period was increasing every year, 
Hebei's birth rate declined from 20.32 per thousand in 1988 
before the "regulations" were promulgated to 15.43 per thousand 
in 1933. Calculated on the basis of the 1988 birth rate, 
850,000 fewer babies were born in these five years. This played 
an important role in promoting Hebei's economic and social 
development. 
  We should also note, however, that there are still some weak 
links in the enforcement of the "regulations." Leaders of some 
localities have failed to regard management of family planning 
work according to law as an important task; the "regulations" 
have yet to be publicized very intensively and extensively and 
to be enforced comprehensively; rural people who do not 
understand or abide by laws are rather many, and multiple child 
births by party members and cadres in violation of discipline 
have remained conspicuous; some localities have failed to 
implement the regulations on punishments and rewards; some 
localities have failed to standardize management of work and 
even practiced fraud; and some cadres, thinking that all their 
acts, no matter what, are reasonable as long as they are taken 
for family planning, have resorted to oversimplified and rigid 
measures and even violated laws in their administration, thus 
affecting the party-populace and cadre-populace relations. This 
shows that enforcement of the "regulations" is a long-term task. 
  This year is an important year for promoting the overall 
economic reform and accelerating establishment of the socialist 
market economy system. A better job in family planning will 
have a very important significance in rural areas' endeavor to 
achieve a fairly comfortable standard of living more rapidly, in 
maintaining Hebei's good trend in economic construction and 
social development, and in building an economically strong 
province. Firmly focusing on economic construction, the central 
task, we should further implement the "regulations," 
institutionalize family planning more rapidly, ensure 
fulfillment of various population growth control targets, and 
raise Hebei's overall family planning work to a new level. 
  Implementation of the "regulations" has a bearing on 
reform, development, and stability, which meet the overall 
interests. This is because the new problems in family planning 
work arising in the process of establishing the market economy 
system should be addressed by deepening reform; because 
population is an issue on development, which can be 
fundamentally resolved only when consideration is given 
comprehensively to the relations between economic and social 
development and population growth control; and because family 
planning is the matter concerning the vital interests of 
thousands upon thousands of families and only when the 
"regulations" are comprehensively enforced can we maintain close 
party-populace and cadre-populace ties and safeguard the stable 
and united situation. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels 
should have a stronger sense of responsibility and more 
initiative in enforcing the "regulations," take the lead in 
studying, publicizing, and enforcing the "regulations," and be 
models in studying, understanding, and enforcing laws. 
  We should continue intensifying the publicity and 
application 
of the "regulations." As family planning is the mass work, 
publicity to the implementation of the "regulations" cannot be 
separated from the masses. Publicity should be given in a 
repeated, in-depth, and persistent manner to make the 
"regulations" known to every village and household. Meanwhile, 
publicity of the "regulations" should be coordinated with 
patient and meticulous ideological work and with the publicity 
of the good persons and good deeds in exemplary enforcement of 
the "regulations" so that the masses, especially peasants, will 
understand that only with fewer births can they achieve 
affluence and a fairly comfortable life at an early date. We 
should persist in the direction of incentive and let the people 
who implement the "regulations" of their own accord gain real 
benefits. Cadres at all levels, especially rural cadres with 
party membership, should publicize the "regulations" through 
their own exemplary implementation of the "regulations." 
  To implement the "regulations," we should carry out 
administrative work strictly according to law. The 
"regulations" not only put forward standards and requirements on 
the masses' child births but also standardize the government 
behavior and protect the legal rights and interests of the 
masses. All localities should conscientiously intensify the 
education and training of leading cadres, cadres in charge of 
family planning, and law-enforcement personnel so that they will 
strictly act according to the "regulations" and will never 
resort to oversimplified and rigid methods, violate laws, or 
exceed the bounds. In this way, they will not only succeed in 
family planning work but also maintain close party-populace and 
cadre-populace ties. 
  The market economy is a legally codified economy. The market 
economy also calls for establishment of necessary laws for 
family planning and higher demands on management of family 
planning according to law. Population is an economic, social, 
and development issue and also an important political issue. 
Party committees and governments at all levels should approach 
enforcement of the "regulations" from the perspective of the 
effort to seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open wider to 
the outside world, promote development, and maintain stability 
and, strictly meeting the demands of the "regulations," actively 
guide the masses to further embrace the ideas of giving births 
according to law, giving fewer births, and practicing sound 
upbringing and accomplish the population growth control targets 
in high quality to promote early attainment of the grand goal of 
building an economically strong province.

  [Text] The provincial party committee held a televised 
conference on rural work to relay the guidelines of the recent 
central rural work conference and arrange Jilin's rural work for 
this year. Attending the conference were provincial leaders He 
Zhukang, Wang Jinshan, Zhang Yueqi, Feng Ximing, Liu Yazhi, Xu 
Zhongtian, Wang Guofa, Quan Zhezhu, and (?Liu Xilin) as well as 
principal responsible comrades of various provincial departments 
and principal responsible comrades of city, autonomous 
prefectural, and county party and government organs. 
  Wang Jinshan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the conference. He Zhukang, secretary 
of the provincial party committee, gave an important speech. 
  He Zhukang first emphasized: We should correctly estimate 
the situation and enhance the sense of urgency toward the 
endeavor to make agricultural and rural work successful. The 
current overall rural situation is developing well, but we 
should never be unrealistically optimistic. We should remain 
clear-headed to understand that our current capacity for 
agricultural production is still low, that improving 
agricultural level is a task that takes time, that great efforts 
are needed in increasing the strength for sustained development, 
and that we must never lower our guard to neglect or slacken 
efforts in agriculture and rural work. Based on the guidelines 
of the central conference, the provincial party committee put 
forward eight demands on Jilin's agriculture and rural work for 
this year. 
  First, party committees and governments at all levels should 
conscientiously put agriculture and rural work in the first 
place of economic work and devote great efforts to them. This 
year is the last year for us to attain the target of promoting 
the economy to a new height in three years. According to the 
requirements of this target, grain output should exceed 19 
billion kg, agricultural output value should increase by 6 
percent, township enterprises' output value should grow by 33.3 
percent, and peasants' per capita income should exceed 1,000 
yuan. These tasks are very arduous. All levels must step up 
efforts to implement them in a down-to-earth manner, pay 
attention to key issues, and add impetus to work. 
  Second, we should adhere to the principle of developing the 
rural economy in all sectors. The general requirements are as 
follows: In grain production, we should concentrate efforts on 
per-unit yields, increase total output, tap potential, and 
reduce production cost; and in animal husbandry and other 
diverse production, especially township enterprises, which are 
currently the major ways to lead peasants to an increased income 
and affluence, we should regard them as the strategic priority 
of the rural economic work and accelerate their development. 
Proceeding from the specific local conditions, all localities 
should fully develop their advantages to comprehensively develop 
the agriculture and rural economy that reflect their own 
characteristics. 
  Third, we should strive to raise agricultural productivity. 
1) We should map out ways to enable surplus laborers to have 
work to do and peasants to [words indistinct] all the year 
round. 2) We should study ways to develop Jilin with the 
application of science and technology and the promotion of 
education, the ways to rely on scientific and technological 
advance to upgrade peasants' quality, and the ways to carry out 
extensive and in-depth activities to develop agriculture with 
the application of science and technology and the promotion of 
education, accelerate the dissemination and application of 
scientific and technological achievements, achieve success in 
the rural vocational and technical education, and improve the 
peasants' ability and level in making the best of rural 
resources. 3) We should study ways to restructure agriculture 
and rural production setup more rapidly in line with specific 
local conditions and develop high-yield, good-quality, and 
high-efficient agriculture. 
  Fourth, we should add impetus to reform to particularly 
address the difficulties in rural economic development. In the 
current endeavor to deepen the rural reform, we should give 
particular attention to stabilizing the relations in land 
contracts, clarifying ownership, stabilizing the rights to 
contract, relaxing control on land use rights, and establishing 
a reasonable mechanism for transfer. We should step up efforts 
to build markets, develop rural markets, connect urban and rural 
markets, accelerate the establishment of the socialized service 
system, and actively lead peasants to markets. We should 
develop the collective economy to expand the collective economic 
strength. We should continue the good job in the experimental 
zone for rural reform and development to blaze a new road for 
deepening the rural reform. 
  Fifth, we should devote earnest efforts to the 
implementation 
of various policy and measures. At present, we should 
particularly supervise and urge the implementation of the 
policies on supporting the rice sacks and vegetable baskets, the 
policies on reducing the burdens on peasants, the policies on 
the production and marketing of the means of agricultural 
production, the policies on service by increasing agricultural 
funds, and the policies on supporting the farm machinery, 
irrigation, and agricultural science and technology service 
systems. Leaders at all levels should not merely pay lip 
service to their effort to attach importance to agriculture and 
rural work. They should let this effort be manifest in their 
specific work. Strengthening agriculture and rural work is the 
major work for the entire party and entire society. We should 
establish effective systems for inspection, supervision, and 
guidance and regard implementation of policies as an important 
criterion for appraising the work styles and performance of 
cadres. 
  Sixth, we should ensure stability in rural society. Leaders 
at all levels should be aware of hardships and resolve well the 
hot issues with which the masses are much dissatisfied in a 
timely manner. The focuses are 1) to continue to successfully 
reduce the burdens on peasants, 2) to conscientiously strengthen 
rural public security work, and 3) to improve party style and 
administrative honesty. We should be firm in reducing the 
burdens on peasants. Based on the central guidelines, the 
provincial party committee reiterated the following work. 
  1) It is not permitted to continue collecting fees that 
should be canceled as stipulated in explicit central and 
provincial orders and to continue the activities for attaining 
certain targets and levels that should be canceled as stipulated 
in explicit orders. 2) It is not permitted to collect 
unwarranted funds from peasants this year, and those who do so 
should be held accountable. 3) Wanton collections of fees, 
donations, funds, and fines should be resolutely dealt with and 
banned. 4) All levels and all departments should inspect how 
they have implemented the regulations of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council and strictly deal with those who 
violate the regulations. Regarding the departments in charge 
which fail in this work, their leaders should be held 
responsible. Resolute efforts should be made in the 
comprehensive management of rural public security. Meanwhile, 
we should resolutely check the unhealthy trends within the party 
and in society, that the masses have many complaints, especially 
the healthy trends of extravagance, extortion, and exaggeration. 
We should resolutely oppose fraud. Those who resort to 
improper means to gain fame and cheat higher level should be 
investigated and have their responsibility affixed once 
discovered. 
  Seventh, we should succeed in improving rural grass-roots 
organizations. Party committees at all levels should attach 
importance to improvement of rural grass-roots organizations and 
achieve success in improving party branches, villagers' 
committees, villagers' collective economic organizations, and 
youth, women, and militia organizations so that they will 
continue to play their role in rural reform, development, and 
socialist construction. 
  Eighth, we should strengthen the rural spiritual 
civilization. We should conduct extensive education on 
socialism, patriotism, collectivism, and scientific and general 
knowledge, eliminate numerous bad feudal and superstitious 
customs and habits, and establish good social practice. We 
should strengthen family planning, raise the quality of the 
population, and develop the two civilizations in a coordinated 
manner. 
  In conclusion, He Zhukang emphasized: We should firmly 
embrace the idea of serving peasants and agriculture and 
maintain close ties with the masses. It requires the concerted 
efforts of all fields to achieve stable agricultural development 
and promote rural work. However, the most important thing is to 
rely on the vast number of peasants and fully stimulate their 
enthusiasm and creativity. With the issues on peasants resolved 
and agriculture promoted, we will have a reliable foundation for 
the development of all our undertakings. We should give heed to 
the views of peasants. In particular, leading cadres at all 
levels should often go deep into the reality of life to directly 
listen to the voice of peasants and learn about what they think, 
what they expect, what they support, and what they oppose. We 
should increase the transparency of rural economic management. 
With regard to financial management, in particular, we should 
make systems public and publish revenue and expenditure accounts 
for the scrutiny of the masses so that (?democracy in rural 
areas will be strengthened). We should protect the legal rights 
and interests of peasants. At present, we should earnestly 
address the hot issues which peasants are concerned about. We 
should adopt effective measures to solve the problem of usurious 
loans in rural areas. We should support and protect peasants' 
entrance into the market and create a market environment for 
competition on an equal footing. Any deeds that damage the 
interests of peasants, such as wanton price rises in the means 
of production, marketing of fake and inferior commodities, and 
forcible purchases and sales, should be strictly investigated 
and handled and resolutely corrected. We should show concern 
for peasants' hardships. All localities should conscientiously 
do a good job in helping those ridden by poverty and 
difficulties, with the focus on helping the areas with 
concentrations of poverty-stricken towns and townships, and 
mobilize and organize the masses to win a success in supporting 
the poor and achieving affluence. All levels and all 
departments should further change their work styles and improve 
their work methods. After this conference, major leading 
comrades of the provincial as well as city and county party and 
government organs should all devote a certain period to 
investigation and study activities in rural areas. They should 
hold heart-to-heart talks with the masses, pay attention to the 
opinions and expectations of grass-roots cadres and peasants, 
and clearly understand to what an extent the central and 
provincial policies have been implemented, the true conditions 
in rural reform, economic development, and peasants' life, and 
the major problems that dampen peasants' enthusiasm and affect 
rural economic development. They should look for effective ways 
together with the cadres and the masses to solve these problems. 
Spring farming will begin soon. Party committees and 
governments at all levels should concentrate efforts on spring 
farming to lay a good foundation for this year's bumper harvest. 
The provincial party committee is convinced that as long as 
party committees and governments at all levels in the province 
attach great importance and devote earnest efforts to 
implementation of the guidelines of the central and provincial 
rural work conferences, Jilin's agriculture and rural work will 
be promoted to a new level. 
  Comrade Wang Jinshan pointed out at the end of the 
conference: Party committees and governments at all levels 
should conscientiously organize cadres and the masses to study 
Comrade He Zhukang's speech, comprehensively understand its 
guidelines, implement them in doing their specific work, and 
strive for practical results. After this conference, all levels 
should put forward, as soon as possible, the specific opinions 
on implementation of these guidelines and submit them to the 
rural work office of the provincial party committee in the near 
future.

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan Affairs 
Office of the State Council published a speech here today to 
mourn over the deaths of the victims of a boat-fire and express 
condolences to the families of the deceased. 
  In all, 32 people, including 24 Taiwan tourists and eight 
mainlanders, were killed in a pleasure-boat fire on March 31 on 
Qiandao Lake in East China's Zhejiang Province. 
  The speech says that the State Council has shown great 
concern over the accident, instructing the Zhejiang Provincial 
Government to handle the accident properly and find out the 
cause of the accident as soon as possible. 
  The Ministry of Public Security, State Tourism 
Administration 
and Zhejiang Province have surveyed the site and searched for 
the remains of the victims. 
  The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits 
(ARATS) of the mainland has passed on reports from Zhejiang 
Province to the Straits Exchange Foundation of Taiwan. 
  At present, the cause of the fire is still under 
investigation. 
  The office believes that Taiwan compatriots understand the 
mainland's efforts and measures in handling the accident. It 
hopes the Taiwan side would view the accident objectively and 
soberly so as to prevent agitators from stirring up incidents 
which may harm the relations across the straits.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Relatives of the 24 
Taiwanese tourists who perished recently in a mainland boating 
accident left for Hong Kong with the ashes of the victims this 
morning. 
  A Chinese airliner, originally scheduled to fly directly 
from 
Shanghai to Hong Kong, made a stopover here to take on the 
relatives of the 24 victims, who died on March 31 when the boat 
they boarded burst into flames on Qiandao Lake. Also dead in 
the accident were eight mainland crew members. 
  Liu Xirong, vice-governor of Zhejiang, extended condolences 
to each of the relatives before they boarded the plane. 
  He said the mainland people shared the same feeling as the 
Taiwan compatriots. He asked them to take care and convey his 
regards to other relatives back in Taiwan. 
  Officials from other departments also saw the Taiwanese off 
at the airport. 
  The possibility of sabotage is not ruled out, according to 
sources from authoritative departments, who found suspicious 
clues in the investigation. 
  Public security departments are all out to dig up the cause 
of the accident. Results will be released to the public timely 
and in a proper way. If evidence confirms that the accident was 
staged, the culprits will be severely punished according to the 
law, said the sources.

  [Text] Tonglu, 7 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- It was 
drizzling this afternoon. The relatives of the Taiwan 
compatriots who died in the "31 March Hairui pleasure boat fire" 
came to the funeral parlor in Tonglu [a county southeast of 
Hangzhou], Zhejiang Province to pay their last respects to the 
remains of the deceased. 
  At 0755, the cremation of the first body began. 
  Earlier, at 0630, reporters arrived at the Tonglu funeral 
parlor to find themselves in a spacious mourning hall permeated 
with an atmosphere of solemnity. The coffins of the 24 
Taiwanese victims were shrouded in green silk covers and laid 
neatly in a line. 
  Both sides of the mourning hall were lined with wreaths from 
relevant departments and individuals from the mainland and 
Taiwan. 
  Under a banner which read, "Mourning with deep grief the 
death of our compatriots," stood the portraits and name tablets 
of the deceased. 
  At 0645, relatives of the Taiwanese victims came to the 
mourning hall. Facing portraits of their loved ones, they 
burned incense, paid their respects on bended knee, and went 
through mourning procedures according to Taiwan customs. 
Afterward, the relatives chose cinerary caskets for the 
victims. Some of them had brought cylindrical caskets with them 
from Taiwan. 
  Ma Shiyong [7456 2514 7167], vice mayor of Hangzhou, 
attended 
the mourning ceremony with his office personnel. He said: We 
are here today with deep grief and would like to express our 
heartfelt condolences over the deaths of the victims and 
sympathy for their families on behalf of the provincial, city, 
and county governments. We hope you will restrain your grief and 
take care of yourselves. 
  Afterward, Ma Shiyong and his office personnel bowed three 
times to the portraits of the Taiwanese victims as a gesture of 
condolence, to which the victims' relatives responded. 
  It is learned that today's mourning ceremony and cremation 
had been arranged according to the wishes of the victims' 
families. 
  The cremation of the Taiwanese victims' bodies will continue 
until the morning of 8 April. 
  Information from another source said that by yesterday 
afternoon [6 April], the bodies of eight mainland victims had 
been cremated or buried. (Because Chunan is a mountainous area 
and lacks a crematorium, crew members from Chunan who died in 
the accident were buried there.)

  [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- In statements made 
over the past few days over the boat tragedy in Zhijiang's 
Qiandao Lake, some politicians in Taibei [Taipei] have voiced 
such words as "boycotting" mainland tours and investments, 
"adjusting cross-strait exchange measures," and "suspending 
cross-strait working level talks." Some even seized the 
opportunity to advocate "Taiwan Independence." This phenomenon 
has aroused concern on and outside the island. 
  In its 10 April editorial, Hong Kong's HSIN PAO said that 
Taiwan officials' criticism of mainland over the Qiandao Lake 
incident can be said to be unprecedented in recent years. 
Whether the Taiwan authorities will slow down development of 
cross-strait relations because of this incident is worth giving 
thought. 
  Brief commentaries and column articles carried by the TAIWAN 
WORLD FORUM [shi jie lun tan bao 0013 3954 6158 1086 1032] said: 
As the Qiandao Lake boat tragedy is an isolated incident that 
has unfortunately taken place, it should be analyzed objectively 
and calmly so that its aftermath can best be dealt with and not 
to push the incident toward a political confrontation between 
the two sides of the strait. Its brief commentary pointed out: 
Cross-strait peace will benefit both sides; although the 
Qiandao Lake incident has grieved people, if it is to be viewed 
from the perspective of the state and the nationality as a 
whole, it virtually should not go to the extent of retrogressing 
the cross-strait relations that only serves to sadden our own 
people and gladden the enemy. 
  Some Hong Kong and Taiwan media also criticized certain 
people on the island for capitalizing on the unfortunate 
incident to advance advocation of "Taiwan Independence," an act 
of self-deceiving "political morphine" that is doomed to fail.

  [Text] The Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] has asked 
Mainland China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Straits [ARATS] to hold an emergency meeting about the Chientao 
[Qiandao] Lake tragegy. Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] Chairman 
Huang Kun-hui said Friday [8 April] if the mainland side failed 
to respond favorably, the government is ready to make a proper 
review of relations between two sides. He did not elaborate. 
  A tourist boat reportedly exploded in flame while crossing 
Qiandao Lake in Mainland China's eastern province of Chekiang 
[Zhejiang] on 31 March. Thirty-two people, including 24 Taiwan 
tourists, were killed. All urged mainland authorities to make 
public the cause of the incident and measures being taken to 
cope with the aftermath. They should give the victims' families 
a clear detailed account rather than making excuses like causes 
of death unknown. 
  In addition, government spokesman Jason Hu said the 
government will call a series of international press conferences 
to recount the inhuman treatment the Taiwan visitors suffered in 
the Qiandao Lake incident.

  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- President Lee Teng-hui 
Saturday [9 April] called Beijing's handling of the Lake Qiandao 
disaster "shoddy," saying mainland officials had acted like "a 
bunch of bandits." 
  Li made the remarks while touring Chungshing new village. 
  He stressed that government should be a government "of the 
people [words indistinct] saying that the Communist Party is 
made up of [word indistinct] elements and they have acted like a 
bunch of bandits, he said that such a government should have 
been discarded by the people long ago. 
  Meanwhile, Huang Kan-hui, chairman of the Mainland Affairs 
Council, condemned Beijing's handling of the case as "barbaric 
and shameless." 
  It was the harshest criticism of Beijing's authority from 
any 
ministerial-level official since the government adopted an open 
policy toward the mainland. 
  He also criticized Beijing for having repeatedly turned down 
requests from Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation to send an 
official to the mainland to assist the victims' relatives. 
  Huang accused Beijing of trying to cover up the truth by 
barring reporters and the relatives from examining the [word 
indistinct] boat.

  [Text] On 8 April, President Li Teng-hui harshly condemned 
the Chinese communist authorities' utter disregard for human 
life as shown in the fire aboard a cruise-boat on Chientao 
[Qiandao] Lake. President Li said: The Chinese communist 
authorities are killing our countrymen and behaving like 
bandits. Can such a government [zheng fu] be called a 
government? 
  President Li said the Chinese people should have renounced 
such a regime [zheng quan] a long time ago. 
  President Li stated: [begin Li recording] A large group of 
evil forces, (?with the support of) a party, have behaved like 
bandits. Look, they have killed many of our countrymen! Right? 
How can such a government be called a government? The people 
should have renounced it a long time ago! [end Li recording] 
  President Li made this comment at a meeting with 336 
township, town, and city mayors--a meeting sponsored by the 
Taiwan Provincial Government in Chung Hsing New Village. 
  President Li stressed that while the Republic of China now 
enjoys the most democratic period and greatest freedom in its 
history, people in government offices should still understand 
that power comes from the people, and thus the government must 
properly accomplish all assignments entrusted by the people. 
People in high office should by no means think they have 
absolute power.

  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Chairman Huang Kun-hui of 
the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] on Saturday blasted Beijing 
as "irresponsible, unresonable, and having no basic respect of 
human rights" or its handling of the Lake Qiandao disaster, in 
which the charred bodies of 24 Taiwan tourist and eight mainland 
crew members and guides were found aboard a tour boat. 
  "There are so many doubts that have yet to be cleared up 
about the disaster," Huang said in a press briefing held at 
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The briefing was 
attended by some 150 foreign and local reporters, as well as 
relatives of the Taiwan victims. 
  The deaths occurred March 31 on Lake Qiandao, or Thousand 
Island lake, in the coastal Province of Zhejiang. The bodies 
were found one piled on top of another, most of them burned 
beyond recognition, in the lower-deck cabin of a cruise boat. 
  Huang listed several challenges to Beijing's claim that the 
deaths are accidental, and not the result of a robbery. 
  --The cruise was first reported missing at 5 p.m. on March 
31 
and was found on fire at 8 a.m. the next day. How could the 
searchers fail for 15 hours to find the burning boat, and how 
could the fire last for so long? 
  -- Why were the 32 victims found in the lower-deck cabin? 
Why didn't the four crew members, reported to be excellent 
swimmers, or any on the other victims jump off the boat to 
escape the fire? 
  -- Why were only the upper parts of the bodies charred while 
their lower parts remained roughly intact? 
  -- Why were only a few personal belongings of the victims 
found, and not all the belongings they were known to be carrying? 
  -- Why were autopsies performed on the bodies without the 
prior approval of the relatives? 
  -- Why did Beijing bar the relatives from taking pictures of 
the ship and reject their request to take the bodies back to 
Taiwan? 
  -- Why didn't the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan 
Straits, which is authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan, 
immediately inform its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange 
Foundation, about the incident? Why did Beijing refuse to allow 
the SEF to provide humanitarian assistance to the relatives on 
the mainland? 
  -- Why did Beijing bar reporters from approaching the site 
and from interviewing the relatives? 
  While calling on international human rights organizations to 
show more concern about the incident, Huang said that Beijing's 
failure to clear up doubts about it would be tantamount to 
confessing its disregard for human life. 
  He said that Taiwan will change its policy towards the 
mainland, pending the results of Beijing's investigation. 
  Huang also noted that the fifth round of cross-strait 
technical talks, scheduled to be held later this month in 
Taipei, will be postponed until the Lake Qiandao tragedy is 
properly resolved.

  [Text] Hong Kong--At 11 o'clock yesterday morning, a man 
who said he had come from Zhejiang and was going somewhere by 
way of Hong Kong, telephoned the Editorial Department of LIEN HO 
PAO and said that on the day the incident occurred on the 
Hairui, his friends and he were on the spot, saw several armed 
mainland servicemen board the ship, and shortly after, the two 
ships sailed off at the same time. 
  The man said that on 31 March, the day of the Hairui 
tragedy, 
several of his friends and he were on the spot on another ship. 
He said: "I saw a ship with more than 10 persons armed with 
guns and in army uniforms berthing by the side of Hairui. 
Several of them boarded the Hairui. Very soon, the two ships 
sailed off at the same time." 
  The man, who was unwilling to give his name, said, "The ship 
with personnel in army uniforms belonged to Anhui Province." He 
also said: "My three friends, who were on the same ship with 
me, told local people about the matter and were immediately put 
into prison by public security personnel." 
  When an editor of LIEN HO PAO wished to see the man to find 
out details, he politely declined by saying that he was leaving 
Hong Kong.

plans to bar ROC [Republic of China] investors, for the time 
being, from sinking further amounts of capital into the 
development of industrial parks in the mainland. The general 
disgust with conditions on the mainland enlisted by the boat 
tragedy may furnish the harsh warning ROC economic planners have

  [Text] About 400,000 of Taiwan's 20 million residents are 
addicted to drugs, according to a report by the Bureau of 
Investigation. The bureau said that it has seized a total of 
1,300 kilograms of heroin last year, which was sufficient to 
supply 32,000 drug addicts for one whole year. But the seizure 
only reflected about one-tenth of the overall drugs smuggled 
into Taiwan, indicating that about 400,000 people here are 
addicted to drugs. 
  The bureau also flatly denied the report by the United 
States 
State Department that Taiwan is Asia's largest way station for 
drug shipment. Citing a record 336-kilogram heroin seizure last 
May, the Bureau of Investigation said that Taiwan will not allow 
drug barons to turn the island into a transfer port for drug 
trafficking.

  [Text] In answering an interpellation by legislator (Chiu 
Chueh-cheng) regarding Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation, president of the 
Executive Yuan Lien Chan said that political instability in 
Japan at present is understandable because the present Japanese 
Government is formed by several political parties and the 
Japanese Government is also faced with the call for political 
reform and the problem of economic recession. Lien Chan said: 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concerned government 
departments have made efforts to strengthen relations with 
various Japanese political parties which have formed the current 
Japanese Government. It is believed that the Japanese 
Government will certainly attach importance to relations between 
China [Republic of China -- ROC] and Japan. President of the 
Executive Yuan Lien Chan said: 
  [Begin recording] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other 
related departments have done their best to promote and enhance 
relations with various Japanese political parties which have 
formed the coalition govevnment. Those Japanese political 
parties have successively held panel discussions between 
Japanese and Chinese [ROC] legislators. I am convinced that the 
Japanese Government will certainly attach great importance to 
the relations between China [ROC] and Japan. [end recording] 
  The preceding are remarks by Lien Chan, president of the 
Executive Yuan. 
  After the release of the news of the Japanese prime 
minister's resignation, U.S. President Clinton expressed his 
regret over Hosokawa's decision. Communist China hoped that the 
resignation of Hosokawa would not influence the friendly 
relations between China [PRC] and Japan. South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam, who had a 15-minute talk with Hosokawa, expressed 
his concern for Hosokawa and guaranteed that his personal 
friendship with Hosokawa would not change.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- The resignation of 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is not expected to 
weaken Japan's support for Taiwan's bid to join the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a high-ranking trade 
official said Saturday [9 April]. 
  Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign 
Trade 
(BOFT) said the Japanese administration is usually free from 
political interference. 
  "Hosokawa's successor is not likely to change Japan's 
established policy of supporting Taiwan's GATT bid," Huang said. 
  He pointed out Taiwan's entry into the Geneva-based world 
trade regulatory body is in Japan's interest under the current 
GATT framework. 
  "Japan enjoys a huge trade surplus with Taiwan," Huang said. 
"Japan would benefit further from Taiwan's market opening 
following its GATT entry," he noted. 
  Huang is scheduled to visit Tokyo late this month. While 
there, Huang will hold informal GATT-related tariff concession 
talks with Japanese officials and discuss other bilateral trade 
issues. Japan has not yet proposed a list of items it wants to 
negotiate with Taiwan for tariff reductions. 
  Huang said he hopes Japan's new cabinet will take more 
positive steps to redress its huge trade surplus with Taiwan, 
which reached a record US$14.2 billion in 1993 and is likely to 
hit US$16 billion this year. "If the growing trade imbalance 
remains unresolved, it will become a political issue," he warned. 
  Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations, Taiwan 
has maintained close economic relations with Japan because of 
historical and geographical reasons. 
  Li Shang-chia, chief executive of a Taiwan-Japan trade 
promotion task force under the semi-official China External 
Trade Development Council, said he believes Hosokawa's quitting 
would not affect economic relations between the two countries. 
  C. F. Ku, chairman of the Chinese National Association of 
Industry and Commerce, echoed Li's view. Still, Ku said he 
worries that the political fallout of Hosokawa's resignation may 
slow transfer of Japanese technology to Taiwan. 
  Ku, also chairman of the Taiwan-Japan trade promotion fund, 
said Hosokawa's departure may delay Japan's political reforms 
and market opening, and even cut into Japan's foreign aid and 
investment. "As Japan's gross national product accounts for 
about 20 percent of the world's total production of goods and 
services, its policy changes would certainly have an impact on 
the global economic development," Ku noted. 
  "The government should keep close watch on Japan's political 
and economic development following Hosokawa's resignation, 
particularly who will be the next minister of international 
trade and industry," he added.

  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to step down will not affect 
Japan's ties with the Republic of China [ROC], a Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs official said Saturday [9 April]. 
  The official, who requested anonymity, said the Japanese 
Government has been reluctant to develop official ties with 
Taiwan for fear of offending Communist China, with which Tokyo 
has diplomatic relations. 
  "Since relations between the ROC and Japanese Governments 
have been cool, I don't think our ties will worsen simply 
because of Hosokawa's resignation," the official in charge of 
Japan affairs said. 
  Although many countries, including the United States, 
Germany, Britain and France, have sent ministerial-level 
officials to visit Taiwan, Japan has declined to follow suit. 
  "I think the Japanese Government will continue to ban 
exchanges of visits of high-level officials between the two 
countries, no matter who will assume the premiership," the 
official said. 
  Hosokawa on Friday announced his decision to resign to take 
responsibility for failing to clear up questions about 
controversial financial dealings and for provoking a four-week 
opposition boycott in parliament.

  [Text] Governor Chris Patten last night warned that 
China's handling of the Xi Yang case was making Hong Kong people 
nervous about their future after 1997. Speaking on his return 
from London, Mr. Patten revealed Beijing had still not responded 
to the Government's request, through the British Embassy in 
Beijing, for further details about the fate of the jailed Ming 
Pao journalist. 
  "There is a degree of concern about the Xi Yang case here 
which, I think, raises a lot of anxieties, a lot of question 
marks, a lot of doubts in people's minds about the future," he 
said. "If ever anything confirms the importance of the people 
of Hong Kong standing up for the Joint Declaration, standing up 
for our values and freedoms, then this case is it, and I hope 
there aren't others like it." 
  But the Governor warned there were limits to what the 
Government could do to help Xi: "He is a Chinese citizen which 
means that there is a certain constraint in what we can do in 
international law, international practice, which wouldn't apply 
if he was a citizen of Hong Kong." 
  And Mr. Patten hinted the Government would adopt a 
relatively 
low-profile approach towards the case: "Our main concern has to 
be to avoid doing or saying anything which might make his very 
difficult position even more difficult." His comments came as 
journalists protesting Xi's 12-year jail sentence outside the 
Happy Valley headquarters of Xinhua (the New China News Agency) 
prepared to end their hunger strike tonight after 72 hours. 
  Meanwhile, under banners reading "Freedom for the press" and 
chanting "Release Xi Yang", more than 200 reporters and 
photographers marched to the news agency yesterday to hand in a 
petition signed by 1,315 journalists demanding justice for the 
jailed reporter. 
  "I'm here because I think the Chinese Government is very 
unfair to Xi Yang. As journalists we want to know what to do in 
future. Now we don't know what to report so we are pressing the 
Chinese Government to explain. There is so much uncertainty," 
said Anissa Cheng, a reporter with a local Chinese-language 
publication. Behind her a policeman moved through the crowd 
filming the protesters. Another one wrote down what was printed 
on the banners. 
  "The way I understand it is that what Xi Yang did was just 
normal news reporting," said Kevin Lau Chun-to, vice-chairman of 
the Hong Kong Journalists' Association. "A release from Xinhua 
yesterday implied China suffered serious economic loss, but they 
didn't give any evidence and we don't accept it." 
  "The message given by Xi Yang's sentence is very subtle and 
psychological," Lau said. "But it's very difficult. We want to 
cover news. We know there's a risk, but we still take that risk 
until something goes wrong." 
  From Xinhua there was little acknowledgement of the 
journalists. But at a window on the sixth floor three people 
could be seen behind the smoked glass, two of whom appeared to 
have binoculars, while above the main door, security cameras 
scanned backwards and forwards.

<F P=106> [By Martin Lee, legislative councillor and chairman of the </F>
United Democrats of Hong Kong: "Harsh Truth in Seeking Facts"] 
  [Text] "Seek truth from facts." To many, the People's 
Supreme Court made a mockery of Deng Xiaoping's well-known 
instruction by sentencing Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang to 12 
years' imprisonment. In Hong Kong, this event has signalled once 
again the price of seeking facts in China may be far too high. 
  The lessons here are not just for journalists but for all of 
us who will soon live under Chinese sovereignty. Indeed, the Xi 
incident represents exhibit A in the case that China's legal 
system is an oxymoron, a contradictory concept. 
  When Ming Pao reporter Xi was detained last summer, Xinhua 
(the New China News Agency) announced he had been arrested for 
"espionage regarding state secrets on banking". The state 
secrets apparently involved the Bank of China's unremarkable 
plans "regarding interest rate movements and sale of gold in the 
international market". Xi was an experienced journalist 
employed full-time by a Hong Kong newspaper. Like reporters for 
this paper and others, he was in China on the trail of a scoop. 
  Throughout most of the world, reporters win awards for 
gathering information and investigative reporting. Few 
journalists would have reason to think financial information 
provided by that most common of journalistic sources -- a 
government official -- would constitute a state secret. Perhaps 
one of the reasons Xi's case has struck a chord with Hong Kong 
reporters is they have always assumed (now falsely, it seems) so 
long as they covered business and economics and steered clear of 
politics -- they would stay out of hot water. 
  Once charged, Xi was denied legal representation (the 
authorities explained he "did not want a lawyer") and visits by 
his family or employer. Tried in secret, he was sentenced to a 
12-year jail term and stripped of political rights for a further 
two years. He is to be permitted an appeal but the lawyer 
representing him must be endorsed by the Higher People's Court 
and he has had one lawyer ditch his case already. In the light 
of this treatment, it is worth remembering at least under the 
Chinese constitution, Xi was exercising the freedom of speech 
and of the press, guaranteed to all Chinese citizens. 
  But in China, the letter of the law has little significance 
and the courts have only one master: the Chinese Communist 
Party. Most laws exist principally to bolster the power of the 
state. This is why the clarification of guidelines for Hong 
Kong journalists in China will make little difference. Xi would 
have been "presumed guilty until found guilty" anyway. 
  Sentencing, too, is subject to cadre capriciousness. Last 
year a Xinhua sub-editor was sentenced to life imprisonment for 
revealing an advance copy of a dry speech by Communist Party 
chief Jiang Ze min. The Express journalist who reported it was 
lucky: she was released after a week's detention. But given 
the ease of passing such draconian sentencing, it would not be 
surprising if some journalists in Hong Kong were to take this 
opportunity to question their choice of profession. 
  Knowledge is power and in China, as with other authoritarian 
regimes, leaders tightly control information. The press serves 
as a propaganda function. But in Hong Kong, we attach special 
value to our media which serves to keep the public informed, and 
keep politicians and the business community more or less honest. 
Equally important, the international business community -- Hong 
Kong's golden egg-laying goose -- has come to rely on objective 
coverage of local and international events. 
  For although it is quite normal in China to harness the 
press 
to the political whims of party cadres and the policy aims of 
the central authorities, gagging the press and impeding the free 
flow of information in Hong Kong will almost certainly deal a 
mortal blow to our image as a world-class financial centre. 
  But clearly Beijing is engaged in a long-term effort to 
transfer China's system of press controls to Hong Kong. Hong 
Kong journalists have found themselves bribed, blacklisted and 
befriended in the process. Making an example of Xi Yang is 
merely the latest attempt to rattle Hong Kong journalists and to 
cripple the development of the powers and autonomy of the press 
during the transitional period to control information in Hong 
Kong after 1997. 
  The assurances from Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office 
Director Lu Ping that "the sentence will not affect Hong Kong 
reporters' normal reporting work" ring hollow. Likewise, 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin maintains so long as Hong 
Kong reporters stick to "economic information in an effort to 
boost (China's) economic and trade relations", there should be 
no need for concern. China's local advisers insist Xi's case 
has no relevance to Hong Kong reporters because he is a 
mainlander. But it is wrong for us to think that because he is 
originally from China, Xi's predicament has nothing to do with 
the rest of us in Hong Kong. 
  In fact, Xi's case and the steady erosion of our press 
freedom is only a single piece in the jigsaw puzzle of Hong 
Kong's transition of sovereignty to China. 
  With Beijing in the throes of a succession crisis, current 
policy towards Hong Kong on press freedom and political reform 
is dictated principally by old and weary men. In the vacuum of 
power created by Deng Xiaoping's failing health, Hong Kong 
provides a convenient target for hardline dogma. 
  For a long time, Britain and China led Hong Kong people to 
believe there would be a smooth transition in 1997 -- that, for 
instance, only one or two legislators would be thrown off the 
legislative through-train for their beliefs. But in the past 
year we have learned China intends to derail all three tiers of 
our system of representative government and there will also be 
no through train for senior civil servants. Similarly, our 
business community has been intimidated, and companies and 
individuals who support democratic reform have been targeted for 
retribution. 
  Although there have been earlier attempts to bully -- or 
simply buy Hong Kong's local papers into submission, Xi Yang's 
case is an omen there may well be no through train for 
journalists either. And if China does succeed in gagging the 
press in Hong Kong as in China, it is safe to say "one country, 
two systems" will be close to impossible. 
  I hope Beijing will see the good sense of releasing Xi Yang 
immediately and take a hard look at the debilitating effect his 
conviction and sentencing have already had on Hong Kong's 
confidence. But if China fails to do so, the reasons for the Xi 
verdict must be made public and Xi must be provided a defence 
lawyer of his own choice, who should be permitted to defend him 
without interference of any kind. Beijing has an obligation to 
allow Xi Yang a fair appeal that is open to the public -- and 
most importantly -- the press. 
  Xi's situation is an opportunity for Hong Kong people to 
look 
critically at China's system and recognise the value of our own. 
What happened to Xi is not currently a possibility in Hong Kong 
because we have accountable judges in an independent judicial 
system. We have separation of powers where the executive is 
checked by the legislature and cannot interfere with the 
administration of justice. 
  But it will not always be so. After 1997, Beijing will 
control the executive through appointments and can influence the 
judiciary through its interpretation of the Basic Law. If we do 
not have a legislature that is democratically constituted with 
enough members to say "no" to Beijing on Hong Kong matters of 
vital importance, we will have little hope of preserving our 
rule of law and freedoms. Beijing will have succeeded in its 
effort to transfer China's authoritarian system to Hong Kong and 
we will have no press freedom, no accountability and no rule of 
law. 
  I hope our press will not be intimidated into silence by the 
Xi Yang case. Ultimately, whether Hong Kong is able to maintain 
a society where the rule of law is supreme and where the press 
can report freely, will depend on whether we as a community 
recognise these values are what make Hong Kong and China so 
clearly two systems. Unless we speak up and fight to preserve 
our way of life now, we will surely see our promised autonomy 
perish. And Xi Yang's case will only be a chilling sign of 
things to come.

<F P=106> [By Jimmy McGregor, legislative councillor and member of the </F>
Democratic Foundation: "Excessive Sentence a Sign of Fear"] 
  [Text] I was 15 years old when World War II began in late 
1939. I had just completed secondary schooling and had, with 
some luck, done well and made my parents very happy. 
  The German attack on Poland and the declaration of war by 
Britain and France on Germany fired my youthful patriotism. I 
volunteered to join the Royal Air Force. My application was 
accepted and I was in uniform and under intensive training soon 
after my 16th birthday. 
  I served my country throughout World War II and until I came 
to Hong Kong in 1951. In a different sense and certainly in a 
different service, I continued to serve my country when I joined 
the Hong Kong Government in early 1954 and until 1975. 
  During all of that time my love for my country was not 
simply 
based on blind patriotism nor on any sense of superiority over 
any other race or country, although I did think Scotland 
produced the best footballers. 
  I certainly had the deepest feeling, based on study, 
observation, participation and example that the system by which 
Britain was governed was relatively fair and open and 
accountable to the people. I was taught and I never forgot that 
all men should be equal before the law and that the law must be 
fair to all men. 
  I was well aware, however, that the system and the law did 
not always work fairly and that some people were more equal than 
others. Improvements were always necessary. 
  But I also learned that within a democratic system of 
government, the rights of the people were established and 
sacrosanct. These were the rights that World War II enshrined 
forever and for which millions died and countless millions more 
suffered in varying degrees. These are the human rights which, 
since my years in the Royal Air Force, I have treasured and 
which I will with all means defend. At the heart of them lies 
the dignity and sanctity of the human spirit. 
  How strange then that I should become a civil servant in a 
colonial government which denied at least one of the basic human 
rights to the citizens for which it was responsible -- the right 
to vote. By denying that right it also meant the right to 
participate in the government of their own affairs was never 
granted to Hong Kong citizens in my 22 years in the Hong Kong 
Government. 
  Yet I was conscious of the many rights that were taken for 
granted by Hong Kong people -- rights that made them free men 
and women in a society that rewarded personal and family 
initiative. I have therefore been happy during the last 10 
years that political rights were at last gradually added to the 
others, even if imperfectly and too hesitantly. 
  I have always been very conscious of the looming might of 
China. Nothing that is done in Hong Kong by the Government or in 
the private sector can disregard the power of China over Hong 
Kong. No government policy during the last several decades and 
no doubt long before that could be complete without an 
assessment of the impact on China, or its likely reaction. 
  Great care has always been taken by the Hong Kong Government 
to do nothing that will provoke a hostile response from our 
mighty neighbour. In fact, many things that might have been 
done to improve Hong Kong were not done because China's reaction 
was feared. 
  We have had great times and very bad times. We have 
undergone terrible stresses and strains as China herself has 
writhed and groaned under the calamity of revolution and violent 
change. Through it all, the Hong Kong people have remained 
essentially Chinese patriots, loving their mother country 
despite being at odds with the political system which governs it. 
  Hong Kong people have also learned to judge human rights in 
comparative terms. Where Hong Kong has been found wanting, the 
people have demanded improvement. The Government has 
increasingly listened to the chosen representatives of the 
people and has acted accordingly. Steadily and perceptibly, 
Hong Kong people have been drawn into protecting the rights they 
now clearly treasure. They will not be content unless and until 
they have the same rights as citizens in other advanced 
societies enjoy. 
  But what do they feel about these human rights and freedoms 
when they consider 1997 and beyond? Hong Kong people know that 
China, with its different kind of government and with a 
different set of priorities when it comes to human rights, is 
not likely to take kindly to a future Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) government that insists on retaining laws and 
practices which irritate or frustrate the authority of the 
central government and its many branches. 
  The Chinese assurance that Hong Kong people will rule Hong 
Kong may begin to crumble if, for example, the Hong Kong media 
persists in criticising the SAR or bringing Beijing policies and 
actions into disrepute. 
  Non-intervention by Beijing will encourage Hong Kong people 
to continue to speak out for what they espouse, even in support 
of liberal and democratic political systems. Intervention by 
Beijing, on the other hand, may stifle the freedoms which give 
life and vitality to the Hong Kong system and society. 
  Any serious intervention by Beijing, before or after 1997, 
will certainly have a sobering effect on those who believe Hong 
Kong can best prosper under a democratically elected government. 
  Many democrats in Hong Kong look hopefully north for signs 
of 
a change in attitude. They seek evidence that the dream of a 
Hong Kong ruled by Hong Kong people with a high degree of 
autonomy is realisable. They listen carefully and assess 
anxiously the statements by Chinese leaders and the actions 
taken by the Chinese Government to extend improvements in human 
rights to the people of China. 
  They have been encouraged many times and just as often have 
suffered disappointment and even despair. China moves in fits 
and starts with human rights. Two steps forwards, one step -- 
sometimes two steps -- backwards. 
  It is as if the Chinese leadership itself is wracked by 
doubt, being led this way or that way, unsure how far or how 
deep or how quickly some improvement or change of policy should 
go. 
  The immense problem of carrying China forward in economic 
terms is sometimes too great to allow Chinese consideration of 
political moderation as well. Yet one element cannot move 
forward without impacting the other. Chinese leadership must 
every now and again bear down on some unfortunate miscreant with 
great harshness and cruelty to provide others with the kind of 
lesson that will never be forgotten. 
  Recent Chinese history is littered with such examples -- Wei 
Jingsheng, Wang Juntao, Chen Chiming and now Xi Yang provide sad 
and terrible evidence of the treatment that can be meted out by 
a totalitarian state seeking to silence opposition and punish 
these who do no more than seek information. 
  This treatment, applied extensively over a long period of 
time with severity and often with the utmost disregard for human 
feeling and dignity has created fear and loathing in Hong Kong. 
It cannot have improved confidence in the long-term future nor 
in the promises which have been solemnly provided by the Chinese 
Government. 
  All my personal background, education, training, experience 
and human instinct cry out at the severity of the sentence of 12 
years on Xi Yang. I will protest to the Chinese authorities as 
best I can and I pray that the voices of all those who seek his 
release will be heard in Beijing. 
  China must move forward, not backward. Excessive punishment 
is a sign of fear not maturity. The freedoms enjoyed by the 
people of Hong Kong, including a free press, will be adversely 
affected if fear replaces confidence. I urge the Chinese 
authorities to reconsider the case against Xi and release him.

<F P=106> [By David Healy in London and Danny Gittings] </F>
  [Text] The influential House of Commons Foreign Affairs 
Committee will this week publish its long-awaited report, 
expected to set the agenda for Britain's relations with Beijing 
in the final years before 1997. 
  A new deal on nationality rights for Hong Kong's ethnic 
minorities, strong criticism of China's human rights violations, 
and full backing for Governor Chris Patten's political reforms 
are among its findings. The report -- which Mr. Patten has 
already predicted will mark an "important milestone" on the road 
to 1997 -- is the outcome of a nine-month high-profile probe 
into relations with China and their effect on Hong Kong. 
  It is being kept under tight wraps ahead of publication on 
Wednesday, with members warned any premature disclosure would 
amount to contempt of Parliament. But a close committee source 
has revealed it will urge the British Government to act to 
protect the position of the 7,000 members of non-Chinese ethnic 
minorities living in the territory, who run the risk of becoming 
stateless after 1997, by giving them either British passports or 
other nationality rights. 
  The report will also issue a tough warning about the 
concerns 
Hong Kong people and the British Government feel over Beijing's 
poor human rights record. However a source stressed this was 
not meant to be seen as "anti-Chinese". 
  The main focus will be to support Mr. Patten's handling of 
the constitutional reform issue, and reject criticisms by former 
foreign affairs adviser Sir Percy Cradock in his evidence to the 
committee. Some committee members had earlier expressed doubts 
about the Governor's failure to visit Beijing before announcing 
his October 1992 political reform proposals. But the committee 
has now united behind Mr. Patten and the report, written by 
chairman David Howell, a former Conservative minister, will be 
unanimous. 
  It also contains a call for the Government to grant British 
nationality rights to Hong Kong's 25 war widows -- a request 
that has now been overtaken by events with Whitehall already 
agreeing to grant them right of entry to Britain. 
  Mr. Patten said on his return to Hong Kong last night the 
campaign for right of abode for the ethnic minorities -- which 
will be boosted by this week's report -- had continued during 
his visit to London, where he raised the issue with British 
officials. 
  The document seems certain to receive a much warmer 
reception 
in Hong Kong than the last, which appeared shortly after the 
June 1989 Tiananmen crackdown and was widely criticised locally 
for rejecting the right of abode in Britain for Hong Kong people. 
  The committee's current inquiry into Hong Kong has also been 
controversial, dominated by a war of words between Mr. Patten 
and Sir Percy over the Governor's policies. The Chinese 
Ambassador to London, Ma Yuzhen, also tried -- and failed -- to 
influence the report, with a letter warning that Beijing was 
serious about dismantling the three-tier political structure in 
1997. 
  Meanwhile Mr. Patten revealed last night that he had held a 
private meeting with former prime minister Lady Thatcher, during 
his nine-day visit to London. "I had an interesting meeting 
with Lady Thatcher, with whom I've been in regular contact over 
the last couple of years," he said.

  [Text] Macao, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Macao Governor General 
Vasco Joaquim Rocha Vieira said that the forthcoming visit of 
Portuguese Premier Cavaco Silva to China would not only 
consolidate the friendly relations between the two governments 
of Portugal and China, but would also further strengthen such 
friendly relations of the two sides. 
  He made his remarks when leaving Macao this evening for 
Lisbon, for the purpose to accompany Portuguese Premier Cavaco 
Silva's visit to China. 
  He said "I think that the efforts made by the two 
governments 
in strengthening their friendship and mutual trust will be 
beneficial to Macao." 
  He continued, Macao is now in the transitional period, 
noting 
that so long as the two Governments of Portugal and China get 
along with each other friendly and make joint efforts, the 
transition can be carried out smoothly. 
  The Macao governor will accompany Portuguese premier to 
visit 
Beijing and Shanghai. The premier will also visit Macao for 
three days starting from April 17 after concluding his visit to 
China.

  [Text] Macao, April 11 (AFP)--An agreement for a 
200-million-dollar export credit line was signed in Beijing 
Monday between Portugal and China aimed at boosting Portuguese 
exports to the mainland, according to a report here. LUSA news 
agency reported the signing was attended by Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who arrived Sunday on a seven-day 
official visit, and Chinese counterpart Li Peng. The credit 
line was negotiated between Portugal's Banco Nacional 
Ultramarino and the Bank of China, the Portuguese news agency 
said. The aim of the credit line was to increase Portuguese 
exports to China, LUSA said. 
  Earlier, Cavaco Silva and Li issued a joint declaration on 
cooperation over the transition of Macau, which reverts to 
Chinese sovereignty in 1999. 
  "The Sino-Portuguese joint declaration on the question of 
Macau is an historic document and a good example to solve 
questions left by history," Li was quoted as saying by LUSA. 
  Cavaco Silva was quoted as saying that the application of 
the 
joint declaration "has been smooth" and "corresponds to the 
wishes of the two countries." 
  Cavaco Silva and then prime minister Zhao Ziyang agreed in 
1987 on the return of the Portuguese colony by the end of the 
century, at which time it would become a "special administrative 
region" of China. 
  Portuguese diplomatic sources told LUSA that the aim of the 
visit was to "consolidate the excellent political understanding" 
between the two countries and to "inject new dynamism" in their 
trade relations. 
  Cavaco Silva has in his entourage 60 businessmen as well as 
the ministers for foreign affairs, trade, and tourism.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (AFP)--Five foreign journalists 
were briefly held and questioned by Chinese police Friday when 
they tried to visit the wife of detained dissident Xu Wenli. 
  A dozen policemen stopped the journalists as they arrived 
Friday afternoon at Kang Tong's housing compound, one of the 
foreigners said. The group included the correspondent of Hong 
Kong's SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST Geoffrey Crothall, Barbara 
Alighiero of Italy's ANSA, David Schlesinger of REUTERS and 
German correspondents Henrik Bork of FRANKFURTER RUNDSHAU and 
Andreas Landwehr of DPA. 
  When Kang arrived to speak with them she was dragged away 
and 
the journalists were taken for questioning to a small room next 
to the compound entrance where their press passes were briefly 
confiscated, the journalists said. "We could have left at any 
time but it would been without our press passes," one said. 
  The police made several phone calls before returning the 
press cards and allowing the journalists to leave after about 30 
minutes, he added. 
  Xu, a leader of the 1978-1979 Democracy Wall movement and 
one 
of China's longest serving political prisoners, was taken from 
his home early Friday, Kang said by telephone earlier. 
  The 49-year-old dissident had been released from prison on 
parole last year after serving 12 years of a 15-year sentence 
for "counter-revolutionary" crimes. 
  The former electrician has since maintained a low profile 
and 
not been involved in any open dissident activity.

<F P=106> ["Provincial Ideological Work Conference Opens, With Lu </F>
Rongjing Delivering Important Speech"] 
  [Text] A provincial propaganda and ideological work 
conference opened ceremoniously in Hefei on 4 March. The 
conference, convened by the provincial party committee, was a 
grand meeting on the ideological front. Attending the 
conference were leaders of party, government, and military 
organizations in the province, including Lu Rongjing, Fu Xishou, 
Wang Taihua, Fang Zhaoxiang, Liu Guangcai, Shen Shanwen, Du 
Cheng, Shao Ming, Du Yijin, Wang Sheyun, as well as Hou Yong, 
head of the provincial party committee's leading group for 
foreign propaganda. Fang Zhaoxiang presided over the conference. 
  Du Cheng made a report on the guidelines laid down at a 
national ideological work conference. 
  Lu Rongjing delivered an important speech. His speech was 
divided into three parts: 1) Accurately appraise the situation 
on the ideological front and fully understand the heavy 
responsibilities on our shoulders; 2) continue to effectively 
perform propaganda and ideological work according to a basic 
guiding principle and four fundamental tasks; and 3) the 
propaganda and ideological front is extremely important, and 
party committees at various levels should effectively strengthen 
their leadership in this regard. 
  Lu Rongjing pointed out: This conference is one of great 
significance, and it is held in a crucial period in which our 
province is speeding up its economic development. The main 
tasks of this conference are that guided by Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, we should extensively implement the guidelines 
of the 14th party congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 
party's 14th Central Committee, and the 10th enlarged plenary 
session of the fifth provincial party committee; act according 
to the requirements set by the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference; and study how to further provide an 
effective ideological guarantee and mold favorable public 
opinion for a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the 
economy, for maintaining political stability and all-around 
social progress. 
  Lu Rongjing said: On the province's propaganda and 
ideological front, We have done a great deal of fruitful work, 
scored remarkable achievements, and accumulated rich experiences 
since the Third Plenary Session of the party's 11th Central 
Committee. Propaganda and ideological work has played an 
important role in emancipating people's minds, changing their 
traditional ideas, unifying the thinking and actions of party 
organizations and people in the province, maintaining the 
political situation characterized by stability and unity, 
promoting reform and opening-up in the province, and advancing 
economic development and the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization. The propaganda and ideological front has made a 
tremendous contribution to bringing about the excellent 
situation in which Anhui is today. 
  Lu Rongjing said: The propaganda and ideological front 
should 
firmly grasp the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, a basic guiding principle. It should arm 
people with scientific theories, guide them with correct 
publicity, inculcate high ideals in them, and encourage them 
with fine works of literature and art. This basic guiding 
principle and the four fundamental tasks constitute the overall 
plan and strategic concept for effectively performing propaganda 
and ideological work in the course of accelerating the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. Lu 
Rongjing set forth requirements for propaganda and ideological 
work according to the province's actual conditions and in the 
light of the basic guiding principle and four fundamental tasks. 
  First, The most important task of the propaganda and 
ideological front is to persistently arm the whole party with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. Lu Rongjing pointed out: Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the spiritual prop of the whole party and 
people throughout the country and a powerful ideological weapon 
for us to win victory in reform, opening-up, and modernization, 
and it is the basic guiding principle for our work in all 
fields. The propaganda and ideological front must firmly grasp 
this basic guiding principle and guide all its work with it so 
that our propaganda and ideological work will always keep to the 
correct orientation. 
  Second, we should act according to the overall interests of 
the party's work and persist in guiding people with correct 
publicity. Media opinion is not equivalent to public opinion; 
the former originates from but stands above the latter. 
Concretely speaking, they can be summed up in three sentences: 
Actively support and develop correct public opinion; 
conscientiously transform or overcome one-sided, irresponsible 
public opinion; resolutely resist or eliminate negative, harmful 
public opinion. This is a crucial year for deepening reform and 
promoting development. As far as Anhui is concerned, it is in a 
crucial period in which we can work hard to make progress or lag 
behind by relaxing our efforts. We must guide people with 
correct publicity and mold favorable public opinion for further 
reform, opening-up, the establishment of a socialist market 
economic structure, and the development of social productive 
forces throughout the province; and we should mold favorable 
public opinion for strengthening the building of socialist 
spiritual civilization and the development of socialist 
democracy and the legal system. 
  Third, we should cultivate a new generation of 
well-educated, well-disciplined people imbued with lofty ideals 
and socialist moral values; strengthen ideological and political 
work among the masses; and step up mass activities in building a 
socialist spiritual civilization. 1. To cultivate a new 
generation of people, we should rely on the strength of truth -- 
that is, we should guide and persuade people with truth through 
ideological education. 2. We should rely on the strength of 
moral quality -- that is, we should bring the exemplary role of 
advanced models into full play. There are a number of advanced 
models around us. We should pay attention to discovering such 
models, conscientiously sum up their experiences, vigorously 
commend and publicize them, and strengthen their ranks. By so 
doing, healthy trends will become dominant in society. It is a 
strategic task to encourage the masses to strengthen the 
building of spiritual civilization, which should go on 
throughout the entire process of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. The "Main Points for Anhui Province's Mass 
Activities in Building Spiritual Civilization in 1994" worked 
out by provincial civilization commission consist of clear 
guiding ideology, tasks, and objectives. Various localities 
should implement these main points according to their own 
conditions. Party committees and governments at various levels 
must put mass activities in building a spiritual civilization as 
an item on their agendas and do this work as they carry out 
economic construction. 
  Fourth, we should vigorously publicize the main theme and 
promote the thriving and healthy development of cultural 
undertakings. Encouraging people with fine works of literature 
and art is an important task of the cultural front. Propaganda 
and cultural departments at various levels should vigorously 
make overall plans and organize people to create works of 
literature and art reflecting the main theme in order to satisfy 
the increasing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses and to 
encourage them to work hard to advance reform and modernization. 
At the same time, we should unswervingly implement the 
principle of carrying out the antipornography campaign while 
making efforts to bring about prosperity, with a view to 
ensuring the healthy development of the cultural market. 
  Fifth, We should actively do foreign propaganda to make 
Anhui 
known and appealing to more foreign people. The province's 
general requirements for foreign propaganda are to: serve 
economic construction, promote opening to the outside world, 
make Anhui known to more foreign people, create a good image for 
it, help to create a favorable environment, and achieve good 
results. According to these general requirements, our foreign 
propaganda at present and for some time to come should focus on 
publicizing the province's conditions; its achievements in 
reform, opening up, and economic construction; its gratifying 
political situation and united people' and its favorable 
conditions for opening to the outside world. This year is the 
45th founding anniversary of the PRC and the 15th anniversary of 
reform and opening up. We should seize this opportunity to 
systematically publicize Anhui by using various media in order 
to make Anhui known to more foreign people and to increase its 
influence at home and abroad. 
  In concluding, Lu Rongjing stressed: Principal leaders of 
party committees at various levels should effectively strengthen 
their leadership and management in propaganda and ideological 
work, often study and analyze ideological trends in society, and 
promptly put forward appropriate principles and requirements for 
work in this regard. From now on, whether to attach importance 
to and to be good at propaganda and ideological work should be 
regarded as an important aspect in evaluating whether or not the 
leader of a locality or department is strong politically and 
competent in leadership, and in appraising the work performance 
of a locality or department. 
  Attending the conference were more than 570 people, 
including 
secretaries and propaganda department directors of various 
prefectural and city party committees; propaganda department 
directors of county party committees; leaders of organs directly 
under the provincial authority, universities, and large 
enterprises; and those attending a provincial conference of 
broadcasting and television bureau directors, a provincial 
conference of cultural bureau directors, a provincial conference 
on foreign propaganda, a provincial conference of journalistic 
and publishing work, and a conference of the provincial 
federation of literary and art circles.

<F P=106> [Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Work Report </F>
delivered by Governor Chen Huanyou at the Second Session of the 
Eighth Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress on 24 February] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  I am going to present the Jiangsu Provincial People's 
Government work report on its behalf. Please examine it. I 
would also like to ask members of the provincial committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] 
and other observers to express their views on this report. 
<H5>  1. </H5>
  The year 1993 was one in which people in Jiangsu proceeded 
victoriously along the path of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. People in Jiangsu earnestly followed the 
instructions Comrade Deng Xiaoping made in his important talks 
in southern China as well as the guidelines laid down in the 
14th National CPC Congress; seized the opportunity; deepened 
reform; opened up wider to the outside world; intensified and 
improved macroeocnomic regulations and control; and persisted in 
promoting material civilization and socialist ethics at the same 
time. The economy grew rapidly, new headway was made in all 
areas, and the province enjoyed political and social stability. 
On the whole, the situation was very satisfactory. 
  (1) As result of seizing the opportunity, the economy 
enjoyed sustained and rapid development. We persisted in 
emancipating our minds, seeking truth from facts, and developing 
the economy rapidly and successfully. To deal with problems 
caused by high economic growth, we followed through with the 
state policy of strengthening and improving macroeconomic 
regulation and control, put financial and taxation affairs in 
order, intensified tax collection and price management, and 
adjusted the economic structure. This brought about positive 
changes in economic operations. The province's gross national 
product [GNP] in 1993 increased 18.5 percent, reaching 255 
billion yuan. The goal of quadrupling [di er ge fan fan 4574 
0059 0020 5064 3972] the GNP was achieved seven years ahead of 
schedule. The per capita GNP of 3,675 yuan was more than 1,000 
yuan higher than the national average, and the province's 
overall economic strength leaped to a higher level. The economy 
developed in all rural sectors. Stronger leadership over 
agriculture and rural affairs, and efforts to stabilize all 
policies and control or reduce farmers' burdens safeguarded and 
mobilized farmers' enthusiasm. Despite all kinds of natural 
disasters, Jiangsu had fairly good agricultural harvests. The 
additional value yielded reached 42.18 billion yuan, an increase 
of 4.2 percent. The total output of grain and oil-bearing crops 
reached 32.797 million and 1.257 million tonnes respectively, 
approaching the output of 1992, which was a year of bumper 
harvests. Because of natural disasters as well as smaller 
acreage, cotton output declined by nearly 20 percent. All kinds 
of economic undertakings developed. The output of eggs, aquatic 
products, silk cocoons, and fruits increased quite 
substantially. New headway was made in afforestation. Because 
of expansion, upgrading, and quality control, village and town 
enterprises achieved higher economic returns and played an 
important role in Jiangsu's economic development. Rural areas' 
secondary and tertiary industries accounted for 84.6 percent of 
their total output value. That was 3.8 percentage points higher 
than that of 1992. New successes were achieved in building key 
water conservation projects and developing agricultural 
resources. The annual plans for controlling the Tai Hu and Huai 
He were accomplished, and the Tongyu He project proceeded 
rapidly. Industrial production maintained its relatively fast 
growth. Doing everything possible to overcome difficulties 
caused by capital shortage and strained energy supply and 
transportation facilities, we guided enterprises to organize 
production according to market needs, speed up restructuring, 
and achieve higher returns. The output of major industrial 
goods -- such as steel, rolled steel, cement, petroleum 
products, automobiles, chemical fibers, ethylene, and plastics 
-- continue to grow. Plans for developing 100 major new 
products and upgrading 100 types of key technology were 
fulfilled or overfulfilled. The value of industrial output 
increased 13.654 billion yuan, or 23.1 percent; and the 
production and marketing rate reached 95.3 percent, or 1.6 
percentage points higher than before. The per-unit consumption 
of major energy and raw materials declined, and the 
comprehensive index of industrial economic returns rose from 
89.3 in 1992 to 99.3. The development of building industry 
continued to accelerate, and the additional value increased 23.6 
percent. Significant progress was achieved in building key 
infrastructures and basic industries. Attention was paid to 
improving the investment pattern and ensuring the needs of 
priority projects so that there will be greater capacity for 
sustained economic development in the future. Public investment 
in fixed assets increased 51 percent, reaching 107.49 billion 
yuan. State units' investment in technological upgrading 
increased 50.8 percent, or 16.4 percentage points higher than 
the investment in capital construction projects; and investment 
in communications, transportation, postal and telecommunications 
services increased 59.3 percent, or 33.7 percentage points 
higher than industrial investment. The construction of the 
Shanghai-Ningbo Expressway and the first-grade 
Ninngbo-Lienyungang and Ningbo-Tonghua Highways as well as the 
dredging of the canal in southern Jiangsu were in full swing; 
the early-stage construction of the New Nanjing Airport, the 
Jiangyin Changjiang Highway Bridge, the Xinchang railroad, and 
other major projects intensified. The reconstruction of the 
Yancheng- Nantong section of the No. 204 national highway and 
the first- and second-stage projects of rebuilding the highway 
network in southern Jiangsu were completed according to 
schedule. This has expedited local construction of 
communications facilities. Some generators in the Changshu 
Power Plant and the Huaneng Huaiyin Power Plant started to 
operate, increasing Jiangsu's generating capacity by 17 million 
kilowatts. With our fast postal and telecommunications 
development, Jiangsu has become China's second province with 
switchboards having total capacity for handling over 2 million 
telephones in urban and rural areas. All county seats can now 
be accessed by telephones, and portable phones are used 
everywhere in the province. Tertiary industry developed more 
rapidly. By setting up business and service concerns through 
multiple channels using multi-layered efforts, we expanded such 
new and developing trades as information, consultation, 
accounting, auditing, and law firms, thus increasing the added 
value of output from tertiary industry [di san chan ye zeng jia 
zhi 4574 0005 3934 2814 1073 0502 0237] by 20.3 percent to 62.3 
billion yuan. Urban and rural markets flourished and 
stabilized. We fully enhanced the roles of market mechanisms, 
vigorously promoted commodity circulation, and ensured abundant 
market supply. Total volume of retail sales in 1993 increased 
33.9 percent to 107.42 billion yuan. Banking and financial 
situations improved relatively. We vigorously encouraged 
savings, promptly increased loans, and optimized the credit 
structure. Various kinds of savings deposited in banking 
institutions in the province increased 36.9 billion yuan, with 
savings deposited by urban and rural residents increasing 19.7 
billion yuan; loans of various types increased 28.9 billion 
yuan. Money supply was controlled as planned. We strengthened 
tax collection and administration, vigorously managed financial 
revenues, and collected 22.13 billion yuan, or 45.3 percent 
more, financial revenues for that year. 
  (2) We continued to deepen all reforms, starting with 
the reform of the enterprise management and ownership 
system. We actively and steadily experimented with the 
standardized shareholding system in state-owned enterprises, 
forming a total of 600 limited liability companies and 104 
limited liability stock companies in the province, six of which 
floated their stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets. In 
some small state-owned enterprises, we conducted various types 
of reforms which involved such efforts as transforming, 
transferring, leasing, contracting, and selling. Collective 
enterprises and village and town enterprises in cities and towns 
actively explored ways to innovate their systems, and nearly 
10,000 village and town enterprises implemented the shareholding 
cooperative system. Individually owned and privately owned 
economic sectors developed rather rapidly. New features emerged 
in the establishment of enterprise groups: Enterprise groups in 
the form of chain stores appeared in the distribution sector; 
large-scale and highly efficient industrial groups equipped with 
high technologies emerged in the industrial sector; and a number 
of large enterprise groups started to venture into the world, 
seeking new ways to achieve transnational development. We 
achieved obvious results in the construction of the market 
system: Markets for consumer goods and means of production 
continued to expand; markets conducting transactions in such 
major elements as technologies, labor forces, financial matters, 
foreign exchange, stocks, property rights, and real estate 
developed rather rapidly; and intermediary organizations started 
to develop in various types of markets. We strengthened 
auditing and business administrative work. We made greater 
strides in price reform; lifted control over the purchasing and 
selling prices of grain and edible oil; increased prices for 
cotton procurement; lifted control over and adjusted prices of 
such basic products as coal, electricity, and oil; and allowed 
market mechanisms to play an increasingly important role in our 
economic life. We carried out comprehensive housing reform, and 
entered a phase in which we implemented social security system 
reform on a larger scope. 
  (3) We further expanded opening up to the outside 
world, and the export-oriented economy maintained vigorous 
growth. We fully displayed our superiority in economics, 
science and technology, and labor quality; further explored new 
horizons for growth; and actively pushed forward our 
export-oriented economy from south to north. We built 
provincial-level development zones at the same time as we were 
accelerating the construction of various types of state-level 
development zones. We launched extensive activities to attract 
businesses and investments, and scored great success in 
utilizing foreign investments. Province-wide, we approved the 
establishment of 10,032 new units of the three types of 
enterprises which are partly or wholly foreign-owned, and 
directly used $3 billion in foreign investments, or 1.1 times 
more than previous figures. We also used relatively more Taiwan 
investments. The scope of foreign investment has been broadened 
with a higher level of commitment and greater involvement in 
major projects. Foreign investment in the fields of energy, 
communications, basic industries, tertiary industry, and new and 
high technologies have increased markedly. The use of foreign 
funds has brought about a faster pace for transforming 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. The 
restructuring of foreign trade continued to be deepened, 
resulting in an even better performance by the province's four 
major exchange earners -- provincial foreign trade companies, 
county and city foreign trade companies, three-types of wholly 
or partly foreign-owned enterprises, and production enterprises 
with operating rights in the import and export business. Total 
import and export value for the year reached $8.7 billion, an 
increase of 39.2 percent, of which the $5.96 billion export 
value marked a 27.6 percent rise. Foreign contracts and labor 
cooperation services developed rapidly, with newly approved 
non-trading enterprises in foreign lands reaching 210 in number. 
Departments handling foreign, Overseas Chinese, and Taiwan 
affairs as well as customs and commodities inspection have an 
active role to play in the process of opening up to the outside 
world and economic development. International tourism enjoyed a 
favorable development trend last year with nearly 800,000 
foreign tourists bringing in $129 million in foreign exchange. 
  (4) We actively implemented the strategy of "developing 
Jiangsu through application of science and technology"; 
scientific, technological, and educational undertakings made new 
progress. Efforts were made to deepen the reform of the 
scientific and technological structure by implementing various 
policies and measures; to push a host of scientific research 
institutes majoring in promoting technological development to 
industrialize themselves by joining enterprise groups, where 
they could participate in or form their own technical 
development centers for a particular trade; to set up various 
non-government science and technology enterprises; and to 
explore formats in developing state-owned enterprises by private 
management. Shifting of scientific and technological 
achievements toward the production field has been accelerated 
with the technological trade transaction volume exceeding 1 
billion yuan. Intensification of basic studies and major 
scientific and technological research has resulted in the 
development of a string of leading -- both in and outside China 
-- scientific and technological achievements. While speeding up 
the construction of key provincial laboratories and scientific 
and technological development experimental centers, we have 
achieved marked results in comprehensive agricultural experiment 
and exhibition bases, and sample scientific and technological 
construction in towns and villages. The industrialization 
process of high and new technologies has been quickened, while 
headway was made in constructing state-level high and new 
technological industry development zones. Total revenues 
derived from technological industry transactions amounted to 
4.76 billion yuan. Plans for the setting up of 10 "spark 
technology-intensive zones" have been approved, while a string 
of projects under both the "Torch Plan" and the "Spark Plan" at 
provincial level and above have been implemented. Educational 
undertakings were actively promoted with larger enrollment in 
ordinary institutions of higher learning, and that of assigned 
trainees and paying students accounting for 42 percent of total 
student enrollments throughout the province. The maintaining 
rate [gong gu lu 7255 0942 3764] for students attending primary 
and junior middle schools has increased steadily, while 56.8 
percent of the population eligible for nine-year compulsory 
education went to school -- a 20 percent increase over the 
previous year. Progress was also made in preschool education 
and special education for the mentally retarded and handicapped 
children. Education at the senior middle level has been 
accelerated with emphasis being laid on the development of 
vocational and technical education. Some 565,000 young and 
middle-aged illiterates throughout the province benefited from 
the illiteracy elimination program. Adult education and 
on-the-job training developed relatively fast, while urban and 
rural comprehensive educational experiments conducted in some 
cities and counties showed progress. A host of privately run 
schools have been established. Efforts were made to improve the 
running of major colleges and the teaching of key subjects in a 
bid to further integrate education, the economy, and science and 
technology to enhance their functions of serving economic 
construction. 
  (5) As result of efforts to improve urban and rural 
residents' living conditions, the masses' living standards were 
raised. Investments in commercial housing construction 
amounted to 9.91 billion yuan, up 230 percent from 1992. 
Residential buildings covering a total of 13 million square 
meters [sq m] of floor space were constructed in urban areas, 
thereby basically solving housing problems for homeless people 
and improving the living conditions of 16 percent of the 
population whose per capita living space was less than 4 sq m. 
New houses totaling 46 million sq m were built in rural areas. 
In cities, gas was available to 58.2 percent, and tap water to 
95.4 percent of households; and expansion and construction of 
roads were sped up. The condition of drinking water in rural 
areas was improved markedly, with tap water available to an 
additional 2.3 million people. The incidence of contagious 
diseases dropped; the results of setting up national- and 
provincial-level hygienic cities were consolidated and 
developed. The natural population growth rate was 7.36 per 
1,000, and was controlled within the targeted limit. Efforts 
for comprehensive improvement of the environment were stepped 
up, with new progress made in eliminating waste gas, waste 
water, and industrial residue. As a result of efforts to 
provide more employment, 206,000 unemployed people in urban 
areas found jobs. On the basis of developing production, 
efforts were made to increase urban and rural residents' 
incomes. Urban residents' per capita income that was used for 
living expenses was 2,525 yuan; and the average per capita net 
income of farmers was 1,267 yuan. After allowing for price 
rises, these figures represented a 10.2 percent and 3 percent 
increase respectively, over the previous year. Civil and 
welfare facilities were improved; and work to help the aged and 
disabled was improved. Active efforts were made to assist poor 
areas to develop their economies, and a total of 300,000 people 
cast off poverty last year. 
  (6) As result of intensifying the construction of 
spiritual civilization, democracy, and the legal system, the 
political situation characterized by stability and unity was 
further consolidated. We launched an extensive drive to 
study the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics. Following the publication of Volume 3 of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," a mass study campaign was 
launched throughout the province, sparking enthusiasm among 
cadres and people to expedite reform, opening up, and 
modernization. In light of new circumstances and features under 
the conditions of a socialist market economy, we reinforced 
ideological education on patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism. Adhering to the principle of emphasizing 
construction, we accelerated the implementation of Jiangsu's 
"Outline of the Program for Building Socialist Spiritual 
Civilization During the Eighth Five-Year Plan." We vigorously 
promoted outstanding national cultures, paid keen attention to 
the production of intellectual products, and obtained new 
results in literature, drama, music, dance, arts, radio, and TV 
as well as in journalism and social studies. Many creative 
works won national grand prizes. We intensified publicity aimed 
at foreign countries to make Jiangsu better known overseas. 
Mass campaigns to build spiritual civilization were launched 
successively and a number of provincial-level civility units 
were designated and commended. Cultural undertakings further 
developed, and construction of cultural facilities was 
quickened. Radio and TV broadcasts were brought to a wider 
audience, with TV broadcasting covering 93.3 percent of the 
population. We strengthened supervision over cultural markets 
and set up a preliminary management network characterized by 
unified leadership, division of labor, and coordination of 
various departments concerned. We achieved results in wiping 
out pornography and cracking down on illicit publications. Mass 
sports activities flourished, and the level of athletic sports 
was enhanced. Last year, athletes from Jiangsu scored good 
performances at the Seventh National Games, won nine world 
championships at major international competition, and broke 
three world and six Asian records. 
  To correspond with the demands of the socialist market 
economic system, we further strengthened democratic and legal 
system construction. Governments at all levels consciously 
subjected themselves to the supervision of people's congresses 
and their standing committees at the same level, as well as 
exploited the political consultative and democratic supervision 
role of people's political consultative conferences, democratic 
parties, trade unions, and mass organizations. We handled a 
total of 787 various suggestions and motions submitted by 
deputies of people's congresses and people's political 
consultative conferences. The government earnestly did a good 
job in handling the people's complaints. It forged closer 
contacts with mass organizations such as trade unions, communist 
youth leagues, and women's federations. Nationality and 
religious work was strengthened. The legislation of local 
administrative laws, particularly economic laws, was quickened. 
We popularized laws through education. We earnestly carried 
out CPC Central Committee and State Council plans as well as the 
guidelines of the Second Plenary Session of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection on the short-term 
anti-corruption struggle; and we achieved temporary results in 
the relevant work. We applied a practical approach to 
strengthen the task of building a clean government and made 
notable progress in guiding cadres to practice honesty and 
discipline. We dealt with a group of major and important cases, 
and handed down severe punishments on a group of corrupt 
elements. We took special steps to rectify several unhealthy 
styles, which were especially scorned by the people. We 
initiated measures to stop government offices from engaging in 
business and enterprises, abolished a group of wanton fee 
collections, and rectified the practice of spending public funds 
for local and overseas travel. We fully upheld the tasks for 
comprehensive control of social order and severely punished 
serious criminal activities and economic crimes in accordance 
with the law to eliminate the hideous social phenomenon. The 
people's armed police force as well as public security, state 
security, and judicial administrative departments continued to 
consolidate their development. We actively supported the 
construction and reform of Jiangsu-based People's Liberation 
Army troops. Our militia and reserve duty soldiers made new 
progress. We actively conducted "double support" activities, 
which enhanced army-government and army-people unity. 
  Last year, at a time when we experienced arresting 
contradictions and greater difficulties in economic life, it was 
not easy for Jiangsu to achieve these results in economic and 
social development. We realized that we must seize opportunities 
whether the economic environment is good or bad. The crux lies 
in making the best use of situations, developing strong points 
while avoiding weak points, and seeking development in 
restructuring. To quicken economic development, it is necessary 
to consciously uphold deepened reform and widened opening up; 
realistically resolve profound contradictions in economic 
operations; accelerate the pace of the transition to a socialist 
market economy, and continue to emancipate and develop social 
productive forces. We should always rely on the vast number of 
cadres and people, actively develop and advance, and strive to 
explore development avenues suited to local conditions. We will 
then be able to step forward more solidly and forcefully. 
  Fellow deputies, in the past year, under the guidance of the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party's basic line; the direct leadership of the Jiangsu CPC 
Provincial Committee; and through the unity and struggle of the 
entire province, various tasks determined by the First Session 
of the Eighth Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress for 1993 were 
basically accomplished. On behalf of the provincial people's 
government, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to 
workers; peasants; intellectuals; cadres; Jiangsu-based People's 
Liberation Army troops; officers and men of armed police force; 
and public security cadres and police officers in the entire 
province; democratic parties, industry and commerce 
associations, and nonparty patriots; mass organizations, 
including trade unions, communist youth leagues, and women's 
federations; as well as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots 
and overseas Chinese who have enthusiastically supported 
Jiangsu's modernization. 
  While affirming the achievements, we must soberly realize 
shortcomings and defects in the government's work and 
difficulties and contradictions on the road of advancement. 
Agriculture as the foundation of the economy is still relatively 
weak; and maintaining stable grain and cotton production remains 
a formidable task. The investment structure in fixed assets is 
not rational; energy, transport, and other "bottleneck" 
constraints stand out very prominently; and problems related to 
low-level and redundant processing industries have yet to be 
solved. Price rises are high; and vegetable and nonstaple food 
prices, in particular, have increased drastically. Poor 
management of enterprises and problems of safety in production 
and transportation have resulted in a number of major accidents. 
Science and technology, education, culture, and other social 
undertakings are incompatible with the development of the 
provincial economy. We are slow in changing government 
functions; and our thinking and work style still cannot meet 
requirements for the establishment of a socialist market 
economy. A handful of government functionaries are corrupt, and 
formalism and bureaucratism have undermined the government's 
ties with the masses. We must pay keen attention to and 
earnestly solve these problems. 
<H5>  2. </H5>
  This year will be crucial for maintaining a sustained, 
rapid, 
and healthy development of the economy, as well as promoting 
reform. In line with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Seventh Plenary (Enlarged) 
Session of the Eighth Provincial Party Committee has put forth 
two targets to be accomplished by Jiangsu before the year 2000. 
The first is the target of reform, that is, to establish the 
basic framework of a socialist market economic structure in 
about five years; and the second is the target of development, 
that is, on basis of prefulfilling in 1993 the objective of 
quadrupling the gross annual value of industrial and 
agricultural production, to realize the objective of sextupling 
the gross annual value of industrial and agricultural 
production, to substantially improve Jiangsu's overall economic 
performance and comprehensive strength, and to bring economic 
prosperity to the people throughout the province ahead of 
schedule before the end of this century. Centering around these 
two targets, the overall requirement of the work of the 
government this year is: Under the guidance of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line, to comprehensively 
implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and 
Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in 
further emancipating minds, persistently seeking truth from 
facts, and firmly seizing the opportunity; to strengthen the 
intensity of reform in accelerating the process of 
internationalizing Jiangsu's economy; to speed up structural 
readjustment and scientific and technological progress for 
improving economic performance and efficiency, and maintaining 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development; and to 
intensify the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, 
democracy, and the legal system for safeguarding political and 
social stability, promoting the all-around progress of society, 
and opening up a new situation in reform, opening up, and 
modernization construction. 
  The major targets of Jiangsu's economic and social 
development for this year are: The gross provincial product is 
to increase by 12 percent, including 4 percent in primary 
industries, 14 percent in secondary industries, and 18 percent 
in tertiary industries; financial revenue, by 7 percent; 
investments in local fixed assets, by 25 percent; imports and 
exports, by 9 percent, including at least 17 percent in exports; 
retail sales, by 20 percent; the general index of retail prices, 
by less than 12 percent; the average wage of workers and staff, 
by about 16 percent; the average net income of farmers, by at 
least 14 percent; the natural population growth rate, by less 
than 9.83 per 1,000; and urban unemployment rate, by less than 
2.5 percent. 
  Many favorable factors can help us realize the various 
targets for this year. Judging from the domestic and 
international situation, we are facing a rare historic 
opportunity. We must seize, cherish, and make good use of this 
opportunity. As Jiangsu made a relatively early start in 
introducing market-oriented reform and practicing 
multi-directional opening, the provincial economy has developed 
in a sustained and rapid manner, social undertakings have 
expanded continually, and comprehensive economic strength has 
been built up substantially; thereby laying the sound foundation 
for expediting reform, opening up, and modernization 
construction. We must firmly grasp the central task of economic 
construction, and unite and rely on people throughout the 
province in jointly working to further improve work in all 
fields of endeavor. 
  Recently, the CPC Central Committee emphatically pointed 
out: 
The overall interests of the whole party and country's work are 
seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up 
wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability. 
Work in all fields must serve and be subordinate to these 
overall interests. To this end, it is necessary to pay close 
attention to the following aspects: 
  -- Placing deepening reform in a conspicuous 
position. Grasping the opportunities for self-development 
and pushing the economy to a new level after several years are 
the fundamental and pressing tasks we face. Meanwhile, it 
should be noted that an accelerated development must rely on 
deepening the reform. If we fail to grasp the current favorable 
opportunities brought about by reform and effectively resolve 
the inbedded problems in the economic structure and straighten 
out economic relations, we will be unable to maintain a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. It is 
therefore necessary to energetically push forward various 
reforms and strive to make breakthroughs in certain key issues. 
As many reform measures have been promulgated this year, the 
implementation of which involve greater difficulties, it is 
essential to enhance the concept of taking the situation as a 
whole and have them conscientiously implemented through 
meticulous arrangements and in a well-coordinated way, making 
sure that experiences are summed up in time to achieve concrete 
results. 
  -- Attaching importance to enhancing both quality and 
efficiency in economic growth. We should foster the 
concept of "development is the final word" for a speedier 
development whenever and wherever possible. As long as we 
stress efficiency and quality, we have nothing to worry about in 
developing an export-oriented economy. Of course, attention 
should be paid to avoid a lopsided pursuit of production values 
and a blind race for speed. We should establish a new mechanism 
for economic growth required by a socialist market economy, 
attach greater importance to bringing out the role of science 
and technology as the prime productive force, vigorously promote 
scientific and technological progress, and effectively 
strengthen operation management. We should attach importance to 
coordinated development among primary, secondary, and tertiary 
industry and within each industry itself -- particularly the 
appropriate solution of such problems as "bottleneck" 
constraints in basic industry and the comparatively lower 
proportion of tertiary industry -- to optimize the industrial 
structure. We should be more active in widening the scope of 
economic activities, strengthen the social division of labor, 
speed up the adjustment of stocks in social assets, and enhance 
an intensive management level and overall economic quality. We 
should apply guiding ideology in actual work and genuinely put 
economic construction on track with raising economic efficiency 
as its focus. 
  -- Opening wider to the outside world. In facing 
a new situation brought about by accelerated reform and 
development, we must further enhance the sense of urgency that 
calls for opening wider to the outside world with even greater 
coverage and at a higher level. While vigorously developing an 
export-oriented economy, we should make full use of 
international markets, funds, technologies, and resources to 
further enlarge total Jiangsu's economic strength; improve 
technological composition; enhance efficiency of resources 
disposal; and seek harmonious links with the international 
economy in a faster and better way to quicken the process of 
establishing a new socialist market economic system. 
  -- We must resolutely safeguard political and social 
stability. Stability is indispensable for reform and 
development. Reform, opening up, and economic development cannot 
possibly proceed without social stability. Thus, while we must 
seize the opportunity for development, we must fully realize the 
problems ahead and work cautiously but with daring so that we 
can discover problems and solve them properly as soon as they 
are discovered. As reform proceeds, interests in various 
sectors certainly must be readjusted. This calls for meticulous 
ideological and political work. We must properly educate and 
enlighten the masses, pay attention to protecting their vital 
interests, and be concerned with improving their livelihood so 
that they will understand and support reform and so that reform 
will truly become their common understanding and conscious 
action. In handling economic affairs, we must consider both the 
immediate and long-range needs. While we must do our best, we 
must also assess our strength and do what we can. Overexerting 
ourselves is not proper. In short, we must take concrete 
measures to create a stable political environment and an 
economic environment that can facilitate reform, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  -- We must always uphold the principle of promoting 
material civilization and socialist ethics at the same 
time. The deepening of reform, the broadening of opening 
up, and especially the establishment of the socialist market 
economic system, will certainly trigger profound changes in 
people's way of thinking, their concept of values, and their 
lifestyles. In line with these changes, we must intensify our 
efforts in promoting socialist ethics and make sure that our 
economic construction will proceed coordinated with the 
development of our socialist cause. Focusing on economic 
construction, we must draw up overall plans for promoting 
socialist ethics, building a democratic legal system, managing 
public security comprehensively, and intensifying ideological 
and ethical education so that we can foster our national spirit, 
promote good public conduct, and expedite the development of the 
socialist cause with Chinese characteristics in all sectors. 
<H5>  3. </H5>
  To achieve the targets set for Jiangsu's economic and social 
development this year, we must focus our attention on 
accomplishing the following projects. 
  (1) We must continue to deepen reform by promoting it 
in all sectors and making breakthroughs in key sectors. 
Focusing on expediting the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system, we must give priority to establishing a modern 
enterprise system and reforming macroeconomic management as well 
as carry out other project supporting reform. 
  State enterprises must continue to replace their 
operating mechanisms and explore effective ways to establish a 
modern enterprise system. Relacing the operating 
mechanisms of large and medium state enterprises, which are 
pillars of the national economy, are essential for deepening 
their restructuring. We must continue to implement the 
"Enterprise Law" and the "Regulations Governing the Change of 
Operating Mechanisms of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" so 
that enterprises can truly enjoy their privileges and fulfill 
their responsibilities. Enterprises must continue to improve 
their internal mechanisms and revitalize their operations 
through reforming their labor, personnel, and distribution 
systems. Certain large and medium enterprises should experiment 
with modern operating systems so as to explore ways to become 
modern enterprises and accumulate experiences in this regard. 
At least 20 percent of large and medium state enterprises 
should operate as corporate companies. The existing 400 or so 
enterprise groups should gradually reorganize themselves into 
businesses with stock held primarily by corporations. 
Enterprises in competitive trades operating in line with the 
state's industrial policy should be encouraged to reorganize 
themselves to become limited-liability companies funded by state 
and other corporations. Some large state-owned enterprises 
whose operations are relevant to the national economy and the 
people's livelihood should be designated to reorganize 
themselves to become limited-liability companies funded 
exclusively by the state. A small number of limited-liability 
companies should be designated to experiment with selling stocks 
in foreign currencies. Small enterprises should use various 
means to readjust their asset inventories. Efforts must be made 
to strengthen the management of state assets to make sure that 
the values of state assets can appreciate or be maintained, and 
that state assets will not be lost. Collective enterprises 
should continue to promote the joint-stock cooperative system. 
While promoting the development of public-owned businesses, we 
should encourage the establishment of independent and private 
businesses. We should treat all forms of enterprises equally and 
create for them conditions for competing on an equal footing. 
  In line with the need to reform the macroeconomic 
system, we must earnestly reform the fiscal, taxation, banking, 
and investment systems. All reform measures should be 
carried out in accordance with the state plan. The provincial 
plan of separating the provincial and municipal tax systems 
should be improved. A more equitable and binding fiscal system 
should be established. Local treasuries should make efforts to 
balance local revenues and expenditures and avoid deficits. 
Earnest efforts must be made to implement the new tax system, 
reform the tax system, and dovetail the new and old tax systems. 
Every effort must be made to explore additional tax resources, 
manage taxation affairs according to law, strengthen tax 
collection and management, and prevent losses of tax revenue. 
We should assist relevant central departments to strengthen the 
central bank's supervision over the implementation of monetary 
policies and all types of financial institutions. Specialized 
state banks should take positive and steady steps to replace 
their operating mechanisms with those of state-owned commercial 
banks. Systematic steps should be taken to establish rural 
cooperative banks and municipal cooperative banks and to 
encourage foreign-funded banks and national commercial banks to 
set up branches in Jiangsu. We should actively promote 
standardized credit services between different regions and 
broaden credit avenues. We should develop and improve the 
securities markets and strive to have our request approved for 
setting up a provincial securities trade center. We should 
deepen reform of the insurance system, and speed up the 
development of insurance businesses. We must properly 
restructure the foreign exchange system and intensify the 
construction of the foreign exchange market. We will introduce 
mechanisms governing market competition so that enterprises can 
play stronger roles as main investors. We should, through 
promoting joint investment and selling stocks, guide capital to 
flow into industries and trades that badly need development. 
  We should continue to speed up building a market system 
and continue to promote price reform. We should give 
priority to establishing the markets for goods and services 
essential for production, such as money, technical expertise, 
property rights, labor, real estate, and information. We should 
continue to standardize and develop the money market, improve 
the comprehensive and supporting services in the marketing of 
technical expertise, encourage proficient personnel and workers 
to flow rationally, and develop market agent services. We 
should continue to establish and develop a large number of 
large, regional wholesale markets of agricultural and sideline 
products, industrial consumer goods, and capital goods; and 
these markets must have a fairly large capacity and be able to 
provide comprehensive services. We must intensify market 
management and supervision and crack down on the manufacturing 
and selling of counterfeit and inferior goods so as to protect 
fair competition. We must actively and steadily carry out price 
reform, continue to merge the different prices of capital goods, 
and continue to improve the mechanisms for price formation. We 
must speed up replacing the operating mechanisms of state-owned 
distributors so they can give scope to their leading roles in 
ensuring supply and holding down prices. We must earnestly 
implement the system under which localities can have special 
reserves of important commodities, and properly collect and use 
the funds for regulating market prices and hedging against risks 
caused by price fluctuations for important materials. We must 
intensify price supervision and inspection and make efforts to 
stabilize the market's commodity prices. 
  We will gradually estalish a rational system governing 
income distribution and social security, and promote 
comprehensive supporting reforms. We must continue to make 
sure that enterprises have autonomy over their internal 
distribution so that their workers' wages can be truly 
commensurated with economic returns, and so that enterprises 
will establish or improve their mechanisms for restraining 
internal distribution. Institutions should have different wage 
systems and different forms of distribution. Self- supporting 
institutions may implement the same wage system as that of 
enterprises. On the basis of reforming their wage systems, 
administrative state organs should gradually establish their 
systems governing normal promotions and wage increases. We 
should gradually establish a consolidated organ to take charge 
of social security, and we should separate administration from 
the operation of insurance funds and tighten the management of 
all types of funds. Enterprises should improve their old-age 
pension systems and insurance against unemployment, carry out 
pilot projects on workers' medical services, and strenghten the 
functions of social services. We should establish a farmers' 
old-age pension system under which farmers' family support will 
be supplemented by community assistance. We must consolidate, 
develop, and improve rural areas' cooperative medical services, 
and carry out in selected rural areas experimental cooperative 
medical insurance projects. In light of state regulations, we 
must speed up housing reform, which places emphasis on selling 
publically owned housing and which sells, rents, and builds 
housing simultaneously. 
  (2) Vigorously develop an export-oriented economy and 
accelerate the process of economic internationalization. 
While reforming the management systems for foreign trade and 
foreign exchange, we should seize the opportunity to expand our 
foreign trade in order to promote the development of an open 
economy. 
  Continue to increase our ability to earn more foreign 
exchange through exports. We should quickly change the 
operating mechanisms of foreign trade enterprises, accelerate 
the integration of trade and industry, trade and technology, and 
trade and agriculture and encourage large foreign trade 
enterprises to move toward industrialization and 
internationalization and to form enterprise groups. We should 
allow enterprises to export more of their products themselves 
and authorize more production enterprises, scientific research 
units, and commercial and materials enterprises the necessary 
conditions to deal with their foreign customers. We should 
continue to implement the market diversification strategy, with 
product quality as a top concern; we should consolidate and 
develop our traditional markets, vigorously open new ones, and 
increase our share in the international market. We should 
accelerate the building of an overseas economic and trade 
network, strengthen the association of our enterprises abroad, 
more extensively carry out international economic and trade 
activities, and raise our economic returns abroad. We should 
accelerate the readjustment of our export mix and support and 
encourage the export of machinery, electrical products, 
technology-extensive products, and complete sets of equipment. 
Through scientific and technological progress, policy guidance, 
and improved management, we should strengthen the system for 
guaranteeing the quality of exports and after-sale service and 
increase our ability to compete in the international market. We 
should make great efforts to develop international tourism and 
increase our nonrade foreign exchange earnings. 
  Further improve the scale and level of using foreign 
funds. We plan to actually and directly use $3.9 billion 
of foreign funds this year, a 30 percent increase over last 
year. We should make vigorous efforts to solicit foreign 
businessmen to invest in the province and to expand fields for 
investment. We should increase the total amount of investment 
by foreign businessmen and attract more consortia and 
multinational companies to invest in the province to expand the 
scale of projects and raise their level. We should encourage 
the foreign partner of a joint venture to increase his 
proportion of investment; we should encourage foreign 
businessmen to run wholly foreign-funded enterprises. We should 
particularly guide foreign businessmen in investing on a large 
scale in transportation, communications, energy, raw and 
semifinished materials, agricultural development, infrastructure 
facilities, and basic and tertiary industries. We should 
develop more technology-extensive and new- and high-technology 
projects and accelerate the technical transformation of large 
and medium-sized enterprises by using foreign funds. We should 
conscientiously sum up experiences, further improve the 
investment environment, and strengthen marcoeconomic guidance 
for and the coordination and management of enterprises with 
foreign investment. We should conscientiously make overall 
planning for various projects and the evaluation of assets. We 
should make sure that foreign-funded enterprises have enough 
investment, go into operation on schedule, have the ability to 
earn foreign exchange, and yield good economic results. We 
should make better use of loans from foreign governments and 
international financial institutions. 
  Actively expand economic and technological cooperation 
abroad. We should expand our economic cooperation with 
foreign countries. Our contracting of projects and provision of 
labor services abroad, now with the focus on construction and 
transportation, should develop into various fields, and we 
should raise the level of such economic cooperation. While 
increasing the export of manual labor services, we should also 
pay attention to the export of technological services. We 
should expand such economic cooperation by striving to contract 
larger projects for construction. 
  Build various development zones according to high 
standards. We should persistently implement the principle 
of giving top priority to using foreign funds, earning foreign 
exchange through export, and developing new and high technology. 
We should introduce appropriate-scale, up-to-standard, and 
high-efficient projects and strive to operate such projects 
according to their distinctive features. We should establish a 
new, flexible, and high-efficiency management system and 
operating mechanisms and form a comprehensive, coordinated 
good-quality service network. We should start the construction 
of the Suzhou Industrial Park. The Zhangjiagang Bonded Zone is 
operated as a closed area [feng guan yun xing 1409 7070 6663 
5887]. 
  (3) Strengthen the foundational position of 
agriculture, develop the rural economy in an all-around 
way. We should fully implement the "policies and measures 
for developing agriculture and the rural economy at the current 
stage" of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, 
deepen reform in rural areas, actively adjust the economic 
structure, stress increasing the income of peasants, and promote 
a sustained and all-around development of the rural economy. 
  Actively establish a new operational system for the 
rural areas. We should continue to consolidate and improve 
the responsibility system, the main form of which is the 
household contract with remuneration linked to output, and the 
system of unified management combined with independent 
management. Those contacts should be extended for 30 more years 
without change when they mature. The period of contract may be 
longer for agriculture of a development nature. In places with 
good conditions, we should speed up the development of 
large-scale operations in an appropriate manner. We should 
continue to promote reform of the marketing system for 
large-volume agricultural products and promote direct contact 
between producers and marketing departments. We should 
encourage and support cooperative economic organizations in the 
rural areas and peasants' entering the distribution field. We 
should promote the prosperity of rural markets and continue to 
promote the establishment of rural cooperative funds. We should 
strengthen the socialized service system in rural areas; 
establish various kinds of combined enterprises, including crop 
cultivation, animal husbandry, processing and marketing; and 
promote the integration of agriculture, industry, and trade. We 
should further strengthen collective economic organizations at 
township and village levels and give full play to the role of 
services provided by economic and technological departments 
related to agriculture. We should consolidate the contingents 
of service workers, expand the scope of services, and raise the 
quality of services. 
  Continue to readjust the mix of agricultural 
production. Agricultural production should be geared to 
the need of the market. We should vigorously develop the kinds 
of farming that provide high yields of fine quality with maximum 
efficiency and can earn foreign exchange. We should continue to 
stabilize the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
crops; guarantee their planting acreage; and find ways and means 
to seize an all-around bumper harvest in agricultural production 
for the whole year. We should vigorously develop diversified 
farming operations and gradually realize specialized production 
in various production bases and regions. We should give full 
play to the advantage of specialized and large-scale production. 
We should develop export-oriented agriculture and encourage 
agricultural production enterprises with good conditions to 
export their products in a direct manner. 
  Persist in using science and education to prosper 
agriculture. We should strengthen the research of 
agricultural science and technology and the training of 
technical personnel, and promote the application of findings of 
agricultural science and technology. We should develop 
vocational training in the rural areas, do a good job in 
technological training at the grass-roots level, popularize 
knowledge of science and technology, and constantly raise the 
quality of peasants. 
  Further improve conditions for agricultural 
production. We should increase the proportion of local 
capital construction funds, budgetary funds, and credit funds 
for agriculture. We should also prevent the loss and shift of 
special funds for agriculture to other purposes. We should 
encourage collectives and peasants to increase their cash and 
labor investment in agriculture, and continue to implement the 
policy of using industry to supplement and develop agriculture. 
We should speed up the construction of large and medium-sized 
irrigation works and their supplementary facilities. We should 
do a good job in harnessing main rivers and building water 
conservancy works to strengthen the ability to resist natural 
disasters. We should accelerate the comprehensive development 
and utilization of agricultural resources. We should improve 
land administration and effectively protect farmland. We should 
seriously implement the responsibility system for concerned 
departments of the province and various cities and trades, and 
make sure that the supply of industrial products for 
agriculture, especially chemical fertilizers and other 
agricultural means of production, can be provided for peasants 
in a timely manner with good quality, adequate quantity, and 
reasonable prices. We should strictly control and reduce 
peasants' burdens, effectively protect the peasants interests, 
and find ways and means to increase peasants' income. 
  Vigorously develop and improve village and town 
enterprises. We should stress promoting the joint stock 
system and speed up the reform of the ownership system of 
village and town enterprises. We should gradually standardize 
administration and prevent the loss of collective assets. In 
line with state industrial policy and the demand of domestic and 
foreign markets, we should step up the readjustment of 
industries and industrial production. We should accelerate 
technological transformation, strenthen the development of new 
products, and expand the market. We should vigorously develop 
economic associations of various forms and promote cooperation 
in specialized fields. We should improve organizational, 
operational, and financial management to further improve the 
quality, scale, and efficiency of enterprises. We should 
integrate the work of developing village and town enterprises 
with the development of public works and environmental 
protection. We should guide village and town enterprises to 
concentrate in an appropriate manner so as to develop their 
combined advantages and lead to the construction of small cities 
and rural economic development. 
  (4) Intensify structural adjustment to enhance overall 
economic quality. We should closely rely on scientific and 
technological progress to quicken the pace of structural 
adjustment that may in turn help Jiangsu secure new edges in 
acute economic competition. 
  Enhance scientific and technological involvement in the 
industrial economy and for better efficiency. We will 
apply new technologies and techniques to accelerate the pace of 
transformation in traditional industries and vigorously develop 
new products. A host of technical transformation projects 
designed to improve key products will be appropriately 
implemented and unfinished jobs will be followed up to ensure 
successful development and production of important products. We 
will upgrade technological equipment to enhance our capability 
in developing science and technology. We will go all out to 
implement the "symbolic projects" to speed up industrialization 
of high and new technologies; to develop a string of 
high-technology, high value-added, and high exchange-earning key 
products; and to nurture a number of backbone enterprises with a 
strong high-technology background and new industries producing 
high-grade merchandise. While accelerating the adjustment of 
enterprises' organizational structure, we will, based on 
products and assets links, incorporate a host of large 
enterprise groups with improved professionalism and 
intensiveness. We will actively open up new markets, 
particularly rural and international markets and urge 
enterprises to improve their management, do more home work, 
enhance quality, produce more and spend less, and increase 
revenues and cut down expenditures. Enterprises running at a 
loss should make serious efforts to reverse the situation, while 
those already in the black should try harder to increase 
profits. We will strengthen labor protection and 
conscientiously improve workplace safety. 
  We will give full play to the superiority of the 
construction 
industry and be determined to enhance its management level and 
overall quality, diversify its operations, open up domestic and 
overseas construction markets, and raise its economic efficiency. 
  Concentrate strength to improve infrastructure and 
basic industries. We will maintain a reasonable size of 
investment, optimize the investment mix, and make sure that the 
limited financial and material resources will first be diverted 
to the construction of key projects. We will fulfill the annual 
projects of harnessing the Huaihe River and the Taifu Lake, 
complete construction of the main channel leading to the Yuhe 
River, strive to commission a 1.225-million kwt electric power 
generating unit and related transmission installations, and 
accelerate construction of the Jiangsu stretch of the 
Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway and the first-class highways linking 
Nanjing with Lianyungang and Nantong respectively, and the 
improvement of canals in Southern Jiangsu. Works will soon begin 
in constructing the new Nanjing airport and the highway bridge 
across the Chang Jiang at Jiangyin. Some 1.25 telephone 
switchboards will be added to improve better telephone services 
in both urban and rural areas, while communications networks 
will be further expanded with improved technology. Effective 
efforts will be made to ensure the availability of such 
important raw and processed materials as iron and steel, cement, 
acrylic fiber, and polyester. We will speed up revision and 
examination of overall urban and rural planning; strengthen city 
management; improve public utilities, including roads, water and 
gas supplies, fire services, and environmental protection. We 
will actively explore new sources and ways to raise funds from 
the community in support of certain key projects and exercise 
stricter project control to ensure engineering quality, shorter 
building time, and better investment returns. 
  Speed up development of tertiary industry. 
Efforts will be made to increase the proportion of tertiary 
industry in the gross national product through meticulous 
planning, rational distribution, and enhancement of overall 
efficiency. While upholding the principle of the state, 
collective, and individual playing their respective roles, we 
will encourage collective economic organizations in both urban 
and rural areas, privately run enterprises, and individuals to 
go ahead with the development of tertiary industry. We will 
optimize the internal structure of tertiary industry by 
developing pillar trades and professions closely related to 
production and livelihood of the people and characterized by 
little investment, quick return, high efficiency, and more job 
opportunities. While vigorously developing new trades and 
professions involving scientific and technological advancement, 
we will pay attention to the development of the 
intelligence-type of tertiary industry, including information, 
consulting, accountancy, auditing, and legal services. We will 
actively develop tourism and the entertainment industry; 
regulate the real estate market; adjust the mix in real estate 
investment; and speed up the construction of ordinary urban and 
rural housing, particularly that with little profit margin built 
for families with extreme financial difficulties. 
  (5) Bring into play local advantages to promote common 
development of the provincial economy. It is necessary to 
earnestly implement the outline program for economic development 
in seven cities in the Chang Jiang valley and four cities in 
northern Jiangsu, and to rationalize the economic structure so 
as to improve overall economic performance and competitiveness. 
  Proceeding from the actual condition of each locality 
in blazing a path of development with local 
characteristics. Localities in the Chang Jiang valley 
should fully utilize their geographical advantage and existing 
foundations in stepping up efforts to converge local economic 
development with Pudong's opening and development. They should 
further optimize the distribution of productive forces; go all 
out to explore ways for developing an export-oriented economy; 
expedite the establishment of a sound market economic 
operational system; and strive to be forerunners in reform, 
opening up, and modernization construction; thereby making 
positive contributions to the provincial economic and social 
development. Localities in northern Jiangsu should mobilize the 
masses and cadres and work hard and self-reliantly to create the 
conditions for accelerating development. In exploring ways for 
developing an economy suitable for local conditions, they should 
pay particular attention to promoting diversified management and 
actively develop village and township industries. It is 
necessary to exploit local resources in developing intensively 
processed products and increasing the added value of products. 
It is also necessary to adopt more flexible policy measures to 
vigorously develop the publicly owned economic sector and to 
encourage individual and private economic sectors in urban and 
rural areas to invest in areas compatible with their operations. 
We must allow some areas and individuals to become rich first 
through hard and honest work and legitimate operation in order 
to accelerate the pace toward prosperity. 
  Adopting practical measures to support northern Jiangsu 
to speed up economic development. In view of northern 
Jiangsu's relatively weak economic foundation, the provincial 
government shall assist the region's development mainly through 
the following four measures: (1) We should expedite 
infrastructure construction. To further improve the investment 
environment, efforts shall be stepped up to construct main 
highways, including the Nanjing-Lianyungang and Nanjing-Nantong 
primary grade highways, the Nanjing-Yancheng highway, and the 
section of the national highway Route 204 in the north of 
Yancheng; to map out plans and complete the first-phase 
preparation for the Xuzhou-Lianyungang main national highway and 
the northern Jiangsu section of the Tongjiang-Sanya national 
highway; to start the construction of the Xinyi-Changzhou 
Railway; to map out plans and complete the first-phase 
preparation for coastal ports; and to speed up construction of 
the Yangzhou-Yancheng and Xinyi- Lianyungang optical trunks, and 
the construction of power stations and a number of basic 
industrial projects. (2) We should open the region wider to the 
outside world. We should bring into play the region's 
geographical advantage to continuously advance the strategy of 
opening up and developing the coastal region and the region 
along the eastern Longhai Railroad and should step up efforts to 
introduce investment from abroad and to establish lateral ties 
at home. In a bid to make the "showcase" of an open economy a 
great success, we should improve management of the existing 
national-level and newly established provincial-level 
development zones. Efforts should be made to utilize rich local 
resources and explore new ways for attracting foreign investors; 
and to integrate foreign trade with industry and agriculture, 
and energetically develop export-oriented agriculture. (3) We 
should quicken the restructuring of agriculture. Efforts should 
be made to earnestly implement the state's policies for 
strengthening the construction of commercial grain and cotton 
production bases and stabilizing grain and cotton production; 
and to energetically promote diversified management and 
invigorate the rural economy. (4) We should strive to do a 
better job in assisting the poor and coordinate the southern and 
the northern regions in aiding the poor. We should earnestly 
implement various aid-to-the-poor measures, strive to build up 
the stamina of economically underdeveloped areas for 
self-development, and help them shake off poverty and become 
well off as quickly as possible. We should further adopt 
economic measures to encourage state enterprises, urban and 
rural collective enterprises, private enterprises, research 
units, and individuals from the south to set up associations and 
conduct cooperation in various areas, at different levels, and 
in diverse forms. We should encourage the south to speed up the 
transfer of labor-intensive industries to the north in line with 
the policy of readjusting industrial structure. We should 
encourage the south and the north to cooperate in the exchange 
of talented people and labor services, to complement each other 
with one's strong points, and to promote common economic 
development of the south and the north. 
  (6) Further develop science and technology, education, 
and cultural undertakings to promote the all-around progress of 
society. The development of science and technology, 
education, and cultural undertakings is a major component of the 
modernization drive as well as an important guarantee for the 
smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. We must attach great importance to reform and 
development in these areas while concentrating resources on 
promoting economic construction. 
  Promoting the integration of science and technology 
with the economy. In line with the principle of "holding 
fast to one end and leaving the whole field open," we should 
give priority to stabilizing a compact contingent of scientific 
and technical personnel engaged in basic research, high-tech 
research, key research projects, and public welfare projects. 
We should give free reign to the research, development, and 
business activities of organizations engaged in developing 
technology or providing scientific and technical services; 
actively develop scientific and technological enterprises run by 
nongovernmental organizations; energetically promote technology 
markets; and more quickly transform new scientific findings and 
technological achievements into actual productive forces. We 
should increase input into science and technology through 
various channels to formulate step-by-step a well-structured, 
rationally distributed, and highly efficient system of research 
and development; and to promote the development of exploratory 
research in new and high technology and their related 
industries. We should coordinate the deployment of scientific 
research resources for the purpose of solving knotty 
technological problems which have an important bearing on the 
national economy. We should encourage and facilitate scientific 
research institutes and institutions of higher learning to 
cooperate with enterprises in conducting large-scale, 
high-quality research. To do good work in importing and 
assimilating advanced technology and in technical upgrading, we 
should establish a new framework under which the developmental 
efforts of research institutes are dovetailed to the 
introduction of imported technology. We should accelerate the 
construction of high-tech industrial development zones, and 
bring into play their leading role in readjusting the structure. 
We should strive to popularize advanced and applicable 
technologies, and step up the research and development of soft 
science. We should develop intermediary organizations for 
transferring technologies, attach importance to constructing 
bases for intermediate and industrial experiments, and form 
regional and professional organizations for technical renovation 
and a network for the diffusion of technology. 
  Making it a strategic task to give priority to 
education. We should further implement the "Outline 
Program for the Reform and Development of Education in China, 
ensure essential and stable input in education, and improve 
teaching quality and educational efficacy. We should accelerate 
the restructuring of the educational system and encourage joint 
management of schools in various forms to give rise to a new 
system in which the government plays the central role in running 
schools, and all walks of life pool their efforts to expand 
education. We should enhance the sense of urgency in enforcing 
compulsory education and continue to fight illiteracy. We 
should energetically develop vocational and adult education and 
other forms of social education and improve the structure of 
schools to better meet market needs. We should expand the 
decisionmaking powers of colleges and universities in running 
their own affairs, step up reform in the enrollment and 
employment system for graduates, adjust the establishment of 
specialities, and improve curricula and teaching materials and 
methods. Under the state's unified planning, we should 
concentrate resources to successfully run a number of key 
universities, subjects, and specialties. We should earnestly 
enforce the "Law on Teachers," improve the quality of teachers, 
safeguard teachers' lawful rights and interests, and foster a 
healthy atmosphere of respecting teachers and valuing education. 
  We should further create the environment and conditions for 
talents to emerge and play their full role. Training should be 
combined with the rational use of intellectual resources so as 
to bring into full play Jiangsu's superiority of talented 
people. We should coordinate the reform of the labor and wage 
systems with the system of promoting cadres, and should take 
steps to encourage fair competition and promote the rational 
flow of talents by opening jobs to public application. We 
should continue to improve the working and living conditions of 
intellectuals. In line with the principle of "supporting 
students studying overseas, encouraging them to return, and 
letting them decide for themselves whether to come or go," we 
should in various ways encourage talented people studying or 
residing in foreign countries to return and serve Jiangsu's 
reform, opening up, and modernization construction. 
  Further prosper cultural work. We should firmly 
adhere to the orientation of serving the people and serving 
socialism, implement the policy of "let a hundred flowers 
blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and follow 
the main guidelines while advocating diversification. We should 
seriously produce high quality spiritual products welcomed by 
the broad masses with emphasis on the "five firsts project [wu 
ge yi gong cheng 0063 0020 0001 1562 4453]." We should further 
develop the role of the theoretical, news, publication and 
cultural fields in uniting, encouraging, and educating the 
people, and have those fields serve the reform and opening up 
and the building of the two civilizations. We should seriously 
build spiritual civilization as outlined in the "Eighth 
Five-Year Plan," continue to improve and implement economic 
policy for cultural work, and increase investment through 
various channels to promote the development of cultural work. 
We should properly concentrate funds for doing some solid work 
to promote spiritual civilization. Based on the principle of 
giving priority to protecting and rescuing cultural relics, we 
should further improve the work of cultural museums. We should 
pay attention to the construction of libraries, cultural halls, 
scientific and technological pavilions and archives. We should 
strengthen cultural work at the grass-roots level, improve 
administration of the cultural market, and persist in 
"eradicating pornography" and cracking down on illegal 
publication activities. 
  Strive to develop public health and sports work. 
We should continue to unfold patriotic health campaigns in 
urban and rural areas and actively develop healthy cities. We 
should strengthen public health work, especially public health 
work and prevention of diseases in the rural areas. We should 
vigorously unfold various kinds of mass sports activities to 
strengthen people's bodies. We should conscientiously do a good 
job in holding the 13th Provincial Sports Meet and step up 
preparations for the Third National City Games. We should 
strengthen work to protect women and children, and attach 
importance to solving problems for the aged. We should show 
concern for and support the work for the handicapped, and strive 
to improve work and living conditions for disabled people. 
  Seriously grasp the work of family planning and 
environmental protection. We should strenthen the 
administration of family planning for the migrant population, 
improve management at the village level, consolidate the results 
of those units which have made improvements in family planning, 
and ensure that the birth control rate will exceed 90 percent. 
We should enhance people's consciousness of environmental 
protection, further strengthen the administration of 
environmental protection according to the law, achieve a 
comprehensive improvement of the environment in urban and rural 
areas, strictly control the development of new sources of 
pollution, and actively solve the problem of old sources of 
pollution. We should step up the pace of afforestation in 
plains areas, raise the level of greening in cities, and improve 
the ecological environment. 
  Fellow deputies! In the entire course of reform, opening up, 
and the modernization drive, we must pay strict attention to the 
construction of socialist spiritual civilization. We should arm 
the people with scientific theory, guide the people with correct 
public opinion, cultivate the people with a noble spirit, and 
encourage the people with outstanding literary and art works. 
We should organize the broad masses of cadres and people to 
study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics in a deep-going manner. We should 
continue to conduct education on patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism; education on arduous struggle and building the 
country through thrift and hard work; education on vocational 
ethics and social morality; and education on the basic national 
situation. We should strenthen national defense education, 
enhance all people's consciousness of national defense, and show 
concern for and support the construction and reform of the 
People's Liberation Army units stationed in Jiangsu. We should 
continue to do a good job in building civilized units, villages, 
and towns; turning more families into families with new customs 
and civilized families; "making three outstanding achievements 
[chuang san you 0482 0005 0327];" building double-support cities 
(counties); "building civilized units jointly by the armymen and 
people;" "supporting the Army and giving preferential treatment 
to military dependents" and other effective mass activities to 
promote the building of spiritual civilization. We should pay 
attention to actual results and raise the quality of our work. 
<H5>  4. </H5>
  The new situation of reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive has exerted higher requirements on 
government work. We should strive to raise our ideological 
standards, earnestly change government functions, 
conscientiously improve workstyle, strengthen administrative and 
coordinating capabilities, perform realistic work, seek 
pragmatic results, and continually strive to improve new working 
conditions. 
  Expeditiously change government functions and properly 
handle organizational reform. It is necessary to 
expeditiously transform government functions so that the 
government will engage in implementing policies on macroeconomic 
regulation and control, in properly planning and constructing 
infrastructural projects, and in strengthening social 
administration. By applying a combination of economic, legal, 
and mandatory administrative means and indirectly regulating 
economic operations, the government should be compatible with, 
guarantee, serve, and enhance the development of a socialist 
market economy. In accordance with the principle of changing 
functions, improving relations, streamlining administration with 
fewwer personnel, and raising efficiency, we should accelerate 
reform in government organizations. We should emphatically 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control and supervision 
of departments, upgrade the departmernts in charge of social 
administration, and gradually reduce the number of special 
organizations in charge of economic operations. We should 
accelerate reform in provincial government organizations and 
properly perform preparatory tasks before conducting reform in 
government organizations at city and county levels. We should 
establish, and later improve, a responsibility system for 
government organs and personnel at various levels so as to 
improve the personnel contingent and raise its quality. 
  Actively promote democratic progress and enhance 
scientific and democratic processes in decisionmaking. 
Governments at various levels should conscientiously accept the 
supervision of the people's congress and its standing committee 
at the corresponding level; should respect people's deputies' 
democratic rights; should earnestly listen to their ideas; 
should properly handle and implement people's deputies' 
proposals, suggestions, criticisms, and opinions; and should 
actively and properly coordinate with the people's deputies' 
experiment to appraise government departments' performance. We 
should uphold the system of multiparty cooperation and political 
consultation under the CPC's leadership. While making some 
major decisions and handling issues of common concern to the 
masses, we should, by holding democratic consultations and 
situation-report meetings, extensively listen to ideas of 
representatives from the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference [CPPCC], from various democratic parties, from the 
All- China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and from people 
without party affiliation so as to give full play to their roles 
in political consultation and democratic supervision. We should 
properly handle CPPCC committee members' proposals. 
Furthermore, we should establish, and improve later, a 
democratic administrative procedure, and should pay attention to 
studying decisionmaking processes and consultations. 
Additionally, we should earnestly implement policies so as to 
further improve our work on nationalities and religious affairs, 
and on issues concerning Taiwan and overseas Chinese. We should 
attach importance to mass organizations including trade unions, 
the Communist Youth League of China, and the All-China Women's 
Federation which serve as bridges and links between the 
government and the people. We should also improve democratic 
management; and should let staff's and workers' congresses, 
residents' committees, and villagers' committees earnestly play 
their roles so as to further vitalize democratic activities at 
the grass-roots units. 
  Enhance legal system work in a down-to-earth manner; 
exercise administrative functions according to law and raise 
work efficiency. It is necessary to do an even better job 
in mapping out plans for government legal system work in line 
with the requirements for building a socialist market system. 
According to the five-year legislative plan worked out by the 
provincial people's congress, steps should be quickened to 
formulate local laws and regulations which complement state laws 
and regulations and which help standardize market practices, 
maintain market order, enhance macroeconomic regulation and 
control, perfect the social security system, and promot opening 
up. A sound system for enforcement of administrative laws and 
regulations, for supervision and checking of law enforcement, 
and for reviewing administrative measures should be established, 
and the level of enforcing administrative laws and regulations 
should be raised. Phenomena such as disregarding the law, 
failure to strictly enforce the law, to investigate cases of 
breaking the law, and cases such as abusing power and breaking 
the law for departmental and regional interests in economic 
activities and in other activities should resolutely be 
rectified. Education in the legal system should be carried out 
in an in-depth manner so that people will gain an enhanced sense 
of the law. Steps should be taken to strenghthen the work of 
helping to mediate disputes among the people. Efforts to 
enhance comprehensive management of social order are needed. 
Measures should be worked out to improve the leadership 
responsibility system over the management of social order. 
There is a need to do an even better job in crime prevention at 
the grass-roots level. Social forces must be pooled and 
mobilized to help combat crime. Efforts should be kept up to 
severely crack down on crime. Resolute and continued efforts 
should be exerted to check all kinds of social ills. Concrete 
steps should be taken to strengthen managing public places in 
urban areas as well as to enhance management of transients. The 
work of cracking down on smuggling should be pursued according 
to law. The police force must be strictly managed. Law 
enforcement personnel should strive to improve themselves and to 
raise their professional and administrative quality. At the 
same time, it is necessary to provide them with adequate funds 
for handling cases and to gradually improve their working 
conditions. 
  Control abrupt commodity price rises and show concern 
for the people's livelihood. Special attention should be 
paid to help solve problems which are of great concern to the 
masses. Management over commodity prices should be 
strengthened. There is a need to establish and improve a 
monitoring and control system over the prices of daily 
necessities which have a direct bearing on the citizens' daily 
lives. Attention should be given to vegetable and grain supply. 
All levels of governments are urged to continuously work out 
policies and measures to support the production and supply of 
nonstaple food, to run well hog-breeding and vegetable-growing 
bases, and to do a good job in nonstaple food production. While 
developing the economy, we need to do our best to help increase 
urban and rural citizens' incomes. We also need to pay 
teachers' salaries on time. The basic needs of life must be 
ensured for staff members and workers who have lost their jobs 
because their enterprises have gone bankrupt or because their 
enterprises have cut back on production. We need to provide 
effective relief for poor households in urban and rural areas 
and show concern for and help arrange retirees' post-retirement 
life. Importance should be attached to the work of handling 
well the people's mail and to the people visiting government 
departments to air grievances, to opening up channels that would 
help forge a closer tie between the government and the people, 
to grasp in a timely manner the masses' opinions and demands, 
and to listen to and accept rationalization suggestions from the 
masses. It is necessary to correctly handle contradictions 
among the people which emerge in the new situation, to strive to 
solve problems in the initial stage, and to rely on the masses 
to help maintain and develop a stable and united political 
situation. 
  Keep in mind the purpose of whole-heartedly serving the 
people; dutifully performing duties; and enhancing the building 
of a clean administration. This is a basic task for 
building up the regime as well as an important guarantee for 
realizing smooth progress in reform and development. We should 
conscientiously implement the CPC Central Committee's decision 
on combatting corruption and do a good job to help bring about 
honest performance of official duties by leading cadres, 
particularly those cadres working at or above county-level 
departments. We will resolutely investigate major and important 
corruption cases and will resolutely mete out punishment to 
corrupt officials. We will conduct special anticorruption 
campaigns, exert great efforts to rectify unhealthy tendencies 
in various trades and professions, and consolidate and expand 
the results which we have scored in earlier anticorruption 
campaigns. At the same time, we need to establish a system that 
will enhance the building of a clean administration, to 
gradually put in place an effective internal and external 
supervision and restraining mechanism that will help prevent 
abuse of power cases. We will try to be thrifty as always in 
running all undertakings and to oppose extravagance. Personnel 
at all government levels must work hard, be pragmatic, and raise 
professional levels and work efficiency. More efforts are 
needed to study the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, particularly to make in- depth study of volume 
3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and the "decision" 
adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee. We must study and understand the socialist market 
economy and acquire such new knowledge as modern science and 
technology. As the state's major policies are already in place, 
the key lies in implementing them. We should develop a 
realistic workstyle; overcome bureaucratism; guard against 
formalism; go deep among grass-roots units to conduct 
investigation; understand actual conditions; promote advanced 
experiences; discover problems; properly handle contradictions; 
and make sure that all undertakings will progress in a positive 
and steady manner. 
  Fellow deputies! We now face a glorious yet arduous task in 
the new year. Let us rely closely on the people in the 
province; work with one heart and one mind: rouse ourselves for 
vigorous efforts; display a pioneering spirit; work in a 
down-to-earth manner to score a new victory for Jiangsu's 
reform, opening up, and modernization construction under the 
guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line and 
under the correct leadershiip of the CPC Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.

  [Text] Seoul, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- ROK National Assembly 
Speaker Yi Man-sop met with the visiting Liu Shuqing, president 
of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, here today. 
  During the meeting, Yi Man-sop recalled with pleasure the 
beautiful impressions left upon him by his China visit more than 
two months ago. He said: Korean-Chinese relations have enjoyed 
very rapid development in all fields in the past year or so

expressed his hope that such friendly cooperation will be 
further strengthened. 
  Touching on the Korean nuclear issue, Yi Man-sop said that 
he 
personally opposes the application of pressure and sanctions 
against Korea [DPRK] and that he hopes the nuclear issue can be 
peacefully resolved through dialogue. 
  Liu Shuqing said: China hopes that peace and stability will 
be maintained on the Korean peninsula, and it hopes that 
conflicts will not occur. Sanctions cannot solve a problem. 
The Korean nuclear issue should be properly resolved through 
dialogue under the framework of a tripartite dialogue between 
the four parties. 
  ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu also met with Liu Shuqing 
here today. 
  Liu Shuqing called on ROK Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang in 
Seoul on 7 April. In their conversation, Yi Hoe-chang said:

during his visit to China were very helpful for developing 
bilateral relations. The ROK follows with great concern China's 
reform and opening up, and it admires China's achievements. 
  Liu Shuqing said: China and the ROK share cultural ties of 
long standing. Relations between the two countries have enjoyed 
a very rapid development after they established diplomatic ties. 
He expressed his hope that Sino-Korean friendly cooperation in 
all fields will develop further. 
  On the same day, Liu Shuqing also met with former ROK 
President No Tae-u here. Both sides held a friendly 
conversation. 
  Liu Shuqing arrived here on 6 April to begin an eight-day

  [Text] Belgrade, April 10 (XINHUA) -- War planes of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bombed the positions 
of Serb-besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde today, U.N. officials 
said. 
  A U.N. military spokesman in Sarajevo said that two NATO 
F-16s, which are U.S. war planes based in the northern Italian 
town of Aviano, attacked the Serb positions after a request by 
the United Nations. 
  The U.N. officials said two Serb tanks were hit during the 
attack. 
  It was the first time during the two-year Bosnian war that 
the United Nations requested attacks on ground positions. In 
late February, NATO war planes shot down four Serb aircraft 
which violated the "no fly zone" over Bosnia.

(1203 6511)] 
  [Text] Wuhan, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a national meeting of 
directors of commodity price bureaus which ended today, Chen 
Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, 
pointed out: It is necessary for commodity price departments at 
all levels to make their efforts in drawing up measures revolve 
around residents' daily necessities, basic service items, and 
important means of production; to resolutely stabilize the 
prices of residents' "rice bag," "vegetable basket," and 
"stove"; and to achieve success in the near future. 
  Chen Jinhua pointed out: While various important reforms of 
the economic structure are taking big strides forward, the 
national economy has kept up satisfactory operations since early 
this year. A conspicuous problem in our current economic life is 
the further escalation of inflation and the excessively rapid 
increase of commodity prices on the market. The retail price 
index of commodities posted a monthly growth rate in excess of 3 
percent this January and February; it is a phenomenon rarely 
seen since our implementation of reform. In particular, the 
prices of basic daily necessities, basic service items, and 
basic means of production which most greatly affect the masses' 
livelihood and national economic development have increased too 
much. All trades and professions have found it hard to bear the 
price increases. Stabilizing commodity prices on the market and 
bringing inflation under control have become a crucial link in 
our current endeavor to properly handle the relationships 
between reform, development, and stability and have become the 
most urgent task of our economic work. 
  Chen Jinhua said: The issue of the increase in commodity 
prices has caught the close attention of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council. The State Council recently 
adopted a series of measures to stabilize commodity prices. 
They are mainly: 1) Strictly exercising "two controls," 
namely, bringing under control the excessive growth of the scale 
of investment in fixed assets and the excessive expansion of 
funds for consumption; 2) successfully promoting in real earnest 
agricultural production as well as the implementation of the 
"vegetable basket" project to increase the supply of essential 
goods; 3) strengthening governments' regulation, control, and 
management of commodity prices on the market, including the 
establishment of a fund to cover the risks of the prices of 
grain and nonstaple foods; stepping up supervision over the 
prices of 20 categories of basic daily necessities and service 
items, implementing the marking of prices for commodities and 
services, and conducting general inspections of commodity prices 
nationwide; and 4) resolutely taking a number of economic 
measures to stabilize commodity prices and to improve the 
allocation, redistribution, and transportation of goods and 
materials so as to guarantee market supply. The people's 
governments and commodity price departments at all levels have 
adopted a series of measures to stabilize commodity prices, too. 
  He stated the requirement that commodity price departments 
at 
all levels resolutely implement the relevant measures drawn up 
by the State Council; that they focus attention on stabilizing 
the prices of grain, edible oil, nonstaple food, important means 
of production, and particularly means of agricultural production 
as well as the fees collected for basic services; and that they 
persist in conducting inspections and making corrections while 
propagandizing and handling the task. In particular, he 
required them to tackle typical cases among the hot issues of 
concern to the masses, to make timely corrections, and to 
sternly investigate and deal with them so as to bring into full 
play the deterrent role of commodity price inspections. 
  Chen Jinhua pointed out: Governments must exercise 
regulation, control, and management of commodity prices on the 
market under the conditions of a socialist market economy. This 
is a common experience gained by the countries that adopt a 
market economy. The decontrol of prices does not mean the 
fulfillment of reform tasks. We cannot let market prices go up 
and down unchecked or let enterprises set prices without 
standardization. As the prices of the overwhelming majority of 
commodities have taken shape on the market, the establishment of 
a perfect system for the regulation and control of prices has 
become an urgent task for us in our endeavor to deepen reform 
under the circumstances. However, we must meanwhile pay 
attention to adopting new thinking and methods for exercising 
regulation, control, and management in light of the requirements 
of a market economy. We must standardize the market, bring the 
excessive increase in commodity prices under control, and 
prevent drastic price fluctuations; meanwhile, we must avoid 
rigid controls over prices and a slip back into the old rut of 
planned prices. 
  Chen Jinhua stressed: At present, the work of [stabilizing] 
commodity prices is very great and difficult. The establishment 
of a new price mechanism is an important integral part of the 
framework for the building of a socialist market economic 
system; price regulation and control constitute an important 
link of the state's macroeconomic regulation and control; and 
the work of [stabilizing] commodity prices is an indispensable, 
important task facing governments at all levels in exercising 
economic management. In compliance with the requirements set by 
the State Council, we must maintain the stability of the 
organizations of commodity price departments as well as the 
contingents of their personnel, and we must beef up the 
necessary forces for inspections. Commodity price departments 
at all levels must be bold in exploring, must carry out their 
tasks in a down-to-earth manner, must give full play to their 
functions, must stabilize the overall situation, and must 
promote sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development [cu jin guo min jing ji chi xu kuai su jian kang di

  [Text] Guangzhou, 10 Apr (XINHUA) -- Following a series of 
measures taken by Chinese Government departments to curb and 
crack down on the illegal export of textiles through the transit 
trade, such activities have been brought under control. 
  Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation, made the above announcement at the fourth national 
work conference on cracking down on the illegal export of 
textiles through the transit trade, which opened today. The 
conference, which is cosponsored by the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General Administration of 
Customs, and the State Bureau of Commodity Inspection, will 
formulate a set of specific procedures for cracking down on 
illegal transit activities and will name a number of enterprises 
involved in the illegal export of textiles through the transit 
trade. 
  Illegal transit textiles are textile products which were 
originally made in China but which were exported through 
fraudulent means to avoid the controls of textile quotas and 
through the transit trade via third countries or regions to 
countries having a quota limit on imports of Chinese textiles. 
The vice minister said: Such activities violate not only 
Chinese laws and regulations but also international agreements 
and relevant bilateral accords, thus seriously jeopardizing 
China's foreign trade export conditions and environment. 
Recently, China has strengthened efforts to crack down on the 
illegal export of textiles through the transit trade. Principal 
leaders of local economic and trade commissions, customs 
offices, and commodity inspection departments, as well as 
textile companies, have strengthened their leadership over this 
work, while many localities have set up joint task forces, have 
formulated a series of rules and regulations, and have 
publicized them through various documents and the media, thereby 
enabling more enterprises to realize the serious harm caused by 
such illegal transit textiles and thereby bringing such 
activities under control. 
  He pointed out, however: The problem of illegal transit 
exports has not been totally solved. Although the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the General 
Administration of Customs, and the State Bureau of Commodity 
Inspection have stepped up the efforts to curb and crack down on 
such illegal activities, and although the amount of illegal 
transit textiles exported after clearing customs is really 
insignificant, there still exist in Chinese territory a number 
of productive and operational undertakings aimed at illegally 
exporting textiles through the transit trade. Although the 
majority of foreign trade companies are aware of the need to 
crack down on the illegal export of textiles through the transit 
trade, and although they understand the relevant regulations 
against such illegal activities, some enterprises, especially 
foreign-funded enterprises and village and township enterprises, 
know little about the situation. For this reason, most of the 
problems result from them. Judging from the small number of 
cases uncovered occasionally, they resorted to more deceitful 
means. 
  Shi Guangsheng said: In cracking down in the future on the 
illegal export of textile products through the transit trade, we 
will -- in accordance with the laws and statutes of the Ministry 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, of customs, and of 
the goods inspection administration, and proceeding from the 
characteristics of their professional work -- concentrate on 
quickly formulating a crackdown measure which stresses the 
division of work to check illegal activities and which also 
stresses coordination, and we will put this into effect as soon 
as possible. This year we will concentrate on the following 
tasks: While integrating prevention with control and cracking 
down, we will mainly rely on prevention; we will continue to 
carry out random checks of key areas and enterprises, strengthen 
the training of personnel assigned to crack down on the illegal 
transit trade in textile products, and coordinate closely with 
the governments of the relevant countries or the authorities of 
the relevant regions in the joint effort to crack down on the 
illegal transit trade.

  [Text] Zheng Zengmao, provincial party committee standing 
committee member and higher people's court president, delivered 
a speech at a provincial court work conference that wound up 
yesterday. 
  Zheng Zengmao emphatically stated in his speech: The 
people's courts at all levels across the province should 
strengthen their determination to tackle difficult cases, 
strictly enforce the law, and resolutely implement court 
decisions so as to safeguard social order and maintain political 
stability. 
  Zheng Zengmao noted: Over the past year, by negotiating all 
sorts of difficulties, courts at all levels across the province 
have placed on file for investigation and prosecution a total of 
more than 52,000 cases involving more than 529 million yuan. 
Moreover, courts at all levels across the province have also 
assisted courts of other provinces and regions in handling more 
than 2,600 cases and directly handled a total of 685 cases on 
behalf of those courts, thus pushing ahead with Henan's economic 
growth and safeguarding Henan's image. 
  Zheng Zengmao pointed out: There are still more than 15,000 
court decisions awaiting implementation across the province at 
the moment. The slow pace of implementing court decisions has 
hindered courts at all levels across the province from serving 
economic construction and safeguarding social stability. In 
view of this situation, courts at all levels across the province 
should actively take measures to improve and strengthen court 
work and resolutely implement court decisions regarding anyone 
irrespective of his position, rank, or personal influence.

  [Text] Kunming, April 8 (CNS) -- Livestock husbandry which 
has been showing persistent growth in the past 15 years is set 
to become another new rising industry after tobacco, sugar, tea 
and rubber, according to a rural work meeting being help here. 
The output value of this business will reach over RMB 
[renminbi] 10 billion by the year 2000. 
  Statistics indicate that Yunnan possesses rich meadow land 
with an area making up more than one-third of the total in the 
province for fodder production, offering sound conditions for 
the development of animal husbandry. The business has in recent 
year developed its professionalism, commercialization and 
large-scale production. There are now 31 counties specializing 
in pig breeding, three counties responsible for the raising of 
poultry, six counties for sheep, two counties for milking cows, 
five counties for goats and six counties for cattle for meat. 
The gross production of meat in 1993 was put at 1.02 million 
tonnes, 3.3 times the amount in 1980, the total amount of milk 
produced 102 200 tonnes or 6.7 times the amount in 1980 and the 
gross production of eggs 51 700 tonnes or 30 percent up over 
1992. The output value of animal husbandry reached RMB 6.4 
billion. 
  Speaking at the meeting, Governor He Zhiqiang said that the 
quantity and development of the industry in the province was not 
in line with the abundant resources available and exploitation 
of sugar, tea and rubber have remained at an early stage. 
Because of this, Yunnan has to speed up implementation of the 
industrial policy in the coming years with an average annual 
growth rate for livestock husbandry of six percent. 
  With adjustment of the agricultural business pattern to be 
undertaken in the province, exploitation of new industry as the 
province' strong point will include aquatic products, forestry 
products, fruits, dried fruits, oil-bearing plants, vegetables, 
flowers, mulberry leaves for silkworms, spices and herbal 
plants, with each ofthem showing an output value of between RMB 
1 billion and over RMB 10 billion.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 11 (XINHUA) -- North China's 
Hebei Province has concentrated its efforts on building and 
upgrading technical and professional education with the aim of 
helping promote economic prosperity. 
  The first group of 60 technical and professional training 
schools (also called professional education centers) have been 
set up, equipped with advanced educational appliances and 
equipment such as computer systems. 
  Each of the schools has an average of 17,000 sq m of floor 
space and 1,620 students. 
  Such schools used to be run by individual counties and they 
were small and short of teachers and teaching facilities. 
  Statistics from 1990 show that each county with a population 
of about 300,000 had nine such schools on average, with only 100 
to 200 students. 
  With progress made in the rural economy, more and more 
peasants are eager to learn new knowledge and skills. 
  In 1991 the provincial government urged various counties to 
concentrate their efforts on building one or two comprehensive 
education centers. 
  The second group of such schools is now under construction 
and they are expected to be operational in July this year. 
  The province plans to build one such high-grade 
comprehensive 
technical school in every county by 1995.

  [Text] Sun Weiben, secretary of the provincial party 
committee, and Sun Kuiwen, standing committee member and 
secretary general of the provincial party committee, made an 
inspection tour of Qiqihar city from 5 to 8 April. Accompanied 
by (Wang Houjun), secretary of the Qiqihar City Party Committee, 
and Chi Jianfu, mayor of the city, they went to the (Huangan) 
Industrial Corporation, the (Heping) machinery plant, and the 
(Jianhua) machinery plant, three major armament industrial 
plants in Qiqihar, to listen to their detailed reports. They 
also went to some workshops to inspect the production situation 
and had contact with many cadres, staff, and workers. They also 
convened several forums with workers, scientific and 
technological personnel, and with managerial personnel to listen 
to the opinions and voice of the grass roots and to learn about 
the difficulties of armament industrial enterprises. 
  During the forums, Sun Weiben said: In the process of 
changing from a planned economy to a market economy, many new 
frictions and contradictions will certainly emerge. And, 
problems are extremely conspicuous among the armament industrial 
enterprises that were completely based on a planned economy in 
the past. Therefore, how to orient the armament industrial 
enterprises to the markets is a completely new question, and it 
is extremely urgent to enable these enterprises to find their 
way out under the guidance of the new [words indistinct]. 
  Wherever Sun Weiben went, he introduced the province's 
overall development situation. He said: As an energy resources 
and raw materials industrial base, Heilongjiang Province is 
[words indistinct] in the armament industry, the light industry, 
and the trades of grain, coal, and beer. This requires 
Heilongjiang people to further emancipate the mind, face up with 
realities, and create conditions for overcoming difficulties 
with the concerted efforts form higher to lower levels. 
  After profoundly learning about the situation, Sun Weiben 
said: The problems of armament industrial enterprises must be 
resolved immediately. To halt the loss of a policy nature, we 
need the state support of a policy nature. The burdens on 
armament industrial enterprises are very heavy. The wages to 
retired personnel alone have taken more than half of their 
maintenance funds. Thus, such enterprises should give full 
consideration to the issue of reform and should encourage part 
of their employees to do business of other trades. 
  Sun Weiben highly praised armament industrial enterprises 
for 
their reform measures of producing the products with high added 
value [words indistinct] and for their method of supporting the 
armament industry by running civilian industries. Sun Weiben 
was also extremely satisfied with the projects of the 641 
desert-use cars, the forklifts, and [words indistinct]. He 
demanded that plants should improve the grade of their products, 
expand the scale of production, and occupy markets as quickly as 
possible. With regard to the fund problem, Sun Weiben said: 
Every possible means should be made to change from accepting 
funds to creating funds and seize the current favorable 
opportunity to invigorate armament industrial enterprises. 
Principal state leaders have been much concerned with the 
province's armament industrial enterprises. General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin, Vice Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua, and some 
other leaders have called on the province to resolve the 
problems of some large armament industrial enterprises in 
Qiqihar as quickly as possible. 
  Sun Weiben called on armament industrial enterprises to 
seize 
the favorable opportunity, carry forward the voluntary spirit, 
increase the dynamics of reform, and explore new ways to 
invigorate armament industrial enterprises.

  [Text] Beijing, 9 Apr (XINHUA) -- A responsible person of 
the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office today issued a 
statement concerning the fire on a pleasure-boat in Qiandao Hu, 
Zhejiang. He said both sides of the strait did not want to see 
the unfortunate accident happen, which killed 32 compatriots 
from the two sides. He urged the Taiwan side to view the 
accident objectively and calmly. 
  On 31 March, a fire broke out on a pleasure boat in 
Zhejiang's Qiandao Hu, which, to our great sorrow, killed 24 
Taiwan compatriots who had come to the mainland for sightseeing 
as well as eight mainland compatriots. The State Council's 
Taiwan Affairs Office grieves over the deaths, and expresses 
profound sympathy and solicitude for the families of the Taiwan 
and mainland compatriots who died in the accident. 
  The State Council leaders have attached great importance to 
problems arising from the fire, and have urged the Zhejiang 
Provincial People's Government to earnestly deal with the 
aftermath of the accident and to expedite investigations of the 
cause of the accident. The Ministry of Public Security, the 
National Tourism Administration, and Zhejiang Province 
immediately took measures to conduct on-the-site rescue, 
inspection, and search for victims' bodies. Acting on a 
briefing by Zhejiang's departments concerned, the Association 
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait promptly took the 
initiative to inform Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation about 
the relevant circumstances. Currently the departments concerned 
are continuing to exert efforts to further deal with the 
aftermath, and to investigate the accident's cause, striving to 
release it as soon as it is verified. 
  The responsible person said: Both sides of the strait did 
not want to see this unfortunate accident happen. We trust that 
Taiwan compatriots at large will show understanding for the 
measures taken and the efforts made by the mainland departments 
concerned to deal with the accident. We are willing to listen 
to positive suggestions and opinions from various parties, 
including Taiwan compatriots. It is our hope that Taiwan's 
relevant departments will view the accident in an objective and 
calm manner to prevent some people from exploiting this accident 
to create public opinion and trouble unfavorable to the 
development of cross-strait relations.

<F P=106> [Report by station correspondent Wang Wei-chun; from the </F>
"Hookup" program] 
  [Text] Answering an interpellation at the Legislative Yuan 
on 8 April, Premier Lien Chan pointed out that the government 
and the public have identical points of view regarding the 
tragedy which took place on Lake Chientao [Qingdao] in Zhejiang 
Province, maintaining that the Chinese Communist authorities 
were inhuman and irresponsible in handling the incident, and 
that the mainland authorities totally lack a sense of rule by 
law. 
  The premier indicated that the Chinese Communist authorities 
should not be forgiven for their total disregard of 
sensibilities, human rights, and humanitarianism. Station 
correspondent Wang Wei-chun reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Wang] Premier Lien again used strong 
wording to condemn the Chinese Communist authorities for their 
handling of the tragedy that occurred on Lake Chientao. Premier 
Lien stressed that places which cannot ensure the safety of 
tourists are not qualified to welcome visitors. 
  [Lien] As one Chinese saying goes, one should not enter a 
state besieged by danger, or live in a state of unrest. Before 
we visit a place for sightseeing purposes, we must make our 
decision carefully. How can a region of danger or unrest, or a 
region that cannot ensure the safety of its visitors, consider 
itself qualified to welcome visitors from the outside? 
  [Wang] Premier Lien also urged tourism services at home to 
examine their operations. He pointed out that under a plan 
drawn up by the Ministry of Communications for developing 
sightseeing in Taiwan, the government will improve the 
sightseeing environment every year. On the other hand, he urged 
the Legislative Yuan to quickly finish examining the regulations 
which the Executive Yuan has drafted for developing tourism so 
that departments in charge of tourism will become more effective 
in supervising travel safety. 
  Meanwhile, in view of the fact that some legislators of 
nonruling parties have insisted on linking the tragedy on Lake 
Chientao with the controversy of reunification and Taiwanese 
independence, Premier Lien pointed out that the most important 
thing the government and the public can do at present is to work 
together to make sure the death of the 24 citizens is justly 
settled. He said the focus of the tragedy should not be blurred. 
  This is China Broadcasting Corporation correspondents Ho 
Chien-min and Wang Wei-chun at the Legislative Yuan. [end

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (AFP)--Leading Chinese dissident 
Bao Ge was picked up by police Saturday morning from his home in 
Shanghai, a dissident source said, announcing the fifth 
detention of a pro-democracy campaigner in China in eight days. 
  Bao was seized just 12 hours after the arrest of another 
prominent activist in the city, as French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, whose country has a record for championing human 
rights, arrived in Shanghai. 
  "Eight policemen took him away this morning at 9:10 a.m. 
(0110 GMT)," Bao's father said by telephone, adding that the 
police had given no reason for the arrest. 
  "When (Bao) asked them to produce some arrest papers, they 
simply said they didn't need any," he said. 
  Bao was taken to a local police station, the father said, 
adding that he hoped his son would be released within 24 hours. 
  The latest detention followed the arrest Friday evening of 
the secretary general of the Shanghai-based Chinese Human Rights 
Association, Wang Fucheng. 
  "It looks as if this is the start of a major crackdown on 
dissidents," said the association's spokesman Yang Zhou, who was 
himself detained and questioned by police twice last month. 
  Since April 1, three other members of China's pro-democracy 
and human rights campaign have been detained -- Wei Jingsheng, 
43, and Xu Wenli, 49, who came to fame for their activism in the 
late 1970s and were released last year after long jail terms, 
and Wei's secretary, Tong Yi. 
  Wei is officially under investigation for purported "new 
crimes." The ministry of public security and the Beijing police 
denied Saturday any knowledge of Xu's detention. 
  Yang, also contacted by telephone, said Wang had not yet 
been 
released. 
  Bao, 31, who recently sent a letter urging the Chinese 
government to push Tokyo into paying reparations for atrocities 
committed during the 1937-45 Sino-Japanese war, had previously 
been detained March 21 during the visit to Shanghai by Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Wang Fucheng, a 30-year-old entrepreneur, spent three years 
in jail for "counter-revolutionary" activities during the 
1978-79 Democracy Wall Movement. 
  He had previously been held for three days in mid-March 
during a police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai. 
  Balladur, meanwhile, arrived in Shanghai on the third day of 
a four-day official visit aimed at repairing ties with China 
that were damaged two years ago when France sold Mirage 
fighter-bombers to Taiwan, Beijing's rival. 
  China has systematically rounded up dissidents during visits 
by VIPs, in an apparent attempt to thwart embarrassing contacts. 
  Similar steps to harass or detain activists were taken 
during 
visits to China last month by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher and the Japanese premier.

<F P=106> [By Ron Gluckman and Chow Gee-inn] </F>
  [Text] The arrest of several labour leaders last month may 
well have been a stern message from mainland officials to 
increasingly brazen worker activists. Many officials are 
worried widespread strikes pose the greatest threat to stability 
since the student democracy movement was crushed at Tiananmen 
Square five years ago. However, the daring escape of one of 
those activists sends an entirely different set of signals to 
Chinese dissidents and the world. While Wang Jiaqi remains on 
the run in China, his escape from custody underscores 
suggestions of widespread corruption in the Public Security 
Bureau and fuels speculation of mounting sympathy among the 
ranks for a renewed dissident movement. Wang was arrested early 
last month with three other labour organisers, apparently in 
reaction to the publication of a charter for a new worker 
alliance calling itself the League for the Protection of Working 
People of the People's Republic of China. 
  One of the four men was quickly released, but prominent 
labour activist Zhou Guoqiang and lawyer Yuan Hongbing remain in 
custody. 
  While previously seen as the least prominent of the group, 
Wang, a 34-year-old postgraduate law student at Beijing 
University, has added to his dissident reputation by slipping 
from sight late last month. He is reported to have escaped from 
custody in Tangshan, a city in Hubei province, east of Beijing. 
  Official mainland media have carried no accounts of his 
arrest or escape, which is not uncommon, according to a Beijing 
source. "You'll only read about an escape at the time of his 
recapture, since this is something they never publicise," he 
said, terming the escape "an extremely rare occurrence". 
  However, former mainland prisoners told the SUNDAY MORNING 
POST that despite the outside perception of formidable and 
intensely fortified prison camps, escape is not too difficult. 
"You have a very good chance of escape if you have the contacts 
and the courage," said one former prisoner, who requested 
anonymity. He said top officials, as well as prison guards, 
were regularly bought off. Dissidents who have escaped, 
including those who remained on the run for years on the 
mainland, said with enough money and influential friends, a 
wanted man might easily elude the authorities. 
  This recalls the extensive underground network by which many 
Tiananmen figures were transported to safety outside the 
country. Known as Operation Yellowbird, the network was believed 
to have been financed and organised from Hong Kong. 
  "Escapes these days are fairly unusual, but not unheard of," 
said Sophia Woodman, of the United States-based group Human 
Rights in China. "But I really don't think there is any real 
organisation, no formal network. However, there are always 
sympathetic people who will help." Worker actions have grown 
widespread, with more than 10,000 reported last year by official 
Chinese publications. Mainland officials have speculated that 
worker unrest has been stirred up by an organised group of 
activists. Several human rights groups have accused officials 
of stepping up surveillance and detention of suspected worker 
leaders. "They are out to stamp out all labour activity," one 
source said. "This is far more threatening to the Chinese 
regime than a group of students talking about democracy." He 
explained the issue of workers' rights had far more appeal to 
the peasant population than abstract notions of democracy or 
human rights. 
  Little is known about Wang, and even less about his life on 
the run. However, former prisoners and escaped activists can 
provide some insight into what he might be expected to face. 
Despite the risk, many strangers will be surprisingly helpful, 
said Tang Boqiao, a student leader from Hunan who was arrested 
in July 1989. While in custody he was severely beaten, and 
persecuted by authorities after his release. He escaped to the 
United States through Hong Kong in 1991. 
  While travelling from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, a university 
teacher posed as his girlfriend to throw his pursuers off the 
trail. Tang was able to elude authorities partly through the 
help of friends in the Public Security Bureau and other 
government offices. His sister was a member of the bureau but 
was demoted and then dismissed after his escape. 
  Bei Ming and husband Zheng Yi were in hiding for three 
years. 
Both were prominent writers prior to undertaking a 
100,000-kilometre journey through 12 provinces before finally 
escaping to the United States in 1992. "When we were first 
living in the underground we were very worried," she said. 
"However, after a few months we became more relaxed. We just 
thought that if we were to worry every day, we would go mad." 
  Bei said they regularly alternated between safe houses 
always 
wary of being apprehended. Nevertheless, they were able to 
travel freely for much of the time, albeit in disguise. 
"Everything had been arranged very well," she said. 
  However, Bei, like other dissidents, expressed doubt the 
same 
resources and community sympathy would be available to Wang. 
She said that following the Tiananmen crackdown, "many people 
were angry. The Government had just shot people and many people 
wanted to help. Times have changed. Now, many people do 
nothing. They have forgotten what happened." 
  However, a new mood of protest seems to be brewing and Wang 
has become part of it.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (AFP) -- Chinese dissident Xu 
Wenli, arrested Friday in Beijing, was picked up by police for 
having broken the law, the Chinese foreign ministry said Monday. 
  "China public security organs summoned Xu Wenli according to 
law for he has violated relevant regulations on parole," a

within China's sovereignty and has nothing to do with China's

  Xu, 49, leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement in 
Beijing, was released on parole in May 1993 after 12 years in 
prison.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (AFP) -- The Chinese ministry of 
security said Monday that police would continue "investigations" 
of leading dissidents Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng. 
  "The police investigations of Xu Wenli and Wei Jingsheng 
continue," a ministry spokesman told AFP. An investigation of 
Tong Yi, Wei's secretary, is also underway, he added. 
  The spokesman did not indicate why the three dissidents were 
being held or where they were. But the Chinese Foreign Affairs 
Ministry said Monday that Xu had been detained by police for 
having "violated the terms of his parole." 
  Xu, 49, leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement in 
Beijing, was released on parole in May 1993 after 12 years in 
prison. 
  The dissident was initially picked up on Thursday, on the 
arrival of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in Beijing. 
He was released, but was again arrested Friday, his wife, Kang 
Tong, said. 
  His arrest comes a week after his friend and another leading 
dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was detained on accusations of having 
"committed new crimes." Wei received a 14-year sentence for his 
role in the Democracy Wall movement. 
  Tong Yi, Wei's secretary, was detained Monday in Beijing. 
  "China public security organs summoned Xu Wenli according to 
law for he has violated relevant regulations on parole," a 
spokesman from the ministry told AFP. "This entirely falls 
within China's sovereignty and has nothing to do with China's 
relations with other countries," the spokesman said. 
  The arrest attracted considerable international attention, 
coming as it did during Balladur's visit to China, which ended 
in Shanghai on Sunday.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (AFP) -- Three Chinese dissidents 
detained Friday and Saturday during the visit of French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur were released Sunday, the dissidents 
said Monday. 
  One of them, Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Chinese 
Human Rights Association, said he was beaten for 20 minutes by 
three plain-clothed policemen during his detention. 
  Wang, Bao Ge and Yang Zhou were able to return home Sunday, 
but were placed under house arrest for most of the day and their 
telephones were cut until Monday morning so that they could not 
speak with the press, the dissidents said. 
  They were released after the departure Sunday of Balladur 
from Shanghai, they added. 
  "We were arrested because of Balladur's visit," Yang Zhou, 
50, the association's spokesman, told AFP over the phone. Bao 
Ge, 31, added: "The government was scared we would do something 
to upset the visit." 
  Wang, 39, detained the first time on Friday, was released 
and 
then arrested again Saturday. He spent two nights in the police 
station and said he was mistreated. "During my second arrest 
Saturday afternoon, I was beaten for 20 minutes by three 
plain-clothed policemen," he said. 
  Bao and Yang were first taken to the police station and each 
spent Saturday night in a different hotel under police 
surveillance and were restricted from leaving.

<F P=106> [Constitution of the CPPCC -- adopted on 11 December 1982 by </F>
the Fifth Session of the Fifth CPPCC National Committee and 
revised by the Second Session of the Eighth CPPCC National 
Committee in March 1994] 
  [Text] General Principles 
  In the course of many years of revolution and construction, 
the Chinese have established the broadest patriotic united front 
led by the CPC. It embraces democratic political parties, 
nonparty democratic figures, people's organizations, minority 
nationalities, and patriotic figures from all walks of life; and 
it includes all socialist working people, patriots who support 
socialism and uphold the unification of the motherland, and 
compatriots in and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and 
Chinese nationals residing abroad. 
  The PRC Constitution provides that the system of multiparty 
cooperation and political consultations under the CPC's 
leadership will exist and develop for a long time to come. 
  The Chinese People's Political Consultative Committee 
[CPPCC] 
is a patriotic united front organization of the Chinese people. 
It is an important organ of multiparty cooperation and 
political consultations under the CPC's leadership. In 
exercising the powers of the National People's Congress [NPC], 
which had not yet been founded, and representing the will of the 
Chinese people, the First Plenary Session of the CPPCC 
proclaimed the founding of the PRC in September 1949, thereby 
fulfilling an important historical function. Since the convening 
of the First NPC in 1954, the CPPCC has continued to do much 
work in China's political and social life and in the field of 
friendly activities with foreign countries, thus making great 
contributions in these respects. Since the convening of the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 
December 1978, the CPPCC has continued to play an important role 
in eliminating chaos and restoring order; consolidating and 
developing political stability and unity; shifting the focus of 
state affairs to economic construction; promoting reform, 
opening up, and socialist modernization; striving for national 
reunification with the return of Taiwan; and launching the 
struggle against hegemony and safeguarding world peace. 
  Led by the CPC following the founding of the PRC, Chinese 
people of all nationalities have abolished the system of 
exploitation and have established a socialist system. 
Fundamental changes have taken place in the class situation in 
Chinese society. The worker-peasant alliance has been further 
consolidated. Intellectuals, like the workers and peasants, are 
force to be relied on in our socialist cause. The overwhelming 
majority of people formerly belonging to the exploitive classes 
have now become laborers earning their own living. The 
democratic parties, which have advanced along with the CPC in 
the people's revolution and construction and which together with 
it have undergone trials and made important contributions, are 
playing increasingly vital roles as political coalitions of 
sections of the socialist working people and patriots supporting 
socialism connected with them. A socialist relationship based 
on equality, unity, and mutual help has been established between 
China's different nationalities. Patriotic figures in religious 
circles are taking an active part in the country's socialist 
construction. Patriots in and from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, 
and Chinese nationals residing abroad love their motherland, 
uphold her reunification, and support her construction. China's 
patriotic united front has taken on greater vitality in the new 
historical period, and it remains an important "magic weapon" 
for uniting the Chinese people in their struggles to build up 
their country and achieve national reunification. It will be 
further consolidated and developed. 
  China is in the primary stage of socialism, and the main 
contradiction at present is the contradiction between the 
people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs and the 
backwardness of our social production. Because of internal 
factors and influences from abroad, the struggle of the Chinese 
people against hostile forces and elements at home and abroad 
will still be a protracted one. Class struggle, although 
continuing to exist within limits for a long time to come, will 
no longer constitute the principal contradictions in Chinese 
society. The basic task of the Chinese people of all 
nationalities is to act in accordance with the theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, uphold the 
basic line in the primary stage of socialism, concentrate their 
efforts on socialist modernization, and work hard and 
self-reliantly to achieve the modernization of industry, 
agriculture, national defense, and science and technology step 
by step to turn China into a strong and prosperous socialist 
country with a high level of culture and democracy. On the 
political basis of love for the PRC and support for the 
leadership of the CPC and the socialist cause, the CPPCC will do 
all it can to further strengthen and develop the patriotic 
united front, mobilize all positive factors and unite all people 
who can be united, work with one heart and with everyone 
contributing ideas and efforts, focus on economic construction, 
protect and develop the political situation of stability and 
unity, advance the socialist democratic and legal systems, 
promote socialist spiritual civilization, push forward the 
development of the socialist market economy, and fulfill the

<F P=106> [By Li Niangui (2621 1628 6311): "China's Internally </F>
Circulated Data Reveal Maltreatment of Workers in 
Foreign-Invested Enterprises"] 
  [Text] (Editor's note: This year's February issue of the 
internally circulated CPC magazine NEICAN XUANBIAN [0355 0639 
6693 4882 -- Selected Reports for Internal Reference] includes a 
report by XINHUA reporter Li Niangui which reflects the fact 
that foreign-invested enterprises pay no attention to the safety 
of workers and that the workers are maltreated. The report 
enumerates shocking examples and statistics. We have reprinted 
the report here. Its original title was: Some Foreign-Invested 
Enterprises Seriously Encroach on the Legitimate Rights and 
Interests of Workers.) 
  The meeting of the presidium of the Second Session of the 
12th All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which concluded not 
long ago, analyzed labor relations in foreign-invested 
enterprise and felt deep concern about how some foreign-invested 
enterprises had violated relevant Chinese laws and regulations, 
and had seriously encroached on the legitimate rights and 
interests of workers. It hoped that the departments concerned 
would attach importance to and concern themselves with this 
issue. 
  At present, 153,000 foreign-invested enterprises have been 
approved on the Chinese mainland, of which 47,000 enterprises, 
employing more than five million workers, have been completed 
and put into operation. On the whole, the labor relations in 
foreign- invested enterprises are stable, and most 
foreign-invested enterprises operate and organize production 
according to the law, but there are some quite serious 
labor-relations problems in some foreign-invested enterprises. 
According to surveys recently conducted by the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions, there are five conspicuous problems: 
<H5>  Safety Neglected, Labor Conditions Poor </H5>
  1. The labor and living conditions of workers are very poor. 
Even the most basic labor-protection measures in safety and 
sanitation are lacking. Accidents occur frequently and the 
safety of workers' lives is not guaranteed. Surveys conducted 
by provincial and city trade unions in Guangdong, Fujian, 
Shandong, and Zhejiang show that in many foreign-invested 
enterprises -- especially some labor-intensive enterprises for 
manufacturing plastics, toys, shoes, and textiles -- the 
workshops are crowded with people and equipment, and are hot and 
sultry. The air there is polluted, and the noise far exceeds 
permitted levels. Zhuhai carried out a survey in seven 
foreign-invested enterprises and found that the levels of such 
toxic gases as benzene, toluene, and dimethyl benzene in the air 
exceeded national standards by eight to 10 times. The 
quarantine departments in Xiamen carried out tests on the 
air-borne dust content at 21 points in 11 foreign-invested 
enterprises, and found that permitted standards were exceeded at 
14; air-borne toxic gases were tested at 23 points, at which 
permitted standards were exceeded at 18; and noise volume was 
tested at 69 points, with permitted standards exceeded at 33. A 
nonmetallugical limited company in Fuzhou carried out open 
operations, long- prohibited in China, at its pyrophyllite 
pencil stone crushing section. The dust concentration exceeded 
national standards by more than 100 times. Shenzhen checked the 
health check-up forms of 260 staff and workers in 
foreign-invested enterprises and found that 46 of them suffered 
from anaemia or had abnormalities in white blood cells or blood 
platelets, or had warning indications of other diseases in their 
blood. 
  What is even more serious is that some foreign-invested 
enterprises have ignored production safety, as well as China's 
labor protection laws and regulations. Serious man-made 
industrial accidents occur often and the safety of the workers' 
lives is not ensured. In a tableware company that employs 400 
workers in Xiamen, 38 industrial accidents have occurred since 
it started operation four years ago and 39 workers had their 
fingers crushed. Recently, two large fires occurred in Shenzhen 
and Fuzhou in less than a month, resulting in the deaths of 144 
people. 
<H5>  Insult, Punishment, and Beating </H5>
  2. Workers are insulted, punished, or beaten, and their 
personal rights are encroached upon at will. Some 
foreign-invested enterprises do not respect minimum human 
rights, ignore China's laws, and use extremely brutal and 
backward management methods. Some enterprises have established 
rules forbidding workers to go to the toilet, to drink water, or 
to see doctors during work hours, and offenders are asked to 
stand before the others wearing a placard. A shoe plant in 
Putian, Fujian, punishes workers by asking them to stand in the 
rain, stand in the sun, or leap like frogs. A foreign 
management supervisor at the Shenmei Household Necessities 
Company in Shenyang found that a glass item had not been cleaned 
properly. He went as far as forcing the worker concerned to lick 
it with his tongue. A Taiwan businessman in Guangdong even 
punished several dozen members of a work team for a mistake made 
by only one of them, asking them to kneel on the floor. In 
1993, case after case of male "security" personnel illegally 
searching women workers were found in Tianjin and Qingdao. A 
restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Shanghai once even 
illegally asked women workers to take off all their clothes 
during a search. Some foreign-invested enterprises even 
employed "supervisors" and "foremen" to serve as roughnecks. 
<H5>  Working Extra Hours </H5>
  3. Workers are compelled to work extra hours and labor 
quotas are set beyond the bodily strength of the workers. The 
eight-hour work day is the most basic right and interest the 
working class all over the world has struggled to achieve. The 
relevant laws and regulations in China also include explicit 
provisions on festivals, holidays, and days off. In quite a few 
foreign-invested enterprises, however, these legitimate rights 
and interests of workers have been willfully violated. In 
August last year, the Guangdong Provincial Labor Bureau carried 
out a survey in 17 foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, and Dongguan. It discovered that work hours at most of 
these enterprises were 10 to 12 hours daily, and there were no 
Sundays or days off. The Guangdong Provincial Federation of 
Trade Unions carried out a survey in 105 foreign-invested 
enterprises and discovered that with the exception of seven, in 
which the workers work three shifts, all the rest asked their 
workers to work extra hours. An enterprise even asked workers 
to work 36 hours at a stretch. Some foreign-invested 
enterprises increase workers' labor quotas at will. In a 
Sino-Japanese joint-venture watch company in Zhuhai, the labor 
quota per worker per shift in the the workshop turning out 
second hands is fixed at 4,000 pieces, while the quota set in 
Japan is only 2,500. 
<H5>  Wages Are Deducted, in Arrears, and Embezzled </H5>
  4. Wages are on the low side, and the wages and overtime pay 
of workers are deducted, in arrears, and embezzled at will. 
Regulations in China state that the wages of workers in 
foreign-invested enterprises are not to be less than 120 percent 
of the average of those of state-owned enterprises with similar 
conditions of the same trade in the same locality. However, the 
wages of workers in many foreign-invested enterprises are on the 
low side, and some of them are even lower than the lowest local 
wage standard. In Shenzhen's Shekou Industrial Zone, for 
example, the Kaida Enterprise Company Ltd, which employs more 
than 1,300 people, pays workers only five to seven yuan per day, 
nearly half the lowest wage standard of 11.2 yuan per day in 
1993 as announced by the Shenzhen City Government. According to 
a survey carried out in 75 foreign-invested enterprises in the 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou Special Economic Zones [SEZ], the 
lowest wage standard of workers in 41 enterprises is lower than 
that published by local governments of the SEZ's. These 
enterprises account for 55 percent of the surveyed total. The 
lowest wages of workers are only 140 yuan a month. 
<H5>  Not Signing Contracts and Not Fulfilling Contracts </H5>
  5. Workers are not recruited openly, but at will. Labor 
contracts are not signed with workers and signed labor contracts 
are not implemented strictly. 
  Some foreign-invested enterprises do not sign labor 
contracts with workers. As a result, workers' jobs are not 
safeguarded, the workers are not insured against unemployment, 
and workers' legitimate rights and interests are not protected 
by law. The Qingdao City Federation of Trade Unions carried out 
a survey in 48 foreign-invested enterprises and found that 11 
had signed labor contracts with only some workers, and four had 
not signed any labor contracts at all. In 1992, Shenzhen 
carried out a general inspection on enforcing labor laws, made 
selective examinations among 280,000 workers and 205 
enterprises, and discovered that 17 percent of workers had not 
gone through any labor formalities. The number of 
foreign-invested enterprises in the Shantou SEZ and Zhuhai which 
have not signed labor contracts accounts for 70 and 90 percent, 
respectively, of the total of such enterprises. Although some 
foreign-invested enterprises sign labor contracts with workers, 
the rights and obligations of the two sides are not on an equal 
basis. The contents of some contracts clearly violate the law, 
while those of others are self-contradictory. In the contracts 
of a joint-venture enterprise in Shanghai, there are articles 
restricting the time for workers to go to the toilet, stating 
the number of years during which workers may not fall in love 
with others, and giving enterprise management the power to 
dismiss any worker who does not follow the arrangements for 
working extra work hours. The labor contracts of a large 
restaurant in Shanghai had two versions, in Chinese and English, 
but the contents of these two versions were completely 
different. The boss let the workers read the Chinese version, 
but asked them to sign the English one. Before the probation 
period was over, some workers could no longer stand the illegal 
practices of using detectors to search them or to search their 
bags, and wanted to terminate their contracts although they had 
to forfeit 340 yuan of cash pledge as stated in their Chinese 
contracts. However, the administration of the restaurant took 
out the English versions of the contracts, which stated that the 
workers had to pay 5,000 yuan in compensation, in addition to 
the cast pledge. A Shenyang enterprise, which was entirely 
owned by a businessman from the Republic of Korea, took 
advantage of the six- month probation period for new workers. 
It recruited workers secretly, dismissed them in less than six 
months, and recruited other workers in a bid to avoid signing 
labor contracts or paying workers' insurance fees. At present, 
most foreign-invested enterprises recruit young workers, then 
dismiss them within a few years. In reality, this is to shift 
the responsibility for paying workers' pensions onto society, 
and will constitute a problem for China in the future. 
<H5>  Work Stoppages, Strikes, and Go-Slows </H5>
  Owing to frequent conflicts between labor and capital in 
some 
foreign-invested enterprises and because of tense labor 
relations, some unexpected events have occurred, such as 
suspension of work, strikes, and large numbers of people 
applying for an audience with the higher authorities to appeal 
for help. They have affected social stability and security. In 
1991, the Shanghai municipal arbitration organs handled 70 cases 
of major labor disputes at foreign-invested enterprises; in 
1992, the number increased to 111. In Fujian Province, the 
number of major labor disputes occurring at foreign-invested 
enterprises in 1993 was 582 cases more than in 1991, an increase 
of 82.7 percent. In Shenzhen from January to May 1993, there 
were 185 cases of large numbers of workers applying for an 
audience with the higher authorities to appeal for help, as well 
as six strikes, with more than 100 workers taking part in each. 
Twelve cases of work stoppages or go-slows occurred in the 
Dalian Economic and Technology Development Zone in the first 
half of 1993.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Fujian Province, a 
pilot in China's reform and opening up, scored rapid economic 
growth and higher living standards in 1993, according to 
provincial Governor Jia Qinglin. 
  Addressing the annual session of the provincial people's 
congress that opened here yesterday, Jia said that Fujian's 
gross national product (GNP) -- the value of all goods and 
services produced -- shot up by 25.4 percent to nearly 96.8 
billion yuan in 1993. 
  As a result, Fujian had quadrupled its 1980 GNP by the end 
of 
1993, seven years ahead of schedule, he said in his government 
work report. 
  The governor also released the following figures to 
illustrate Fujian's economic achievements in 1993: 
  -- Industrial output value climbed 48 percent to 149 
billion yuan; 
  -- Agricultural output value rose 11 percent to 39.5 
billion yuan; 
  -- Grain production reached 8.69 million tons; and 
  -- 13 priority infrastructure projects were completed. 
  He attributed Fujian's rapid economic growth to 
macro-economic control measures and efforts to optimize the 
industrial structure and improve economic returns. 
  "Rapid economic growth has made it possible for Fujian 
residents to enjoy higher living standards," he said. 
  In real terms, the per-capita income of urban residents rose 
by 6.8 percent to 2,605 yuan, and that of rural residents by 
seven percent to 1,211 yuan. 
  Apartment buildings with a total floor space of five million 
sq m were completed last year, he said, adding that the floor 
space for urban residents rose to 10.8 sq m per person. 
  On the whole, rural residents live in more spacious homes, 
with per-capita floor space rising to 22.4 sq m in 1993, he said. 
  In a move to eliminate poverty, he said that the provincial 
authorities have decided to resettle 100,000 poverty-stricken 
residents in areas with good natural conditions and bright 
development prospects. 
  These residents should be encouraged to move, on a voluntary 
basis, out of areas with harsh natural conditions, he said. 
  The governor also spelled out the following major tasks for 
this year: 
  -- Deepening reforms in order to speed up the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure; 
  -- Stabilizing grain production and expanding the rural 
economy; 
  -- Improving economic returns in industrial production; 
  -- Accelerating infrastructure construction; and 
  -- Opening Fujian still wider to the outside world. 
  "In introducing overseas funds, we should focus on the 
construction of harbors, power plants, airports, expressways, 
the expansion of basic industries and the farming sector and the 
upgrading of existing enterprises," he said. 
  He promised to formulate flexible policies for overseas 
companies investing in these sectors. 
  He also called for efforts to use more overseas funds in the 
financial, retail and tourism sectors. 
  Fujian, on China's east coast facing the Taiwan Straits, 
should do all it can to increase its economic and trade 
exchanges with Taiwan, the governor said.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 8 (CNS) -- The Fuzhou authorities 
will harshly punish persons found guilty of violation of 
property owned by foreign-invested enterprises and of the 
personal safety of investors or of posing hazards to the normal 
production of foreign-funded enterprises. 
  The Fuzhou police recently decided to further boost the 
administration of public order for foreign-invested enterprises 
here in a bid to safeguard the normal running of these 
enterprises as well as the legitimate rights and interests of 
investors. 
  There are now some 3 000 foreign-funded enterprises approved 
for operation here and public security for these enterprises and 
their running was generally stable. Incidents in breach of the 
legitimate rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises, 
however, such as thefts committed by workers in a handful of 
foreign-funded enterprises, disruption of enterprises by 
outsiders, blackmail and extortion as well as fighting are not 
something new. Adverse effects on these enterprises are 
therefore the result. 
  The Fuzhou bureau of public security set up a special 
leading 
team responsible for public order for foreign-invested 
enterprises. The team will keep an watchful eye on public 
security for these enterprises while at the same time working 
out policies, carrying out inspections and supervision as well 
as studying the main security problems related to 
foreign-invested businesses. The bureau has asked the police at 
various levels to carry out their duty of protecting 
foreign-funded enterprises. Great attention must be given by 
the local police regarding various kinds of criminal offences 
reported by these enterprises and a rapid response and 
settlement of the problem must be made. 
  In a similar development, Vice Mayor Mr. Gong Xiong has 
asked 
the judicial department to actively deal with economic disputes 
related to foreign-invested enterprises in accordance with the 
law.

  [Text] The Xiamen People's Congress may pass its first 
piece of legislation as early as next month, the head of the 
legislature, Li Xiuji, said yesterday. He said the congress, 
which was given its own legislative power by the National 
People's Congress last month, would promulgate a procedural law 
governing the lawmaking process when its standing committee met 
next month. It will be followed by a law on how to implement 
China's first Taiwanese investment protection law. Mr Li said 
he was hopeful this second piece of legislation might be ready 
in the first half of this year. 
  But the long-term aim is to set up a legal framework that 
matches the needs of a "socialist market economy" by 1997 in 
Xiamen, which is the closest mainland city to Taiwan. According 
to Mr Li, who is also Xiamen's Deputy Communist Party Secretary, 
the congress will at this stage focus on three types of 
legislation. These are: protection of Taiwanese interests, 
bringing the legal system up to par with other countries, and 
urban planning, management and public order. A meeting had 
already been held between the congress and Taiwanese investors 
in Xiamen to solicit their opinions, Mr Li said. 
  Although Xiamen now has its own power to legislate, Mr Li 
said the Special Economic Zone would not become independent from 
the rest of Fujian. Instead, he said, the power would provide 
other Fujian cities with a "very valuable experience". Being 
able to legislate, Mr Li said, was important to enable Xiamen to 
become the third free-trade port in China. The congress will 
try to upgrade some of its existing regulations in order to 
speed up the process.

<F P=106> ["Jiangsu Province's Procedures for Implementing the `PRC </F>
Trade Union Law' -- adopted by the Sixth Session of the Eighth 
Jiangsu Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee on 22 
February 1994"] 
  [Text] Article 1. These procedures are drawn up for 
implementing the "PRC Trade Union Law" (simply referred to as 
"Trade Union Law" hereafter) in accordance with Jiangsu's actual 
situation. 
  Article 2. When an enterprise, institution, or organ within 
Jiangsu's administrative area is able to set up trade unions but 
has yet to do so, a higher-level trade union may send its 
personnel to the unit to guide and supervise it in establishing 
its trade union. 
  Article 3. Trade unions shall mobilize and organize workers 
to support and take part in reforms as masters of their own 
houses, and educate workers to correctly handle the interests 
between themselves and those of the state and collectives, and 
work hard to accomplish their production and other assignments. 
  Trade unions shall safeguard workers' legitimate rights and 
interests, reflect their views and requests, and serve them 
warmly. 
  Trade unions shall strengthen their own construction by 
establishing or improving management, heightening their staff's 
political awareness and educational and professional level, and 
operating according to law. 
  Article 4. Local trade union councils, industrial trade 
unions, and grass-roots trade unions with more than 25 female 
workers shall set up female workers' committees; and grass-roots 
trade unions with less than 25 female workers shall have female 
committee members. 
  Article 5. When enterprises, institutions, or organs having 
trade unions cease to operate, the trade unions there shall also 
cease to operate accordingly; and the cessation shall be 
reported to the higher trade unions for the record. Other 
organizations or individuals may not close their trade unions at 
will, nor can they close or merge trade union offices, or place 
them under other departments. 
  Article 6. When a grass-roots trade union has a legal 
person's qualifications prescribed in civil laws, it possesses 
the credentials of a legal mass organization after the 
credentials have been acknowledged by a trade union council of a 
higher level; and its chairman shall be the legal representative. 
  Article 7. Trade union chairmen and vice chairmen are 
elected democratically in accordance with the "Constitution of 
Chinese Trade Unions." They shall serve specific terms of 
office and can be reelected. During their terms of office, they 
are entitled to treatment prescribed in relevant regulations of 
the state and the province. 
  When trade union chairmen and vice chairmen have to be 
transferred, discharged, or retired before their terms of office 
expire, the transference, discharge, or retirement shall have 
the prior agreement from their trade unions and trade unions of 
a higher level.

signing labor contracts with administrative departments of 
enterprises and institutions; and supervise the execution of the 
contracts. 
  In case disputes arise between a trade union and workers on

other while fulfilling a collective contract, a collective 
insurance contract, or a labor contract, the disputes shall be 
handled according to state regulations for settling labor 
disputes.

discharge or discipline any workers, it shall provide the trade 
union with a list of the workers' names and the reasons of the 
disciplinary actions, and listen to the trade union's views. In 
case the unit's administrative department has violated the law, 
regulations, or any relevant contract, the trade union is 
entitled to present its views and the unit's administrative 
department shall restudy the case and handle it according to law. 
  Article 10. When workers of the trade union of an enterprise 
or institution are unjustly treated while performing their 
duties or safeguarding workers' legitimate rights and interests, 
authorities in charge and the trade union of a higher level 
shall consult with the unit and resolve the problem according to 
law. 
  Article 11. In case an enterprise or institution infringes 
upon workers' legitimate rights and interests, or upon female 
workers' special rights and interests, in violation of the labor 
law or other relevant regulations, and refuses to mend its ways 
seriously, the trade union shall urge the government or other 
relevant departments to order the unit to make corrections. And 
if the case is serious, relevant departments and units shall 
discharge their responsibiliies and authority and displine or 
punish the unit's principal persons in charge or persons who are 
directly responsible for the infringement. 
  Article 12. In case an enterprise or institution acts

correction; and if the case is serious, the trade union may 
support workers to bring the case to the people's court. 
  Article 13. Trade unions exercise supervision over 
enterprises and institutions to make sure that they observe the 
state rules governing work hours and holidays. When workers' 
work hours have to be extended because of special circumstances 
or urgent assignments, the units' administrative departments 
shall solicite trade unions' views in advance, and trade unions 
shall make sure that workers' labor services shall be 
compensated accordingly. When an enterprise forces its workers 
to work longer hours against their wishes in disregard of their

present its views and settle the issue with the enterprise 
through consultations. If consultations fail, the trade union

Committee.

assemblies shall meet at least once every six months. Ad hoc 
meetings shall be held whenever there are major issues to 
discuss. 
  Article 21. Trade union committees of collectively owned

workers to take part in democratic management and supervision, 
and safeguard workers' legal democratic rights. 
  Article 22. Enterprises and institutions shall support the 
workers' congresses or workers' general meetings in exercising 
their functions and powers. On administrative affairs, when a 
dispute over the exercising of functions and powers by workers' 
congresses arises between a trade union and an enterprise or 
institution, a competent department, a trade union of a higher 
level and an enterprise or institution of a higher level shall 
be asked to coordinate in resolving the problem. 
  Article 23. When a state-owned enterprise sets up a 
management committee, the committee shall include

committee. 
  The membership of the board of directors of a wholly 
state-owned corporation and a limited liability corporation set 
up through the investment of more than two state-owned

way under the organization of a trade union.

  [Text] Nanchang, April 9 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangxi 
Province is undergoing a profound economic change in the wake of 
two major state development projects. 
  Located at the junction of the Chang Jiang River and the 
Beijing-Kowloon railway, both of which are under development, 
Jiangxi has successfully absorbed overseas capital to fund its 
economic take-off. 
  The province has used foreign funds to the tune of 838 
million U.S. dollars since 1984. Of the sum, direct business 
investment has exceeded the loans from governments of foreign 
countries. 
  Before 1991, however, foreign investment in most joint 
ventures was less than 300,000 U.S. dollars each. Most jobs 
were labor-intensive at that time. 
  By last year, there were 59 such firms each with an 
investment exceeding five million U.S. dollars. More firms were 
in technology-intensive and export-oriented industries. 
  The investment structure has also become diversified to 
embrace transportation, energy, raw materials and other areas of 
infrastructure. 
  The joint ventures have also created jobs. More than 30,000 
people were employed in newly-opened factories last year. 
  The introduction of new technology and management skills 
have 
upgraded local industries. 
  This year the province is determined to reform its 
financial, 
monetary, and foreign trade enterprises and offer more desirable 
terms to foreign businessmen. It is also trying to obtain loans 
from governments of foreign countries and international 
financial organizations.

  [Text] Nanchang, April 10 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangxi 
Province is launching a drive to sow quality seeds in the 
current spring farming season. 
  Several million farmers are joining forces in the selecting, 
cultivating, testing and promoting of quality crop seeds and 
animal stock. 
  Jiangxi hopes to lift its agriculture to a new level by 
doing 
so. Last year more than 90 percent of its major crops such as 
soy beans, peanuts and cotton used quality seeds. 
  The use of quality stock has also been promoted in raising 
pigs, cattle, sheep and aquatic products. 
  Governments at all levels have offered financial and 
technological support for the cultivation of quality seeds and 
stock and the construction of such centers. 
  Jiangxi has also set up organizations to make sure that no 
inferior seeds or stock can find their way onto the market.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai's population 
decreased by 10,015 last year, taking the lead among major 
Chinese cities of a population decrease. 
  Natural population growth rate was minus 0.78 per thousand 
in 
1993 as a total of 84,000 babies were born and 94,000 deaths 
were reported in Shanghai, China's most populous city. 
  Statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Family Planning 
Committee and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau show that 
population growth rate in all 20 counties and districts of the 
city all dropped greatly. 
  Officials in charge of the family planning committee 
attribute that to the family planning work during the past 40 
years and progress achieved in the city's social, economic and 
cultural fields. 
  Shanghai's population (the number of people with permanent 
residence permits) topped 13 million by 1992. 
  In the 1950s, annual natural population growth rate reached 
32 per thousand. There was virtually no family planning at that 
time. 
  Experts say that the natural population growth rate in 
Shanghai is expected to witness a continuous decrease in the 
coming few years as existing policy on family planning will 
continue and elderly people now make up 16 percent of the 
overall population. 
  An official from the Shanghai family planning committee said 
that a shrinking population is not the target of the family 
planning policy. Instead, a proper population suiting the 
social and economic development of Shanghai will be the final 
destination. 
  However, officials said existing policy on family planning 
will continue, as birth control pressure is still heavy. 
Prevention of unexpected pregnancies and health education to 
care for women's health will be stressed. 
  Recent surveys show that migrant laborers from other parts 
of 
China to Shanghai often do not carry out the family planning 
policy as required. The birth control policy still does not 
mean much to some unemployed people, among others. 
  In addition, officials said that many women of child-bearing 
age lack enough knowledge and ability on how to prevent 
unplanned pregnancy.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 11 (XINHUA) -- A host of new 
four-story houses, mostly in unique architectural styles, have 
cropped up on the outskirts of shanghai. Some are even equipped 
with garages and elevators. 
  Shanghai, the fastest-growing city in China, has become 
surrounded by a batch of rich rural villages. 
  Statistics show that more than 740 villages, a quarter of 
city's total, registered over one million yuan each in profits 
last year. The villagers grossed an average of 5,300 yuan each 
in annual income, five-fold the national average. 
  The income of four million farmers in Shanghai has topped 
the 
list in the country for 13 years running, with the average per 
capita income reaching 2,650 yuan in 1993, compared with the 
national average of 921 yuan. 
  Thanks to brisk local markets and advantages in personnel 
and 
technology, the booming township enterprises in the region have 
become jackpots for rural residents. Last year they achieved an 
output value of over 70 billion yuan, more than 70 percent of 
the total industrial and agricultural output value in the region. 
  Qizhong village, which tops the list of rich communities, 
achieved an output value of one billion yuan, and profits and 
taxes of 300 million yuan in 1993. 
  Most of the farmers put house-building on top of their 
agenda, spending from 100,000 yuan to one million yuan. 
  At present, the average per capita living space has exceeded 
40 sq m [square meters] in rural Shanghai. 
  The new generation of farmers also invests in cultural 
pursuits like travel. 
  Zhou Yingjian, a farmer and head of a small auto repair 
workshop in Hongqiao town, earned 300,000 yuan last year. 
  "My family belongs to the middle class in the village," he 
said. 
  According to Shanghai's growth plan, the sales volume of 
township enterprises is expected to reach 100 billion yuan this 
year, up 20 billion yuan over 1993. 
  It will also plant 35 percent of its 600,000 ha [hectare] of 
land with crops for export crops.

the province. 
  By the end of last year, more than 1.23 million 
individually-owned business households employing over 1.97 
million workers had registered in the province, increases of ten 
percent and 13 percent respectively over the year before.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Hangzhou, the 
capital of east China's Zhejiang Province and a major site of 
scenic beauty, has recently launched a massive campaign to 
improve its road networks. 
  The ten projects on the drawing board or under construction 
include a third bridge over the Qiantang River, an expressway 
around the city, two highway passenger stations, the expansion 
of the road to Xinanjiang city, the expressway to Shanghai and 
Ningbo, and the dredging of the grand canal. 
  Though the city's economy has been growing rapidly, city 
officials said, the ancient city's antiquated traffic networks 
had been imposing an adverse effect on the development of its 
tourism and other economic sectors. 
  This explains why the traffic sector has 10 of the 17 major 
projects on the city government's top agenda from 1993 to the 
year 2000. 
  The officials said the 2.3 billion yuan fund for these 
projects would be raised by many means besides government 
investment. 
  For example, they said, the expressway around the city would 
be built using three million U.S. dollars and four million yuan 
from a Hong Kong company. 
  By leasing a piece of land to overseas banking groups, the 
city acquired 225 million yuan for the building of the Qiantang 
Bridge. 
  According to the officials, four of the projects, including 
the bridge, the highway to Xinanjiang and others, will be built 
and managed by independent commercial companies. 
  Most of these projects are now under way, and the rest will 
begin soon, the officials added.

  [Text] Shenzhen, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Statistics show that 
Shenzhen city, one of China's special economic zones in 
Guangdong Province, ranks fifth in economic strength among 
China's 24 large and medium-sized cities. 
  Figures recently released by the city government show that 
the major economic indicators of Shenzhen in 1993 were only 
behind Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou and Tianjin. 
  The city's export volume last year reached 8.335 billion 
U.S. 
dollars, 950 million and 5.08 million more than Shanghai and 
Guangzhou. 
  And the city made use of 1.432 billion U.S. dollars in 
foreign funds last year. 
  The city's total investment in fixed assets, second only to 
shanghai, was 10 to 20 percentage points higher than the 
Beijing, Guangzhou and Tianjin figures. 
  In addition, the city's financial revenue last year reached 
6.725 billion yuan and the volume of urban residents' savings 
deposits reached more than 17.5 billion yuan.

  [Text] Shantou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Shantou city, one of 
China's special economic zones [SEZ] in Guangdong Province, has 
made efforts to develop its export of labor services. 
  Now the city has formed labor export relations with a dozen 
countries and regions, and every year the city sends about 1,000 
people to work abroad. 
  Most of the workers will be engaged in housing construction, 
machine operation, clothes-making, crop-raising and livestock 
farming. 
  In 1980 when the Shantou Overseas Labor Service Company 
started its labor export service, its business was limited to 
countries and regions in southeast and central Asia. 
  Now its business has expanded to some countries in Europe, 
America and Africa. 
  Experts noted that the people of Shantou have a tradition of 
working abroad. With the rise of Shantou's fame in labor 
exports, more and more people from Shantou will participate in 
the labor export service. 
  Last year a team of construction workers was hired by a 
Spanish company to undertake an express highway construction 
project in Libya. 
  Now they have completed the project and have been employed 
by 
the company to continue a supplementary project.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Guangzhou, capital 
of southern China's fast-booming Guangdong Province, has made an 
environmental protection blueprint, aiming to turn the city into 
a clean and tidy international metropolis in 15 years. 
  Its industrial structure and regional distribution of 
industries will be readjusted. Enterprises in the urban areas 
that cause environmental pollution and bother local residents 
will be relocated to the south-east of the city. 
  New development zones and new industrial projects can not be 
started unless approved in accordance to the environmental 
appraisal system. 
  The 15-year blueprint also rules that new and advanced 
technology and equipment should be used to avoid air pollution. 
Industrial sectors with high economic returns and lower 
pollution will be granted priority. 
  A group of infrastructure facilities to treat existing 
pollution in water, air, refuse and noise will be constructed, 
according to the plan, which was recently adopted by the 
municipal government. 
  Some 12 large ventures that bring severe water pollution 
will 
be renovated and a series of sewage water treatment plants will 
be constructed. Smog and other forms of air pollution will be 
put under control. Solid garbage treatment plants and 
garbage-burning electric power plants will be built. 
  By 2005, air and water pollution will be effectively curbed 
and the recycling rate of solid waste will reach 80 percent. 
Green-coverage will top 45 percent by then. Noise pollution in 
urban areas will be reduced, according to the plan. 
  A major city in the Pearl River Delta, with urban population 
topping 3.73 million, Guangzhou has witnessed a rapid growth in 
its economy in the past few years. Last year, the city achieved 
a total industrial output value of 92.679 billion yuan, up 30.44 
percent compared with the previous year. 
  However, environmental problems have also become 
increasingly 
serious. Air pollution due to the burning of coal and exhaust 
emissions worsened. River water is widely contaminated with 
organic substances, and solid waste has increased rapidly, local 
officials said.

with a TA KUNG PAO reporter today, Guangdong Provincial Public 
Security Chief Chen Shaoji and Deputy Chief Wu Zeyao denied a 
recent report in Hong Kong's CHENG MING magazine entitled: 
"Guangdong Provincial Public Security Chief's House Ransacked 
By Thieves." 
  The "Reference News" column report in the April issue of 
CHENG MING said: "The house of Chen Shaoji, chief of the 
Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department, was ransacked 
by 'thieves' believed to have come from within." The report 
continued: "One day in early March, Chen Shaoji attended a 
provincial party committee meeting, all his family members went 
to visit friends in Foshan City, and his domestic helper 
returned to Xinhui on vacation. It was reported that this 
happened at about 1800 and involved two or more suspects. All 
of the electrical appliances in the house were damaged, clothes 
were smeared with paint, and a message was left, which read: We 
visited your excellency's house to check your property; we will 
announce the results soon. Reports said that bank books showing 
deposits of 35,000 yuan and gold ornaments were stolen." 
  Chen Shaoji pointed out: The report described the date, 
people's whereabouts, and the way the ransacking was performed 
in such a detailed manner that "they seemed to be true" but, as 
a matter of fact, my house and the houses of other leaders of 
the provincial Public Security Department have remained safe so 
far and no burglary has ever occurred. Since the report was 
published, my family members and I have received many telephone 
inquiries every day which have been quite disruptive. 
  Deputy Public Security Chief Wu Zeyao said: The provincial 
Public Security Department feels it necessary to clarify some 
Hong Kong press reports which have distorted facts concerning 
Guangdong's public security. The "thieves from within" 
mentioned by the report refer to public security personnel. 
This is groundless and means to say that "internal conflicts" 
have occurred in public security departments. The report on a 
burglary in the Guangdong Provincial Public Security 
"commander's" house located in the Public Security Department's 
compound tried to indicate that Guangdong's social order had 
deteriorated to an unredeemable degree. In addition, the report 
also used some words which caused much food for thought, such as 
"announcing the results soon" and so on, to make a false 
impression that there was uncleanliness within the leadership. 
Wu Zeyao said that the report was short and comprised only a 
little over 100 characters. However, it was meticulously 
composed and targeted at the public security chief and has 
ruined the image of Guangdong Public Security Departments. Wu 
Zeyao said that a lawsuit would be filed against the report if 
necessary. 
  To further clarify this case, a reporter went to Chen 
Shaoji's house accompanied by Chen Shaoji's wife and others. 
Chen Shaoji lives on the top floor of an old seven-story 
building within the Public Security Department's compound. The 
building is not equipped with an elevator. The interior of the 
room is simply decorated. There were no indications that the 
electrical appliances and furniture had been damaged and the 
domestic helper was a girl from Guangxi (not from Xinhui, as the 
report mentioned) who has been in Guangzhou for not more than 
six months.

  [Text] Riots occurred in Zengcheng village, Guangdong when 
close to 3,000 villagers took to the streets and blocked roads 
for two days to protest the government's uncompensated land 
acquisition. The local government sent anti-riot policemen to 
put down the demonstration. Four villagers were arrested and 
some villagers were reportedly hurt, although no accurate 
figures are available. This was the second riot in Guangdong in 
the last 10 days sparked by the problem of land acquisition. A 
similar incident occurred early this month in Huiyang County. 
  The riot occurred in Gongbei village, Shitan town, Zengcheng 
City. At around 1000, about 3,000 villagers surrounded the city 
government building, marching and protesting with banners on 
which were scrawled messages about dying of hunger if they got 
no compensation for their land. 
  Other villagers, holding hoes, held up the traffic and 
blocked the road from Shitan to Xintang and Zengcheng county 
seat, denying entry to public security vehicles. There was a 
standoff and tension ran high. 
  At around 1400, hundreds of anti-riot policemen arrived at 
the scene and fired a dozen tear gas canisters to disperse the 
crowd, and later arrested a few villagers. Local villagers said 
that when the anti-riot force fired the tear gas, the situation 
was very chaotic. Many villagers were beaten up by public 
security personnel, and some were wounded. As of yesterday 
evening, an accurate count of the wounded was unavailable. 
  Yesterday there were still a few villagers tacking up 
posters 
on the street, but the city had quieted down. The authorities 
began an investigation into the village riot a few days ago, but 
would not confirm whether official corruption was involved, only 
telling reporters that the matter was under investigation. 
  Local villagers said that, about six months ago, the village 
government sold land of about 500 mu to a Hong Kong businessman 
for property development for 10 million yuan. It is understood 
that the village government had collected the money, but 
villagers had never received any government compensation. In 
the last six months, villagers had repeatedly demanded the land 
sale proceeds from the village government, but to no avail. The 
villagers charged the government officials of corruption. 
  Early this month in Huiyang, there was a similar village 
riot sparked by the villagers' suspicion of their land sale 
money being pocketed. About 600 villagers of Bogang village, 
Xiayong town, Huiyang County besieged and vandalized the town 
public security neighborhood unit. A villager was shot in the 
thigh by public security personnel and seven were arrested 
during the incident.

  [Excerpts] On 31 March the regional party committee held a 
regional rural work teleconference, and regional people's 
government Chairman Cheng Kejie relayed the spirit of the 
important remarks made by CPC Central Committee and State 
Council leaders at a recently concluded central rural work 
conference. 
  Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin also delivered 
a speech in which he spelled out the region's rural work tasks 
in 1994 in accordance with the spirit of the recent central 
rural work conference. 
  The teleconference was presided over by Cheng Kejie and 
participants included regional party committee, government, 
people's congress standing committee, and Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference committee leaders; 
prefectural, city, and county party and government leaders; 
Nanning-based central unit leaders; and persons in charge of 
various organs directly under the regional authorities. 
  Secretary Zhao Fulin's important speech at the 
teleconference 
was divided into the following five parts: 
  1. Profoundly view agriculture as the foundation of the 
country's national economy and make energetic efforts to promote 
agricultural growth. [passage omitted] 
  2. Adopt practical measures aimed at securing steady 
grain production; provide agricultural production with all types 
of assistance, improved services, and sufficient supplies of 
capital, water, electric power, chemical fertilizer, farm 
chemicals, gasoline, farm machinery, and so on; implement to the 
letter all policy measures aimed at boosting grain production; 
and make continued efforts to successfully build commodity grain 
production bases. [passage omitted] 
  3. Vigorously readjust agricultural structure and 
increase the income of peasants. [passage omitted] 
  4. Make continued efforts to successfully build vegetable 
production bases and increase the effective supply of farm 
products. [passage omitted] 
  5. Further strengthen CPC leadership over agriculture and 
rural work. [passage omitted] 
  Secretary Zhao Fulin concluded his speech by saying: The 
principal party and government leaders at all levels in the 
region should, after this teleconference, go deep into the rural 
areas to carry out investigation and study. They should 
conscientiously give heed to opinions and demands put forth by 
cadres and masses at the grass-roots level, acquire a clearer 
understanding of the situation in the rural areas where central 
and regional policies have been implemented, and clearly 
identify a series of major problems that have cropped up in the 
course of Guangxi's rural reform and development in order to 
work out feasible and effective measures. Furthermore, they 
should make pragmatic arrangements for this year's agriculture 
and rural work in light of the local realities and strive with 
one heart and one mind to push Guangxi's agriculture and rural 
work onto a new stage in 1994!

  [Text] Nanning, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Guangxi Zhuang 
Autonomous Region in southeast China has made remarkable 
achievements in capital construction in such fields as energy 
supply, transportation, raw materials and posts and 
telecommunications. 
  Last year fixed-assets investment reached 27.2 billion yuan, 
up 93 percent over the previous year. Infrastructure received a 
record investment of 11 billion yuan, twice the amount for 1992. 
And more than 8,200 projects were launched. 
  The region has introduced flexible measures to speed up the 
construction of important projects. For instance, the first 
joint- stock venture in the field of electric power was set up 
last year to promote the construction of the Bailongtan Station, 
which cost over 100 million yuan. 
  By the end of 1993 a total of 34 priority projects were 
progressing smoothly, with over 20,000 long-distance telephone 
lines and five fiber-optic telecommunications lines installed, 
and ports achieving an annual handling capacity of 2.7 million 
tons. 
  The region's construction industry has also seen remarkable 
progress. In 1993 it registered 5.03 billion yuan in output 
value, 78 percent more than in the previous year. 
  Meanwhile, the real estate market has been booming in the 
area. Last year it grossed 1.4 billion yuan in sales of 
commercial dwellings, making a profit of over 100 million yuan. 
  Meanwhile, the province has strengthened control over the 
industry, having already closed down about 380 substandard real 
estate companies. 
  So far, the region has 14 cities, with an urban population 
of 
7.38 million. In 1993 it poured 2.8 billion yuan into urban 
construction, three times the figure for 1992.

  [Text] Wuhan, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Farmers in central 
China's Hubei Province find themselves liberated from worries 
and cares about what to grow or raise this spring -- "market 
advisers" will tell them exactly what to concentrate on. 
  Local experts at planting and stock-raising or well-informed 
businessmen are now acting as farmers' market advisers, teaching 
them useful techniques and seeking marketing channels for their 
products. 
  A farmer named Xiong Zaifu lost more than 1,000 yuan by 
planting watermelons last year. At the beginning of this year 
he signed a contract with a consultant, who advised him to grow 
soybeans instead and guaranteed that he could market them. 
  Another farmer, Hu Xinan, earned 10,000 yuan last year by 
raising pigs, following the advice of his market adviser. 
  This year he signed another three-year contract with the 
same 
adviser, which clearly stipulates that the adviser must buy his 
pigs for a price already agreed upon by the two sides. 
  "So I need only see to the raising," Hu said in a cheerful 
tone. 
  "Market advisers" have also benefited from such cooperation, 
as one adviser explained, "farmers get marketing channels and we 
get an ample supply of goods." 
  Song Guizhi of Wangtan village, near Tianmen city, an expert 
at cotton growing, has organized an association of market 
advisers in her village to provide services for farmers. 
  According to a local official, although the output of 
aquatic 
products and fruits in Hubei increased hugely last year, 
marketing has run smoothly, thanks to the positive role played 
by the "market advisers" in invigorating circulation and guiding 
farmers to adjust their activities to market demands.

  [Text] The central study group of the provincial party 
committee devoted three days, from 29 to 31 March, to 
intensively studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping and the "Decision of the CPC Central 
Committee on Some Questions Concerning the Establishment of the 
Socialist Market Economy." In light of their own actual cases 
regarding ideological understanding and work, members of the 
study group talked freely. During the closing session, 
provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered an 
important speech on theoretical study for leading cadres. 
  The provincial party committee central study group's main 
purpose in organizing this intensive study class was to enable 
its members to emancipate their minds, change their concepts, 
and to explore a general policy for Hunan Province to embrace 
the market economy. The provincial party committee demanded that 
members participating in the intensive study class concentrate 
on reading the original text of the works and documents, 
thoroughly study and understand the essence of Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as 
well as the basic content and important significance of the 
central authorities' decision, and conduct research on special 
topics with reference to the reality in Hunan as well as the 
specific tasks assigned to them. 
  On the afternoon the study class closed, Comrade Wang Maolin 
delivered a speech. He said: Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the important 
theoretical foundation on which to build socialism well, and the 
theoretical ground for our party to formulate its line, 
principles, and policies. Our comrades holding leading posts, 
especially those holding high-level leading posts, must properly 
implement the party's line, principles, and policies and do a 
good job in performing the duties that the party and the people 
have entrusted to them. Without studying Deng Xiaoping's theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics well, they 
will not be able to perform their duties well, thus they will 
fail to accomplish the tasks the party and the people assign to 
them. 
  Wang Maolin demanded that everybody conscientiously read the 
original text of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 
in a thorough and down-to-earth manner, with close reference to 
actual cases, try to understand the works' spiritual essence, 
and apply the theory to actual work. 
  Members of the standing committee of the provincial party 
committee, the principal comrades in charge of the provincial 
people's congress and the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference provincial committee, vice governors, 
and the secretary general of the provincial government attended 
this study class organized by the central study group of the 
provincial party committee.

  [Text] Changsha, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Traffic on the 
Xiangjiang River, a major waterway in central China's Hunan 
Province, will soon increase greatly, in size and number. 
  Official sources here said that preparations have started to 
make the 182 km section from Zhuzhou to Hengyang cities 
navigable in all seasons for ships under 1,000 tons. 
  This requires the building of a dam 62 km from Hengyang, the 
dredging of the 120-km river channel from the dam to Zhuzhou, 
the building of six berths in the two river ports, and auxiliary 
telecommunications and navigation facilities. 
  Feasibility studies to improve the water channel of the 
river, a major tributary of the Chang Jiang River, was started 
as early as 1986 by the State Council and the Hunan Provincial 
Government. 
  The approved feasibility report proposed that the 439 km 
section between Yueyang and Hengyang should be made navigable 
for vessels up to 1,000 tons, through an investment of two 
billion yuan. 
  The first phase of the work was finished some while ago, 
resulting in the passage capacity being raised from 300 tons to 
1,000 tons on the 257 km section from Yueyang to Zhuzhou. 
  The authorities believe that the project, a national model 
work in improving inland waterways, will be of great 
significance to the development of the many manufacturing 
centers along the Xiangjiang River.

  [Text] The Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee called a 
provincial conference of leading cadres in Guiyang yesterday 
morning. The conference summed up the province's anticorruption 
work over the past year and made anticorruption work 
arrangements for this year. 
  Chen Shineng, provincial party committee deputy secretary 
and 
provincial governor, presided over the conference. Xia Guohua, 
provincial party committee standing committee member and 
discipline inspection commission secretary, relayed General 
Secretary Jiang emin's address to the recently concluded Third 
Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Liu Fangren delivered a 
speech in which he put forth the following four requirements on 
the ongoing anticorruption struggle across the province: 
  1. To correctly view the ongoing anticorruption struggle 
across the province. Secretary Liu Fangren stated: Guizhou has 
scored marked results in fighting corruption over the past year. 
Nevertheless, the province's anticorruption struggle has been 
plagued by unbalanced growth, unsustained progress, and some 
other problems. We should know that corrupt phenomena have now 
multiplied to a serious extent, posing a real threat to Guizhou. 
Therefore, we should be fully aware of the arduousness and 
protractedness of the ongoing anticorruption struggle. 
  2. The main tasks of and principles for the province's 
anticorruption struggle in 1994. Secretary Liu Fangren noted: 
This year, Guizhou's anticorruption struggle should be 
continually focused on party and government leaders at and above 
the county or provincial department section level. To this end, 
we should see to it that all party and government cadres at and 
above county or provincial department section level remain 
honest in performing official duties and abide by the party and 
government disciplines. We should work hard and strive for more 
progress in this regard. Moreover, we should make redoubled 
efforts to investigate and handle all major and serious cases, 
strictly enforce party discipline and state laws, straighten out 
departmental or professional malpractices in real earnest, and 
strive to make the province's anticorruption struggle submit to 
and serve the CPC's overall interests. 
  3. The party committees and governments at all levels across 
the province should strengthen leadership over the ongoing 
anticorruption struggle. 
  4. To forge and maintain flesh-and-blood ties with the broad 
masses of people and strengthen the effectiveness of the 
anticorruption struggle. Secretary Liu Fangren stressed: The 
mass viewpoint and mass line have remained the CPC's cherished 
traditions, they are the basis upon which the party and 
government can survive, and are the source of force with which 
we can overcome all sorts of hardships and difficulties. 
Improving party style and building a clean government are, in a 
nutshell, aimed at maintaining long-term flesh-and-blood ties 
between the party and government on the one hand and the broad 
masses of people on the other. We should always bear this point 
in mind. 
  The conference was attended by provincial leaders, including 
Wang Chaowen, Long Zhiyi, Wang Siqi, Wang Guangxian, Hu Kehui, 
Li Wanlu, Wang Shouting, and Huang Yao; retired veteran leaders 
at and above deputy provincial level; leading cadres at the 
deputy provincial department director level; provincial 
discipline inspection commission members; prefectural, 
autonomous prefectural, city, and county discipline inspection 
commissions secretaries; prefectural, autonomous prefectural, 
city, and county supervision bureaus chiefs; as well as 
discipline inspection groups leaders and supervision offices 
directors from various provincial departments.

  [Text] Guiyang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China is making 
efforts in building hydro-power stations along the Wujiang 
River, a major tributary of the Chang Jiang River, in south-west 
China's Guizhou Province. 
  The state has just approved construction of the Hongjiadu 
Hydro-Power Station with a generating capacity of 540,000 kw. 
  Experts calculate that the Wujiang River's abundant 
hydro-power resources have a total potential capacity of 8.56 
million kw for development. 
  At present a 630,000-kw hydro-power station is in operation, 
another 510,000-kw plant will be completed within the year, and 
in the long run, a Wujiang hydropower energy base with a total 
generating capacity of 6.39 million kw will be built up in the 
coming 25 years. 
  The Wujiang River Valley is rich also in natural resources 
of 
coal, aluminium, sulphur, manganese and mercury. The bauxite 
reserve amounts to 270 million tons, ranking third in China; and 
its phosphate ore reserve comes to 2.58 billion tons, ranking 
second in the country. 
  In order to accelerate development of hydro-power resources, 
the central government and Guizhou Province have also 
incorporated the Wujiang Hydropower Development Corporation of 
Guizhou, which will be in charge of construction and operation 
of nine power stations along the Wujiang River.

  [Text] Chengdu, April 11 (XINHUA) -- "Less children, less 
burden; late child-bearing, early money-making" has gradually 
replaced the formerly deeply-rooted "more children, more 
happiness" to become the most popular life maxims in rural 
Sichuan Province. 
  Local official said this marked the great changes in the 
Chinese farmer's concept of marriage and child-bearing. 
  Gan Zeqiong, a young woman in Pingan village near Chengdu, 
the provincial capital, participated in the marriage education 
schools held by the local family-planning department, together 
with her husband, where they were taught not only necessary 
knowledge on sex and pregnancy but also techniques of crop 
planting, breeding and market information by technicians. 
  During the two years since then, the couple has been busy in 
planting fruit trees and selling fruit and has decided to put 
off their child-bearing plan to what they said will be "a more 
appropriate time in the future." 
  In the district where the couple lives, almost every young 
farmer has grasped more than one practical technique. 
  Devoting most of their time and energy to utilizing these 
techniques and to their own capability to make more money, more 
than 2,000 young farmers have postponed their schedule for 
weddings and raising families and many young one-child couples 
have even voluntarily abstained from giving birth to the second 
one. 
  They have fully understood that it's more the quality of 
life 
than the scale of the family that matters in bringing about 
family happiness. 
  Sichuan is the country's most heavily populated province 
with 
110 million permanent residents, with those in rural areas 
accounting for 80 percent of the total. 
  Alteration of most farmers' concepts of marriage and child- 
bearing has clearly begun to lighten the population burden in 
this western province, whose birth rate and natural increase 
rate of population in the year 1993 were 16.7 percent and 0.957 
percent, respectively, both among the lowest of the country.

  [Text] Lhasa, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The ongoing Three Rivers 
Comprehensive Development Project in Southwest China's Tibet 
Autonomous Region has begun to yield good returns. 
  A total of 22 projects on the middle reaches of the Yarlung 
Zangbo, Nyangqu and Lhasa Rivers have been completed over the 
past three years. 
  The projects include the building or expansion of four 
reservoirs with a combined holding capacity of 26.12 million cu 
m of water, two hydropower stations with a total installed 
capacity of 2,200 kw, land improvement and afforestation. 
  In the three years the total investment in the projects has 
been 240 million yuan (about 30 million U.S. dollars). Over 
1,333 ha of low-yield farm land have been improved, and over 
6,666 ha of land planted with trees. 
  The construction of water conservancy, energy, transport, 
technology, farm, animal husbandry and forestry projects along 
the rivers have greatly improved local farming conditions and 
the ecological environment. 
  Last year the production of grain, rape, meat and milk in 
the 
project areas were respectively 62.06, 79.2, 17.47 and 21.24 
percent of the totals for the region.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will speed up 
the establishment of a socialist market economy this year, Mayor 
Li Qiyan said here today. 
  Li made the remark at the second session of the eighth 
municipal people's congress opened here today. 
  Li said that more effective measures will be explored to 
push 
forward the modern enterprise system. A group of well-performed 
large and medium-sized enterprises will be selected to have a 
trial operation of the modern enterprise system. 
  More experiments will be done to promote the share-holding 
system. Five enterprises in Beijing will be listed abroad, 
according to the mayor. 
  The Chinese capital also will incorporate a number of 
inter-regional or multi-industrial large enterprise groups and 
chain-enterprises. 
  Small state-owned enterprises will go through various 
reforms 
such as leasing operation, joint-stock holding and selling 
properties by auction, Li said. 
  A network of markets will be developed with emphasis on the 
establishment of a capital goods market, the mayor said. 
  This year, the city will mainly develop and improve edible 
oil and commodity exchanges, chemicals, steel, automobile, coal 
and building material markets. 
  Financial and property markets will also be developed while 
promoting technology, information, labour and futures markets. 
  The city will accelerate legislation to keep the markets in 
good order, Li added. 
  A macro-economy control system will be established in the 
city. Specialized banks will be shifted to commercial banks, and 
financial insurance system will be promoted. 
  The city plans to set up a development bank, a merchant bank 
and an urban and rural cooperative bank. Foreign and 
joint-venture banks and the Beijing securities trading center 
are also expected to be established in the city this year. 
  Beijing will work hard to promote its insurance and welfare 
system. A new system will be built up to guarantee a normal 
increase of pensions for the retirees. 
  The city will streamline the municipal government within the 
year and get ready for the implementation of the civil service 
system, said the mayor.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Hong Xia: "Beijing Targets 10 Percent </F>
GDP Growth This Year"] 
  [Text] Beijing plans to push its economic output to 99 
billion yuan ($11 billion) this year, a 10 percent jump over 
1993. 
  The goal, set by Mayor Li Qiyan yesterday, is 2 percent less 
than last year but 1 point higher than the national gross 
domestic product (GDP) target of 9 percent for 1994. 
  The mayor opened the Municipal People's Congress [MPC], the 
city legislature, by outlining several of the capital's economic 
priorities for the coming year. The MPC session runs for one 
week. 
  Li said agriculture and industry should grow 3.5 and 9.8 
percent respectively. 
  He stressed the importance of the city's service sector -- a 
development priority -- and projected an 11.5 percent increase 
in output, making up 47.5 percent of GDP. 
  To ensure sustained, rapid and healthy growth, Beijing will 
focus on improving economic efficiency and product quality. 
  It plans to spend 484 million yuan ($55.6 million) this year 
to promote agriculture, 11.8 percent more than last year, Li 
said. 
  Arable land should be preserved and more bases of non-staple 
food set up. Vegetable farms will be expanded by 10,000 
hectares. 
  Top finance official Sun Jiaqi shrugged off the city's $500 
million deficit for 1994. Sun said revenue will grow by 9 
percent to reach 4.25 billion yuan ($488 million). And 
expenditures will reach 8.56 billion yuan ($984 million), up 5.7 
percent over last year, the Finance Bureau director said. 
  But a roughly balanced budget is expected because of central 
government tax refunds and subsidies, as well as last year's 
financial surplus. 
  To increase farm income, the city will promote a high-yield, 
quality and efficient agriculture. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing will encourage industry development that 
consumes less water and energy and produces less pollution, Li 
said. 
  The capital's three key industries of cars, electronics and 
new building materials will be accelerated. 
  And technical renovation of enterprises will be stepped up, 
he said, calling for one-third of the key plants to be revamped. 
  Retail sales are expected to increase 20 percent to hit 66.4 
billion yuan ($7.6 billion) -- just the beginning of the city's 
shopping bonanza. 
  Ten more shopping complexes with a floor space of at least 
1O,OOO square metres will open to business in 1994.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (CNS) -- Beijing municipality has 
been seeing a continuous rising of prices, arousing great 
concern and becoming the focus of current discussions by the 
Beijing People's Congress. 
  Information released by the Beijing Bureau of Statistics 
showed that prices rose by over 23 percent on average in the 
first quarter and the rising trend was continuing, resulting in 
heavy inflationary pressures being felt by residents. 
Delivering report on government work to the Congress, Mayor Li 
Qiyan said that prices for daily necessities had climbed too 
quickly in recent times. Representatives attending the meeting 
were convinced that the current rising prices were mainly seen 
in milk with a 33 percent hike last February and in fresh 
vegetables which registered a price increase of 37 percent. 
Prices rises in these two daily items triggered off price 
increases for other items. General workers and those working 
with enterprises cannot afford such prices and persons going 
into retirement or on leave received the greatest impact. 
  Deputies to the municipal People's Congress strongly 
appealed 
to the municipal government for measures to bring the runaway 
prices under control. They asked for a clear picture on how 
much prices in Beijing would climb this year. Mr. Li and the 
executive vice mayor Mr. Wang Baosen told the deputies that the 
municipal government would take steps to curb prices from rising 
further. The measures include the powers of responsibility held 
by the mayor and heads of counties and districts. Great efforts 
in the food production programme will be made including the main 
agricultural by-products such as grains, oil, meat, eggs and 
milk to stabilize prices. 
  The municipality will further open itself to the outside 
world to draw on more sources of goods. With the measures for 
price adjustment in place, the municipal authorities will 
strictly control the number of items for price reform this year. 
  Prices inspection on two occasions will be carried out in 
the 
first half and second half of this year. The raising of prices 
by capitalizing on the price rise trend, the increasing of 
prices by individuals, price hikes under the pretext of 
increasing taxation and profiteering by raising prices have to 
be harshly punished. The enactment of laws and regulations 
countering the practice of making staggering profits is in full 
swing and will come into effect this year.

  [Text] Beijing, April 10 (XINHUA) -- More than 95,000 
households of Beijing residents will move into new homes this 
year, the city Mayor Li Qiyan said. 
  Li said that renovation of dilapidated houses and 
construction of new residential buildings will be accelerated so 
that a total of 6.50 million sq m of houses will be available by 
the end of the year. 
  The "Kangju Project," aiming to provide more housing for 
lower-income families with small living space, will be one of 
the key projects in the housing blueprint, according to Li. 
  One sq m of the "Kangju Residence" would cost 700 yuan, 
according to Zhang Baifa, a vice-mayor of the city. Currently, 
one square meter of commercial housing typically costs 3,000 to 
4,000 yuan in Beijing. 
  "If that price is still out of reach for the lower income 
families, they will get help from the government and their 
employers," Zhang said in a recent press conference. 
  The vice-mayor said that Beijing will continue to carry out 
the fund-accumulation system, something like the mortgage system 
in the west, and carry out reforms in commercializing housing. 
  Some 8,000 sq m in residences in the construction project 
begun last year have been put into use. Another 300,000 sq m of 
residences will be completed this year. Some one million sq m 
of dilapidated houses will be rebuilt. 
  Statistics show that Beijing now has a total residential 
space of 110 million sq m, with 8.3 sq m for each citizen. 
However, there are still more than 200,000 lower-income 
households living in cramped houses with less than 4 sq m of 
living space per capita. 
  In an attempt to quicken the pace of housing construction, 
Beijing began to make use of overseas capital last year. Dozens 
of contracts to jointly renovate old houses were signed with 
overseas investors, including Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- There are now more 
than 5,000 overseas agencies in Beijing, posing pressure on the 
supply of office space. 
  Local officials said that the number of business agencies of 
internationally-known companies keeps rising in the Chinese 
capital. Most of the existing office buildings have been rented 
out. 
  The China World Trade Center, for instance, harbors more 
than 
300 offices of overseas companies from over 20 countries and 
regions, including Japan, the United States and Germany. 
  All of the center's office accommodation has been occupied 
continuously in the past two years. 
  Overseas investors have been flocking to Beijing. Renovation 
projects of major commercial facilities in Beijing's Wangfujing, 
Xidan and other golden areas have incorporated overseas 
investment. 
  At present, construction of several more office buildings in 
the city is in full swing.

<F P=106> [By Yang Qingyu (2799 1987 3842): "Food Industry Should </F>
Become Hebei Province's Pillar Industry"] 
  [Text] Our province's food industry should serve the 
domestic and international markets and be developed as a pillar 
industry. Developing the food industry is an important measure 
for guaranteeing the basic living demands of the urban people 
and enabling peasants to become better-off with moderate 
prosperity and an important component for developing the 
export-oriented economy. This was repeatedly stressed by Cheng 
Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, when he 
listened to Shijiazhuang city's briefings on development of the 
vegetable basket project today. 
  Today, the production line for producing 10,000 tonnes of 
Guangbei Brand cook meat products under the Shijiazhuang city 
meat packing plant, which is one of the key items of 
Shijiazhuang city's vegetable basket project, was completed and 
put into production. Provincial leaders, including Cheng Weigao, 
Li Bingliang, Zhao Jinduo, Guo Hongqi, Gu Eerxiong, Song Shuhua, 
and Zhang Runshen, and former provincial leaders, such as Xie 
Feng and Hong Yi, travelled to the plant to extend 
congratulations. After that, they listened to briefings given 
by the Shiajiazhuang city government on the vegetable basket 
project. 
  Cheng Weigao said: The CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council have been concerned about this vegetable basket project. 
Whether we can enrich the vegetable basket in the course of 
deepening reform will affect economic and political stability. 
Foodstuffs are an important aspect to the vegetable basket 
project. Our province has rich resources for the development of 
the food industry which should become a pillar industry along 
with steel, iron, machinery, and textile industries. On the one 
hand, we should do a good job in local market supply; and on the 
other hand, we should make food industry serve the domestic and 
international markets. At present, people have failed to fully 
understand this point. The development of food industry may 
lead the processing industry and aquaculture forward, make a 
number of peasants rich, arrange jobs for a batch of labor 
force, and enrich the vegetable basket and market supply. It is 
necessary to regard this work as an important measure for 
enabling peasants to become well-off and developing the 
export-oriented economy. 
  Cheng Weigao said: To grasp the vegetable basket, first of 
all, we must do a good job in production and supply; and second, 
strengthen market management and price management, deal blows to 
unlawful acts, such as manipulation of markets, mixing up good 
and inferior products, selling fake products, forcing the prices 
up, and giving short measurements, protect the interests of 
consumers, and keep the prices at a rational level. He 
expressed hope that Shijiazhuang city will pay attention to the 
four matters in the course of carrying out the vegetable basket 
project: First, Shijiazhuang city should attend to hog raising, 
accelerate the development of the meat processing industry, and 
exert efforts to raise the product quality and increase product 
varieties; second, actively carry out the work of raising cattle 
with straw; third, accelerate the development of vegetables 
within plastic sheet coverings and select several vegetable 
varieties for intensive processing or for sale within small 
packages; and fourth, develop the intensive processing of grain 
products.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- North China's 
Hebei Province has since 1988 improved medical care in rural 
areas using nearly 27.4 million U.S. dollars in either 
interest-free loans or assistance from international 
organizations. 
  An official of the provincial public health department said 
that the World Bank has promised a 21 million U.S. dollar loan 
to Hebei to assist it in training rural doctors and improving 
rural clinics. 
  Hebei began to undertake the six-year World Bank-aided 
project in November 1993, he said. 
  When the project is completed, working conditions in 222 
rural clinics will be improved and better medical services 
provided for 30 million farmers, he said. 
  Now, 12 poor counties in Hebei are co-operating with the 
United Nations Children's Fund in improving medical care for 
rural women and children and promoting family planning, the 
official said. 
  The counties have received 543 sets of medical equipment 
worth 3.5 million yuan from the fund, he said. 
  Moreover, funds from other international organizations are 
being used to control tuberculosis [T.B.] in 111 counties, 
cities and districts in hebei, he said. 
  By the end of 1993, 10,000 T.B. patients had received free 
medical treatment. 
  Wang Youhui, vice-governor of Hebei Province, pledged to 
make 
efficient use of the funds from international organizations to 
improve medical care in rural areas, where 80 percent of Hebei 
Province's population lives.

  [Text] Hohhot, April 10 (XINHUA) -- More than 140 million 
yuan will be spent this year to upgrade the telecommunications 
facilities in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 
  Local officials said that the autonomous region is to 
construct another 200 telecom projects this year to help promote 
local economic growth. 
  Among the 200 projects are two national projects -- the 
Inner 
Mongolian section of the Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin optical fiber 
line and of the Beijing-Hohhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou optical fiber 
line -- and a few long distance telephone lines. 
  According to the development plan, 17,470 long distance 
automatic terminals, three times that of 1993, and another 2,000 
long distance telephone lines will be added to the existing long 
distance network. That will help all counties and banners of the 
autonomous region to reach the target of long distance direct 
dialing. 
  In addition, some 300,000 lines of intra-city telephone 
exchanges will be installed this year and 80 rural telephone 
automatic exchange systems will be added. 
  Last year, automatic long distance telephone services were 
installed in 100 counties and banners on the grasslands.

  [Text] Beijing, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 22 
March, a joint inspection team organized by the Xinzhou 
Prefecture and Xinzhou city, Shanxi Province, price inspection 
departments -- while inspecting price tags at the Guangxiu 
Department Store (a large, privately run retailer) -- were 
attacked by the department store's security personnel and other 
employees who claimed that they were "imposters with fake 
papers," according to information provided by the State Planning 
Commission. They hauled one of the inspectors to the security 
office and there beat him up using a baton. Two inspectors who 
later entered the office to negotiate with them were also 
beaten, abused, and held in custody for nearly two hours, thus 
severely obstructing the price inspectors from carrying out 
their official duties. 
  Leaders of Shanxi Province, the Xinzhou Prefectural 
Administrative Office, and Xinzhou city took the incident rather 
seriously. The Xinzhou Prefectural Administrative Office 
instructed the Xinzhou city government to strictly handle the 
incident, and the Xinzhou city Public Security Bureau has 
assigned police to investigate. Guo Yuhuai, member of the 
Shanxi Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and 
executive deputy governor, instructed the secretary of the 
Xinzhou Prefectural Party Committee to take personal charge of 
the matter and see to it that the offenders are duly punished. 
SHANXI RIBAO was going to report the incident and express its 
support for price inspectors' exercising their regular powers 
and functions. 
  The incident is still under investigation. On 1 April, Wang 
Dahu, deputy chief of the security section at the Guangxiu 
Department Store and the principal offender in the attack, was 
taken into custody for interrogation in Xinzhou city.

<F P=106> [Work report of the Tianjin Municipal Higher People's Court </F>
by Zhang Bofeng, president of the municipal higher people's 
court, at the second session of the 12th municipal people's 
congress on 5 March] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: The people's courts at all levels 
throughout the municipality carried out the administration of 
justice by earnestly implementing the duties imposed on them by 
the Constitution and law in 1993 and scored new achievements in 
accelerating their self reform and improvement. In 1993 they 
received 38,656 first-and-second trial cases of crimes as well 
as of civil, economic, and administrative disputes, which showed 
a 4.15 percent increase over 1992. They tried and wound up 
38,656 cases, which showed a 4.26 percent increase over 1992. 
They handled 77,978 cases of petition letters and visits 
written and paid by the masses. While successfully conducting 
the administration of justice, they further enhanced their sense 
of initiatively rendering services and continuously paved the 
new ways of serving the reform and economic construction. 
Through the administration of justice and their initiative 
service they made positive contributions to safeguarding the 
municipality's stability; promoting the deep-going development 
of the anticorruption struggle; protecting the legal rights and 
interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations; 
ensuring the enforcement of the state macroeconomic readjustment 
and control; and promoting the smooth progress of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. 
<H5>  1. We Dealt Strict Blows at the Criminal Elements Who Had </H5>
Seriously Endangered the Social Peace; Strictly Punished the 
Criminal Elements Who Had Damaged the Economy; and Created a 
Fine Social Environment for Reform, Opening Up, and Economic 
Construction. 
  In 1993 the people's courts at all levels throughout the 
municipality received 5,581 first-trial cases that showed an 
11.13 percent increase over 1992. Of these cases, those of 
serious and appalling crimes showed a 16.02 percent increase 
over 1992. They tried and wound up 5,552 first-trial cases that 
showed a 10.4 percent increase over 1992. Of 5,843 criminals 
whose cases were tried in the year, 5,800 were announced guilty 
and accounted for 99.26 percent in the total, showing a 2.7 
percent increase over 1992. Of these tried criminals, those who 
were sentenced to more than five-year imprisonment, life 
imprisonment, and death penalty (including probation) accounted 
for 28.63 percent in the total; those who were sentenced to less 
than five-year imprisonment, reform, surveillance, and probation 
accounted for 68.89 percent; and those who were exempted from 
criminal punishment accounted for 1.74 percent. 
  A. We deeply carried out the struggle of "dealing strict 
blows at crimes" and made out-all efforts to safeguard the 
social stability. 
  The broad masses of cadres and policemen of the people's 
courts at all levels across the municipality further enhanced 
their sense of dealing strict blows at crimes and deeply carried 
out the struggle against crimes. They emphatically handled the 
serious and appalling criminal cases that had seriously 
endangered the social peace. In particular, they persistently 
joined in advance in the investigations of serious and appalling 
criminal cases of murder, hold-up, rape, heavy harm, gangsters, 
and arson, which were bitterly hated by the masses. They 
carefully examined these cases as well as tried and wound up 
them rapidly. They also resolutely, heavily, and rapidly 
punished in line with the law the criminal elements whose crimes 
were very serious. They resolutely gave heavy judgment or death 
penalty to criminals who deserved to receive. Thus, they 
reinforced the dynamics of dealing blows at crimes and 
continuously maintained the trend of "dealing strict blows at 
crimes". They tried and wound up 2,695 criminal cases that 
exerted serious influence to the society and effectively 
punctured the arrogance of criminal elements. In line with the 
prominent problems of public security, they actively carried out 
the specialized struggles and concentratedly dealt blows at 
robbery and the damage of electric equipment. They earnestly 
implemented the "decisions" adopted by the municipal people's 
congress standing committee with regard to banning narcotics; 
punishing the criminal elements of smuggling, making, and 
trafficking in obscene things; banning prostitution and going 
whoring; and strictly punishing the criminal elements of 
abducting women and children. They also jointly with the 
relevant departments actively carried out the struggle against 
"pornographic things" and "six vices" as well as tried and wound 
up 64 cases of luring and sheltering women for prostitution, 
making and trafficking in obscene things, participating in 
gambling, abducting and trafficking in human beings, and 
trafficking in narcotics. They created a fine social 
environment for reform, opening up, and the establishment of 
socialist market economic systems. 
  B. We strictly punished economic crimes, attended to trying 
major and appalling cases, and promoted the deepening of 
anticorruption struggle. 
  People's courts at all levels across the municipality 
continued to deal strict blows to criminal activities that 
seriously disrupted the economy in line with the law and gave 
priority to punishing criminal activities concerning state 
functionaries who took advantage of their posts to engage in 
corruption, bribery, misappropriation of public funds, 
production and marketing of fake and inferior commodities, tax 
evasion, refusing to pay taxes, and other activities that 
damaged the prestige of the party and the state and disrupted 
the socialist market economic order. In line with the 
guidelines of the central directive on handling major and 
appalling cases well, we prominently grasped the handling of 
major and appalling cases well. We accepted 357 economic 
criminal cases each involving an illicit sum of over 10,000 
yuan, accounting for 35.9 percent of the total number of 
economic criminal cases, and recovered 6.8 million yuan in 
economic losses for the state and the collectives. Regarding 
serious economic criminals, we upheld the principle of punishing 
them strictly in line with law. Of these economic criminals, 
30.41 percent were sentenced to more than five years of 
imprisonment, life imprisonment, and capital punishment 
(including death sentence with temporary suspension of the 
execution), an increase of 9.41 percentage point over the 
previous year. Courts at all levels across the municipality 
upheld the principle of "first be resolute and second be careful 
and accurate," strictly handled cases in line with facts and 
evidences, applied suitable law to the cases, conscientiously 
studied and understood the state promulgated law and regulations 
on economic construction and the party's relevant policies on 
the establishment of the socialist economic structure, strictly 
distinguished between the limit between economic crimes and 
miscalculations in economic activities, and properly handled the 
relationship between dealing blows and protection; strictly 
distinguished between the limit between economic crimes and 
ordinary economic law-breaking acts; and properly handled the 
relationship between dealing blows and education. Meanwhile, 
they provided economic criminal clues for public security and 
procuratorial departments which they had discovered in the 
course of economic trials. In order to expand the social effect 
in handling cases, courts at all levels across the municipality 
extensively conducted propaganda on the legal system through 
public trials, meting out punishment in the public, and 
reporting by the press media. Since last August, the municipal 
intermediate and higher people's courts successively tried and 
meted out sentence for the case of Yu Zuomin of Daqiuzhuang in 
Jinghai County, and the corruption case of Hu Fengming, former 
manager of Guomin Hotel, and a number of cases that brought a 
great influence to the people. Particularly, the handling of 
the case of Yu Zuomin caused strong repercussions in society, 
showed the decision and acts of the party and the people's 
government in strengthening the legal system and fighting 
corruption, promoted the in-depth and sound development of the 
anticorruption, and received a good comment from all social 
sectors. 
  C. We actively participated in comprehensive management of 
public security and succeeded in preventing and reducing crime. 
  People's courts at all levels across the municipality 
conscientiously upheld the principle of "giving simultaneous 
attention to dealing blows to criminals, preventing crimes, and 
taking temporary and permanent measures for solution," and paid 
attention to the comprehensive management of public security in 
the course of giving trials. While actively conducting the 
struggle to "deal strict blows to criminals," they actively 
coordinated with relevant departments to manage some areas where 
public order was chaotic, selected some typic cases with 
educational significance, and conducted open trials in places 
where the cases occurred in an effort to expand the results of 
handling cases. They held 315 public trials on various sorts of 
cases, concentrated efforts on meting out sentences for 908 
criminals, and allowed 7,904,800 people to listen to the trials, 
thus effectively dealing blows to and frightening the criminals 
and inspiring the masses of people to struggle against criminal 
acts. We continued to strengthen juvenile court work, 
unceasingly improved the method of "educating juvenile 
delinquents in the course of trials and integrating punishment 
with education," further implemented the measures aiming at 
helping and educating delinquents, and saved a great number of 
misguided youths. We paid attention to education on 
implementing legal policies before, during and after the trials, 
on admitting the crimes and serving the sentence, on urging 
delinquents to receive transformation, and on tracking their 
acts. We handled 2,572 cases on reducing sentences and 
releasing criminals on probation in line with the law, and 
succeeded in promoting education and transformation of criminals 
held in custody. We did a good job in helping, educating, and 
examining criminals whose sentences were temporarily suspended 
and their punishments were exempted or reduced, and who were 
released on probation, and succeeded in preventing criminals 
from committing new crimes again and reducing the number of such 
cases. Suggestions for conducing judicial work were actively 
encouraged. Over the past year, 452 suggestions for judicial 
work were proposed, 41 percent of which were accepted, and these 
suggestions yielded fairly good social effect. 
<H5>  2. We Strenuously Strengthened Economic Trials and Actively </H5>
Served the State Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Policy and 
the Development of the Socialist Market Economy 
  The people's courts across the municipality accepted 6,248 
cases on economic disputes for first trial, an increase of 29.7 
percent; the lawsuits involved a total sum of 1,047,120,000 
yuan, an increase of 169.92 percent over the previous year. 
  People's courts at all levels across the municipality 
proceeded their work from guaranteeing the smooth implementation 
of the state macroeconomic regulation and control policy and the 
establishment and normal operation of the market economic 
structure and made special efforts to strengthen the trial of 
the following few kinds of cases: 
  A. They carefully handled all sorts of cases emerged in the 
course of changing the planned economic system into the market 
economic system. The tried and concluded 184 cases on 
enterprise bankruptcy, enterprise contracted and leasing 
operation, enterprise cooperative management, and enterprise 
amalgamation emerged in the course of changing the operational 
mechanism. 
  B. They conscientiously tried all sorts of cases emerged in 
the process of cultivating the socialist markets. They tried 
and concluded 3,262 cases on purchase and marketing contracts, 
bill disputes, and infringement on patent and trademarks, and at 
the same time, actively and carefully tried cases of a new type, 
such as cases on disputes concerning futures trade and listing 
stock in other localities. 
  C. They promptly handled all sorts of economic disputes 
emerged in the course of strengthening the state macroeconomic 
regulation and control policy. Primarily, they coordinated with 
the state to rectify the financial order, strengthened the trial 
of cases on bank loans, and concluded 415 cases on loan contract 
disputes, and recovered 40 million yuan in overdue loans for the 
financial departments in line with the law. They 
conscientiously tried 121 cases on contract disputes of 
construction projects occurred when the state curtailed the 
capital construction funds, and coordinated with the government 
to readjust the capital construction items. 
  D. They actively tried all kinds of cases related to the 
development of the rural economy. They properly tried cases on 
rural contract disputes and safeguarded the responsibility 
system with the family-based output-related contract 
responsibility system as the mainstay. Meanwhile, they promptly 
tried cases on economic disputes involving township enterprises 
and promoted the development of the rural economy. 
  E. We fairly tried and handled cases on maritime affairs 
and maritime businesses. Last year, we tried and handled a 
total of 136 cases of this kind, an increase of 183.33 percent 
over the previous year. Cases involving foreign countries, Hong 
Kong, Macao, and Taiwan accounted for 35.29 percent of this. As 
a result, the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese and 
foreign parties concerned were protected and opening up and 
international economic and trade development were promoted. 
  In the course of improving the trial of economic cases, 
people's courts at all levels continuously expanded their 
service for reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  First, economic dispute mediation centers were established. 
Economic dispute mediation centers were set up at various 
grass-roots courts in the municipality, the municipal 
intermediate people's court, and the municipal maritime affairs 
court. In line with the demands of the Supreme People's Court, 
and within the scope stipulated by laws, these centers provided 
mediation to economic disputes before disputes were brought to 
lawsuits by following the principle of "being simple, flexible, 
rapid, and efficient." As a result, economic disputes were 
resolved rapidly. Last year, economic dispute mediation centers 
throughout the municipality received a total of 2,100 cases, of 
which, 1,500 were concluded. Through these cases, 150 million 
yuan worth of economic losses were retrieved for enterprises. 
The average time to conclude a case of this kind was one month, 
and some of these cases were concluded within only several hours. 
  Second, help was provided to enterprises to clear debts 
according to laws. In light of the problem in which some 
state-owned enterprises and township enterprises in the 
municipality were unable to clear receivable debts and thus 
seriously affected economic development, many courts positively 
launched the special service activities of helping enterprises 
clear receivable debts, thus promoting the development of 
enterprises. 
  Third, the joint activity of building the legal system was 
tried. We actively launched the activities of building the legal 
system together with some enterprises, positively propagated 
policies and laws, guided enterprises to mediate disputes, and 
helped enterprises perfect contracts, establish regulations and 
systems, and train legal professionals to handle cases according 
to laws. At the same time, enterprises also supervised law 
enforcement of courts, thus helping raise the law enforcement 
level of courts. 
  Fourth, the contacts between courts and economic management 
departments were strengthened. The municipal higher people's 
court established the economic dispute coordination office 
together with the municipal economic development and coordinated 
in a timely and appropriate manner, 40 cases that emerged 
suddenly due to the forced freeze and transfer of enterprises' 
funds on accounts by the courts of other localities. The 
municipal higher people's court also received and handled 228 
disputes and cases of various categories, involving 120 million 
yuan. 
<H5>  3. We Positively Conducted the Trial of Civil and </H5>
Administrative Cases, Protected Legitimate Rights and Interests 
of Citizens and Legal Entities, and Supervised and Safeguarded 
Administrative Organs To Do Administrative Work According to Laws 
  People's courts at all levels in the municipality received 
and handled a total of 23,070 civil cases of the first ruling, 
of which, 23,304 were concluded. With the implementation of the 
"General Principles for Civil Code of the PRC" and the "Law on 
Civil Procedures" as the central task, people's courts at all 
levels in the municipality comprehensively enforced the laws and 
policies on civil affairs, improved the methods of trying civil 
cases, and laid emphasis on trying the cases in the following 
aspects: They concluded the trying of 2,571 cases on real 
estate, 3,026 cases on debts payable, and 36 cases on labor 
disputes that were closely related to economic construction and 
the development of market economy, thus promoting the 
establishment and development of real estate, banking, and labor 
service markets. 
  Second, we meticulously tried and handled 11,857 cases on 
matrimonial and family disputes and protected the legitimate 
rights and interests of old people, women, and children, thus 
making many families more harmonious. Third, we appropriately 
handled 2,498 cases on damage compensation, land, and irrigation 
works, safeguarded the legitimate rights and interests of the 
persons concerned, and imposed sanctions upon the behaviors 
running counter to civil laws, thus promoting unity and 
stability and the building of the socialist spiritual 
civilization. Fourth, we continuously improved the forms to 
trying cases and gave full play to the role of persons concerned 
in providing evidence. Some people's courts also tried out the 
methods of "separating complicated cases from simple ones" and 
"opening court sessions directly," thus improving the quality 
and efficiency in trying cases. Some people's courts 
established real estate trying tribunals to resolve complicated 
or difficult real estate cases in a correct and timely manner. 
Fifth, we strengthened the work concerning the grass-roots 
people's courts and newly established six people's tribunals, so 
that the total number of people's tribunals throughout the 
municipality reaching 208. The vast numbers of cadres and 
policemen of people's tribunals fearlessly and persistently went 
down to rural areas, plants, and even households to handle cases 
on the spot, thus providing convenience for the masses to take 
legal proceedings. These cadres and policemen also positively 
guided the grass-roots units to regulate and organize work, thus 
resolving many contradictions and disputes of the grass-roots 
units in a timely manner. 
  People's courts at all levels in the municipality positively 
and prudently tried administrative cases. Last year, we 
received and tried 161 administrative cases of the first ruling, 
a drop of 2.43 percent from the previous year, and concluded the 
trying of 161 cases. Of these cases, 39.75 percent had the 
specific administrative behaviors of administrative organs 
maintained according to laws, 15.5 percent had their original 
penalty and court decisions canceled or changed, and 31.68 
percent had their lawsuits withdrawn by persons concerned. As a 
result, the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal 
entities, and other organizations were protected according to 
laws, the execution of functions and powers by administrative 
organs were supported and supervised, and the building of 
democracy and the legal system was promoted. In the course of 
trying cases, we vigorously conducted the administrative 
execution work. Based on the large scale and heavy task of 
rebuilding Tianjin's dangerous houses, which gave rise to more 
administrative disputes, some people's courts voluntarily went 
deep to real estate management and urban construction 
departments to conduct investigation and study and offer legal 
consultations and suggestions for key house rebuilding projects. 
People's courts also transferred some judicial personnel to the 
worksites of relocation projects to accept and handle the 
enforcement cases registered by administrative organs, and to 
resolve the problems existing in the administrative enforcement 
cases so as to protect the legitimate rights and interests of 
the relocated people and ensure the smooth progress of key house 
rebuilding projects. 
<H5>  4. We Actually Strengthened the Work of Lodging Lawsuits, </H5>
Appeal Against Legal Decisions, and Execution of Legal 
Decisions, Thus Safeguarding the Fairness and Dignity of the Law 
  People's courts at all levels in the municipality positively 
and boldly accepted and tried all kinds of new cases emerging in 
the development process of reform, opening up, and economic 
development and actually protected the concerned persons' rights 
to bring lawsuits against others and to appeal against legal 
decisions. We appropriately handled the disputes that tended to 
cause disturbances and that were revealed by the masses. We 
patiently attended to the work of persuasion and education, thus 
resolving contradictions and calming down incidents. Last year, 
we handled a total of 53,674 petitions from the masses and 
mediated and handled 464 simple disputes. We strengthened the 
functional role of judicial and supervisory departments, 
persisted in the principles of seeking truth from facts and 
correcting whatever was wrong. We conscientiously handled cases 
of appeal, maintained according to laws the cases whose original 
judgment was right, and corrected according to laws the cases 
whose original judgment was wrong. Last year, we concluded the 
trying of 1,520 appealing cases of various kinds, of which, 101 
had their judgment changed completely or partially. As a 
result, the fairness and dignity of laws were safeguarded. For 
those who unjustifiably kept appealing against court decisions, 
patient persuasion was given them to withdraw appeals and accept 
court decisions. We voluntarily invited people's congress 
deputies and members of Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference committees to attend court sessions as visitors and 
to inspect cases. We also listened to their opinions with an 
open mind and consciously accepted the supervision by the masses. 
  In order to overcome the "difficulties" encountered in the 
implementation of court judgments, the people's courts at all 
levels across the municipality adopted powerful measures to 
improve the implementation methods and to expand the 
implementation ways by proceeding from having people's courts 
serve economic construction. The municipal higher people's court 
established the tribunal last year in charge of implementing the 
court judgment, thus, it straightened out the relationship 
between higher and lower people's courts in the work of 
implementing the court judgment and enhanced the guidance and 
harmony over the implementation work. As for cases that exerted 
great influence and encountered great interference and 
difficulties in the implementation, these people's courts asked 
for instruction and reported them in a timely manner to the 
municipal party committee and the municipal people's congress as 
well as kept the municipal people's government informed of them 
in order to enhance the contacts with various circles and to 
obtain their understanding and support. The people's courts in 
some districts and counties actively launched a "campaign" in 
this regard and emphatically enhanced the work of handling the 
long-standing discrepancies in old cases that involved multiple 
links and faced great difficulties. By fostering the concept of 
taking the whole situation into consideration, they assisted 
outside people's courts to handle 94 cases. They also upheld 
the civilized implementation in this regard, put emphasis on the 
style and method of implementation, overcame and resisted local 
protectionism, and emphasized that no one is allowed to regard 
the withholding of hostages as a measure in implementation. The 
municipal higher people's court adequately mediated and handled 
10 incidents in which outside people's courts came to the 
municipality to deal with their cases by withholding the 
hostage. It also actively handled the incidents in which the 
cadres of the municipal people's courts were scolded and beaten 
in the implementation work or in taking legal proceedings. 
Thus, it dealt blows at the criminal activities that impaired 
the performance of official duties by upholding and promoting 
justice. Through the arduous efforts made by the broad masses 
of implementing personnel, the municipality received 5,951 cases 
in this regard in the year and handled and concluded 5,998 cases 
to show a 3.54 percent increase over 1992. It recovered 
42,514,800 yuan in funds involved in these cases. 
<H5>  5. We Strived To Be the First-Class Court of the Country and </H5>
Further Enhanced the Work of Self Reform and Improvement 
  A. We made efforts to strive to be the first-class court of 
the country. The municipal higher people's court put forward 
the fighting target of "striving to be a first-class court in 
the country through efforts in the next five years," at the 
forum of presidents of people's courts across the municipality 
last year. Thus, it unified the ideology and understanding of 
leading cadres at all levels and of the broad masses of cadres 
and policemen. Thus, a new situation in which all courts were 
learning from the advanced, finding out their gap, and 
vigorously catching up with the advanced, gradually took shape 
in the year. 
  B. We enhanced the construction of leading bodies. The 
leading bodies of people's courts at all levels across the 
municipality were generally reinforced and consolidated. A 
large number of cadres who are in the prime of life, have both 
ability and political integrity, and possess higher cultural 
standards, were selected and promoted to the leading posts of 
people's courts at all levels. The municipality vigorously 
grasped the improvement of work style and ideology among the 
leading bodies at all levels, upheld the democratic centralism, 
defined the duties among the staffers of leading bodies, 
enhanced the unity among the leading bodies, and upgraded their 
fighting strength. 
  C. We enhanced the reform in the systems of personnel 
affairs 
management. In selecting and employing cadres, the municipality 
paid attention to gradually introducing the competition and 
encouragement mechanism in this regard and actively explored the 
systems of personnel affairs management, in which cadres are 
capable of both higher and lower posts and the survival of 
cadres will be of the fittest. It also upheld the principle of 
integrating the material interest with the administrative 
achievements and contributions of cadres and policemen and 
formulated the adequate criterion of appraising achievements and 
the methods of awarding and punishing personnel. All of these 
played an active role in awarding the superior, punishing the 
inferior, and arousing enthusiasm. 
  D. The construction of contingents focused on improving 
administrative honesty was strengthened. The education on 
improvement of administrative honesty was vigorously 
strengthened. According to the central discipline inspection 
commission's five regulations on leading cadres' administrative 
honesty and self-discipline and the supreme people's court's 
circular on strengthening the improvement of administrative 
honesty, we worked out and perfected the measures and systems 
for improvement of administrative honesty, concentrated efforts 
on consolidating the problems of establishing personnel contacts 
cropping up in the course of handling cases, generally examined 
the enforcement of laws and disciplines, and realistically 
solved the problems of not strictly enforcing laws. We strictly 
investigated and handled 14 cases of 15 court cadres violating 
laws and disciplines and actively corrected the practice of 
accepting bail for probation. To stop producing new corrosive 
phenomena and unhealthy practices, the municipal higher court 
worked out and revised "several regulations on leading cadres at 
various levels opposing corruption and advocating administrative 
honesty" and "the system of responsibility for the wrong 
handling of cases." The number 1 criminal court that won the 
collective merit citation as well as some advanced examples in 
doing solid and arduous work and making selfless sacrifice, 
including the national court model Liu Shanlin, were commended 
in a timely manner. 
  E. The improvement of professional ability and 
standardizations was strengthened. Eleven training classes for 
more than 800 cadres and policemen were organized. Through 
vigorous investigation and study, a preliminary investigation 
and study network was set up in the municipal court department. 
More than 50 reports on investigation and study findings were 
applied by the state science and technology commission, the 
supreme court, the leading organs under the municipal party 
committee, and relevant publications. The study on the new 
situation and new problems relating to the judicial work was 
strengthened. The municipal higher court convened 20 symposiums 
of various types and worked out 13 documents guiding the 
judicial work. 
  In the past year, although the people's courts at various 
levels across the municipality made appropriate achievements, 
some problems still remained. The major indicators were that 
some leading cadres and judicial personnel were not suitable to 
the development of the socialist market economic system in terms 
of their understanding and law enforcement levels. Some cases 
were not handled in a high quality manner and longer periods of 
time were spent on hearing some cases. The new categories of 
cases and the new situation cropping up in the course of 
developing the socialist market economy were not extensively 
investigated and studied. Some weak links in the management of 
contingents and the improvement of administrative honesty still 
existed. The cadres and policemen's political integrity and 
professional abilities needed to be further improved. These 
problems should conscientiously be solved and improved in the 
future. 
  Fellow deputies: 
  Along with the setup of the socialist market economic system 
and the socialist legal system, a large number of new laws will 
be formulated this year. There will be increasingly more cases 
to be directly heard by the people's courts. The judicial work 
tasks will become heavier. The people's courts at various 
levels across the municipality should take Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building a socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as a guidance; conscientiously implement the 
guidelines of the national political and legal work conference, 
the national meeting of higher court presidents, and the second 
(enlarged) plenary session of the sixth municipal party 
committee; further strengthen and reform the people's court work 
to meet the requirements for setting up the socialist market 
economic system; persist in the strategic principle of "taking a 
two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough;" 
strictly enforce laws; improve the law enforcement levels; go 
all out to maintain social stability; promote the improvement of 
administrative honesty; and provide legal guarantees and service 
for speeding up the municipality's reform, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  In the new year, the people's courts at various levels 
across 
the municipality should closely rely on the leadership of the 
party committees at various levels, consciously accept 
supervision by the people's congresses and the masses, do their 
duties, bravely do pioneering work, work arduously, strive to be 
first-grade courts in the country, bring into full play the 
trial functions, and make new contributions to stabilizing 
society and accelerating the municipality's reform, opening up, 
and economic construction.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 10 (XINHUA) -- A housing 
construction project is now in full swing in north China's 
Tianjin city in an effort to let more low-income families move 
into better apartments and more than 750 households with housing 
difficulty have already moved into new homes since mid-March. 
  According to an urban housing official, the city government 
earmarked 100 million yuan to build a number of living complexes 
last year. 
  These houses were mainly sold at a price rate 30 percent 
lower than market prices to urban residents who have an average 
living space per capita of less than four square meters. 
  As part of the project, the design of these apartment 
buildings stresses practical, multi-functional living facilities. 
  This year, another three million square meters of such 
housing will be built in urban areas, the official said. 
  Talking about the rebuilding and repair of old and dangerous 
houses, the official said, more than 83,000 homes in Tianjin 
have benefited from such projects since the year 1987. 
  Together with the newly-built apartment houses, the city's 
average living space per capita now has jumped to 6.9 square 
meters from 3.3 square meters in 1978, although this is still 
much lower than the country's urban average. 
  While focusing on expansion of average living space, the 
official said, the city also has made great efforts to improve 
the living environment. 
  Every newly-built living complex or living quarters now is 
equipped with fine water, heat and electrical supply facilities, 
he said. 
  Emphasis has also been placed on green land as part of 
housing planning. In one living complex with a population of 
51,000 residents, for example, the average per capita area of 
green space reaches 1.76 square meters. 
  "We cannot let the common residents March into the 21st 
century in shabby and dangerous homes," said city Mayor Zhang 
Lichang. 
  Following the countrywide campaign to improve the living 
conditions of low income families, the municipal government also 
framed a better-off-housing program last year. 
  It planned to spend three years or more to build more than 
10 
million square meters of apartment houses equipped with advanced 
living facilities. 
  And within the coming five or seven years, nearly 10 million 
square meters of dangerous and shabby housing in the downtown 
area will be replaced by new houses and new financial and 
business centers. 
  At the same time, about 25 million square meters of new 
housing would be added, and the average living space would reach 
eight square meters, the urban housing official said. 
  The program has started to take effect. The design work of 
four living complexes has already been completed and ground has 
been broken for the construction of 1.65 million square meters 
of housing this year. 
  According to the official, an estimated investment in the 
better-off-housing project totals about 15 billion yuan. 
  To attract more funds, both domestic and overseas, the city 
government will improve the management of land for housing 
construction. And the building materials will be supplied at 
government-set prices. 
  The same preferential policies will be offered to overseas 
investors, according to the official. 
  In 1993, overseas investment in housing construction reached 
700 million U.S. dollars. 
  And the amount the city received in the first two months 
this 
year topped 500 million U.S. dollars. 
  According to an urban construction planning official, the 
better-off project is a comprehensive one involving the 
residents' views on living style, their real income and many 
other management problems of urban development. 
  And Tianjin is ready to take measures to reform the current 
housing system and further expand the real estate market in 
order to quicken the pace of the housing drive.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Hu Jintao, member of 
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central 
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), today stressed 
the necessity of applying the theory of Deng Xiaoping on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics in solving 
practical problems. 
  At the opening session of the third high-ranking official 
class for studying Deng's works, Hu, who is the president of the 
Central Party school, said there may be many new situations, new 
contradictions and new problems that need to be solved this year 
as the country will produce a series of major reform measures 
covering a wide range of areas in breadth and depth that is 
unprecedented in history. 
  He said that it is essential to handle well the relations 
among reform, development and stability and the organic 
integration of the three aspects of work will ensure a 
sustainable, fast and healthy development of the economy and 
maintain stability in the process of development. 
  Hu also stressed the importance of doing well in promoting 
socialist culture and ethics, saying that "the heavier the 
tasks, the more complicated the situation and the more 
contradictions there are, the greater attention we should pay to 
promoting socialist culture and ethics, to arming the people 
with scientific theories, inculcating into the minds of the 
people with lofty ideals and encouraging them with fine works. 
  He urged the leading officials attending the class to make 
an 
in-depth study of such problems of how to carry on with the 
anti-corruption struggle, crack down on criminal activities and 
strengthen the building of clean government. 
  He drew particular attention to such problems as how to 
strengthen and improve party leadership and party building and 
how to better display the central role of the Communist Party in 
reform and the modernization drive under the conditions of a 
market economy. 
  Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC 
Central Committee, presided over the session.

  [Text] Haikou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Peng Peiyun, State 
Councillor and minister in charge of State Family Planning 
Commission, recently called for enhancing family planning, 
medical and public health work in the rural areas. 
  In her recent inspection tour in Hainan Province, Peng said 
that although Hainan has achieved progress in population control 
in the past three years, the tendency of fast growth of the 
population in the province remains in the province. 
  She said that the leaders at various level should realize 
the 
arduousness of the task of the family planning. 
  She said that under the condition of establishing socialist 
market structure, it is one of the functions of the government 
in controlling the growth of population. 
  She said that the viewpoint of controlling population growth 
with market regulation cannot meet the demands of China's 
population plan. 
  She urged the grass-root units in Hainan to enhance family 
planning work by integrating the work with economic development 
in rural areas. 
  Peng also affirmed Hainan's methods in introducing funds, 
talents and technology in the development of public health 
services. 
  She called for setting up medical and public health work in 
rural areas as one of key works and solving the problems in 
public health work.

the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling 
activities, recently pointed out at the third meeting of the 
national leading group for cracking down on smuggling activities 
that the nationwide struggle against smuggling has achieved 
success in the past period, and that launching the struggle 
against smuggling in a persistent and deep-going manner and 
preventing a resurgence of smuggling activities would be the 
main tasks for this year. 
  Since last August, various locales in the country have 
launched a large-scale joint struggle against smuggling 
activities and have punished a number of lawbreakers who engaged 
in smuggling. In the past six months, authorities in various 
locales of the country have investigated and handled more than 
12,000 smuggling cases involving a total of 2.64 billion yuan. 
  Li Lanqing pointed out: In this year's struggle against 
smuggling, we should strengthen the leadership over the struggle 
against smuggling. We should concentrate our efforts on 
cracking down on specific cases in light of some serious issues 
of smuggling, and we should consider the struggle against 
smuggling to be an important part of the struggle against 
corruption and should grasp the work ceaselessly.

"Severely Punish Lawbreakers Who Mob and Beat Up Price 
Inspectors"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- Since 1983, when the 
State Council gave the go-ahead to the establishment of price 
inspection organs, the vast number of price inspectors have 
performed their duties honestly, cautiously, and conscientiously 
and have enforced the law strictly and impartially, thus playing 
an important role in advancing reform, promoting development, 
and preserving stability. The work of price inspection 
departments has won praise from all sectors of society and the 
public. The party and government have fully affirmed and highly 
valued their work. 
  Price inspection departments are law-enforcement 
administrative departments of the government, and price 
inspectors exercise their functions on behalf of the state. All 
enterprises and individuals engaged in production or business 
and administrative units or institutions that charge fees are 
subject to inspection without exception. Taken together, the 
overwhelming majority of units and individuals that are subject 
to inspections are supportive of and cooperative toward price 
inspections. There are, however, indeed a handful of units and 
individuals -- privately run enterprises and self-employed 
industrial and commercial entities in particular -- who 
interfere with, obstruct, or even refuse to be inspected. Some 
even threaten, abuse, mob, and beat up inspectors. The incident 
in Xinzhou city, Shanxi Province, in which price inspectors were 
mobbed and beaten up shows how lacking is awareness of the law 
among this handful of units and individuals. Some people 
declare that because prices have been deregulated, they are free 
to set their own prices, free to cheat and hustle consumers by 
any means, and free from government supervision and price 
inspection. They are greatly mistaken. 
  Obstructing price inspectors from carrying out their 
official 
duties is a rather prominent problem today. Governments and 
departments concerned at all levels must take it seriously and 
pay close attention. Article 34 of the "Provisions of the 
People's Republic of China Concerning Price Inspection" 
provides: When a party refuses to permit or obstructs price 
inspectors from carrying out their duties according to the law, 
he shall be punished by a public security department pursuant to 
the provisions of the "Regulations Governing Offenses Against 
Public Order of the People's Republic of China"; in cases of 
gross violation or when a crime has resulted, the judicial 
department shall investigate the party's criminal responsibility 
according to the law. Governments and departments concerned at 
all levels must take immediate, effective action to protect the 
personal safety of price inspectors and ensure the smooth 
progress of the general price inspection.

  [Text] On the morning of 11 April, the work team of the 
State Council, which comes to Liaoning to conduct mass 
inspection over commodity prices, listened to the province's 
work briefing on price inspection. Wen Shizhen, member of the 
provincial party standing committee and executive vice governor 
of the province, briefed the State Council's price inspection 
team on the province's economic situation and price inspection 
work on behalf of the provincial people's government. Vice 
Governor Wen Shizhen said: The province's present level of 
general commodity prices is fine. However, prices for the means 
of production show a faster increase and the rise and fall of 
prices for products turned out by the state-owned enterprises is 
relatively large. Enterprises are being heavily affected by the 
prices of material supplies. If we fail to improve the 
situation in a timely manner, it will adversely affect the 
social stability and the improvement of the people's lives. He 
said: The market economy has set forth new demands for shifting 
the governmental function. Departments in charge of commodity 
prices at all levels should enhance the market calculation while 
grasping the macroeconomic readjustment and control in a timely 
manner, report on time the fluctuation in commodity prices, and 
perform their bound duties to make the economy prosperous and 
improve people's lives. 
  During the briefing Hao Dechun, deputy director of the 
provincial price bureau, also delivered a speech in which he 
said: After the telephone conference sponsored by the State 
Council and the provincial people's government on making work 
arrangements for price mass inspection on 7 March, the people's 
governments of various cities have attached great importance on 
the arrangements; gone into action rapidly; and earnestly 
implemented the arrangements. Thus, a certain momentum and 
scope in the price inspection work have been built up. We will 
conduct concentrated inspection in a shorter period to correct 
the prominent price violations throughout the province and to 
ensure the mass inspection work to score periodical results in 
June this year. The work team of the State Council, which comes 
to the province to conduct price mass inspection, will spend 
more than 10 days on carrying out practical inspections.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Li Xiaoshi, former 
vice-minister of the State Commission of Science and Technology 
(SCST), was sentenced today to 20 years in prison with his 
political rights deprived for four years for taking bribes and 
for embezzlement. 
  This verdict was given in the final ruling by the Beijing 
Higher People's Court. 
  Li, 53, successively held posts of division chief, bureau 
director, deputy director of the Hubei Provincial Commission of 
Science and Technology, president and editor-in-chief of THE 
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY and vice-minister. 
  When the Beijing-based Changcheng (Great Wall) Machinery and 
Electronics Scientific and Technological Industry Company began 
its illegal fund raising activities last year, Li made an 
immediate positive written comment and instructed his staffers 
to support the activities. 
  Li immediately went to the Changcheng Company himself, and 
left with a note of encouragement. 
  Li's words were later made use of by Shen Taifu, then 
president of the Changcheng Company, for his illegal fund 
raising. 
  Li kept advertising for Shen Taifu in similar ways on many 
public occasions. Shen was also eager to reward him for his 
"service." 
  On March 4, 1993, a SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DAILY reporter 
signed a 40,000 yuan contract on technology development with the 
Changcheng Company in the name of Li Xiaoshi's son and gave the 
money to Li Xiaoshi. 
  Li kept the money and took the contract to his office, 
locking it in an iron safe. 
  After Shen Taifu was arrested, Li realized the predicament 
he 
was in and asked the reporter to take away the contract. 
  When he was inquired about this matter by the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission of the Communist Party, Li 
denied involvement. 
  Li reached an agreement with his wife that she shoulder all 
the responsibilities in further inquiries. 
  More clues implicating Li in other criminal practices were 
also discovered during the investigation. 
  Li became acquainted with a Hong Kong couple in Guangdong 
three years ago and offered business opportunities to them. Li 
received 5,000 Hong Kong dollars and 1,000 U.S. dollars in 
bribes for his offer. 
  In 1991, Li used his position to help a Beijing 
Refrigeration 
Equipment Company. The next year, Li asked the company to 
install an air conditioner worth 3,500 yuan for him without 
paying a cent. 
  In 1990, a unit published a full page advertisement in the 
newspaper at 20,000 yuan when Li was its president and 
editor-in-chief. The money was pocketed by Li. 
  The Beijing Intermediate People's Court issued its first 
ruling on March 4 this year after a long and careful trial. The 
court ruled that Li was found guilty and should be sentenced to 
15 years of imprisonment with his political rights deprived for 
three years and part of his personal property confiscated for 
taking bribes; and seven years in prison with his political 
rights deprived for one year for embezzlement. 
  Li lodged an appeal afterwards to the Beijing Higher 
People's 
Court, which rejected his appeal and upheld the original 
sentence.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Shen Taifu, president 
of the former Beijing-based Changcheng (Great Wall) Machinery 
and Electronics Scientific and Technological Industry Company, 
was executed this morning on charges of corruption and bribery 
worth more than three million yuan. 
  The death sentence was passed by the Intermediate People's 
Court of Beijing, upheld by the city's higher court at the final 
hearing of the case, and confirmed by the Supreme People's Court. 
  Shen, 39, was also deprived of his political rights for 
life. 
  Li Xiaoshi, a former vice-minister of the State Scientific 
and Technological Commission, who was implicated in the case, 
was jailed for 20 years, with his political rights revoked for 
four years. 
  According to an announcement by the supreme court, Shen's 
accomplice and wife Sun Jihong, 40, was sentenced to 15 years' 
imprisonment. She was vice-president and head of the accounting 
department of Changcheng, which was ordered closed in the second 
half of last year. 
  On March 2, 1993, Shen Taifu and Sun Jihong withdrew one 
million yuan in cash from the company's fund-raising department, 
then deposited it into Sun's personal bank account. 
  On February 21 and 22, 1993, Shen filled in two receipts for 
one million yuan each, allegedly to pay for patent commissions. 
  With one of the receipts he drew one million yuan in cash 
from the Shenzhen Taifu Company, and then asked You Chengshun, 
the head of this subsidiary company of Changcheng's, to use the 
other receipt to reimburse the same amount of cash. 
  In March of the same year, Shen managed to persuade others 
to 
pass a decision before the Changcheng board of directors 
exclusively for his own benefit -- for every transaction he 
concluded, he would be entitled to a 10 percent patent 
commission. 
  To cover up the trick, Shen had the decision affixed with 
the 
date "January 4, 1993" -- about two months before its adoption. 
  To facilitate the illegal fund-raising by Changcheng and its 
subsidiaries from 1989 to March 1993, Shen gave out bribes 
amounting to 255,791.9 yuan, in cash or in kind, to Li Xiaoshi 
as well as to 11 other state functionaries. 
  The eleven have all been prosecuted for receiving bribes or 
for negligence of duty. Some of these people -- a government 
official at the deputy bureau director level, four reporters, 
three bank clerks and three retired accountants -- will be dealt 
with in cases connected with Shen's illegal fund raising. 
  On March 4, 1994, the Intermediate Court of Beijing 
sentenced 
Shen Taifu to death and all his personal property was 
confiscated. Sun Jihong was sentenced to 15 years in jail and 
deprived of her political rights for three years. 
  At the final or second hearing later, the Higher Court of 
Beijing upheld the intermediate court's sentences and rejected 
their appeals. 
  On April 8, 1994, the supreme court confirmed the validity 
of 
Shen's death sentence. Acting on an order issued by the 
president of the supreme court, the Intermediate Court of 
Beijing carried out the death sentence today. 
  Li Xiaoshi, 53, was found guilty of receiving 52,690 yuan in 
bribes and pocketing 20,000 yuan in public money while serving 
as vice-minister of the commission. 
  On March 4, 1994, the Intermediate Court of Beijing 
sentenced 
him to 20 years' imprisonment with his political rights revoked 
for four years and part of his personal property confiscated. 
  Li also pleaded not guilty. However, the Beijing higher 
court rejected his appeal and upheld the sentence. 
  At a press conference this afternoon, Liu Jiachen, 
vice-president of the Supreme People's Court, accused Shen Taifu 
of pocketing three million yuan in funds he had raised, 
allegedly to develop machinery and electronics technology. 
  The vice-president advised state functionaries, especially 
those with power, to learn proper lessons from the cases of Shen 
Taifu and Li Xiaoshi.

<F P=106> ["Report from Shanghai" by special correspondent Li Hsi-ping </F>
(2621 6007 1627): "Those Imprisoned in Relation to the 4 June 
Incident Are Warned Not To Get Together or Get In touch With 
Reporters From Outside the Mainland"] 
  [Text] As there is only a bit more than one month before 
the fifth anniversary of the 4 June Incident, the mainland 
authorities have been tightening control over dissidents. Those 
who were jailed for being involved in the 1989 pro-democracy 
movement yesterday received oral warnings from the department 
concerned, and some more famous dissidents were under closer 
supervision around their houses. 
  Sources in Beijing said that, because the CPC top leadership 
once again issued an instruction to the department concerned on 
strictly exercising control over pro-democracy activists in 
order to "stabilize" the social environment, beginning 
yesterday, the public security and state security organs on the 
mainland took action to control the activities of those who 
participated in the pro-democracy movement in 1989. The 
measures included that of not allowing them to get to touch with 
reporters from outside the mainland and not allowing them to get 
together in any form. Some dissidents who always kept a low 
profile, such as Bao Zunxin and Zhou Duo, were also put under 
close supervision. Bao Zunxin said that this was "quite 
baffling." 
  The sources also said that today's action would last until 
late June, and strict supervision over pro-democracy activists 
would also be conducted in other cities in order to prevent some 
people from trying to hold activities of commemorating the fifth 
anniversary of the 4 June Incident. 
  Reportedly, the authorities demanded that the local 
authorities concerned guarantee that no mistake would occur in 
the next two months, and that they would immediately report to 
Beijing if any trouble occurred.

  [Excerpt] Yesterday, as noted dissident Wei Jingsheng was 
reportedly treated inhumanely during a period of "surveillance 
and investigation," the United States expressed -- for the third 
time -- its concern over his arrest, but China strongly warned 
that the United States should not involve itself in the incident. 
  Wei Ling, the younger sister of Wei Jingsheng, said during 
an 
interview with a foreign press agency yesterday that the 
authorities had on many occasions hinted to Wei Jingsheng's 
family that there might be some problems with Wei's health, and 
this made people worry that Wei Jingsheng had been inhumanely 
treated while being "kept under surveillance at a certain place." 
  She said: "They told my father it was necessary for them to 
give my elder brother a health check-up. However, he was in 
good health before he was arrested." 
  Wei Ling worried that the doctors in the prison might do 
harm 
to her elder brother. 
  However, when she was answering MING PAO reporter's 
questions, Wei Ling said she knew nothing about her elder 
brother. She only said that she thought it was possible that 
Wei Jingsheng's secretary, Tong Yi, might be sentenced to 
imprisonment, and it was even more possible that Wei Jingsheng 
would be sentenced to imprisonment, because this had already 
been implied in some statements made by public security 
departments. [passage omitted]

  [Text] This reporter has made inquiries with the relevant 
authorities in Beijing and learned that MING PAO reporter Xi 
Yang was simply not engaged in normal reporting, nor did he 
"mistakenly enter the forbidden zone." What he was involved in 
was criminal activity of spying and stealing state secrets. The 
Beijing Intermediate People's Court has handed down the 
second-instance judgment according to law and given Xi Yang a 
sentence of 12 years, with deprivation of political rights for 
two years. Because Xi Yang had admitted his guilt and showed 
repentance, the court handed down a light sentence according to 
the law when considering the penalty. 
  The relevant authorities noted: During the period June and 
July 1993, Xi Yang repeatedly spied and stole state financial 
and economic secrets through bank clerk Tian Ye, the other 
defendant in the case; and passed all this secret material and 
information to MING PAO in Hong Kong for publication, causing 
serious economic losses to the state. The court was convinced 
that Xi Yang had committed the crime of spying and stealing 
state secrets, and his case was extremely serious. 
  According to the "Supplementary Stipulations Concerning 
Punishment of the Crime of Disclosing State Secrets" as well as 
Clause 1, Article 51 of the "Criminal Law of the PRC," criminals 
like Xi Yang who steal state secrets can be given a jail term of 
10 years or more, life imprisonment, or even the death penalty, 
with deprivation of political rights. In consideration of the 
fact that Xi Yang had already admitted his guilt and showed 
repentance, the court gave him a light sentence of 12 years with 
deprivation of political rights for two years. According to 
relevant stipulations, if he refuses to accept the court's 
judgment, a defendant can appeal within 10 days after receiving 
the court's verdict. It is learned that Xi Yang has appealed. 
According to the "Law on Criminal Cases," cases involving state 
secrets will not be open to the public. Since the Xi Yang case 
involves state secrets, there will not be a public trial. 
  The relevant authorities in Beijing rejected suggestions 
that 
Xi Yang "mistakenly entered the forbidden zone," for Xi Yang was 
simply not engaged in normal news-gathering. The fact that Xi 
Yang is the only one to get into trouble among thousands of Hong 
Kong reporters who have been to Mainland China on reporting 
assignments since last year demonstrates that the line between 
normal reporting and criminal activities of spying and stealing 
state secrets is clearly drawn. Hong Kong reporters' normal 
reporting activities are fully protected.

  [Text] Beijing 11 Apr (XINHUA)--Not long ago, this 
reporter visited the responsible personnel at the Beijing 
Municipal State Security Bureau, the Municipal People's 
Procuratorate branch, and the Municipal Intermediate People's 
Court to inquire about Xi Yang's case, the trial process, and 
related conditions. These individuals indicated that Xi Yang 
spied on and stole state banking and economic secrets. This was 
proved by solid evidence and confessed to by Xi Yang himself. 
Xi Yang's crime was very serious. However, in view of the fact 
that he confessed his crime and repented, in the first trial on 
28 March, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People' Court ruled 
on the case and meted out a light sentence, sentencing Xi Yang 
to 12 years in prison and depriving him of political rights for 
two years. Xi Yang did not accept the judgment and has filed an 
appeal. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court has 
already transferred the case to Beijing Municipal Higher 
People's Court for the second trial, which is currently underway. 
  According to the briefings, the 38-year-old Xi Yang, a 
native 
of Jiangsu's Taicang County, was transferred from an Army unit 
to a civilian post in May 1983. Between April 1984 and June 
1992, he was a reporter with the XINTIYU [NEW SPORTS] journal 
under the jurisdiction of the State Physical Culture and Sports 
Commission. Later he was deputy director of the editorial 
department of JIANKANG ZHIYOU [FRIEND of HEALTH] under the 
aforesaid journal. In June 1992, Xi Yang left for Hong Kong 
because he had inherited property from his grandfather there. 
In August of the same year, he was employed as a reporter for 
the China page of Hong Kong's MING PAO daily. According to Xi 
Yang's confession, in view of the fact that he had worked and 
lived in Beijing for many years, MING PAO specifically 
designated him to constantly conduct activities in Beijing. In 
June and July of 1993, Xi Yang was active in Beijing under the 
pretext of covering the Sino-British talks and the founding of 
the Preliminary Work Committee for the Preparatory Committee for 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. In actual fact, he 
was not a bit interested in covering the topic that was 
registered on his application; rather, he focused his energy on 
establishing ties, doing his utmost to pry into major state 
banking and financial secrets based on the requirements of a 
responsible person from MING PAO, and according a "plan" 
formulated beforehand. He did not submit applications for news 
coverage to the related departments according to the 
regulations, but resorted to illegitimate means and incited his 
friend Tian Ye, an employee of the People's Bank of China, to 
steal and provide him with voluminous state banking and 
financial secrets, which included an unpublished People's Bank 
of China deposit and loan interest modification plan, the bank's 
secret policy decision on participating in the international 
gold trade, and other important secrets. Instigated by Xi Yang, 
Tian Ye stole an important document marked "secret," which he 
delivered to Xi Yang so he could make a photocopy. Based on the 
requirements of MING PAO, Xi Yang wrote an article based on the 
stolen state banking and financial secrets and delivered it to 
MING PAO for publication. As a result, the compromise of these 
secrets has had serious consequences for the national economy. 
  Reports have indicated that Xi Yang and Tian Ye acted 
surreptitiously when carrying out the above-mentioned 
activities. To avoid attention, they did not meet at the Jianguo 
Hotel, where Xi Yang was staying, but often met on a street 
corner; they did not shake hands when they met, nor did they bid 
one another farewell when they parted. On 31 July, Tian Ye 
arranged a meeting with Xi Yang through a pager, and at 
approximately 1700 that afternoon, they met in the street east 
if Beijing's Changan Mall, where Tian Ye nervously told Xi Yang 
that the People's Bank of China was investigating the incident 
of MING PAO's publication of state banking and economic secrets. 
Xi Yang said to Tian Ye: "We are the only ones who know about 
each other; there should not be any trouble." "I will not 
betray my friend." "When you have things in the future, do not 
use the phone, use the pager to contact me as much as possible." 
Xi Yang also suggested that, when Tian Ye goes to work on 
Monday, 2 August, Xi Yang would call Tian Ye through the pager, 
and if Tian Ye is okay, he should call back through the beeping 
pager, to say he is safe. Xi Yang also said some words to 
comfort Tian Ye. Thereafter, Xi Yang used the pager and the 
telephone many times to ask whether Tian Ye "had any trouble." 
A relevant person from the Beijing Municipal State Security 
Bureau said: Facts have indicated that Xi Yang and Tian Ye 
themselves knew that what they were doing was using illegal 
means to steal and spy on state banking and economic secrets, 
that their behavior had violated the state criminal code. 
Furthermore, Xi Yang also admitted "knowingly breaking the law" 
in his repentant letter, in which he pleaded guilty." Therefore 
it was never a case of "mistakenly trespassing into a restricted 
zone" as alleged by Hong Kong's MING PAO and others. After the 
incident took place, MING PAO repeatedly asked Xi Yang to return 
to Hong Kong as soon as possible, and this indicated that MING 
PAO also knew about the nature of the incident. This case is 
purely a criminal case and is not related to normal news 
gathering activities by reporters. Since last year, more than 
1,000 Hong Kong reporters have gone to the interior to cover 
news, and no problem of this kind has emerged, except with Xi 
Yang. We can see that the boundary between normal interviews 
conducted by reporters and illegal stealing and spying on state 
secrets is very clear and understandable to Hong Kong reporters. 
  According to reports, the Beijing Municipal State Security 
Bureau deemed that Xi Yang was suspected of jeopardizing state 
security and violating the "PRC State Security Law." Therefore, 
it summoned him in accordance with the law on 27 September 1993 
and detained him in accordance with the law on 28 September 
1993. On 7 October of the same year, with approval from Beijing 
Municipal People's Sub-Procuratorate, the security bureau placed 
him under arrest. Article 4 of the "State Security Law" 
stipulates that "any organization or individual who carry out 
behavior which jeopardizes the state security of the PRC must be 
prosecuted by the law," and "stealing, spying on, purchasing, 
and illegally providing secrets" are behaviors which jeopardize 
state security. Tian Ye was also detained and arrested in 
accordance with the law. After investigating in the case, the 
Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau handed it over to 
Beijing Municipal People's Sub-Procuratorate on 23 September 
1993. After investigating in the case, the Beijing Municipal 
People's Sub-Procuratorate instituted proceedings at the Beijing 
Municipal Intermediate People's Court on 14 December 1993. The 
Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court sent copies of the 
prosecution letters to Xi Yang and Tian Ye, and told them that, 
as the accused, they have the right to defend themselves, and 
may hire defense attorneys for this purpose. Xi Yang and Tian 
Ye both said they did not want to hire anyone but would defend 
themselves in court. According to Article 111 of the PRC 
Criminal Procedure Law, "the people's courts shall conduct the 
adjudication of cases in the first instance in public. However, 
cases involving state secrets or the private affairs of 
individuals are not to be heard in public." The cases of Xi 
Yang and Tian Ye involved state secrets, therefore, in 
accordance with the law, the court did not try them in public. 
  During the trial process, Xi Yang pleaded guilty and 
repented for his crime. In the Statement of Confession and 
Repentance, he himself wrote: "The fact that I violated the law 
has caused undue losses to the state's economy and has brought 
undue interference to the state's current policy of 
macroeconomic regulation and control. As a Chinese citizen who 
lived on the mainland for many years, I committed the above 
illegal offense which has caused such a loss to State interests, 
and the nature of this problem is serious." 
  After trying the case, the court maintained on the basis of 
verifying the facts that Xi Yang, in disregard of state laws and 
regulations on news coverage, pried into and stole state banking 
and financial secrets and published them in Hong Kong's MING 
PAO, thus violating the national criminal code. According to 
the Supplementary Provisions on Punishment for Those Committing 
the Crime of Releasing State Secrets, "one who steals, pries 
into, buys, or illegally supplies state secrets to a foreign 
establishment, organization, or person is to be given, where the 
case is serious, a prison term of 10 years or more, life 
imprisonment, or the death penalty and will be deprived of his 
political rights." A person in charge of the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court pointed out: Xi Yang's crime was 
particularly serious. Considering the comparatively good 
attitude of Xi Yang, who pleaded guilty and repented for his 
crime, the court leniently sentenced him at the first trial to a 
term of 12 years in prison and deprived him of his political 
rights for two years in accordance with the law. Tian Ye also 
had a comparatively good attitude and was leniently sentenced to 
a term of 15 years in prison and has been deprived of his 
political rights for three years. The penalty meted out to them 
is appropriate. On 28 March 1994, the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court announced in public their 
first-trial sentences and immediately sent the notices of 
judgment to Xi Yang and Tian Ye. According to the PRC Criminal 
Procedure Law, they could lodge an appeal within 10 days after 
the second day of receiving the notice of judgment. Tian Ye did 
not do so, while Xi Yang, who did not accept the first-trial 
sentence, did lodge an appeal. The Xi Yang case has now been 
passed to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court for a 
second trial. 
  The person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate 
People's Court stressed: The principle we follow is that we 
base our cases on facts and use the law as the criteria. Xi 
Yang's crime is supported by irrefutable facts. Moreover, he 
pleaded guilty himself. This is something that no one can 
reverse. Reporters' normal news coverage is completely 
different from prying into and stealing state secrets. The law 
forbids obstinately equating the criminal act of prying into and 
stealing state secrets as normal news coverage. Trying to 
confuse the public by saying that black is white will not work 
in China or any other country.

  [Text] Hong Kong 8 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)-- Hong Kong 
MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, who was found guilty of stealing 
state secrets, was sentenced to 12 years in prison in the first 
trial at the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court not 
long ago. When the news spread, it was understandable that Hong 
Kong residents showed great concern over the case. However, 
some people have taken action before they have acquired a clear 
picture of the case, and a small handful of people who want to 
stir up trouble have taken advantage of the incident to attack 
the Chinese Government, repeating the slogan that "Xi Yang is 
innocent' and demanding that the authorities "release Xi Yang." 
Consequently, this has posed a serious question: Is Xi Yang 
guilty or not guilty? 
<H5>  The Irrefutable Facts of Xi Yang's Crime </H5>
  Xi Yang was detained by the PRC State Security Authorities 
in 
accordance with the law on 27 September 1993 and was officially 
apprehended on 7 October 1993, with the Beijing Municipal 
People's Procuratorate's approval. On 28 March this year, he 
was found guilty of "stealing and prying into secret information 
of the state" in the first trial at the Beijing Municipal 
Intermediate People's Court and was sentenced to 12 years in 
prison and was deprived of political rights for two years. 
  What crimes have Xi Yang committed? In actual fact, in the 
wake of Xi Yang's apprehension, the relevant PRC departments 
somewhat published the facts of his crimes. On the very day 
that Xi Yang was detained, XINHUA sent a dispatch, saying that 
Xi Yang "was detained for stealing and spying on state financial 
secrets in violation of the PRC State Security Law." On the 
very day that Xi Yang was officially apprehended, XINHUA gave a 
truthful report on the criminal facts regarding Xi Yang. The 
report indicated: "Xi Yang engaged in stealing and gathering 
our state banking secrets, with conclusive evidence of his 
activities. The banking secrets stolen by Xi Yang included an 
unpublished People's Bank of China deposit and loan interest 
modification plan, its secret policy decision on participating 
in the international gold trade, and other important secrets. 
The compromise of these secrets has had serious consequences. 
The state security organs have obtained conclusive evidence of 
activity which jeopardizes state security." 
  Everyone knows that XINHUA is China's national news agency, 
and the information it dispatches is authoritative. Under the 
prerequisite that no state secrets are to be revealed, the news 
agency had already revealed the content and consequences of Xi 
Yang's case specifically enough. In addition, according to the 
XINHUA report, "Xi Yang has confessed to behavior endangering 
state security"; at the same time, Xi Yang's employer, MING PAO 
enterprise president Mr. Yu Ping-hai acknowledged in Beijing 
that Xi Yang "violated PRC Law" in his news gathering 
activities, and openly "apologized to the relevant authorities." 
  The above clearly showed that Xi Yang has truly violated 
China's penal code, and he has been found guilty. It is very 
important to clarify whether Xi Yang is guilty or not guilty, 
which is a prerequisite. As long as we have a clear picture of 
the facts of Xi Yang's crime and see that his criminal behavior 
has already resulted in serious economic losses to the state, 
people will not disregard the solemnity of the law based on 
their sympathy for Xi Yang. 
<H5>  Who Was Actually Being "Lawless"? </H5>
  An extremely small handful of people, who have always been 
hostile to the Chinese Government, intentionally threw mud at 
China and misled the public. They attacked the Chinese 
Government for being "lawless" in handling Xi Yang's case. 
However, the facts are simply the contrary. 
  The truth is that Xi Yang violated the PRC criminal code. 
This being the case, it is natural for the relevant Chinese 
law-enforcement department to conduct the investigation, 
apprehension, and sentencing based on facts in accordance with 
the law. This is precisely an expression of doing business 
according to the law. The trial of Xi Yang's case was not held 
publicly in order to ensure that state secrets would not be 
revealed in an open trial in accordance with Article 111 of the 
"PRC Criminal Procedure Law," which explicitly states: "Cases 
involving state secrets or the private affairs of individuals 
are not to be heard in public." In the wake of passing sentence 
in the first trial, it was reported that Xi Yang has filed an 
appeal, and his employer was also looking for a lawyer to defend 
his case. All this is sufficient to show that his case has been 
handled strictly in accordance with legal procedures. The 
party, the government departments, and individuals are forbidden 
from intervening in the trial of the case, and they have not 
intervened. Why then should China be charged with "being 
lawless"? 
  In fact, the speeches and actions of the extremely small 
handful of people who have maliciously attacked the Chinese 
Government by taking advantage of Xi Yang's case are out and out 
"lawless." This little handful of people are insisting that 
someone like Xi Yang -- who has already admitted being guilty of 
violating the Chinese penal code -- is "innocent," and are 
demanding his "release." If things are handled according to 
this model, all people who steal state secrets will be found not 
guilty and none of them will be apprehended. Would not that be 
truly "lawless?" The PRC Criminal Procedure Law explicitly 
stipulates that trials of cases involving state secrets will not 
be held in public; furthermore, Xi Yang's case is undergoing a 
further hearing and is not yet closed. However, this small 
handful of people are demanding an "open trial" and the 
"publication of the trial's results." Who are actually being 
"lawless?" 
  Xi Yang's Case Has Nothing To Do With "Freedom of the 
Press" 
  Recently, some people have linked Xi Yang's case with 
"freedom of the press," saying that the Chinese side has dealt 
a blow at freedom of the press in Hong Kong by taking advantage 
of Xi Yang's case. Some commentaries have even linked this 
incident with conditions after 1997, saying that Xi Yang's case 
shows that Hong Kong will lose its freedom of the press after 
1997. If that was not stated out of ulterior motives, it was at 
least a muddle-headed understanding. 
  We must bear in mind that Xi Yang was not ignorant of 
Chinese 
law and political operations -- he had gone to Hong Kong from 
the hinterland only two or three years before. His "coverage" 
in question was not "mistakenly trespassing in a restricted 
zone," but knowingly committing a crime to spy on state secrets. 
That being the case, Xi Yang's actions had gone far beyond the 
realm of ordinary news coverage. To apprehend a criminal who 
has stolen important state secrets according to the law and 
"suppressing press freedoms" are two entirely different kettles 
of fish; how could the two issues be placed on the same level? 
  Chinese law protects all reporters in their normal news 
gathering activities; of course, activities that are not in line 
with the reporter's status are not included. Since reform and 
opening up, the Chinese Government has provided conveniences for 
reporters from Hong Kong and Macao in their coverage of the 
hinterland, ever simplifying procedures. Since 1993, the number 
of Hong Kong reporters leaving for the hinterland for news 
coverage has totaled more than a thousand; they have come and 
gone freely, and have experienced smooth sailing in their news 
gathering. Of course, when reporters cover the Chinese 
hinterland (as in any country in the world) Chinese law must be 
observed; this applies to reporters as well as businessmen and 
travelers. If other people are sanctioned for violating the law 
in the hinterland, why should reporters alone be exempt? The 
fact is, so many reporters from Hong Kong went to the hinterland 
to cover news last year, and only Xi Yang was prosecuted. This 
fact alone has vividly demonstrated that the Chinese Government 
protects reporters' normal news gathering activities. 
  The author believes that some people intentionally or 
unintentionally regard reporter's activities as being free from 
all legal restrictions as one of the contents or major contents 
of the freedom of the press. This is actually opium to 
reporters and misguides Hong Kong residents. Such an 
understanding will harm reporters and will inevitably hurt the 
press itself. Therefore, such an erroneous understanding must 
be clarified. 
  In the final analysis, regarding Xi Yang's case, as long as 
we clarify whether he is guilty or not guilty, it will be easy 
to understand the other issues. A responsible person from the 
PRC State Security department put it well: "Xi Yang's behavior 
has violated the PRC criminal code and has nothing to do with 
the normal news gathering activities of a reporter; his is 
purely a criminal case."

<F P=106> [Report: "MING PAO's Response to XINHUA Article Entitled </F>
`Xi Yang Sentenced to 12 Years Imprisonment at First Trial'"] 
  [Text] First, the XINHUA article once again showed that Xi 
Yang was actually engaged in normal news gathering as understood 
by the Hong Kong journalistic circles. 
  In June and July last year, a number of important meetings 
concerning Hong Kong were held in Beijing and MING PAO sent two 
reporters, one of whom was Xi Yang, to cover the news in 
Beijing. During this period, Xi Yang also covered economic news 
concerning China's macroeconomic control, which was of keen 
interest to people in various circles at that time. All 
arrangements made between MING PAO and Xi Yang were within the 
scope of news gathering and there was no such thing as doing 
something without relation to news gathering in the name of 
covering news in Beijing. The XINHUA article once again proved 
that Xi Yang delivered all the materials he gathered from news 
gathering to MING PAO for open publishing and did not use the 
information for any other purpose. 
  Second, PRC Criminal Procedure Law, Chapter 2, First 
Section, 
Article 121 stipulates: "All sentences are announced openly 
without exception." According to the annotation on this article 
in the book "Collection of Annotations on the PRC Laws" compiled 
by the National People's Congress Law Committee: "The People's 
Courts will openly announce their decisions on all cases no 
matter whether the cases are tried openly or secretely." The 
"Collection of Annotations" particularly mentions that the 
decisions on cases related to state secrets and tried secretely 
should also be announced openly. Relevant law experts in Beijing 
pointed out that an open announcement of court decisions should 
at least include the following two points: 
  1. Delivery of the court verdicts to the accused and the 
public prosecutors concerned. 
  2. Posting of the written court verdicts on the notice 
boards of the courts with the signatures of the courts' 
responsible officials and the seals of the courts. 
  According to the XINHUA article, the Chinese authorities 
only 
satisfied the first point. It is perplexing as to why the court 
has not yet made public the verdict and the details of the case 
were only partly revealed by XINHUA. According to the 
instructions of the court in Beijing, Xi Yang's lawyers were not 
allowed to reveal any details of the case to the public. 
Therefore, before the court verdict was officially made public, 
it was unfair to the appelant that the Chinese authorities gave 
a unilateral account of the case through the news agency. 
  Third, the XINHUA article said that Xi Yang's case was very 
serious and Xi Yang might be sentenced to a prison term of over 
10 years. However, the article did not quote the official 
concern and did not mention what evidence showed that the case 
could be considered as very serious. On the contrary, according 
to Dr Lo Cheung-kwok, a member of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, who pointed out in his capacity as a 
finance expert that, under the current financial operation 
system, the information about China's gold trading and interest 
rate adjustment as reported by Xi Yang absolutely could not 
cause any serious economic losses to the state.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Watch Out for British Intervention in `Xi </F>
Yang' Case"] 
  [Text] Reportedly, [Governor] Patten reviewed Hong Kong's 
latest developments with British diplomatic officials on 6 
April, which included the sentencing of MING PAO reporter Xi 
Yang. After the meeting, Patten's spokesman said that a 
statement will be made by Chief Secretary Chan Fang On-sang on 
the case. 
  Mrs. Chan Fang On-sang did make a statement, saying that the 
British and Hong Kong governments are naturally concerned about 
Xi Yang's fate. 
  Obviously, Mrs. Chan was backed by Patten, who was supported 
by the British Government. Mrs. Chan merely repeated what 
Patten and the British Government wanted her to say. 
  Because of his involvement in criminal activities 
incompatible with his capacity as a reporter, MING PAO reporter 
Xi Yang violated the State Security Law by spying and stealing 
important state financial secrets. The Beijing judicial organs 
arrested, tried, and sentenced him in accordance with the law. 
This is China's internal affair and brooks no foreign 
interference. 
  Some people in Hong Kong do not understand China's laws and 
judicial procedures and are not clear about Xi Yang's criminal 
offense. It is understandable that they have requested more 
information about the case. However, a handful of figures like 
Martin Lee and Sze Tu-wah have acted diametrically. On the one 
hand, they say that they know nothing about the Xi Yang case and 
"not even the kind of crime of which he is charged." On the 
other hand, they attacked the Chinese judiciary for being 
"unfair" and "hostile to the freedom of press," "brutally 
trampling upon human rights," and "intentionally dealing Hong 
Kong press circles a head-on blow at the first encounter." 
  Regarding Xi Yang's criminal offenses, officials responsible 
for the relevant Chinese departments have answered questions 
raised by the press circles on various occasions, clearly 
pointing out that he stole state secrets, including the 
unreleased plans of the People's Bank of China concerning 
savings interest rate changes, the decisions by the People's 
Bank of China on participating in international gold bullion 
transactions, and other major financial secrets. A few days 
ago, Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong 
branch, and Lu Ping, director of the State Council's Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office, gave an account of the nature of the 
case and the grounds for the sentence. Zhu Yucheng said: It is 
true that Xi Yang has been convicted of stealing major state 
financial secrets. As he has violated the "PRC Security Law," 
he must be handled in light of the "PRC Criminal Procedural 
Law." The purpose of not trying the Xi Yang case openly is to 
prevent leakage of state secrets during the trial. This 
conforms to article 111 of the "PRC Criminal Procedural Law": 
"Cases involving state secrets or privacy shall not be tried 
openly." 
  These remarks are based on responsibility and not made 
willfully by any individual. We believe that the Chinese 
judicial departments will be very prudent in the arrest, trial, 
and sentencing of a Hong Kong reporter who has violated the 
criminal law. Based on evidence and the law, the case will be 
handled realistically. 
  Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said 
yesterday: "Each country has its own commercial and economic 
secrets. If these secrets are stolen, the person involved, of 
course, must be punished." Has the Hong Kong British 
authorities not introduced the "Government Security Law" from 
Britain? In Britain, you cannot make everything public and 
secrets are not to be leaked. For the sake of Hong Kong's 
overall interests, former legislative councilor Sit Hao-yan made 
public some material concerning the airport and he was 
investigated by security officials for leaking secrets. For the 
sake of maintaining the secrets of the Independent Commission 
Against Crime [ICAC], the Hong Kong people are still kept in the 
dark about the case of Tsui Ka-kit, who was sacked by the ICAC. 
Naturally, China has its own secrets as well as laws for 
maintaining secrets. The handling in accordance with the law of 
a person who has stolen major financial secrets is precisely a 
manifestation of the legal spirit. We do not know why the Hong 
Kong British authorities have made indiscreet remarks and shown 
"concern" over an espionage case. What kind of law is it in the 
world which allows one to maintain its secrets but does not 
permit the other to fight against spying? 
  This reminds us of the Han Dongfang case which took place 
last year. Han was handled according to law and his passport 
was revoked for violating China's criminal law. Taking 
advantage of the case, the British Government wantonly carried 
out provocations and even "showed great concern" by raising it 
to a diplomatic level. The Hong Kong British authorities 
attacked China's handling of the Han Dongfang case as "violating 
human rights" and "contravening the International Law," saying 
it "would dampen the confidence of the Hong Kong people for a 
long time to come." The followers of the Hong Kong Alliance for 
Promoting Democracy in China added fuel to the flames, lodged 
protests, held sit-in strikes, and stirred up trouble for some 
time. 
  We can draw the following conclusion, after reviewing the 
past and current situations: The British side's concern over 
the "Xi Yang case" is not for the individual. They think that 
the individual can be used to smear mud over China, incite Hong 
Kong people's discontent against China, dampen the confidence of 
the Hong Kong people in their future, and meddle in Hong Kong's 
smooth transition. All people of goodwill should heighten their 
vigilance. 
  The British side did not gain any advantage from the Han 
Dongfang farce which they played in the past. How can they 
attain their objective with the "Xi Yang case" today?

<F P=106> [By Chan Wai-fong] </F>
  [Text] A human rights organization's application for legal 
status has been rejected by Shanghai authorities who fear 
creating a way for underground democratic movements to go 
public. Shanghai's Civil Affairs Bureau told leaders of the 
Chinese Human Rights Association that its application to 
register had been rejected because it was not a "mass 
organisation" according to the law. Association leaders were 
told that the new body had to be affiliated with official 
organisations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions 
if it wants to become legal. 
  Association spokesman Yang Zhou, a leading Shanghai 
dissident, said: "This evidently contradicts the constitution, 
which guarantees people's rights to organise." Mr Yang was 
detained during French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's brief 
visit to Shanghai last weekend. "Only the Communist Party can 
say who is lawful and who is not. And no genuinely independent 
mass organisation is allowed, although there are regulations 
allowing such associations," Mr Yang said. "You are illegal and 
may have to face criminal charges if you do not register. But 
when you try to do so, there is no way that you will succeed," 
he said. 
  Officially submitted in March 1993, the association's 
application for legal status has been pending for more than a 
year. The group is so far the first non-government mainland 
organisation with no official link whatsoever to seek legal 
recognition. "They are handling it very carefully because there 
is no precedent. And they know that if it is approved, it will 
be a gateway for underground democratic activities to go 
public," Mr Yang said. If the association became legal, similar 
groups could then affiliate with it and register with the 
Government which is something the authorities would rather 
avoid, he said. 
  Civil Affairs Bureau officials have agreed to reconsider the 
association's application in the future, but Mr Yang said it was 
unlikely that approval would be granted this year. Unless there 
were big changes in Beijing, the case would just be left hanging 
in the air, he said. 
  But the activist said efforts to legalise the group would 
not 
be abandoned. "At the moment, we can only learn bits and pieces 
about the situation of political prisoners through friends. 
There is no way that we can visit prisoners, monitor works of 
the judiciary, procuratorate and public security departments, or 
make proposals unless we are officially recognised."

<F P=106> ["Eye on China" column, by China Editor Cary Huang: </F>
"Rearrests Showcase China's Strength and Weakness"] 
  [Text] China's rearrest of leading dissidents Wei 
Jingsheng and Xu Wenli and its threat to pin new charges on the 
two best-known dissidents are a sign of strength and of 
weakness. With it, the Beijing regime sharply defies American 
pressure to improve its human rights record. It also 
graphically demonstrates its lack of confidence about its 
control in China. 
  The rearrest of China's most prominent political dissidents 
appears to set the United States and China on a collision course 
over human rights. But more obviously, the Communist Party 
leaders are hoping that the U.S. will pursue its economic 
interests in maintaining trade with China rather than press its 
human rights concerns. 
  The commonly held belief among Chinese officials is that the 
U.S., fearful of being shut out of the world's biggest emerging 
market, will find a way to renew China's most-favoured-nation 
(MFN) trading status. Beijing has every reason to support this 
assumption as it has gained more and more sympathy inside and 
outside America towards unconditional renewal of the trade 
privilege. The Clinton administration has been under 
increasingly heavy pressure from the most influential business 
community to promote closer trade ties with China. 
  Japan, Germany, Italy and France have defied the U.S. stance 
on human rights with leaders flooding into the middle kingdom to 
scramble for a bigger slice of the world's most lucrative and 
last untapped market. Last weekend, the visiting French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur even gave China clear assurances his 
government would not "interfere" in China's human rights issue. 
Earlier, other Western leaders including German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl and resigned Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa made similar pledges to China in their recent visits. 
  Meanwhile, Beijing has strengthened its bargaining position 
in dealing with the Americans. The rift between the U.S. and 
Japan and other Southeast Asian nations over trade issues has 
weakened the U.S.'s status in pressing China for more 
compromises both in trade and politics. China's role in 
maintaining regional order has been measurably enhanced 
following the North Korea nuclear crisis, in which Beijing's 
attitude has been crucial. The communist leadership has 
obviously became more confident than ever in obtaining 
unconditional MFN this June. 
  In many ways, however, Wei's fate and the course of the 
Sino-American struggle over the profitable trade status now seem 
inextricably bound. He may end up hostage to the dispute. The 
high risk Beijing is taking by threatening to jail Wei again and 
rearresting a few other dissidents gives a strong indication how 
much it fears just one man or a few. But the larger background 
to this singular fear is the high level of public discontent in 
China in recent months over its runaway economy, price hikes, 
rampant corruption and other economic imbalances -- much the 
same sort of mass discontent that set the stage for the 
nationwide pro-democracy protests five years ago. 
  For the Chinese government, a free and outspoken Wei and a 
handful of other dissidents pose a major threat. More than 
anyone else, Wei has become the focal point for many 
pro-democracy activists. The Chinese government is especially 
worried about the potential for turmoil this spring, the fifth 
anniversary of the 1989 democracy movement. Given widespread 
discontent among masses, maintaining social stability has become 
a catchword of Chinese politics these days and has been given 
top priority in recent speeches by senior leaders. China's 
season of silence is in full swing. Every spring, Beijing's 
security apparatus, its relatively few dissidents and its 
foreign press corps gear up for the anniversary of the 4 June 
event. The fragility of the Communist Party's grip on power is 
shown by the silence it tries to enforce on many matters. This 
year, the crackdown on dissidents and foreign reporters has come 
earlier than usual and tensions are greater than any time since 
1989. 
  It thus may seem unfathomable that China would make the 
mistake of handing a few dissidents out of 1.2 billion people so 
much power by repeatedly harassing them under the spotlight of 
the international news media. The explanation to this is 
largely due to an increasingly fragile constitution for 
89-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping. 
  Party leaders appear to agree with their critics that 
conditions now are ripe for a huge social explosion. The 
contradiction here is that while China is doing better than 
ever, at the same time it appears set for another huge spasm.

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "Praising `Those Who Are </F>
Spiritually Rich'"--Spirit of Wholeheartedly Serving the People"] 
  [Text] Sun Maofang [1327 5399 5364], political assistant 
of the Sixth Department of Internal Medicine, Beijing Military 
Region General Hospital, the Chinese People's Liberation Army 
[PLA] has drawn nutrition from the Lei Feng spirit on the one 
hand and dedicated himself to the people on the other ever since 
he put on his military uniform in 1964. Over the past 30 years, 
he has been "warm like spring toward his comrades"; while doing 
a good job of work at his post, he did voluminous good things 
for the masses and was honored as "a person who is spiritually 
rich." 
  Love is the foundation of dedication. The reason why Lei 
Feng "put his limited life into unlimited service to the people" 
was that he likened the party to his "mother" and socialism to 
"the root of life," while cherishing the party, the people, and 
socialism with utter devotion. Likewise, Sun Maofang has 
unremittingly done good things for the masses, because he has 
the lofty idea of "dedicating his love to the motherland and the 
people." For scores of years, Sun Maofang's heart has been 
filled with devotion to the party and the people, while 
regarding the development of the cause of the party and the 
people and the happiness of other people's lives as his own 
greatest wish. For the cause of the party and people, Sun 
Maofang does not care about his personal fame and position and 
is willing to serve as a "human bridge." He said: "`Human 
bridges' were set up in wartime to wipe out the enemy; in 
peacetime construction, `human bridges' are set up to lead to 
the four modernizations." To enable five elderly widowers, who 
had no children, to live happily in their old age, Sun Maofang 
waited on them as if he had been their own son. The elderly 
praised him and likened him to their "good son." Some people 
believed that it did not pay for Sun Maofang to have taken all 
that trouble. However, Sun Maofang said: "It is no easy job 
to be a fine son of the people! If the people recognize me as 
their good son, that would be the greatest prize for me!" "Head 
bowed, like a willing ox, I serve the children." This spirit of 
Sun Maofang is commendable and admirable. 
  Beyond a doubt, a person who dedicates his love to the 
motherland and the people is spiritually rich. In our society, 
people who are spiritually rich like Sun Maofang are numerous. 
Xu Honggang, Bao Qifan, and Jin Zhenghong [6855 2973 3163], who 
have been covered by this paper recently, are all spiritually 
rich and have lofty ideals and pursuits. There are a far 
greater number of people who are working diligently at their 
posts in obscurity, dedicating themselves to the people. 
However, we may put it bluntly that under the pounding tide of 
the commodity economy, there really are many people who have 
neglected spiritual pursuits. In their eyes, the Lei Feng 
spirit with selfless devotion as its core is outmoded; other 
people's sorrows, the rise or decline of the nation, and the 
future of the motherland all have nothing to do with them. Only 
money, only the individual's private gain is the sole target of 
their pursuit. These people might be materially rich, but they 
are definitely spiritually impoverished. 
  "A man must have some spirit." Such a spirit is precisely 
the dedication to society and mankind and the spirit of serving 
the people heart and soul. This spirit was called for in the 
times of revolutionary war as well as in times of socialist 
construction. Today, the times have changed as well as the 
situation and our tasks. However, "the essence retains its 
identity while appearances may wary"; our party's purport has 
not changed. The spirit of selfless devotion and serving the 
people heart and soul will always be an important source of 
strength for the prosperity of our country and nation. Just as 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping indicated, in the course of the conversion 
to the socialist market economic structure, we must grasp 
building of the two civilizations simultaneously, we must do a 
good job in building socialist material civilization to make 
people materially rich, but do a good job of building socialist 
spiritual civilization so that people will become spiritually 
rich too.

  [Text] There will be no significant changes in China's 
political system in the next one or two years, according to a 
leading Beijing scholar. 
  "This year is a key period for economic reforms. 
Accelerating political reforms all depends on the success of 
that," said Pan Guohua, the vice-chairman of the Department of 
International Politics at Beijing University. "Political steps 
will not appear for one or two years. There are many conditions 
not ripe for democracy at present," Pan said. 
  A former party general secretary, Zhao Ziyang, put forward a 
programme of moderate political reforms in the late 1980s, but 
the subject has been a near taboo in China since Zhao's 
dismissal after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989 and the jailing 
of Bao Tong, who was Zhao's former political secretary and the 
director of the central committee's political reform think tank. 
However, in a lively discussion with other mainland scholars in 
Hong Kong, Pan indicated that consensus is being reached in the 
capital on the political transition after the supreme leader, 
Deng Xiaoping, dies, as well as plans for cautious 
democratisation. 
  Pan said the experience of 1976 -- when three key Chinese 
leaders died -- proved that China would not fall into chaos 
after Deng's death. "I admit we do have some worries that 
another dictator could emerge. But in general we feel that 
widespread instability is impossible," he said. 
  The three most likely to emerge as supreme leader of China 
after Deng's death are President Jiang Zemin, the executive 
vice-premier Zhu Rongji and a vice-premier, Li Ruihuan, Pan 
said. Asked about the fate of the Premier, Li Peng, he replied: 
"Of course everyone can be included." 
  As far as democracy is concerned, Pan said, researchers in 
the capital believed it could be achieved through the gradual 
devolution of power to the National People's Congress (NPC) and 
to non-communist parties. Both have been described by Western 
scholars as window-dressing meant to legitimise the Communist 
Party's grip on power in China. However, Pan said this view 
ignored important changes already taking place. The standing 
committee of the NPC, headed by Qiao Shi, was already seeking to 
enhance its power at the expense of the Communist Party, he said. 
  "The NPC must listen to a growing chorus of complaints from 
the people, so they feel the need for more authority," he said, 
adding that the standing committee significantly amended more 
than 20 laws last year. 
  The growing political role of non-communist parties 
represents the second route by which democratisation would be 
achieved, Pan said. These so-called democratic parties have in 
the past been tightly controlled by the authorities and all 
acknowledge the overall leadership of the Communist Party. 
  But Pan pointed out that at the recent Beijing municipal 
elections, a Communist candidate lost to a Democratic Party 
candidate in Haidian District, which is home to most of the 
capital's universities and research institutes. 
  The consensus in Beijing was for a "safe" speed of political 
change, however. "The Chinese people care about the conditions 
for their children. As a result, economic reforms have gone 
faster than political reforms," Pan said. 
  The devolution of power to local governments as well as the 
development of the nonstate economic sector would lay the 
foundations for the civil society that is considered crucial to 
successful democracy, he believed. 
  "As long as they are constitutional, the Chinese government 
will support the emergence of new popular groups," he said. "Up 
to now, no such groups in the academic or social sphere have 
posed a serious threat to the Communist Party and government." 
  The greatest threat to the party came from internal 
corruption. "Even though two national meetings have been held to 
deal with this problem, the measures taken so far are not 
working," he said. "The life or death of the party lies here." 
  Within Beijing University, Pan said, growing academic 
freedom 
had contributed to more discussion about political change and 
other taboo subjects. "In the past, the party controlled 
everything we said, but no longer. The atmosphere is now very 
harmonious." 
  But Pan had harsh words about the dissidents Wang Dan and 
Wei 
Jingsheng, who have been detained and harassed by Beijing police 
in the past month. "The common people don't care one whit about 
them," he said. "They know that if the likes of Wang Dan or Wei 
Jingsheng were to become the leaders of China, they would not be 
able to handle a single matter well." 
  As long as dissidents were handled by police in accordance 
with legal procedures, Pan believed no protests would be raised 
at their detentions.
