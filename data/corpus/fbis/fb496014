  [Text] Beijing, 25 Mar (XINHUA) -- A Discussion of 
Party History and a Study of Party History by the Older 
Generation of Revolutionaries is China's first collection 
of important documents specially studying the history of the 
Communist Party of China. It was recently compiled by the 
General Study Group of the Party Literature Research Office 
under the CPC Central Committee and published by the Shaanxi 
People's Publishing House. 
  This book collected 92 important documents totalling 650,000 
characters on the party's history. They were written from 1926 
to 1991, a time span of 65 years, by 31 older generations of 
revolutionaries including Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, 
Zhu De, Ren Bishi, Deng Xiaoping, and Chen Yun. The book is 
divided into four parts. The first discusses the significance 
of studying party history; the second is about the scientific 
attitude and method of studying party history; the third deals 
with the basic process, characteristics, experiences, and 
lessons of party history; and the last reviews major events in 
party history. 
  Experts are of the view that the book is an important 
collection of the works of the older generation of 
revolutionaries who analyzed party history from Marxist 
standpoints, views, and methods; is a guide for studying party 
history and doing research on party history under the new 
historical conditions; and will greatly help party members, 
cadres, and youth understand and study party history, better 
understand China's past, cope with future problems, and enhance 
self-awareness and a sense of historical responsibility for 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<F P=106> [From the "Special Commentary on China's Economy" column by </F>
Yu Guangyuan (0060 0342 6678): "On the Meaning of `Development 
Is Unconditional Logic' -- A Philosophical Principle, as Well as 
a Fundamental Guideline for Economic Work"] 
  [Text] Two years ago, Deng Xiaoping inspected Wuchang, 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shanghai, and other places, making many 
speeches during the trip. These speeches have an important 
historic role to play in our country's socialist modernization. 
Over the past two years, our country's rapid economic 
development has drawn widespread attention in the world, and the 
people in our country are delighted and encouraged, and have 
enhanced their confidence in our country's bright future. 
Although these speeches two years ago have been studied by 
people many times, a review of the past can help us to 
understand the present, and I think that we must always review 
them and deepen our understanding of them. 
  These speeches were quickly organized into a document 
entitled "Key Points of Speeches Made in Wuchang, Shenzhen, 
Zhuhai, and Shanghai," for the broad masses of cadres in our 
country to study. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping, which was published in October 1993, included 
this document. The first part of the document said that "we 
must liberate productive forces through reform," the second part 
said that a "market economy does not equal capitalism," and the 
third part mainly talked about economic development problems. I 
believe that everyone will remember the important expositions 
mentioned in these three parts: "grasp the opportunity to 
develop ourselves, and the crux is to develop the economy"; "the 
places that can develop should not be blocked from so doing, and 
the places with conditions must try their best to develop 
faster"; "low speed means standstill, or even retrogression"; 
"our country's economic development must try hard to climb to a 
new stage every several years"; "Guangdong must climb to several 
new stages, and try hard to catch up with the four small dragons 
of Asia in 20 years"; "we must pay attention to the stable and 
harmonious development of the economy, but stability and harmony 
are also relative, not absolute, and only development is 
unconditional logic" [fa zhan cai shi ying dao li 4099 1455 2088 
2508 4289 6670 3810 -- usually translated as "development is the 
last word"]. The saying that "development is unconditional 
logic" comes from here. The original remark by Deng Xiaoping 
was "only development is unconditional logic," a total of seven 
characters. When people cite this remark, they omit the word 
"only" for the sake of convenience, so it becomes "development 
is unconditional logic," a total of six characters, and this is 
also the way I say it in this article. For me, the purpose in 
writing this article is to review this portion of the speeches, 
and to ponder the meaning of his remark: "Development is 
unconditional logic." 
  After Jiang Zemin twice cited "development is unconditional 
logic" at the economic work meeting of 10 provinces and regions 
in central, south, and southwest China on 27 September 1993, 
this famous remark by Deng Xiaoping has begun to be cited 
frequently by people over the past three or four months. To my 
knowledge, many articles have been written on this remark, but I 
notice that discussions on it are still inadequate, and 
expositions are not full, thorough, and comprehensive. I myself 
have carried out only a preliminary study of it. I think that 
there is earnest need for our country's academic circles 
(including myself, of course) to deepen our understanding of 
this issue. 
  I think that the argument that "development is unconditional 
logic," which was proposed by Deng Xiaoping, is a philosophical 
principle, as well as a fundamental guideline for the current 
economic work in our country. That is to say, as a 
philosophical principle, it is one that has great guiding 
significance to our country's economic work, and as a guideline 
for economic work, it is one characterized by profound 
philosophical reasoning. 
  Although this remark by Deng Xiaoping was not made during a 
discussion of philosophical topics, what it said was indeed a 
fundamental principle of materialist dialectics. We all know 
that dialectics is about a science of "general development," but 
when Deng Xiaoping phrased it in such a way, it became his 
innovation. Therefore I think that regarding this remark by Deng 
Xiaoping, we must first view it as a philosophical proposition 
when we begin discussing it. 
  Deng Xiaoping's innovation was that he added the word 
"unconditional" in front of "logic." I think the word "logic" 
used here means objective law, which does not change according 
to man's will, as well as a principle that should be 
subjectively followed by the people. The argument that 
"development is unconditional logic," as an objective law that 
does not change according to man's will, means that things 
always develop themselves in an uncompromising manner, and that 
is to say, they cannot be stopped in any case. They can be 
stopped at a certain point of time, but cannot be stopped 
forever. There might be such a historical process: A certain 
force consciously or unconsciously stops the development of 
things. In such times, "development is unconditional logic" 
begins to function, and whoever would block this objective law 
will have his behavior punished by this law, and life will be 
made difficult for people. Things develop eventually and win 
victories. This is what we mean by unconditional when it is 
viewed as an objective law. As a principle to be followed 
subjectively, we mean that we must voluntarily view the 
promotion of development as the highest principle, and let all 
other things obey this principle. The purpose of reform is 
development, the purpose of opening up is development, the 
purpose of running operations and management well is 
development, the purpose of attaching importance to education 
and to science and technology is development, the purpose of 
paying attention to stability and harmony is development, and 
even the purpose of our upholding the basic system of socialism 
is development. 
  Everyone knows that unconditional and conditional are 
"antonyms." Whether it is viewed as an objective law or action 
guideline, when a certain logic is unconditional, it is because 
other logic is conditional. Conditional logic [ruan dao li 6516 
6670 3810] means something less than unconditional logic. 
Conditional logic is still logic, not nonlogic. For example, 
we need sustained, stable, and rapid economic development, so 
stability is a condition here. Of course, the development of a 
country or a region requires concerted efforts by various 
quarters, as well as certain kind of balance, but the argument 
for stability, harmony, and balance must obey the argument for 
development, and we must realize the principle that -- as 
dialectics points out -- balance is relative, imbalance is 
absolute. We must attach importance to balance, for it is the 
opportunity for development. However, we cannot have absolute 
balance during development. We must not expect development 
characterized by absolute balance. If we view absolute balance 
as the guiding principle for work, this will block development. 
That is to say, when balance, harmony, and similar logic are 
overemphasized or stressed unduly, they will block economic 
development. Regarding the relationship between unconditional 
and conditional logic, we should have the following 
understanding: The conditional logic that obeys unconditional 
logic, meaning the conditional logic that conforms to 
unconditional logic -- is real logic, while the conditional 
logic that confronts unconditional logic -- meaning conditional 
logic that does not conform to unconditional logic -- is not 
real logic. 
  We must affirm both unconditional logic and that conditional 
logic which falls into the category of real logic. Which of 
these two should we often discuss and stress? The unconditional 
logic, of course. Therefore Deng Xiaoping stressed that 
"development must not be blocked" and that "low speed even means 
retrogression." This does not mean that we should not talk 
about the conditional logic which falls into the category of 
real logic, but we must refrain from talking to the extent that 
it becomes a logic that no longer falls into the category of 
real logic. By the same token, a conditional logic can change 
from one that is real logic into one which is not real logic. 
It all depends on how far we go in talking about the logic, and 
whether we talk about it appropriately. I think we should 
proceed from using the argument that "development is 
unconditional logic," to examine the situation of discussions on 
conditional logic in real life, and to study whether such 
discussions have surpassed the boundary of real logic. Only 
when we can often carry out examinations of this kind, can we 
truly respect the objective law that "development is 
unconditional logic," and truly do public things according to 
the principle that "development is unconditional logic." 
  There is some conditional logic that sometimes is viewed by 
people as very hard, or as unconditional logic, but it still 
belongs to the category of conditional logic. For example, on 
the problem of the ownership system, "public" has been viewed as 
highly unconditional logic. Before the Third Plenary Session of 
the 11th CPC Central Committee, almost without exception, "one 
big, two public" was considered highly unconditional logic. 
Many people once thought that since we practiced socialism, it 
was righteous to emphasize "public," and therefore "one big, two 
public" was highly unconditional logic and could not be a kind 
of conditional logic. (What I am saying is that it was the 
actual situation in those days, and I am not saying that in that 
time someone actually said "one big, two public is unconditional 
logic." Regarding the term "conditional logic," I do not know 
if I am the first one to use it here.) We also must admit that 
even now, this kind of thinking still functions in the heads of 
some people, and perhaps quite a number of people. Today, some 
people still obstinately view "one big, two public" as 
unconditional logic, and even more people do not understand how 
to view it properly. In fact, even if it is an ownership system 
that suits the productive forces' need for development, it is 
itself a condition for development. It is only a means, and 
development is the end, and as a logic, it cannot be more 
unconditional than development. 
  Of course, the argument that "development is unconditional 
logic," as an objective law that will not change according to 
man's will, will implement itself in an uncompromising way. 
When people try to block it, it will mete out punishment, and 
the force blocking it cannot be more undonditional. The final 
result still will be development. For example, in more than 20 
years before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, the "one big, two public" logic, as subjective 
guiding thought, once prevailed over the unconditional logic of 
development. During the Cultural Revolution, some people even 
said they "prefer socialist weeds to capitalist seedlings." 
Hence, we were severely punished. The big disaster led to the 
great awakening, which led to great development. As a result, we 
have the reform and opening up since the Third Plenary Session 
of the 11th CPC Central Committee, as well as the great 
development over the past 15 years. As an objective law, 
development, indeed, is unconditional logic. The twists and 
turns in the history of our country tell us that if we do not do 
things according to the subjective guiding principle of 
"development as unconditional logic," then this unconditional 
logic -- as an objective law -- will force us to pay a price 
when it implements itself in an uncompromising manner, and the 
price can even be a heavy one. This situation is one that 
cannot be avoided. Now, however, we have learned serious 
practical lessons over a long period of time, and we have a 
higher awareness. Deng Xiaoping has already summed up things in 
his famous remark that "development is unconditional logic," and 
I think that even if there are some fluctuations, we have reason 
to hope that we no longer have to pay a great price, and to hope 
that our country's economy can develop smoothly. 
  Development must take place in a certain space and at a 
certain point of time. By space we mean region. Different 
regions have different situations, and thus different conditions 
for development. By time we mean a period of time, and different 
periods of time have different situations, and thus different 
opportunities for development. Regarding the space and time for 
development, Deng Xiaoping attached adequate importance to them 
when he said that "development is unconditional logic." When he 
said "grasp the opportunity to develop ourselves," he referred 
to the issue of period; when he said "the places with conditions 
should try their best to develop faster," he referred to the 
issue of region. In China, the current period of time should be 
considered a very good period of time for economic development, 
and the whole of mainland China should be considered the best 
region for economic development. The reform our country is 
carrying out is for the purpose of removing obstacles to 
development and of creating very good systemic conditions. The 
developed countries in the world walk ahead of us in terms of 
economy and culture, so when we adopt the open-door policy, we 
may borrow whatever achievements we want, and this is a very 
good condition for development. With such basic conditions, we 
are completely able to achieve the kind of rapid and long-term 
development that is difficult for other countries and regions to 
achieve. Under these circumstances, I think it is very 
important for us to study and learn from the argument that 
"development is unconditional logic."

  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- To keep pace with the 
development of the socialist market economy and to focus on 
economic construction, the China Institute for Workers' 
Ideological and Political Work has been exploring new ways and 
means to carry out ideological and political work. Its efforts 
have promoted the development of ideological and political work 
within enterprises, have stabilized the workers' ranks, and have 
deepened reform and development. 
  To improve and intensify enterprises' ideological and 
political work, over the past two years the institute has 
dispatched eight groups to investigate nearly 100 enterprises 
along open coastal areas and in certain provinces and cities; 
their findings have helped enterprises build stronger party 
organizations and make decisions on carrying out ideological and 
political work. Recently, the institute also organized the 
fifth and sixth national seminars on enterprises' ideological 
and political work in order to exchange experiences on studying 
theories of market economy, and called a symposium in Shenzhen 
to study and discuss the relationship between enterprises' 
cultural work and ideological and political work in an effort to 
guide political workers to move out from their "small circles" 
[xiao xun huan 1420 1789 3883] of ideological and political work 
and step into the "large circles" of economic construction, 
reform, and opening up; the symposium also helped the vast 
number of political workers change their mind sets and improve 
proficiency so they can meet the requirements of the 
transformation period as quickly as possible. 
  According to a person in charge of the institute, the 
institute will continue to employ its resources for doing 
ideological and political work for enterprise development. He 
said members of his institute will serve party committees and 
governments at various levels as advisers, providing them with 
investigative findings and relevant information. He said the 
institute will soon carry out studies on the modern enterprise 
system as well as ideological and political work, and on 
ideological and political work in joint ventures and village and 
town enterprises. He added that efforts will be made to produce 
significant research results in one or two areas. Meanwhile, 
the institute will improve its service for grass-roots units, 
will intensify doing ideological and political work and 
propagating public opinion, and will provide the grassroots with 
more effective guidance in accordance with the actual conditions 
of grass-roots enterprises.

  [Text] At a recent international seminar in Kunming on 
copyright protection and economic and cultural development in 
Asia, this reporter learned that China has made major progress 
in protecting intellectual property rights. China has 
preliminarily brought in line with international practices its 
own legal system regarding copyright protection, thus showing 
that China has basically established a copyright system. 
  Since last year, the State Copyright Administration and 
local 
copyright administrations have formulated and perfected a series 
of regulations and operating procedures governing copyright 
administration. At the same time, they have strictly enforced 
relevant laws on copyrights and have cracked down on all kinds 
of serious copyright infringement cases. Over the past year, 
while investigating and dealing with a batch of key copyright 
infringement cases concerning foreigners, the State Copyright 
Administration took disciplinary actions against 11 domestic 
units and individuals. 
  Modern copyright protection systems such as the collective 
copyright administration system and the copyright agent system 
have been established and gradually perfected in China. The 
Chinese Association for Music Copyrights has gradually 
standardized its operations. The Chinese Transaction Center for 
the Payment of Copyright Use has scored preliminary results and 
has effectively protected the legitimate rights and interests of 
more than 300,000 authors. At present, 16 copyright agencies 
have been set up and authorized to serve as a bridge for 
introducing Chinese works to overseas markets and for bringing 
excellent foreign works into China. 
  Since promulgating the Copyright Law in September 1990, 
China 
has signed major copyright conventions, including the Bern 
Convention, the World Copyright Convention, and the Phonographic 
Record Convention, and it has established ties with more than 
100 countries to protect mutual copyrights.

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (CNS) -- China is now speeding up 
exploitation of applied satellite technology and applied 
technology for satellites in a bid to meet the needs of the 
economy, science and technology, culture and national defence. 
  The new generation of applied satellite technology under 
development at present includes communications satellites of 
great capacity and long life span, various kinds of 
meteorological satellites, satellites for navigation, satellites 
for reduction of disasters and multi-purpose satellites for 
earth resources. Of these satellites the "Dongfanghong No. 3" 
communications satellite and the "Fengyun No. 2" weather 
satellite will go into operation, marking the reaching of an 
internationally advanced level by China in the use of applied 
satellites. The "Dongfanghong No. 3" satellite is equipped with 
24 transmitters and has a life span of eight years able to suit 
the needs of satellite communications up to the year 2000 or 
even longer. The "Fengyun No. 2" is a remote-sensing weather 
satellite synchronized with the earth's orbit, the first of its 
kind ever developed in China. The meteorological satellite will 
play an important role in the development of meteorological 
science and technology both in China and elsewhere in the 
international community. 
  China, meanwhile, is improving and modifying the "Long 
March" 
carrier rocket and a number of advanced carrier rockets of 
greater loading capacity have been successfully developed, 
meeting needs at home and abroad. The "Long March No. 3B" 
synchronous carrier rocket has a loading capacity of 4.8 tonnes 
and 12 tonnes when in low altitude orbit. Other models of the 
"Long March" carrier rocket have also seen their carrying 
capability improved to various extents. A communications system 
with the application of satellites which can cover all areas 
across the country has been set up. China has also established 
a variety of ground systems with the use of satellites including 
a satellite system for quick location fixing and a satellite 
digital information system. All these kinds of satellite can be 
used in such sectors as communications, broadcasting, education, 
weather, resource prospecting, ocean exploitation, surveying, 
navigation, traffic dispatch, rescue at sea and environmental 
monitoring.

  [Text] Qingdao, April 8 (XINHUA) -- A scientific survey 
vessel staffed by 55 scientists and 52 crew members left here 
today for an eight-month mission to the central Pacific. 
  Its sophisticated seabed investigations will study 
polymetallic structure. 
  The 4,435-ton "Xiangyanghong 09" will survey a 65,000 sq km 
area to the southeast of Hawaii. 
  Scientists said that they will investigate water, climate 
environment, biological environment, hydro-chemical environment 
and the seabed landscape. 
  In addition, the mission will provide an opportunity for 
some 
foreign scientists to practise at sea. 
  The vessel, 15.20 meters wide and 112.9 meters long, has a 
maximum speed of 18.2 knots. It has completed several 
scientific missions since 1977. 
  Much sophisticated exploration and sample-collecting 
equipment was added to the ship before its departure, according 
to officials from the National Bureau of Oceanography.

called a meeting for leading cadres to summarize the work during 
the session, and made arrangements for relaying and implementing 
the spirit of the current NPC session to all Army units. 
  Liu Huaqing, head of the PLA delegation and vice chairman of 
the Central Military Commission [CMC], delivered an important 
speech at the meeting. Zhang Zhen, deputy head of the 
delegation and vice chairman of the CMC, presided over the 
meeting. Attending the meeting were CMC members Ci Haotian, 
Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou. 
  Liu Huaqing said that, during the current NPC session, all 
comrades in the PLA delegation have given play to the spirit of 
democracy, solidarity, seeking truth from facts, and forging 
ahead to make progress; earnestly performed their duties; and 
successfully fulfilled all tasks at the session. 
  Liu Huaqing indicated that the Second Session of the Eighth 
NPC is very important. The current session adhered to taking 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party basic line as guidance, 
implemented the spirit of the 14th party congress and Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee, and set out the 
goal and tasks of government work by centering around the basic 
principle and overall situation of party and government work 
this year; all this is of very important significance to guiding 
economic construction and reform and opening up this year and 
beyond. 
  On relaying and implementing the spirit of the current NPC 
session, Liu Huaqing stressed the need to guide broad cadres and 
soldiers to grasp the following issues: First, to acquire a 
clear picture of the fine situation in China's reform and 
construction, especially the great significance of building a 
socialist market economic structure, and further bolster 
confidence in realizing the great goal of national economic 
construction under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
the party basic line. Second, to acquire a clear picture of the 
basic principle of party and government work this year, 
correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, 
and stability, and further strengthen the consciousness of being 
subjected to the overall situation of the work of the whole 
party and whole country. Third, to acquire a clear picture of 
the goals and tasks of economic work and economic restructuring 
this year, proceed from the basic interests of the party and 
state, consciously subject personal interests to that of the 
whole, subject partial interests to those of the overall 
situation, resolutely support various important reform measures 
of the state, and actively make contributions to the country's 
development and the people's prosperity. And fourth, to have a 
clear picture of the Army's historical mission, consciously give 
play to fine traditions, and augment the Army's comprehensive 
construction to provide strong and powerful security insurance 
to reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  Liu Huaqing required that in relaying and implementing the 
spirit of current NPC session, various units should closely link 
to the thinking of cadres and soldiers and actual conditions in 
their work and should make arrangements in a scientific way. 
Organizations and leading cadres at and above regiment level 
should link study of the spirit of the current NPC session with 
study of volume three of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and 
deepen understanding of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and thinking on 
army building during the new historical period. At the grass 
roots, study should be linked chiefly to political education to 
have a grasp of the basic spirit of the current session. 
Through relay and study, the thinking of cadres and soldiers is 
to be unified and their enthusiasm given play to promote army 
building and reform. 
  Liu Huaqing said, during the session, Chairman Jiang 
delivered a series of important speeches and also made an 
important speech to the PLA delegation. That was of very 
important guiding significance to our Army in having a clear 
idea of its historical responsibility, consciously subjecting it 
to the overall situation of party work and of the whole country, 
augmenting the Army's comprehensive building, and better taking 
up the sacred mission of safeguarding the security and unity of 
the motherland and defending socialist modernization. We must 
earnestly study his speeches to have a deep grasp of them in 
resolute implementation. 
  On army work today, Liu Huaqing stressed that our Army has 
been obedient to the party all along. Under the new situation, 
party committees at all levels should grasp augmenting 
ideological and political building and maintaining the Army's 
high stability and centralized unity as top priority work. It 
is imperative to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping in depth and to arm the whole Army with 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and thinking on army building during the 
new historical period. 
  The building of party style and 
clean government has a bearing on the life and death of the 
party and the state. It is imperative to earnestly implement 
the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Commission for Discipline Inspection and the All-Army Work 
Conference on Discipline Inspection and work hard to make new 
progress in building party style and clean government. It is 
necessary to augment building of leading bodies at all levels 
and grass-roots building in a comprehensive way. The Army 
should never for a minute harbor a false sense of peace and 
security. It is imperative to augment military training based 
on the requirements of military strategy and principles for the 
new historical period and to work hard to improve combat 
effectiveness under modern conditions, especially under hi-tech 
conditions. It is necessary to adhere to being strict in 
running the Army, do a good job of constant ideological work and 
administrative work, and run the Army strictly according to 
various rules and regulations. We should earnestly study the 
characteristics and laws governing the administration of the 
Army under the new situation. The glorious tradition of the 
unanimity of officers and men, showing respect to cadres, and 
cherishing soldiers should be brought forward, and doing a good 
job of running the Army by exploring scientific ways of 
commanding troops. It is necessary to bring forward the fine 
traditions of support the government, cherishing the people, and 
further doing a good job of Army-government, Army-people 
solidarity. 
  In conclusion, Liu Huaqing said, it is imperative for us to 
work with one heart and soul, go all out to make our country 
strong to successfully fulfill all the tasks assigned to our 
Army by the party and the people under the inspiration of the 
current session's spirit and the leadership of the Central 
Committee and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as their core.

  [Text] A number of advanced people who are ready to take 
up the cudgels for a just cause have emerged recently in the 
Xinjiang Military District. The regional military district 
issued a circular on commending and recording the merits of Zhou 
Fuqun, Zhang Wei, and other fighters who were ready to take up 
the cudgels for a just cause. 
  Not long ago, Zhao Ping, a female driver of the Urumqi Taxi 
Company, was held under duress by two ruffians with knives for 
as long as seven hours when she was driving a taxicab. When the 
automobile was passing a military camp in Urumqi, fighters Zhou 
Fuqun and Zhang Wei, who were on guard and heard the calls for 
help, promptly rushed to the site of the incident. The two 
ruffians dropped the female driver and hurriedly ran away when 
they saw fighters coming in their way. Zhou Fuqun and Zhang Wei 
fought with the two ruffians, and the ruffians were finally 
arrested with the help of other fighters and people who rushed 
to the scene. 
  At 0300, in the wee hours of the morning, on 6 March, two 
criminals who had escaped from a prison went to the dormitory of 
their former friend Wang Guangyao, who is a soldier assigned to 
guard the Urumqi Medicine Warehouse. Wang Guangyao did not act 
wrongly out of personal consideration. Wang Guangyao left his 
dormitory with an excuse of wanting to wash his face and 
reported the matter to the authorities, and then returned to his 
dormitory to set the minds of the two criminals at ease. A 
concerned department immediately dispatched personnel to the 
site to arrest the two criminals.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Eighteen cities, 
including Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Harbin, have been 
selected to be pilot cities to carry out comprehensive reforms 
aimed at establishing a socialist market economy. 
  This was revealed at the national conference on pilot cities 
carrying out comprehensive reform which opened today here in the 
capital of north China's Hebei Province. 
  The other 14 cities selected are Changchun, Shenyang, 
Nanjing, Chengdu, Xian, Chongqing, Ningbo, Anshan, Tangshan, 
Yantai, Tongling, Changzhou, Quanzhou and Yanji. 
  These 18 cities have better sense of reform, better 
foundation for economic reform and development, and heavier 
weight in the overall situation. They were selected to probe 
for a way of deepening the reform and opening wider to the 
outside world and sum up experience to pave the way for urban 
reform throughout the country, sources from the current 
conference said. 
  During the experiment, however, the central government will 
not offer any more preferential treatment to the selected 
cities, the sources said. Instead, the selected cities should 
completely carry out all the reform measures and the 
macro-control policies promulgated by the central government. 
The emphasis of the reform will be put on establishing a modern 
enterprise system.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently issued a circular on launching a nationwide general 
inspection of commodity prices to provincial and municipal 
people's governments, and to ministries, commissions, and 
organizations under the State Council. 
  The circular said: At present, China enjoys a stable 
political environment and a prosperous economy. However, price 
hikes occur frequently. Price hikes and unauthorized fees have 
provoked a strong reaction from the masses. Some enterprises 
raised prices by taking advantage of the reforms in taxation, in 
the exchange rate, and of prices; some localities exceeded their 
authority, set prices for services, and wantonly collected fees 
for personal gain; and some shop owners, instead of marking 
prices clearly on their merchandise, demanded unreasonable 
prices, fixed prices, and cheated customers. Some of them even 
earned exorbitant profits from selling fake and shoddy products. 
These illegal operations have pushed up the general price level 
and have seriously harmed consumers' interests. To prevent 
illegal acts of raising prices, establish order with regard to 
market prices, restrain the general price level from an 
excessive increase, keep people's lives stable, maintain social 
stability, and create a favorable environment for the smooth 
implementation of various reforms, the State Council decided to 
continue the nationwide general inspection of commodity prices 
in 1994. 
  The circular's demands: 
<H5>  1. The Scope, Focus, and Main Content of the Inspection </H5>
  All enterprises, individual industrialists and businessmen, 
and administration units authorized to collect fees will be 
included in the inspection. 
  The inspection will focus on prices of daily necessities and 
fees for various services for citizens which are closely related 
to the people's lives. 
  The main content of the inspection will focus on illegal 
acts 
of raising prices in the second half of 1993. These illegal 
acts include: 
  1) Raising prices without authorization by taking advantage 
of taxation reform and by widening the gaps between purchasing 
and selling prices and between wholesale and retail prices, and 
raising prices of products and services by adding additional 
value-added tax to original prices; 
  2) Exceeding the authority of price administration to raise 
prices and service charges that are supposed to be set by the 
state; wantonly raising and charging fees for railway, highway, 
and water transportation services; and forcing passengers to buy 
insurance while selling them tickets; 
  3) Violating state regulations on reporting the price 
adjustment plan, on controlling price differences, and on 
temporary price controls; and failing to mark prices on 
commodities; 
  4) Violating relevant state regulations and wantonly raising 
the prices of agricultural production means such as chemical 
fertilizers, agricultural films, pesticides, diesel fuel for 
agricultural use, and electricity in rural areas; 
  5) Charging fees outside of authority, adding categories of 
charges without authorization, and increasing fees 
indiscriminately. 
<H5>  2. The Time and Method of the Inspection </H5>
  The nationwide general inspection of commodity prices will 
begin in late March, and preliminary results must be scored by 
the end of June. Price departments at all levels will be in 
charge of the inspection. Working together with supervision, 
finance, taxation, auditing, industrial and commercial 
administration, and technology supervision departments, they 
will select cadres to form inspection teams to kick off the 
inspection. With the price inspection organizations serving as 
the mainstay, the nationwide general inspection of commodity 
prices will give full play to price supervision organizations in 
all fields. It will be conducted by simultaneously carrying out 
propaganda, handling problems, and correcting mistakes. 
  In the course of the inspection, it is necessary to bring 
into full play the role of the mass media in exercising 
supervision, utilizing radio and television broadcasts, 
newspapers, and journals to build up momentum and create public 
support for the general price inspection and to publicize major 
and serious cases which have created bad influences. It is also 
necessary to encourage the masses to expose various instances of 
price violation. Measures for improving and perfecting price 
management should be worked out promptly to deal with problems 
uncovered during the inspection and to strengthen enterprises' 
capability for self-restraint. 
  Local governments may invite people's congress deputies, 
members of political consultative conferences, and the 
democratic parties to take part in the price inspection, 
bringing into play their role in exercising supervision and 
offering guidance. 
<H5>  3. Organization and Leadership of the Inspection </H5>
  The nationwide general price inspection should be carried 
out 
and led directly by governments at various levels. Governments 
at all levels should attach great importance to, strengthen 
leadership over, and assign a leading comrade to take charge of 
the inspection, while leaving specific work to the commodity 
price departments. To ensure the smooth progress of the 
inspection, it is necessary to keep consistent commodity price 
departments and staff members, replenish essential inspection 
personnel, coordinate relations between various departments in 
good time, and effectively solve practical problems arising in 
the inspection. 
  On the basis of investigations and study, governments at all 
levels should identify focal points, arrange them in the order 
of their priority, formulate plans, study policies, work out 
meticulous and well-conceived arrangements to ensure the 
concentration of resources to achieve breakthroughs in the focal 
points, and use the experience of selected units to promote work 
in the entire area, thereby making the inspection a great 
success. 
  All departments should step up cooperation and coordination. 
The finance department should ensure outlays for investigating 
price violations uncovered in the inspection; banks should 
assist price inspection departments to collect, according to the 
regulations, fines and confiscations that units and individuals 
being penalized refuse to deliver to the state; the industry and 
commerce administrative departments should provide active 
cooperation in regard to price inspection departments' request 
for suspending a business's operations pending consolidation or 
revoking its business license; and the public security 
department should, in pursuance of the relevant laws and 
regulations, punish those who obstruct inspection personnel from 
executing their official duties. 
  The State Council should instruct the State Planning 
Commission to work together with the supervision, finance, 
taxation, auditing, industry and commerce administration, and 
technical supervisory departments in organizing a number of work 
groups and should send them to provinces, autonomous regions, 
and municipalities to give inspection-related guidance; while 
local governments at various levels should also dispatch work 
groups to go down to lower levels to supervise the inspection. 
<H5>  4. Requirements of the Inspection Work </H5>
  1) All inspection personnel should diligently study the 
"Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning 
the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" 
adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, to fully recognize the inspection's great importance 
for stabilizing commodity prices, reassuring the public, and 
ensuring the smooth progress of reform programs. It is 
necessary to conduct training to enable inspection personnel to 
familiarize themselves with this year's reform programs as well 
as relevant professional knowledge, policies, and legislation. 
In the course of inspection, it is necessary to uphold 
principle, to observe discipline, to perform duties honestly, to 
strictly enforce the laws, and to handle price violation cases 
impartially without bending laws for the benefit of relatives or 
friends. 
  2) Price inspection offices should sternly handle uncovered 
cases of price violation in accordance with the "Regulations on 
Price Management in the PRC" and other relevant regulations. It 
is necessary to instruct units and individuals involved in price 
violation to refund their illegitimate incomes to buyers or 
consumers. Illegitimate incomes that cannot be refunded should 
be confiscated by price inspection offices, and those involved 
should be given a fine depending on the degree of gravity of 
each case. 
  3) All units and individuals being inspected should 
voluntarily accept inspection and provide accurate information; 
those who deliberately create difficulties and refuse to accept 
inspection will be given a heavy punishment. 
  4) It is necessary to protect inspection personnel who 
uphold 
principle as well as people who expose price violations; and 
retaliation against them should by no means be permitted. Those 
who shield and connive at acts of price violation should be 
affixed with responsibilities and duly punished. 
  The State Planning Commission is responsible for the 
day-to-day work of the nationwide price inspection. Before 20 
July, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities 
should submit to the State Council special reports on progress 
in the inspection.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "BOC's Arm in Britain Adds </F>
Brawn"] 
  [Text] The Bank of China's London branch is seeking to 
expand its merchant banking business to intensify its activities 
in the world financial centre. 
  The branch has decided to set up a merchant banking division 
and it is expected to play an important role in BOC's global 
business, said Li Zhuangfei, assistant general manager of the 
branch. 
  One focus of the new division will be structured financing, 
including syndicated loans and aircraft leasing. 
  The branch has been engaged in this business for several 
years. It has completed two major aircraft leasing deals, one 
for Xiamen Airline and the other for Southern China Airlines. 
  Both of these entailed complicated structured financing 
involving commercial lending, U.S. export credits, equity and 
leasing. 
  The other area the branch is to concentrate on is corporate 
financing, including advising European companies on doing 
business with China and helping Chinese companies invest in 
Europe. 
  Li said the branch is also interested in underwriting 
China-related shares. 
  "We hope to help list Chinese shares on the London Stock 
Exchange in the future," he said. 
  China has selected 22 domestic firms for possible listing 
overseas this year. 
  Although most will be listed in Hong Kong, State securities 
authorities have indicated that some will be listed in New York 
and London. 
  Li said the Bank of China's London branch is now recruiting 
staff in London and is applying for licensing. 
  "We know that our path will have many twists and turns, but 
we are confident that we will reach our destination," he said. 
  The London branch was set up in November 1929, the first 
overseas branch of the Bank of China. 
  The branch was originally staffed by only three English 
bankers but has been expanding steadily and now employs 200 
people. 
  It conducts a comprehensive range of businesses, including 
savings and lending for the Chinese community in the United 
Kingdom, trade settlement between China and Europe, foreign 
exchange trading, inter-bank borrowing and interest rate swaps. 
  The branch has become an important member of London's 
banking 
community. 
  "Although we have achieved a great deal in London, we still 
have a lot to learn and many new goals to be realized," he said. 
  The unprecedented structural changes in China's economy 
impose a duty on the branch to explore new businesses to support 
the reform, Li said. 
  He said his bank is seeking to better use the advantages of 
London which he called the most international, flexible and 
advanced financial centre in the world. 
  The city has the world's largest foreign exchange market, 
with an average daily turnover of $300 billion. It has the 
biggest foreign banking community, with offices of over 600 
banks. Of the top 100 banks in the world, 99 have offices in 
London.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Investment Fund Listed in Shenzhen"] </F>
  [Text] The first standardized investment fund, the Tianji 
Fund, has recently been listed on the Shenzhen Securities 
Exchange. 
  The Tianji Fund was established in January 1993 by Fund 
Management Co of China Shenzhen Investment Fund Management Co 
Ltd (SIFM). A total of 581.47 million yuan's ($66.8 million) 
worth of fund units were issued, at a price of 1.03 yuan (11.8 
cents) apiece. 
  Tianji Fund's organizational framework, internal operations 
and management are based on international standards. The 
responsibilities of the manager and trustee are clearly 
separated to ensure that the trustee effectively supervises the 
manager. 
  Tianji Fund is designed to increase assets while spreading 
risks through diversified investments, as well as to service 
small and medium investors. Its portfolio includes securities, 
real estate, money markets and share rights. 
  As the first fund management company, SIFM is cultivating 
foreign partners to develop overseas business. 
  According to officials of Tianji, China's emerging 
securities 
market has more individual and fewer institutional investors. 
It is widely recognized that the lack of institutional 
investors is the main cause of the stock market's persistent 
sluggishness. 
  An investment fund is necessary to stabilize the market and 
stimulate the development of capital markets the Tianji 
officials say. 
  The listing of the Tianji Fund marks a new stage in 
institutional investment in securities, fund officials say. 
  However, many problems stand in the way of the development 
of 
such funds in China, such as the absence of effective laws. Few 
funds in China are based on international regulations, and China 
itself has only one document governing investment funds -- the 
Contemporary Regulations on Investment Fund Management, issued 
by the Shenzhen municipal government. 
  Comprehensive laws are urgently needed to ensure that funds 
can operate properly and orderly, Tianji officials say. In this 
respect, China can learn from other countries in building its 
own system.

<F P=106> [Seventh of seven question-and-answer talks sponsored by the </F>
State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and the State General 
Administration of Taxation, chaired by Wei Dong, deputy director 
of the SETC's Department of Enterprises: "Answers to Questions 
Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System" -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Wei] In today's talk, we will discuss some 
special questions confronting some special trades. Deputy 
Director [of the State General Administration of Taxation's 
Department of Indirect Taxes] Chen [Jie], in our previous talks, 
we have discussed issues relevant to value-added taxes, 
consumption taxes, and income taxes. Today we would like you to 
answer some questions relevant to special trades. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Gao Feng, deputy director of the Policies and Regulations 
Department under the Ministry of Coal] In the past, enterprises 
paid a 3-percent product tax, which was the previous tax rate. 
Now that the product tax rate has been raised to 17 percent, 
the additional tax must be reflected in prices. Should we 
assume that this problem can only be solved by setting new 
prices? 
  [Chen] This problem should be observed through the central 
authorities' price policy. First of all, we must understand 
that prices must not be changed. But how can problems caused by 
additional taxes be solved if prices cannot be changed? In most 
cases, the problems can be solved in two ways. First, while 
introducing the value-added taxes, the state has also adopted 
tax- cutting measures, such as exempting enterprises from paying 
the two funds [fund for major energy and communications 
development products and fund for budget regulation] and 
reducing enterprises' income taxes. The second solution rests 
with enterprises themselves. Enterprises should have more 
efficient management and they should tap their potential. While 
the majority of enterprises can cope, some enterprises have 
problems dealing with the higher taxes. The state has been 
studying ways to help these enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  [Zheng Guangzhao, chief accountant of the Beijing 
Papermaking 
and Packaging Industrial Company] I remember that in 1987, the 
State Council encouraged enterprises to recycle renewable 
resources. The Ministry of Finance, the State Economic 
Commission, and the General Administration of Supply and 
Marketing Cooperatives in those days also supported the policy 
by deducting or exempting these enterprises' tax payments. 
Because this preferential policy has not been specified in the 
new tax policy, these enterprises face the problem of having to 
pay higher taxes during the transitional period. Can you 
comment on this issue? 
  [Chen] [word indistinct] invoice and [word indistinct] 
constitute the foundation of the new value-added taxes. If the 
paper you produce by recycling waste paper is tax-exempted when 
it is being marketed, then you are neither entitled to tax 
deductions nor to the use of a special invoice. And if your 
buyers cannot enjoy the deductions, then they may not want to 
buy paper from you and your sales will be affected. In the 
past, nobody was sure what new problems might be caused by the 
policy of giving preferential treatment to the comprehensive use 
of material resources. However, we have decided to carry out a 
serious follow-up study of this issue following the introduction 
of the new tax system. We believe that there will be a proper 
solution. [passage omitted] 
  [Wei] Deputy Director Chen, some enterprises recently 
asked us some tax-related questions. I would like to mention 
two of the questions here. The first one is how are retail 
sales of paging equipment and cellular phones taxed? The other 
one is how are products made of grain -- like steamed stuffed 
buns and pastries -- taxed? 
  [Chen] The way that retail sales of pagers and cellular 
phones are taxed is different from how retail food products are 
taxed. According to what we know, some pagers are now sold by 
the telecommunications bureau, and some are sold by stores on 
its behalf. Generally speaking, the prices of papers and 
cellular phones are made up of two parts: the prices of the 
pagers themselves and the prices charged by the 
telecommunications bureau. After a customer has purchased a 
pager, the telecommunications bureau has to provide the buyer 
the needed services, including labor services. As for cellular 
phones, some are also sold by the telecommunications bureau, and 
some are sold by retail stores. The prices of cellular phones, 
however, are different from pagers. Some prices are the prices 
of the phones themselves, and some prices also include 
telecommunications services to be provided in the future. This 
being the case, we have decided to impose business taxes on the 
prices of pagers or cellular phones sold by all units providing 
telecommunications services -- including the telecommunications 
bureau and other units engaging in the telecommunications 
business -- as well as service charges. The tax rate is 3 
percent. The sales of pagers and cellular phones alone are 
subject to value-added taxes. 
  When a retail store sells pagers or cellular phones on 
behalf 
of telecommunications units, the prices it charges are subject 
to value-added taxes, no matter whether or not labor services 
will be provided in the future. Of course, after this store has 
sold the equipment for the telecommunications units and 
delivered the money to them, we will not tax the 
telecommunications units for the money in question. 
  As for the sales of commodities such as cakes, pastries, and 
candies, they are taxed like other commodities. When they are 
sold, their pretax prices should be multiplied by 17 percent, 
and then the taxes stated in the special invoices issued when 
they were purchased should be subtracted from the total.

<F P=106> [Fourth of seven question-and-answer talks sponsored by the </F>
State Economic and Trade Commission and the State General 
Administration of Taxation, chaired by Jiang Qiangui, director 
of the State Economic and Trade Commission's Enterprise 
Department: "Answers to Questions Regarding Enterprises' 
Implementation of the New Tax System" -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Video opens with shots of three men and two 
women seated at a long table in a room, then cuts to show medium 
shots of the moderator] [Jiang] Viewers and comrades: We are 
presenting today the fourth lecture in the series "Answers to 
Questions Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax 
System." The major topics of this lecture are how to fill out 
value-added tax invoices, tax returns, and other relevant 
issues. Deputy Director [of the State General Administration of 
Taxation's Turnover Tax Department] Chen [Jie], could you please 
tell us how to fill out value-added tax invoice forms? 
  [Chen] As for how to fill out the form, detailed regulations 
can be found in the regulations governing the use of value-added 
tax invoices issued by the State General Administration of 
Taxation. Generally speaking, it is necessary to fill out the 
forms honestly. [words indistinct] I would like to explain 
technical problems such as how to fill out the price, amount, 
tax rate, and tax amount columns. First of all, prices which do 
not include value-added taxes should be filled in in the 
unit-price column. As for the sale amount, which is called the 
amount column in the invoice, it should be filled in with 
enterprises' sale amount, not including the value-added tax. As 
far as the tax rate is concerned, it depends on what tax 
category a specific commodity belongs to. For example, if the 
tax rate for the commodity is 17 percent, then you should write 
17 percent; if the tax rate is 13 percent, then you should write 
13 percent. As to the tax amount, its formula is as follows: 
the sale amount multiplied by the tax rate equals the tax 
amount. The tax amount should be filled in in the tax amount 
column. [passage omitted] 
  [Jiang] Do you have any question about this issue? 
  [Liu Jian, deputy manager of the Beijing Medical 
Radiographic 
Equipment Plant] When we levy value-added tax, we should show a 
tax certificate and fill in the tax certificate number in the 
form. Don't you think such a procedure is too complicated? 
  [Chen] When we sell commodities which are not tax-free, we 
must fill in commodity names and value-added tax amounts. The 
purchaser can file for tax refunds with the invoices on which 
tax rates are clearly indicted. Otherwise, they are not 
eligible for tax refunds. This procedure helps promote mutual 
supervision among enterprises. [passage omitted] 
  [Chen Shuqi, chief of the financial section of the No. 4 
Beijing Pharmaceutical Plant] Deputy Director Chen, products 
produced by pharmaceutical plants are often lost or damaged 
while being shipped. The procedure for returning products 
stipulated in the new taxation law is fairly complicated. Is it 
possible to retain the former procedure -- that is, to use the 
central bank's repudiation notice as evidence of a commodity 
return? 
  [Chen] I agree that the current regulations are relatively 
complicated. The current regulations, to put it simply, are 
this: If the purchaser returns the goods before paying for them 
or registering them in the account, the invoices for such goods 
should be returned. If the goods have been paid for or 
registered in the account, the purchaser should go to the local 
taxation organ to ask for a return certificate in duplicate. 
One copy of such a certificate should be returned to the 
seller. After receiving such a certificate, the seller shall 
issue a red invoice which should be sent to the purchaser. With 
this red invoice, the seller can readjust the sale income amount 
in the account record, while the purchaser can readjust the cost 
of the goods purchased. This procedure is indeed relatively 
complicated. [passage omitted] 
  [Zhang Qipeng, chief accountant of the Beijing Automobile 
Industrial Corporation] I have a question for you. We have a 
large amount of merchandise left over from 1993 on which we have 
paid taxes. Now we are not able to offset this tax payment. We 
do not know when we are allowed to offset this tax payment. We 
are waiting for detailed information. Because of this, we are 
suffering from insufficient operational funds. How are we 
supposed to solve this problem? Can this particular tax payment 
be reduced, exempted, or suspended? 
  [Chen] First of all, let me explain how to deal with the 
problem of tax payments for goods in stock. In 1994, your 
enterprise is allowed to calculate tax payments in three phases. 
In January and February, your enterprise is allowed to 
calculate monthly tax payments according to your amount of 
sales. The third phase covers the period from March to 
December. [passage omitted] 
  [Zhang Qipeng] My next question is about the reduction and 
exemption of value-added tax. Are enterprises allowed to 
postpone tax payments when they encounter financial problems? 
  [Chen] The problem concerning a reduction and exemption for 
value-added tax indeed exists. When enterprises experience 
financial problems, they are allowed to postpone their tax 
payment, but they have to apply for the postponement first. 
They can file a report with local taxation organs to explain 
temporary problems they are having. 
  [Jiang] Because the value-added tax is levied by the State 
General Administration of Taxation, shall such authorization 
procedures be approved by this organ? 
  [Chen] Concerning the limit of authorization, the general 
rule is this: Unified tax reduction and exemption is to be 
approved by the State General Administration of Taxation. Only 
central authorities have the power to decide on tax reduction or 
exemption. As for postponements of tax payments, enterprises can 
seek approval from local taxation organs. 
  [Jiang] This is the end of today's lecture.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wei Min: "New Policy Benefits Car </F>
Buyers"] 
  [Text] A new policy governing China's budding automotive 
industry seems appealing to both manufacturers eager for 
business and consumers who dream of owning a car. 
  The policy, which was approved by the government last month, 
for the first time orients the auto industry toward the 
interests of everyday consumers. 
  The policy document is kept confidential, but key points 
have 
been released by government officials. 
  China's market of 300 million households, comprising 1.18 
billion people, is potentially the world's largest. However, 
since the average worker earns only 4,000 yuan ($460) a year, 
most of the 1 million sedans now in use are owned by work units. 
  Experts predict that competition will be intense among auto 
makers, Chinese and foreign, to develop affordable small cars. 
  Business Weekly has learned that foreign companies such as 
America's General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co, France's 
Renault SA, Sweden's Volvo, South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co and 
Japan's Nissan Motor Co will launch components-manufacturing 
projects in China before long. 
  Industry observers are paying close attention because such 
projects can be developed into car-assembly plants in a short 
time. 
  China now has six assembly ventures with Germany's 
Volkswagen 
AG, France's Peugeot SA, America's Chrysler Corp and Japan's 
Suzuki Motor Corp. These plants produced 230,000 sedans last 
year. 
  "Don't worry about competition," a reform-minded official 
said. "Competition among auto makers benefits customers as well 
as the growing market economy." 
  The new policy does try to promote the development of 
domestic manufacturers. 
  For instance, it prohibits the approval of new assembly 
plants over the next two or three years. After that, approval 
will be withheld from projects that would assemble cars with 
complete knock-down components from overseas. 
  In new ventures at least 40 percent of the parts used in 
assembling cars must be made in China. In three years that 
proportion must be 60 percent. 
  Sources close to the negotiations with foreign auto makers 
say potential investors seem undeterred by the policy. 
  The market is too big to ignore, and all foreign 
manufacturers planning to invest in China say they like 
competition. 
  Aside from foreign auto makers quite a number of Chinese 
plants are developing low-priced cars. 
  Some claim that in a couple of years mini cars selling for 
20,000 yuan ($2,300) will be available. 
  Experts point out that low-priced vehicles are not 
necessarily low quality and heavily polluting. 
  Besides standards for safety, quality, fuel consumption and 
exhaust emissions, the experts say, manufacturers should also 
pay attention to road and repair conditions. 
  In addition to the 230,000 sedans made in China, about 
400,000 vehicles from overseas entered the country through 
various channels. 
  Car smuggling was rampant in 1992 and last year but has now 
been stopped. Nevertheless, people still ask if Chinese-made 
sedans will be good enough to compete with imports. 
  It is believed that China will have to cut tariffs on 
imported cars if, as expected, it rejoins the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) this year. 
  A long-time industry observer pointed out that current 
situation shows the government has not yet made up its mind to 
give the industry free rein to develop. 
  No official permission has been granted for large enterprise 
groups to raise urgently-needed development capital at home or 
abroad despite years of appeals.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Weimin: "Search for Oil Will Be </F>
Intensified"] 
  [Text] China is to beef up prospecting for new reserves of 
crude oil in its eastern part, where major oilfields are 
concentrated. 
  The efforts are expected to verify enough reserves to make 
up 
for declining production in old oilfields. 
  Fields in the eastern part produce some 124 million tons of 
oil a year. In addition, five oil-bearing areas are to be 
developed in the next three years and are expected to yield at 
least 10 million tons of oil annually. 
  Due to decades of exploitation, production at some old 
oilfields has slumped over the past three years. 
  New technology will be used to recover more oil from old 
fields and to develop heavy and super-heavy oil. 
  Measures for that purpose were outlined at what was billed 
as 
a "historic" conference held late last month by the China 
National Petroleum Corp (CNPC). 
  A senior official from CNPC's Production and Development 
Department last week said the measures have raised the 
confidence of Chinese. 
  In an interview with Business Weekly, the official, who 
declined to be identified said the five oil-bearing areas will 
be part of a "second battlefield" to launch major maneuvers by 
the energy industry. 
  The areas include the Liangjiang district of the Songliao 
Basin, a block covering parts of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region 
and the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu, and the shallow waters 
of the continental shelf in the Bohai Bay. 
  If successful, the measures will ensure that annual oil 
production in the eastern part remains above 124 million tons in 
the next seven years. 
  Last year onshore oilfields produced 139 million tons of 
oil. 
  China has expertise in enhancing the recovery of oil from 
old 
fields, but the official said major efforts are necessary to 
perfect the expertise and to develop new technology. 
  The official spoke highly of last month's conference, saying 
it was rare that nearly all senior officials and experts engaged 
in onshore oil production attended the week-long conference. 
  The official reiterated the importance of stabilizing 
production in the eastern part as a precaution in case big 
discoveries are not made soon in the Tarim, Turpan-Hami and 
Junggar basins in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The three 
basins are expected to be the core of oil production in the next 
century. 
  Some Chinese are wondering why the country, which lacks 
enough energy for an economy of 1.18 billion people, does not 
buy more oil from overseas when prices are only about $13 a 
barrel. 
  Instead, high-ranking officials and oil industry 
professionals seem to have worked out various plans for drawing 
every drop of oil out of the ground. 
  Officials from different sources have ruled out raising oil 
imports because the country lacks the foreign currency to pay 
for it. 
  China's imports of oil have been on the rise over the past 
several years and this year will be equal to exports. 
  But next year the country is likely to become a net importer 
of oil. Experts predict demand for crude oil will exceed 
planned production. 
  China imported 15 million tons of oil in 1993, compared with 
19.31 million in 1992. Last year oil exports were 19 million 
tons, 1.7 million less than in 1992.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Yanbin (3769 6056 1755): "Another Year of </F>
Ups and Downs in the Annual Upsurge of Migrants"; passages 
between slantlines published in boldface] 
  [Text] The annual upsurge of migrant workers was even 
worse this year. According to information from various 
localities, tens of millions of surplus rural laborers left home 
to find jobs elsewhere after the Spring Festival. Many of them 
left home to find urban jobs for the first time and became new 
members of the migrant community. 
  The most striking feature of the migrant upsurge is that 
tens 
of millions of peasants travel here and there to find jobs after 
the Chinese New Year, at a time when urban residents return home 
after visiting relatives in the countryside, and the two groups 
of travelers create a "spring travel tide." On the crest of the 
tide are the migrant peasants, who are particularly noticeable 
because of their large numbers. 
<H5>  What Causes the Upsurge in Migrant Workers </H5>
  The flow of large numbers of rural laborers began in the 
second half of the 1980's with the readjustment of the rural 
production structure and further economic development in the 
coastal regions. The migration reached its first high tide at 
about the time of the 1988 Spring Festival. Some of the rural 
laborers who worked in urban and coastal areas went home as a 
result of the economic retrenchment over the next three years, 
but the general trend of migration did not decrease. Since 
1991, the annual exodus of rural laborers has become larger and 
larger, causing concern among both the government and the people. 
  In a certain sense, the upsurge of migrant workers is a 
concentrated indication of the problems of rural areas, 
agriculture and peasants, showing fully the impedance caused by 
an excessive population to China's economic and social 
development after the opening up of the market. 
  The household contract responsibility system, which links 
remuneration to output, has solved the problem of feeding the 
rural population, but a growing surplus labor force has been 
created due to limitations on the availability of land. New 
village and town enterprises have created nearly 1 million jobs 
for the surplus rural labor force. However, job creation has 
been uneven from region to region and the problems of the 
surplus rural labor force are becoming worse and worse in 
central and western regions and in some of the less developed 
areas in coastal regions. In these regions peasant income has 
increased slowly and they lack development opportunities. Some 
of these peasants, not content with the situation, were the 
first to leave home and look for opportunities elsewhere. 
Following their lead, other villagers left home for coastal 
regions and cities. As a result, the exodus of rural laborers 
after each Spring Festival has become the biggest social news 
every year. 
  Generally speaking, the flow of the rural labor force from 
one province to another is part of the great historical process. 
Such spontaneous regulation and balancing of the labor force 
has, to a certain extent, helped some less developed rural areas 
become better off sooner, and has greatly supported economic 
development in the developed regions. 
  In Jiangsu's Wuxi County, which has the greatest economic 
strength of any county in China, migrant workers yield an annual 
output value of more than 5 billion yuan. 
  The leaders of some northwestern provinces and regions 
have openly pointed out: "After one person leaves home, the 
entire family will be freed from poverty." We should send 
surplus rural labor force to work elsewhere and deem the action 
an important way or even a strategic measure to free the people 
from poverty. 
  The peasants of Sichuan and Hunan Provinces working in other 
provinces send home their earnings of more than 10 billion yuan 
a year, and they are the major source of increased income of 
peasants. In many places where village and town enterprises are 
of weak foundation and poor economic efficiency, the total 
earnings of peasants working away from home are much greater 
than the total earnings of those enterprises. According to a 
most conservative estimate by the department concerned, the 
total annual earnings sent home by peasants across the country 
amount to 50 billion yuan. According to another estimate, the 
social wealth created by migrant workers across the country 
exceeds 3 billion yuan a year. 
  Of course the upsurge of migrant workers also poses a series 
of problems concerning urban and rural political affairs, 
economy, culture, and population. The Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee has unequivocally pointed out 
that the existing household registration system will be reformed 
in the near future. How to guide, coordinate, and organize such 
a large flow of migrant workers among provinces is a social 
problem demanding prompt solution. 
<H5>  Useful Exploration and Trial </H5>
  Guangdong Province was the first to disperse, guide, and 
manage migrant workers. Since as early as 1988, Guangdong has 
stepped up the management of the inter-provincial labor service 
market and promoted labor service cooperation. Now, some major 
labor-export provinces have set up labor service management 
offices in Guangdong. In this regard, Guangdong has found out 
some effective labor control methods. For instance, it 
invariably stops hiring migrant workers during the peak spring 
travel period -- January and February -- and migrant workers 
from other provinces must carry at all times in their person 
three certificates -- ID card, permit to work away from home 
issued by a labor department at the county level or above, and 
single status certificate or family planning certificate. 
  Through the establishment of a labor service market base, 
Beijing since 1991 has effectively managed migrant workers from 
other parts of the country. The municipal labor department has 
successively established a cooperative relationship in labor 
service with Hebei, Sichuan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and 
Gansu; and has gradually formulated rules and regulations which 
standardize the procedures for hiring migrant laborers to work 
in the construction, textile, and environmental protection 
fields. 
  Sichuan, a major labor export province, has adopted concrete 
measures. The provincial government has stipulated that each 
migrant worker group must have a leader or coordinator. If it 
is a very large group, the government will assign a cadre to 
travel with it and manage it. The province has set up labor 
service development leading groups and offices at and above the 
county level and established labor service training bases and 
labor service exchange markets. 
  Five million migrant workers from Hunan are working in other 
provinces. The provincial labor department has already joined 
Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and five other southern provinces 
and regions in establishing a labor service cooperation 
information network. It has also set up labor service offices 
in Guangdong and Zhuhai. More than 60 percent of the counties 
in Hunan have had offices in coastal regions. Those offices are 
responsible for collecting information, issuing certificates and 
registrations, arranging transportation, and providing escorts 
to travel with migrant groups. In this way, large numbers of 
laborers are organized to leave for labor service markets in 
coastal regions. 
  Tianjin Municipality in the past tried to expel and block 
migrant workers and imposed fines on them, but none of those 
efforts worked. In recent years, it has shifted its efforts from 
"blocking" to "dispersal" and the new efforts prove remarkably 
effective. For instance, Tianjin's Hongqiao District used to be 
the gathering place of a large number of rural laborers. The 
district labor department has set up an employment agency which 
can accommodate several hundred job seekers and even provide 
food and lodging service to some of them. 
  Tianjin Municipality has also built labor service bases in 
Shandong, Hebei, Jiangxi, and Anhui Provinces so that the job 
seekers can wait there for employment opportunities. Since the 
employment is through the labor service market, the blind flow 
of migrant workers has decreased. 
  While various localities were actively exploring ways for 
managing labor export, the Ministry of Labor in October 1993 
published an "urban and rural employment coordination plan." 
The plan specifically calls for organized efforts to guide 
rural labor exodus through legitimate channels, for the hiring 
regions to formulate necessary labor market rules and management 
system to manage incoming laborers, and for offering and 
improving services to migrant rural laborers during the entire 
course of their trans-regional travel. By implementing the 
plan, the Ministry of Labor expects to ensure an orderly labor 
force flow in all localities by the end of 1996. 
<H5>  Get at the Root of the Problem </H5>
  While it is necessary to organize and guide the flow of 
migrant workers at present, the permanent solution of the 
problem is to accelerate the economic development in the central 
and western regions so that more jobs will be created for the 
local surplus labor force. 
  Village and town enterprises are a large "container" to 
accept rural surplus labor force. They created 9.72 million 
jobs in 1992 and more than 7 million jobs in 1993. However, 
they are still far from being able to accept all the rural 
surplus labor force which is in hundreds of millions. The 
places of origin of migrant workers should consider local 
realities and make more efforts to develop economic projects 
that need smaller investment, yield quicker results, and hire 
more workers. Developed coastal regions should accelerate the 
relocation of their labor-intensive industries to less developed 
regions and absorb more surplus labor force into the secondary 
and the tertiary industries. 
  The development of "three-dimensional agriculture [li ti 
nong 
ye 4539 7555 6393 2814]" and high-yield, high-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture can refine the division of labor 
within the primary industry and absorb more rural labor force. 
  In recent years, there have been a number of townships and 
towns with quite developed secondary and tertiary industries in 
the central and western regions. They are like "sparks" 
illuminating the local economy. We can expect that with the 
rise of those industries, most of the central and western 
regions will be like coastal regions where some peasants leave 
crops field but not the village as they work for factories 
without having to go to cities.

  [Excerpt] The provincial united front work conference was 
held in Changchun on 8 April. At the conference, the guidelines 
of the national united front work conference were relayed and 
implemented, and demands were set on the province's united front 
work in the future. 
  He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
attended the conference and made a speech. He said: The 
party's united front work is extremely important to the new 
historical period. Major indicators are: The scale of the 
united front work is even wider, tasks even more important, and 
[words indistinct]. Thus, the united front work can only be 
strengthened rather than being neglected. The goal of the 
united front work lies in mass unity and mass alliance. By 
unity and alliance, we mean making friends with people on all 
sides. To make friends in an even better way, cadres on the 
united front are required to have new methods and new knowledge 
that are commensurate with the economy and trade. Without the 
knowledge on market economy and on new and high technology, it 
will be very difficult for cadres to do the united front work 
well. United front cadres must not only study Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on the socialism with Chinese characteristics 
but also study the theory on market economy and the knowledge in 
various other aspects so that they can raise the united front 
work in the new period to a new level. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Liaoning Province has defined its major tasks for 
conducting reform in the economic systems this year, which are 
as follows: A good job should be done in emphatically 
conducting reform among the state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises. Continuous efforts should be made to shift the 
operation mechanism of enterprises and to actively explore the 
method of establishing modern enterprise systems. Except for 
the four enterprises selected by the state for the pilot work of 
establishing modern enterprise systems, the province will select 
10 other enterprises to take up the pilot work in this regard 
this year. Various cities may also select their enterprises 
that have conditions in this regard to take up the pilot work. 
In line with the company system, we should carry out classified 
combination among enterprises that have conditions in this 
regard. A good job should be further done in conducting the 
pilot work of enforcing the share-holding system and efforts 
should be made to continuously increase the province's number of 
shares that can be sold at the stock markets. All advanced 
enterprises will be reorganized this year in line with the 
principle and standard of modern enterprise systems. Efforts 
should be made to establish new enterprise mechanism and to 
comprehensively push forward the reform in the property right 
systems of small enterprises so as to promote the optimization 
and combination of essential factors of production.

  [Text] Liaoning Province has scored marked achievements in 
clearing up illegal mobile telephones. It has discovered 1,399 
illegal mobile telephones users in 13 categories. In the past, 
some supply and marketing units have imported a large number of 
mobile telephones of various styles in spite of state 
regulations. Such telephone systems caused serious interference 
to radio and television broadcasting and to other radio 
facilities, about which the society lodged a strong complaint. 
Since the beginning of 1993, six units, including the provincial 
radio management committee and the provincial post and 
telecommunications bureau, jointly with localities throughout 
the province, started their work of ferreting out and handling 
the illegal mobile telephones. Various cities have basically 
been kept informed of the sale and usage of mobile telephones in 
their own localities by adopting various measures. Benxi city 
has cleared up and consolidated the sale markets and had six 
stores sealed up because they had seriously violated the 
regulations and refused to mend their ways despite repeated 
admonition. Dalian city confiscated mobile telephones from 78 
illegal users. The cities of Shenyang, Anshan, Tieling, and 
others have also adopted active measures to check the illegal 
mobile telephones. Through the large-scale activities of check, 
the province's radio environment has been purified and the 
interference encountered by the radio and television 
broadcasting stations and other radio facilities has achieved an 
obvious turn for the better.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Xuejun (1728 1331 6511): "Our Province </F>
Makes a Fairly Big Stride in Price Reform"] 
  [Text] Our province has achieved substantial progress in 
conducting price reform along the orientation of the socialist 
market economy, made big strides in changing the pricing 
mechanism and readjusting the pricing structure, strengthened 
the price monitoring work and the price regulation and control 
work, and effectively checked the inflation trend and the act of 
arbitrarily raising prices and pooling funds, donations, and 
fees. 
  We have strengthened the building of pricing monitoring 
network and enhanced the ability to cope with the changes in 
market prices. Liaoning Province's initially built price 
monitoring network has monitored the macroeconomic situation of 
the whole province and the changes in the prices of essential 
means of production, farm and sideline products, and consumer 
goods after pricing reform was carried out in various cities and 
counties. Through tracking and monitoring the situations in 14 
large commercial enterprises, six wholesale markets, and 10 
large production enterprises across the province, this network 
has provided reliable information and policymaking basis for 
governments at all levels to keep abreast of the local pricing 
situation in a timely manner, to grasp the price reform 
strength, and to select major pricing reform items. In March 
last year, the prices of eggs continued to decline and were 
lower than the production cost in some cities. On the basis of 
carrying out monitoring work, Shenyang and Yingkou Price Bureaus 
studied countermeasures, urged the governments to purchase and 
store eggs for future use, and succeeded in raising the prices 
of eggs within a short period of time and avoiding the situation 
of stopping to raise chicken. 
  We have improved a guiding mechanism in which the prices are 
formed mainly by the market, and cultivated the markets to 
ensure their sound development. Our provincial pricing 
departments have regarded entering the market as a strategic 
task for establishing the new price regulation and control 
system. The pricing departments across the province have 
entered and stationed in 58 means of production, real estate, 
and farm produce markets. The price inspectors stationed in the 
markets have publicized the state commodity price laws and 
regulations, and pricing policies, promulgated and disseminated 
relevant pricing information, participated in market 
construction, and supervised units entering the markets and 
businessmen to observe the state pricing laws and regulations. 
Pricing departments at all levels have also actively 
coordinated the prices in various trades and guaranteed that 
commodity prices were kept relatively stable within a certain 
period of time. 
  We have applied economic, administrative, and legal means to 
regulate and control the market prices. At present, price 
regulation funds have been established in 12 cities and 21 
counties. Last year, we invested 50 million yuan in stabilizing 
the prices of some major nonstaple foods whose cost rose or 
declined suddenly, the market prices of major nonstaple foods 
during festive days, and the prices of commodities essential to 
people's life, stabilized the prices of the "vegetable baskets," 
and ensured that the prices are linked with the price index 
control target. 
  Last year, following the decontrol of meat, vegetable and 
coal prices in the province, 14 cities across the province 
generally decontrolled the marketing price of grain. Most of 
the prices of commodities under the management of provincial and 
city authorities had been decontrolled. Considering the 
province's total purchase of agricultural products, 90.4 percent 
of the products were purchased at market adjusted prices, of the 
total retail sales of commodities, 96.6 percent of the 
commodities were sold at market adjusted prices, and of the 
total sales of the means of production, 87.4 percent of the 
products were sold at market adjusted prices, and these three 
figures were higher than the national average. Thus, we have 
initially formed a new price operational mechanism with market 
adjusted prices as the mainstay. The adjustment of prices of 
railway transport, freight transport, electricity, oil products, 
state-allocated timber, and of bus tickets and tape water supply 
of some cities has played an active role in alleviating the 
difficulties in our province's basic industry and promoting a 
more rapid development in the national economy.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- North-east China's 
Liaoning Province will launch a massive campaign to build new 
reservoirs and river diversion works, in a bid to remove the 
ever-worsening water shortages. 
  On top of the agenda are four huge reservoirs -- Guanyinge, 
Dongfeng, Baishi and Yanwangbizi -- the first of which will be 
able to hold 950 million cubic m of water, official sources here 
said. 
  River water will also be diverted into Jinxi and Dalian, to 
relieve the water shortages in the two major manufacturing 
cities in the province. 
  Another diversion project is planned to start in 1998 to 
supply 1.88 billion cubic m of water a year to the western part 
of the province from the eastern. 
  As one of the Chinese provinces with the largest industry, 
Liaoning's available water resources per person are only 
one-third of the national average. Its industry is losing 10 
billion yuan a year from water shortages, according to the 
sources. 
  The province plans to invest as much as 11 billion yuan in 
these projects, which will be completed by the year 2010. 
  To secure its water demands up to the year 2030, Liaoning 
also plans to divert water from neighbouring Heilongjiang and 
Jilin provinces, the sources said.

  [Text] Lanzhou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Five major nonferrous 
metal bases have taken shape in Gansu Province of northwest 
China with state assistance during the past decade. 
  Last year, the output of nonferrous metals in the province 
was nearly 400,000 tons, 95 percent of which came from the five 
bases, and the amount accounted for 12 percent of the country's 
total nonferrous metals output. 
  Dozens of rare earth materials and nonferrous metal 
products, 
including silver, copper, aluminum, lead, zinc, barium, nickel 
and cobalt, are being sold on world markets. 
  Local government officials attribute the achievement to the 
state's large sum of investment during the past decade when the 
central government injected some five billion yuan (about 574.7 
million U.S. dollars at the present exchange rate) to upgrade 
such metals manufacturers.

  [Text] Yinchuan, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The remote Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Region in Northwest China has kept up its tradition 
of caring for the environment and made great achievements in 
controlling industrial pollution in cities and preserving the 
good ecological environment. 
  Located in the arid and semi-arid area, Ningxia has a 
population of 4.9 million, one third being of the Hui 
nationality. 
  The Hui people are well known for personal hygiene and like 
to grow flowers, lawns and trees. 
  "It is their good habit and tradition that have made it easy 
for the regional government to push through its environment 
protection measures," said Sun Ningzhang, director of the 
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional Environment Protection Agency. 
  Sun noted that the rapid economic development has inevitably 
caused pollution. To control it, the regional government has 
worked out a package of rules and regulations while building a 
number of pollution prevention and control facilities. 
  All these have got enthusiastic support from the local 
people. 
  A survey shows that the regional capacity of treating waste 
water has doubled, and that of treating waste gas increased by 
45 percent. 
  So far the region has transformed 267,000 hectares of sandy 
land and 8,390 square kilometers of areas suffering from soil 
erosion. 
  In addition, the region has planted trees on 267,000 
hectares 
of hilly areas and set up some nature reserves of animals and 
plants.

  [Text] The second provincial power installations 
protection work conference was recently convened by the 
provincial public security department and the electric power 
industry bureau. 
  Thanks to faster hydropower resource exploitation, the 
province's electric power industry has witnessed an 
unprecedentedly fast growth, resulting in the construction of 
more power installations across the province in the past year. 
Thus, protecting power installations has become a pressing 
issue confronting the province's electric power and public 
security departments. 
  The conference revealed: In 1993, a total of 121 cases of 
stealing or sabotaging electric power installations occurred, 49 
of which were major and serious cases, inflicting direct 
economic losses of about 400,000 yuan. A growing number of 
similar cases occurred in the first quarter of this year 
compared with the same period of last year, some posing a real 
threat to the province's normal production. 
  The conference participants unanimously held: At present, it 
is imperative to conduct exhaustive education on the importance 
and urgency of protecting power installations by proceeding from 
the overall interests of social stability; properly solve such 
problems as power supply disputes between adjacent counties and 
between adjacent villages; properly handle, by seeking 
government assistance, such incidents as besieging power plants, 
beating and abusing power plant staff and workers, and other 
similar incidents; step up investigations as well as crackdowns 
on such criminal activities as theft or sabotaging power 
installations and other similar activities; and make redoubled 
efforts to rectify the salvage market with an eye on blocking 
the source of income of the criminals. 
  The conference urged public security organs at all levels 
across the province to assist security departments of the 
electric power organs in strengthening safety management of 
large power plants, large power stations, large transformer 
substations, and key power supply lines; rectify and maintain 
social order in adjacent villages; and take full precautions 
against the outbreak of similar incidents in the future.

  [Text] Xining, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's 
Qinghai Province will invest more than 200 million yuan in 
telecommunications construction this year. 
  Telecommunications service in Qinghai, an inland province, 
is 
underdeveloped at present. 
  Chen Jian, deputy director of Qinghai's provincial posts and 
telecommunications, said that the investment will mainly be used 
to transform the telephone networks in Xining city and Golmud 
city as well as seven counties in eastern Qinghai. 
  The state has approved Qinghai's use of 10 million U.S. 
dollars in Australian Government loans and introduction of 
78,000-line program-controlled telephone exchanges from Alcel of 
Australia. 
  The local government in Qinghai will be responsible for 
raising more than 100 million yuan for the project, Chen added. 
  According to the Qinghai provincial posts and 
telecommunications plan, the number of telephone lines in Xining 
city will increase from the present 25,000 to 74,000 by the end 
of this century. 
  In Golmud city, telephone lines will increase from the 
present 2,000 to 12,000. 
  The total telephone lines in the province will increase from 
the present 30,000 to 140,000. 
  Now Qinghai is planning to undertake several projects to 
install fiber optic cables and two satellite telecommunications 
lines.

  [Excerpts] A provincial township and town enterprises work 
conference ended on 24 March. 
  The conference called on all comrades to work hard and 
strive 
to raise the province's total township and town enterprise 
output value to 1.4 billion yuan, total township and town 
enterprise income to 1.35 billion yuan, and the total amount of 
taxes and profits realized by township and town enterprises to 
140 million yuan. 
  The conference also urged all comrades concerned to make 
redoubled efforts to comprehensively improve township and town 
enterprise quality; upgrade township and town enterprise 
products; and increase township and town enterprise economic 
efficiency. [passage omitted] 
  Provincial Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao delivered a speech in 
which he stated: 1993 saw rapid township and town enterprise 
growth in Qinghai with the result that the province's total 
township and town enterprise output value exceeded 1 billion 
yuan, reaching 1.12 billion yuan; total township and town 
enterprise income reached 1.08 billion yuan; and the total 
amount of taxes and profits realized by township and town 
enterprises topped 105 million yuan. 
  Vice Governor Ma Yuanbiao maintained: So long as we adhere 
to reform and opening up, implement correct policies, adopt 
effective measures, dare to scale new heights, cultivate a 
pragmatic work style, and work in a down-to-earth manner, we 
will certainly be able to more rapidly develop township and town 
enterprises in remote, border, and economically backward areas. 
Moreover, he stated, areas where conditions allow should also 
waste no time in developing foreign-funded enterprises, tertiary 
industry, and labor services export. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs issued a three-point statement Tuesday [12 April] 
expressing deep regret and dissatisfaction over the U.S. 
imposition of trade sanctions on Taiwan's wildlife products. 
  On Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an order 
prohibiting import of wildlife specimens and products from 
Taiwan in retaliation for Taiwan's alleged continued trade in 
rhino horns and tiger bone. 
  The Foreign Ministry called the sanctions "obviously unfair 
and unjust," and criticized Washington for ignoring Taiwan's 
effort in wildlife conservation, which "is far greater than that 
of the neighboring countries or areas in this region." 
  The ministry, however, reiterated that Taiwan remains 
"determined and committed to the cause of wildlife conservation 
in spite of the unilateral U.S. sanctions." 
  Moreover, the ministry urged all ROC [Republic of China] 
citizens "to recognize the global trend of conservation and 
comply with the pertinent laws and regulations in full 
cooperation with the government by refraining from smuggling, 
trading, consuming, exchanging, or possessing endangered species 
and their derivatives so as to dissolve the international 
pressure of sanctions." 
  The sanctions will reportedly result in U.S.$20 million to 
U.S.$25 million in annual losses for Taiwan and will limit 
exports of farmed crocodile skins, orchids and farmed coral, 
local trade officials said. 
  Sanctions will take effect in 30 days and will continue 
until 
December 1994, when the U.S. will review conservation programs 
in Taiwan and decide whether to extend the import prohibitions.

  [Text] Washington, April 11 (CNA) -- Representative Ding 
Mou-shih of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs 
Monday [11 April] expressed deep regret at the U.S. decision to 
impose trade sanctions against Taiwan for its alleged trade in 
endangered species parts and products. 
  "It is deeply regrettable that the United States has decided 
to rush ahead with sanctions against (Taiwan), despite the 
recommendation by the Standing Committee of the United Nations 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (to 
postpone sanctions)," Ding, head of Taiwan's non-official 
representative in the U.S. said in a statement. 
  He said that Taiwan has made aggressive efforts to eradicate 
the trade in endangered species, adding that "we are concerned 
that sanctions will cause an unnecessary negative reaction on 
the part of our people." 
  Ding added that the Executive Yuan has approved amendments 
to 
Taiwan's wildlife conservation law that significantly increase 
punishments for those convicted of trafficking in endangered 
species, and that these amendments are expected to be passed by 
the Legislative Yuan soon. 
  Taiwan has been conducting an island-wide crackdown on 
establishments suspected of selling rhino horn and tiger parts, 
he said. Of the 519 shops that have been investigated so far, 
six were found to be selling products containing rhino horn 
powder and 22 were found to be selling tiger products, he added. 
  Ding reiterated Taiwan's commitment to eradicating the trade 
in endangered species, and said he believes that dialogue and 
cooperation rather than sanctions are the best means of 
achieving progress toward the elimination of endangered species 
trade.

  [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 11 (CNA) -- The Republic 
of China [ROC] is welcome to join the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as soon as possible, GATT 
Director-General Peter Sutherland said here Monday [11 April]. 
  Sutherland made the statement while meeting with ROC 
Economic 
Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang at a reception given by the 
Moroccan Government in honor of delegates from some 150 
countries to a GATT ministerial meeting scheduled to open here 
Tuesday. 
  As Taiwan is a major trading country, Sutherland said he 
believes Taiwan's accession to GATT will help boost the healthy 
development of a world trading system. 
  Sutherland further said Taiwan's GATT membership application 
has nothing to do with Mainland China's. 
  "They are two separate cases and are being screened by two 
different working groups," he explained. 
  "So I think there is no such problem as which side of the 
Taiwan Strait should join GATT first," he said. "Either side 
which can win the support of two-thirds of GATT contracting 
parties will enter the body first," he added. 
  Taiwan applied to join GATT as a separate customs territory 
in 1990 and was awarded observer status in the world trade 
regulatory body in 1992. It hopes to become a full member by 
the end of this year. Mainland China, which applied for GATT 
membership in 1986, is also a GATT observer. 
  Chiang, heading a 15-member delegation, arrived here Sunday 
to attend the four-day GATT ministerial meeting, which will set 
the seal on a sweeping new world trade treaty, also known as the 
Uruguay Round accord. 
  While here, Chiang will hold informal tariff concession 
talks 
with delegates from the Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, 
Egypt, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and the United 
States with a view to accelerating Taiwan's entry into GATT, 
which is scheduled to be superseded by the World Trade 
Organization next January.

  [Text] The 1994 report on foreign trade barriers, 
published by the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR], gives a 
positive evaluation on the overall measures taken by the 
Republic of China [ROC] to open its markets. Commenting on the 
USTR's report, Minister of Economic Affairs Chiang Ping-kun said 
on 1 April: As the ROC's trade surplus against the United 
States has been significantly reduced and tariffs on some 
industrial products have been cut to the level of advanced 
countries, our country should be able to avoid facing the U.S. 
Super 301 action. 
  The minister added: The ROC's efforts at protecting 
intellectual property rights [IPR] should be affirmed. Last 
year the problem of imitation was not as serious as in previous 
years, and exports of replicas decreased considerably. Our 
country should be dropped or downgraded from the special 301 
priority observation list. 
  The USTR report's section dealing with the ROC consists of 
seven major categories, including import policy, testing 
standards, government procurement, IPR protection, service 
trades, and investment. 
  According to the Board of Foreign Trade, so far as tariffs 
are concerned, the United States takes note of the ROC's 
progress in lowering import duties, but still maintains that 
those on farm products and automobile parts are overly high; in 
IPR protection, Washington views the situation in the ROC as 
having improved, but believes that serious problems remain in 
implementation. Moreover, Washington regards the ROC's fourth 
TV station's unauthorized relay of satellite programs as a very 
serious problem; and it deems the ROC's patent reviewing system 
as not yet totally open. 
  The USTR's report shows deep concern over the ROC's 
financial 
service trade, investment barriers, monopolistic measures, and 
telecommunications service. Take, as examples, the U.S. Mutual 
Insurance Company's inability to set up a branch office in 
Taiwan, the ban on insurance companies setting up subsidiaries 
in Taiwan; the restrictions on investing in domestic insurance 
companies, and the ban on investing in housing and real estate. 
  The minister said: Taiwan's trade barriers, such as high 
tariffs on certain products and restrictions on imports to 
certain areas, have been included in the agenda of negotiations 
with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]; and they 
will be resolved once the negotiations for GATT membership are 
completed. Therefore, Taiwan should be able to avoid facing 
Super 301 action.

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- The cabinet-level 
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) announced Tuesday [12 April] that 
it will temporarily suspend all government funded cultural and 
educational activities with Mainland China. 
  The Education Ministry also announced it will no longer 
accept applications for mainland artists to perform in Taiwan. 
  MAC Vice Chairman Su Chi said resumption of cross-strait 
cultural and educational activities will depend on how Beijing 
responds to a mysterious boat fire in Mainland China in which 24 
Taiwan tourists died. 
  Some of the activities affected by the suspensions include a 
planned visit by a mainland printing industry group and a 
delegation of presidents from ten Chinese medicine institutes. 
  A trip to the mainland by members of Taiwan's mass media 
will 
also be cancelled. 
  Meanwhile, Taipei Association of Travel Agents President Hsu 
Chin-jui said the MAC will announce an all-out travel boycott 
against Mainland China within one or two days. 
  Hsu said the travel association will cooperate with the 
boycott and urged all other travel agents to join.

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- Cross-Taiwan Strait trade 
exchanges will be put on hold in the wake of a mysterious boat 
fire in Mainland China in which 24 Taiwan tourists died, the 
Economics Ministry said Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Economic officials said all normal exchanges will be 
suspended until Beijing settles the incident reasonably. 
  They added they will suspend the review process for Taiwan 
applications to invest in the Mainland and will also prohibit 
imports of mainland goods. 
  The officials said plans to allow the visit of mainland 
economists and entrepreneurs will also be put on hold. 
  Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien said that the 
ministry will make the adjustments in line with a policy mapped 
out by the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC). 
  Yang added that he did not know how long the prohibitions 
will last. 
  Meanwhile, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) Monday said it 
will suspend the approval process for imports of semi-finished 
products from the mainland. 
  Since Premier Lien Chan unveiled an economic stimulus 
project 
last July, Taiwan has approved the import of 1,788 semi-finished 
products from the mainland, BOFT officials said. 
  Semi-finished products approved before the suspension will 
still be allowed into Taiwan, they noted.

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- In the wake of the Lake 
Qiandao disaster, Mainland China has agreed to a Taiwan request 
to hold talks on the protection of Taiwan tourists, investors 
and their property on the mainland as soon as possible, 
according to vice chairman and secretary-general Chiao Jen-ho of 
the Straits Exchange Foundation. 
  Twenty-four Taiwan tourists and eight mainland guides and 
crew members were found dead in a lower deck cabin of a tour 
boat on Lake Qiandao in the coastal Province of Zhejiang on 
March 31. The incident prompted waves of protest in Taiwan 
because of Beijing's obstruction into investigation of the 
matter by relatives of the victims and Taiwan reporters. 
  Tang Shubei, Standing Vice Chairman of the mainland's 
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), and 
SEF Deputy Secretary-General Shih Chi-ping reached the decision 
in a meeting Tuesday [12 April] in Beijing. 
  The SEF and ARATS are authorized by Taipei and Beijing to 
handle cross-strait exchanges. 
  Tang also agreed that Beijing would more thoroughly 
investigate the incident. The mainland had earlier claimed the 
disaster was accidental, but later said sabotage was possible. 
  Tang expressed the hope that both sides would take necessary 
measures to minimize the negative impact on cross-strait 
exchanges brought about by the incident. Taipei on Tuesday 
announced the suspension of cultural and trade exchanges with 
the mainland over the tragedy. Many tour agents also announced 
a boycott of mainland trips. 
  He said after the meeting that Beijing was concerned about 
how the investigation into the matter was being handled, and has 
instructed relevant agencies, including the Taiwan Affairs 
Council and Zhejiang Province authorities, to probe more deeply 
into the case.

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan 
emphasized Tuesday that the Republic of China [ROC] is a 
peace-loving country and has no plans to manufacture nuclear 
weapons. 
  "This is the principle the government has adhered to and it 
should be understood by the world," Lien said in reply to an 
inquiry on the issue by Democratic Progressive Party legislator 
Chou Po-lung. 
  Although Chou is an opponent of Taiwan's fourth nuclear 
power 
plant project, he nevertheless suggested that the government 
accelerate the development of nuclear devices as a hedge against 
the Mainland Chinese threat. 
  "Peace in the region can be maintained only by the creation 
of mutual assurance of destruction over the skies of the Taiwan 
Strait," Chou said. 
  He said developing nuclear weapons is necessary if Taiwan 
wants to be independent of Mainland China. He warned, however, 
that announcing independence without a deterrent force to back 
up the proclamation would invite disaster.

  [Text] Brasilia, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- Brazilian President 
Itamar Franco on 5 April met Chi Haotian in Brasilia. Chi, 
Chinese state councillor and concurrently defense minister, is 
currently on a visit to Brazil. 
  Chi Haotian conveyed President Jiang Zemin's greetings to 
Franco, saying that the Chinese president is looking forward to 
the Brazilian president's visit to China next month. He added 
that the expansion of friendly relations between China and 
Brazil is of great importance to regional and world peace. 
  Franco expressed appreciation for President Jiang Zemin's

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva is in China. He is 
accompanied by dozens of businessmen wanting to secure a market 
of almost 2 billion people. Paulo Lavadinho reports from 
Beijing. 
  [Lavadinho] This is the largest ever delegation to accompany 
the prime minister. He arrived in Beijing seven years after 
having signed with Prime Minister Zao Ziang the Joint 
Declaration on Macao. It was at the People's Palace, where this 
morning, after receiving military honors in Tiananmen square, he 
held the first official meetings. 
  During the welcoming ceremony, the Chinese prime minister 
stressed the excellent relations between the two countries and 
expressed his government's satisfaction over the transition 
period in Macao. Cavaco Silva also recalled his government's 
wish to resolve all matters pertaining to the territory, always 
at the negotiating table. 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] Futhermore, I would like to 
stress -- as I did seven years ago -- the commitment of the 
Portuguese Government to the implementation of the articles 
enshrined in the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and to the 
continuing dialogue between Portugal and China regarding Macao 
with a view to giving its people stability and progress and the 
safeguarding of their way of life and cultural specificity after 
1999. [end recording] 
  [Lavadinho] No details regarding the talks have emerged. At 
dinner Cavaco Silva and Li Peng talked once more about the 
unresolved issues regarding Macao. However, both heads of 
government advocated good relations between China and the EU.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng and visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva 
today pledged that they will make joint efforts to further 
strengthen friendly bilateral ties and promote good cooperation 
on the issue of Macao. 
  The two premiers expressed the pledge during their talks at 
the Great Hall of the People here this morning. 
  Li said that relations between the two countries have 
developed smoothly since they established diplomatic ties 15 
years ago. 
  Especially over the past few years, he added, the exchange 
of 
visits between high-ranking officials of the two countries has 
increased and the bilateral relationship has been growing. 
  Li said China places great importance on its economic 
relations and trade with Portugal on the basis of equality and 
mutual benefit and will send a purchasing group to Portugal at 
an appropriate time. 
  Extending his warm welcome to Portuguese entrepreneurs who 
are accompanying the prime minister on the visit, Li said it is 
his hope that industrialists and businessmen of the two 
countries will have wide contacts and explore various ways for 
cooperation, to enable bilateral trade to rise by a big margin 
and expand the scale of bilateral economic cooperation. 
  Praising the fruitful cooperation between China and Portugal 
on the issue of Macao, Li said the Macao society is stable and 
its economy is growing steadily. The residents of Macao have 
full confidence in its future, he said. 
  The facts demonstrate that earnestly implementing the Sino- 
Portuguese Joint Declaration conforms to the interests of the 
two countries and cooperation benefits them both. 
  He expressed the belief that so long as the two sides, as 
always, act in accordance with the spirit of friendly 
consultation, various issues concerning the transitional period 
of Macao can be properly settled and Macao can realize a stable 
transition and smooth transfer of power in 1999. 
  Silva said he was very pleased to have the chance to revisit 
China on the occasion of the 7th anniversary of the signing of 
the Portugal-China Joint Declaration on the question of Macao. 
  He expressed the hope that this visit will give impetus to 
the smooth implementation of the joint declaration and promote 
the growth of bilateral relations. 
  Silva said the Portuguese Government consistently attaches 
great importance to its relations with China. He has brought a 
large delegation of entrepreneurs with him to China, which he 
said vividly shows that the Portuguese Government and 
entrepreneurs have sincere aspirations for and are eager to 
develop Portugal-China economic ties and trade. 
  He said the Portuguese Government and people pay great 
attention to the question of Macao and are looking attentively 
at Macao's future and stability. 
  "What we are gratified at is that the two countries have had 
very good cooperation on the question of Macao in the spirit of 
friendly trust. 
  "The joint declaration is being implemented smoothly, which 
gives us full confidence in Macao's future," he said. 
  On international issues, Li said that after the end of the 
Cold War, the world people's demands for the establishment of a 
new international political and economic order has daily become 
stronger. 
  This is the need of the times and also the inevitable result 
of the development of the international situation, he said. 
  Li said the new world order should be based on the five 
principles of peaceful co-existence. Countries, big or small, 
strong or weak, rich or poor, all have the right to be involved 
in international affairs and can make their due contributions to 
this end. 
  He said international affairs should not be decided by one 
or 
several big powers in the world. Therefore China supports the 
current world trend toward multipolarization. 
  The Chinese premier said China attaches great importance to 
developing its ties with European countries, adding: "We have no 
conflicts of interests and our economies are mutually 
complementary and have great potential." 
  He said China thanks Portugal for its support of the 
resumption of China's status as a signatory party to the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  During the talks, Li recalled with pleasure his visit to 
Portugal in February 1992. 
  Silva invited Li Peng to visit Portugal again and the 
Chinese 
premier expressed his thanks and accepted the invitation with 
pleasure. 
  Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and 
visiting Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso 
participated in the talks. 
  After the talks the two premiers attended a ceremony for 
signing a framework loan agreement between the Bank of China and 
the National Overseas Bank of Portugal (Banco Nacional 
Ultramarino). 
  According to the agreement, the Portuguese bank will provide 
the Bank of China with a credit line of 200 million U.S. dollars. 
  This is the first instrument of credit between the banks of 
the two countries and also the largest credit agreement signed 
between the two countries. 
  This evening, Li Peng hosted a banquet here in honor of 
Silva 
and his wife and their party.

journalists in Beijing including Sandor Svabi, correspondent of

  [Svabi] [passage omitted] According to Janos Latorcai, 
Hungarian industry still has serious opportunities in China, but

had sold to German firms the Chinese state's debts to Hungary. 
He said that this year, Beijing would like to settle the 
Chinese trade deficit of 108 million Swiss francs. It has been 
mentioned that China would repay the debt through Chinese goods. 
  By the way, the minister described his negotiations in China 
as definitely successful. Several preliminary agreements have 
been concluded. Discussions are being held about the creation

  [Text] Tirana, April 10 (XINHUA) -- It is a positive step 
for China to develop a market economy with its own 
characteristics, Albanian Parliament Speaker Pjeter Arbnori told 
XINHUA here before his coming visit to China. 
  Arbnori, who is leaving for China Monday [11 April] at the 
invitation of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) for 
the first visit of its kind in about 20 years, will be the 
highest- ranking Albanian official to travel to China since the 
Albanian Democratic Party came to power in 1992. 
  He said that significant changes have taken place in both 
Albania and China and ideology is no longer the condition for 
developing relations of cooperation. 
  Recent years have witnessed rapid progress in China in 
various areas and that is to the credit of, above all, the 
introduction of a market economy, Arbnori said. 
  "Sure," the Albanian speaker added, "China is developing a 
market economy with Chinese characteristics in the light of its 
specific conditions. That is positive." 
  Noting that there exist no obstacles to expanding ties 
between the two countries, which have broad prospects for 
cooperation, he predicted that the bilateral relations will 
further improve and develop. 
  He stressed that "Albania adheres to a very important 
principle, that is to recognize only one China -- the People's 
Republic of China." 
  He hoped that China will contribute to the peaceful solution 
of the Balkan issue as it is playing an important role in major 
world affairs as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. 
  During his visit to China, Arbnori said, he will learn more 
about the NPC's work, China's experience in building the legal 
system and the progress in China's economy.

River and the bund on the western bank of the river. It will 
become the busiest district in Shanghai, with a population of 
more than 200,000 and a floating population of 500,000. The

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji respectively met 
visiting French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and exchanged 
views with him on promoting Sino-French relations here this 
afternoon. 
  Jiang emphasized that it is very important to maintain a 
sound cooperative relation between China and France in a complex 
and volatile world. 
  Zhu said it takes time to restore and improve Sino-French 
trade and economic relations. He believes they will grow 
quickly through joint efforts. 
  Balladur said the two countries have identical or similar 
views in many fields, and there is a large room to improve 
bilateral ties. 
  The meeting between Jiang Zemin and Balladur took place in 
Zhongnanhai. Jiang hailed the normalization of Sino-French 
relations, and appreciated Balladur's efforts in restoring and 
improving bilateral ties after he took office. 
  Jiang believed that Balladur's current tour will lead to 
further development of Sino-French relations. 
  Jiang said China and France, with long history and splendid 
cultures, have contributed greatly to the world civilizations, 
and the two peoples enjoy traditional friendship and friendly 
cooperations. Many Chinese leaders of the older generation 
studied and lived in France. 
  Jiang said since China and France established diplomatic 
ties 
some 30 years ago, effective cooperation in the fields of 
politics, economy and trade, science and technology and culture 
have been conducted, despite the difficulties and bumps facing 
the two countries. 
  "We consider it very wise and foresighted decision made by 
late Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and General de 
Gaulle to cement diplomatic ties when looking back the 
development of Sino-French relations," Jiang said. [sentence as 
received] 
  He emphasized that as permanent members of the UN Security 
Council, China and France should contribute more to safeguarding 
world peace and security, he said. 
  China and France have good basis of cooperation given that 
they have no fundamental interests conflicts while holding 
identical or similar views on many major international issues, 
he said. [sentence as received] 
  The two countries are complementary economically, which 
provide good conditions for trade and economic cooperation, 
Jiang said, adding that he believe Sino-French trade and 
economic cooperation will rise to a new height and a lot more 
concerned will be done once a favourable political atmosphere is 
created and bilateral political relations improved. 
  Balladur extended President Mitterrand's greetings to Jiang 
and invited him to visit France on behalf of Mitterrand. 
  Balladur said Mitterrand looked forward to further 
development of France-China relations. 
  Jiang thanked for the invitation and asked Balladur to 
convey 
his greetings to Mitterrand. 
  In another meeting held at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, 
Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji told Balladur that China appreciates his 
speech in Paris that France-China relations have entered a new 
phase. 
  Zhu added that China is willing to exert efforts to develop 
its relations with France. 
  Balladur said his talks with Premier Li Peng yesterday 
indicated that France and China share many identical or similar 
views, there is a great potential for improvement of bilateral 
cooperation. 
  Zhu and Balladur exchanged views on how to develop 
Sino-French trade and economic relations in friendly atmosphere. 
  He also briefed the guest on China's reform and opening-up. 
  Among those present at the meeting were chairman of the 
Chinese Government Reception Committee and Minister of Power 
Industry Shi Dazhen, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and 
Minister of Industry, Posts, Telecommunications and Foreign 
Trade Gerard Longuet. 
  Besides meeting with Chinese leaders, the French Prime 
Minister visited Beijing Zhong-Pu Electro Refractory Co., Ltd. 
and the Forbidden City this morning. 
  Zhong-Pu is the first joint venture in the Chinese electro 
refractory industry, co-sponsored by the original Beijing Glass 
Refractory Factory and S.E.P.R., a French company taking a 
leading position in the electro fused industry world-wide. 
  Balladur expressed his admiration when seeing the 
well-preserved Forbidden City, saying "Chinese, like other 
peoples in the world, have bestowed new vitality on history." 
  Tian Jiyun, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress, today met and hosted a banquet for 
the two vice-presidents of France's National Assembly, Gilles de 
Robien and Pierre-Andre Wiltzer, accompanying Balladur to China.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Teng Wenqi: "Crucial Week for S. </F>
African April Elections"] 
  [Text] Johannesburg, April 11 (XINHUA) -- A showdown might 
come out this week among South Africa's chief political players 
over the situation in the eastern South African province of 
Natal, the kwaZulu homeland in particular. 
  President F. W. de Klerk, African National Congress (ANC) 
President Nelson Mandela, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and 
Inkatha Freedom Party President Mangosuthu Buthelezi held a 
crisis summit on April 8 on the situation in Natal and the 
adjoining kwaZulu homeland. 
  The Zulu king declared independence of the `Zulu Kingdom' on 
March 18 and called on the Zulu people to boycott South Africa's 
first non-racial elections scheduled on April 26-28. 
  The government and the ANC tried to persuade the king to 
drop 
his claim in exchange for a guarantee for the accommodation of 
the Zulu king position in the new constitution. 
  However, they did not reach any agreement at the summit 
except establishing a working group to deliberate on various 
proposals and report back to the respective leaders on April 14. 
  This week is considered crucial for the April 26-28 
elections 
as the time is short for more talks and various preparations. 
  Observers here are suspicious very much on the results of 
the 
second meeting of the four leaders due this week. 
  They do not believe the Zulu king, with the support of 
Buthelezi, who is also chief minister of the kwaZulu homeland 
government, will change his position in such a short period. 
And, his demands are far beyond the government or the ANC to be 
able to meet. 
  On the contrary, the observers believe the kwaZulu homeland 
might face an intensified security crackdown if the last gasp 
talks this week fail to produce a breakthrough in the electoral 
impasse. 
  There are widespread fears that violence in Natal Province 
might soar if the working group fails to produce any concrete 
result. 
  There is deep pessimism in both the government and the ANC 
circles over the prospects of this week's talks between the four 
leaders. 
  `Even if we manage to reach agreement in the working group 
-- 
which is possible -- it appears that it will be blocked by the 
Inkatha Freedom Party leadership,' said a senior government 
official. 
  Mandela expressed his intention to meet with the Zulu king 
again after their talks on April 8. But the king has not 
responded by now. 
  With the failure of the four-way crisis summit on April 8, 
it 
is understood that security measures will be considerably 
intensified in Natal Province if tension there continues to lead 
to bloodshed. 
  This week is also crucial to the kwaZulu homeland and the 
Zulu monarchy. The low-key civil war raging in the region could 
escalate and become out of control. 
  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said 
yesterday about 60 percent of Natal's inhabitants would be able 
to participate freely in the elections, but the Inkatha Freedom 
Party supporters are scaring people away from the elections. 
  Meyer warned that if the elections were postponed, the 
future 
of the country would be determined by radical elements of the 
left and the right, and that a Bosnian-style situation would 
appear in South Africa. 
  People in South Africa are watching the development of the 
situation in the country with great concern and care.

  [Text] Cairo, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Ambassador to 
Egypt Yang Fuchang said today Egyptian President Husni Mubarak's 
upcoming visit to China is very important to relations between 
the two countries. 
  Yang told a press conference held this evening at the 
Chinese 
Embassy that the Chinese Government and people welcome President 
Mubarak's upcoming visit to China and that the visit will open 
new prospects for cooperation between the two countries. 
  He said the visit, which will take place from April 21 to 
23, 
will provide a chance for the leaders of the two countries to 
consider ways of promoting ties of cooperation between them. 
  Answering a question about political relations between China 
and Egypt, the Chinese ambassador said there is no problem in 
their relations. They are linked together by good ties, in 
addition to the fact that the two countries coordinate their 
positions at international assemblies. 
  He added that Mubarak's upcoming visit to China will give a 
fresh impetus to the already good relations between the two 
countries. 
  Dealing with their economic cooperation, Yang said that the 
volume of trade between the two countries reached 220 million 
U.S. dollars in 1993, hoping that it will expand so as to be 
compatible with the good political relations between them.

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren said here today that China has always insisted that a 
political settlement for the Mideast issue should be sought on 
the basis of resolutions adopted by the Security Council of the 
United Nations. 
  Rong made the remarks when meeting with Faruq al-Qaddumi, 
foreign minister of the State of Palestine, who arrived in 
Beijing on Thursday [7 April] for a six-day visit to China. 
  Rong said that the signing of the agreement between Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) on implementing 
a declaration of principles for palestinian self-rule on the 
West Bank and in Gaza shows that the Palestinian issue can be 
solved through peaceful negotiations. 
  China hopes that the recent U.N. resolutions on occupied 
territory would be implemented smoothly, he said, adding that 
parties concerned should continue to work for peace in an 
all-round manner. 
  Rong said that China firmly supports the mideast peace 
process and will, as always, support the just cause of the 
Palestinians. 
  Al-Qaddumi, also director of the Political Department of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization, said that his organization 
would work patiently and continue peaceful negotiations for an 
early realization of the legitimate rights of the palestinians.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 8 Apr (MENA)--Chinese Ambassador in Cairo 
Yang Fuchang has said his country's government and people 
welcome President Husni Mubarak's forthcoming visit to Beijing. 
In an interview with MENA, he said President Mubarak is an old 
friend of China and that this visit will be his sixth trip to 
China. He noted that every time he visits China, President 
Mubarak gives new momentum to the good traditional bilateral 
relations. [passage omitted] 
  The Chinese ambassador stressed the need to honor Security 
Council Resolutions 242 and 338 on the Middle East and hoped 
that the Jerusalem issue will be resolved through negotiations. 
  On lifting the economic sanctions on Iraq, he explained that 
they were imposed under particular circumstances but that if we 
now look at the situation objectively, we will find that Iraq 
has responded to the Council's recent resolutions. So, he said, 
sanctions on the humanitarian level must be lifted, primarily to 
secure food and medicine for the Iraqi people and, as the 
implementation of the resolutions continues, other sanctions can 
be lifted, something that is currently being discussed at the 
Security Council. 
  On China's arms sales to Pakistan, he said the purchase and 
sale of arms is something normal in relations between states. 
The United States, France, and other big powers also sell arms. 
He added: Our selling arms to Pakistan does not mean we 
support one party at the expense of another. And it does not 
mean there is intervention in other countries' internal affairs, 
so the situation in the region is not aggravated. 
  Commenting on the Korean issue, the Chinese ambassador said 
his country believes that the best way to solve the problem is 
through negotiations between the United States and Korea, 
between Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and 
between the two Koreas. He said China stresses that the Korean 
Peninsula should be free of nuclear weapons and it believes the 
imposition of sanctions does not help to solve problems but 
rather complicates them. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Manila, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- While meeting today with 
a Supervision Ministry delegation headed by Vice Minister He 
Yong from China, Philippine Vice President Estrada said the 
Philippine Government always attaches importance to developing 
friendly relations with China. 
  Estrada noted that since the origin of Philippine-Chinese 
relations goes back to ancient times, and since over half of the 
Philippine people have Chinese blood in their veins, there is no 
reason not to maintain a friendly relationship between the two 
countries. 
  He Yong relayed Chinese Vice President Rong Yiren's 
invitation to Estrada to visit China, which Estrada accepted 
with pleasure. 
  He Yong and his party arrived in the Philippines on 5 April 
at the invitation of the Interior and Local Governments Ministry 
of the Philippines. 
  This is the first time the Chinese Supervision Ministry has 
sent a delegation to visit the Philippines. The aim of the 
current visit is to establish contacts between the 
administrative supervision organs of the two countries and to 
lay a foundation to enhance cooperation and exchanges in the 
sphere of supervision between the two sides in the future. The 
delegation will depart the Philippines for Thailand on 10 April.

  [Text] Wellington, April 12 (XINHUA) -- China and Japan 
have been recognized by New Zealanders as the markets with 
greatest growth prospects, showed the result of a survey 
available today. 
  The National Research Bureau, which conducted the survey, 
concluded New Zealanders had now become aware of the importance 
of trade with Asian countries. 
  Seventy-eight percent of the 600 people surveyed felt Asian 
tourism was good for New Zealand and 57 percent favored 
education institutions attracting fee-paying Asian students. 
  However, many New Zealanders are wary of Asian investment 
and 
immigration, the survey showed. 
  The result indicated 29 percent welcomed Asian immigration 
to 
New Zealand as good for the country, and 25 percent thought 
Asian investment as good. 
  Thirty-three percent of the people had mixed feelings about 
the immigration, 25 percent thought it would be neither good nor 
bad, and 13 percent believed it would be bad for New Zealand. 
  On the Asian investment, 46 percent had mixed feelings, 18 
percent opposed it and 11 percent considered it as neither good 
nor bad. 
  The bureau said people were concerned Asian investment could 
move ownership and control of businesses overseas, a similar 
attitude New Zealanders held toward the United States and other 
countries 20 years ago. 
  The prime reason for people opposing Asian migration came 
from the fear for the perceived takeover of jobs from New 
Zealanders.

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President 
Kim Yong-sam today expressed the hope that the enhancement of 
cooperation between South Korea and China will promote further 
development of the relations between the two countries. 
  Kim made the remarks when meeting with Wu Xueqian, 
vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (CPPCC), in the Presidential House here Monday [11 
April]. 
  He said that he held talks with Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin 
and Premier Li Peng during his recent visit to China. "We 
exchanged views on bilateral relations and issues of mutual 
concern. The talks are very useful," he added. 
  President Kim paid an official visit to China from March 26 
to 30 at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin. 
  He noticed that great achievements have been made in China. 
"I saw with my own eyes the situation of the open-door to the 
outside world and the rapid economic development in Shanghai and 
Tianjin." 
  Wu said that the establishment of diplomatic ties between 
China and South Korea in August 1992 has restored long-standing 
ties of the two countries in the history. 
  Kim's China visit has made important contributions to the 
promotion of further development of the relations between the 
two countries, he said. 
  Wu arrived here Sunday for an eight-day good-will visit at 
the invitation of South Korean Foreign Minister Han Song-chu.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Beijing Political Situation" column by </F>
Jen Hui-wen (0117 1979 2429): "The Chinese-U.S. Strategic Trial 
of Strength on the Korean Peninsula"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 6 Apr--The tense situation on the Korean 
peninsula resulting from the North Korean nuclear issue 
escalated in late March and led to a military confrontation at 
the end of that month. This has received international 
attention. Under these circumstances, on 1 April the UN 
Security Council adopted a moderately worded statement proposed 
by China asking North Korea to allow international inspectors to 
complete their nuclear inspections and urging North and South 
Korea to resume dialogue with the UN Security Council members so 
as to implement the declaration on the Korean peninsula being a 
nuclear-free zone, thus temporarily easing the tension on the 
peninsula. 
  How has the present situation on the Korean peninsula taken 
shape? An informed source in Beijing has revealed that a 
Beijing expert on international conflicts was of the opinion 
that primarily human factors were behind the military 
confrontation on the Korean peninsula. Over the past year, the 
situation on the Korean peninsula has been tense one moment and 
relaxed the next. On 12 March last year, North Korea suddenly 
announced its withdrawal from the Treaty on the Nonproliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons, to oppose the U.S.-South Korean "team spirit 
1993" joint military exercises. Not long afterward, South and 
North Korea were in a "state of quasi war." Subsequently, the 
United States took the initiative in holding a dialogue with 
North Korea, and good results were achieved. In February this 
year, North Korea reached agreements respectively with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the United States, 
expressing its willingness to allow IAEA personnel to carry out 
an "inspection aimed at ensuring continuity in nuclear safety." 
Apart from this, South and North Korea held talks in Panmunjom 
from 3 to 6 March to discuss mutual visits by both sides' 
special envoys. Logically, this should have helped improve the 
atmosphere on the Korean peninsula, but a six-member 
international nuclear inspection team complained that North 
Korea had prevented them from taking samples from a chemical 
research agency after inspecting seven nuclear facilities in 
North Korea. North Korea asserted that these nuclear facilities 
had passed IAEA inspections, had been sealed, and monitoring 
equipment had been installed at the sites; there was no reason 
for the inspection team to remove the seals and take samples 
again. Logically, it was possible to resolve this difference of 
opinion. Unfortunately, however, South and North Korea 
viciously abused one another during the Panmunjom talks, and the 
United States asserted that, if North Korea refused to yield, 
the UN Security Council would impose sanctions on it. 
<H5>  China Persuaded the Three Parties To Have a Dialogue </H5>
  The international community, however, did not agree with the 
idea of the Security Council taking economic sanctions against 
North Korea or the United States punishing it with force. 
Instead, it hoped that China could influence North Korea 
through their friendly relations so that the crisis on the 
Korean peninsula could be alleviated. During their visits to 
China in late March, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, 
Japanese Prime Minister Hosokawa, and South Korean President Kim 
Yong-sam respectively expressed the same view. It was against 
this background that China submitted the above-mentioned 
proposal. 
  The informed source further pointed out that, because China 
had always abided by the international norm of not interfering 
in other countries' internal affairs, it indicated that "it can 
only play a limited role and do little" on the North Korean 
nuclear issue, apart from expressing its stand of favoring 
dialogue and opposing the use of pressure. To ease the tense 
situation on the Korean peninsula and remove the war crisis 
there, China continued to actively persuade the United States 
and South and North Korea to patiently resolve their disputes 
through dialogue. 
  China indicated to the United States: After the Cold War, 
the United States should no longer adopt a hostile attitude 
toward North Korea, and this is an important factor preventing 
North Korea from manufacturing nuclear weapons; North Korea does 
not constitute any threat to world peace, and the United States 
should cancel its military exercises with South Korea; the 
United States should give up its policy of politically isolating 
North Korea, economically containing it, and diplomatically 
slandering it and should restore talks with it so that their 
bilateral relations will develop toward normalization. 
  China indicated to South Korea: North Korea lacks the 
technological and economic capacity to manufacture nuclear 
weapons, so South Korea should not be oversensitive about this 
issue; as there is no proof, South Korea should not act rashly; 
even though North Korea has the intention of manufacturing 
nuclear weapons, this problem can be resolved through 
negotiations; the shipment of U.S. Patriot missiles to South 
Korea and U.S.-South Korean joint military exercises have 
unquestionably added fuel to the fire; South and North Korea 
should hold direct summit talks to create a relaxed atmosphere. 
China indicated to North Korea: North Korea should be more 
flexible on the question of nuclear inspections; it should 
withdraw its troops a little from the military demarcation line 
to avoid clashes; and it should take the initiative in proposing 
talks with South Korea. 
  The Beijing expert on international conflicts pointed out 
that China's active persuasion to the United States and South 
and North Korea suggested its sincerity for alleviating the 
tense situation on the Korean peninsula. The alleviation of 
this tension primarily relies on the patient dialogue between 
North Korea, South Korea, the IAEA, and the United States. 
  The informed source said that the Beijing international 
conflicts expert was of the opinion that the United States 
should undertake a major responsibility for the tense situation 
on the Korean peninsula, because this superpower practices 
hegemonism and power politics abroad and always wants to foist 
its value concepts on others. For example, the United States 
used the method of peaceful evolution on the former Soviet Union 
and is applying the same method to China, and it is using 
military methods to bring about a change in North Korea, Iraq, 
and Libya. The United States deeply regretted not being able to 
conquer Iraq with one stroke during the Gulf war. Remembering 
this lesson, it will practice a strategy of destruction against 
North Korea--the last Stalinist regime in the world--with the 
aim of enabling South Korea to gobble up North Korea, like West 
Germany gobbling up East Germany. A South Korean radio station 
said that "Seoul and Washington already have a plan to overthrow 
the Kim Il-song regime." This is a specific example of an 
attempt to change North Korea through military means. 
<H5>  The United States Is Using Two Methods </H5>
  Apart from this, aiming to undermine China's foreign policy 
of establishing good-neighborly relations with its surrounding 
countries, the United States is trying every possible means to 
set these countries against China, with a view to encircling it. 
  When discussing the international situation recently, an 
authoritative person from the CPC pointed out that the Korean 
peninsula, India, and Pakistan might be on fire [qi huo 6386 
3499], and Vietnam and Russia might see winds rising [qi feng 
6386 7364]. Partially speaking, this refers to the U.S. 
strategy of encircling China. 
  This international conflicts expert said that China is quite 
certain that the United States is aiming at China in pressuring 
North Korea, and therefore China is quite concerned about the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. Strategically speaking, 
China regards the Korean region as an important buffer [huan 
chong 4883 0394] zone between China and the United States. 
Should North Korea fall under U.S.-South Korean joint military 
occupation, China could face U.S. Naval, Army, and Air Force 
threats. If war breaks out again on the Korean peninsula, and 
the United States supports South Korea in attacking North Korea, 
the Chinese Army, which "resisted U.S. aggression and aided 
Korea to defend the motherland" in the early 1950's will not sit 
idly by. If it did, the people throughout the country would 
condemn it. 
  This expert continued: Of course, China's stand is very 
explicit at present; it will do its best to prevent war on the 
Korean peninsula. Therefore, as the United States highly values 
U.S.- Chinese cooperation, China also sets great store by 
improving Chinese-U.S. relations. The further development of 
Chinese-U.S. relations will be good for easing the North Korean 
nuclear crisis, for preventing Japan from becoming a nuclear 
country, and for stopping the "Taiwan independence" movement and 
the Vietnamese demand for "sovereignty" over the Nansha Islands 
[Spratlys]. More importantly, it will provide China with a 10 
to 20 year opportunity for peaceful construction. The sustained 
development of China's economy and the constant growth of its 
comprehensive national strength will prevent the United States 
and other Western countries from belittling China's 
international role. 
  This expert stressed: The Korean peninsula issue is no 
longer a simple dispute between South and North Korea; the 
different attitudes of China and the United States on the North 
Korean nuclear issue is, essentially speaking, a strategic trial 
of strength between the two countries on the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "China Spurs Regional Aid For Ship </F>
Inspections"] 
  [Text] China is stepping up efforts to ensure safer 
shipping conditions in the Asia-Pacific region by cementing its 
co-operation with surrounding nations on vessel inspections and 
port control. 
  Zheng Guangdi, Vice-Minister of Communications, told the 
opening of the first meeting of Asia-Pacific Port State Control 
Committee that teamwork was critical to this success. 
  About 100 maritime authorities from 16 Asia-Pacific 
countries 
are in Beijing to collaborate on port control data exchange 
systems and maritime surveyor training. 
  Last December these nations, along with Vietnam and Fiji who 
are absent this time, signed the Tokyo Memorandum of 
Understanding on Port State Control -- a regional treaty to 
safeguard marine safety and prevent sea pollution in the region. 
  The deal unified inspection standards. If a ship clears 
inspection after docking in a Chinese port, it will be granted 
entry to the other 17 nations without repeating the same 
procedures. 
  States are obligated under the agreement to check any 
foreign 
ship entering its port, along with on-board equipment and 
seamen, to ensure they meet international criteria and domestic 
laws. 
  Lin Yunai, head of China's Harbour Superintendency Bureau, 
said the region faces uneven economic development which leads to 
legions of substandard vessels sailing into their ports, some of 
which have caused serious accidents. 
  In 1990 China launched its own port State control in 12 main 
seaports. More than 200 Chinese officials have qualified for 
overall safety checks on foreign ships, and a technical training 
centre has been established in Dalian to foster more maritime 
surveyors. 
  The number of foreign vessels inspected topped 2,000 last 
year, and is expected to grow by 50 per cent annually. About 10 
per cent of the examined foreign ships violated international 
conventions, such as having obsolete on-board fire-fighting 
devices. They were required to fix any problems discovered. 
Depending on how severe the problem is, some ships may be 
allowed to leave the port without making the repairs, but will 
have to remedy the violations in a certain time period before 
docking again in China. If the owner cannot fulfill the 
requirements, the ship will be detained. 
  Some violators may face fines.

  [Text] Seoul, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman 
of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific 
Region, has suggested a "package deal" in solution to the Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The nuclear issue can be resolved through a "package deal" 
under which Western countries would "recognize the Pyongyang 
government while North Korea give up nuclear program," Kim said 
at a meeting in Taegu, capital of South Korea's North Kyongsang 
Province Saturday [9 April]. 
  Kim, former renowned South Korean opposition leader, asked 
the South Korean Government to adopt a soft policy toward the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in order to bring 
about change. 
  "The Cold War age is over and the conditions causing 
division 
of the Korean Peninsula have disappeared. So if South and North 
Korea continue their exhausting competition, both will turn into 
third- rate countries," he warned. 
  Kim predicted, "North Korea will eventually abandon nuclear 
program and the United States will establish an embassy in 
Pyongyang." 
  Speaking at Pusan University in the country's South 
Kyongsang 
Province Friday, Kim Tae-chung said that South Korea and the 
U.S. should not resume their joint military exercise "Team 
Spirit" as it would impede dialogue on the nuclear issue.

General M. P. Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff of the 
Armed Forces of Russia, and his party at the Diaoyutai 
Guesthouse at noon today, Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the 
Central Military Commission, expressed pleasure with the smooth 
development of relations between the two countries. 
  Liu Huaqing said the Chinese Central Military Commission 
attached great importance to Kolesnikov's visit and he expressed 
the belief that the visit will help promote mutual understanding 
and enhance friendship between the two armies. He said: "The 
Chinese people and army have always cherished a profound 
friendship toward the Russian people and army. Since the 
normalization of relations between the two countries, bilateral 
relations have developed very smoothly and friendship has 
continually deepened. We are very happy about this." 
  Liu Huaqing said: China and Russia are both large countries 
with long histories and cultures. As close neighbors, they 
should have better relations. 
  He continued: "Currently, Russia has encountered some 
difficulties. However, we believe the Russian people will 
overcome their temporary difficulties. This is because the 
Russians are a great people, the country has a good economic 
foundation, it has a vast land and rich resources, and its 
people are better educated and very intelligent. We believe 
that as long as the policy is correct and the direction is 
right, the Russian people will definitely build their country 
well. We respect the Russian people's choice." 
  Kolesnikov said: "We are very pleased to have to opportunity 
to visit China, our great neighbor. Seeing for oneself is a 
hundred times better than hearing from others. After arriving 
in Beijing, we have personally observed the tremendous 
achievement made by the Chinese people in construction." 
  He said: "We came here to develop friendship and increase 
mutual understanding between the two armies. We are ready to 
further develop friendship between the Russian and Chinese 
Armies on the existing foundation." 
  Zhang Wannian, chief of the General Staff of the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army, and Russian ambassador to China 
Rogachev, were present at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The series of visits 
scheduled to be exchanged between China and Russia this year 
will help further promote the relations between the two 
countries, said Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian 
Qichen . 
  Qian made the statement during his meeting with visiting 
deputy Foreign Minister Alexsandr Panov of Russia here this 
morning. 
  Qian and Panov exchanged views on bilateral relations and 
international issues of common concern. 
  Qian said that Russia is a big country that plays an 
important role in world affairs, adding that China always puts 
its relations with Russia high on its foreign policy agenda. 
  Qian said that there has been healthy and steady development 
recently in the bilateral relations, adding that the developing 
of good neighborly relations between the two countries not only 
conforms to the interests of the countries themselves, but also 
constitutes a stabilizing factor in the Asia-Pacific region and 
the world as a whole. 
  The Chinese vice-premier expressed his belief that the 
bilateral relations will be further developed though joint 
efforts. 
  Panov expressed his satisfaction over the positive results 
of 
his current visit to China. He held that Russia-China relations

  [Text] Harbin, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Suifenhe city in 
Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has become one of the 
business centers on the Sino-Russian border. 
  Located in the southeast part of Heilongjiang Province, the 
city, with an area of 460 square km and 40,000 people, is linked 
with Russia by a railway and two highways and is also serving as 
a hub in access to Japan and Korea. 
  As early as in the 1920s, businessmen from 18 countries and 
regions in the world including the United States, Britain, 
Australia, Japan, Russia and Korea were engaged in business in 
the city. 
  Since October 1987 when China re-opened the border trade to 
Russia, Suifenhe city has made a big progress in its foreign 
trade and economic cooperation. 
  Over the past six years, its export volume to Russia reached 
1.2 billion Swiss franc and the varieties of commodities 
exported to Russia increased by hundreds of times to more than 
4,000. 
  The city has 248 joint ventures involving a total investment 
of 1.5 billion yuan. 
  At present, business people from both China's inland areas 
and overseas have had more than 2,000 representative offices in 
the city, as a result of the improved telecommunications and the 
conditions of other infrastructure.

  [Text] Moscow, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin said the U.S. has no right to unilaterally decide to 
bomb Bosnian Serbs positions. 
  Yeltsin made this remarks in response to the U.S. bombing of 
the Bosnian front near Gorazde on Sunday [10 April]. 
  Before leaving for Spain today, Yeltsin said that the U.S. 
has no right to make such a decision without consulting Russia 
first. 
  The Russian president added that he had a telephone talk at 
6:00 this morning with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Clinton did 
not answer whether the U.N. General Secretary [as received] had 
agreed to the attack, he added. 
  According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, Yeltsin insisted 
that 
all issues be solved according to U.N. resolutions, and demanded 
that the U.N. Security Council discuss the issue.

  [Text] Moscow, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev today warned that NATO air strikes 
against Bosnian Serb positions could lead to an escalation of 
the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  NATO aircraft have bombed Bosnian Serb positions near the 
town of Gorazde twice in the past two days. 
  In a telephone conversation with U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher today, Kozyrev said the world might be 
dragged into the danger of exchange of strikes and he called for 
maximum restraint. 
  He said the decision to launch air strikes was hasty and 
"taken without due regard for consequences" and NATO had not 
consulted the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. 
  Kozyrev, who is accompanying President Boris Yeltsin in 
Madrid for a visit to Spain, said that the decision-makers 
should be responsible for "all serious consequences of air 
strikes." 
  In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow was 
told that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali had been 
informed of the possibility of using aircraft before the air 
strikes. 
  The statement said Russia also hoped to be informed of the 
whole incident by U.N. leaders. 
  It called on the United States and other Western countries 
not to wreck the U.N. decisions or connive at any side. 
  As a direct and active participant in the settlement of the 
Bosnian crisis, Russia insisted on preventing an escalation of 
the conflict in the region, the statement said.

  [Text] Washington, April 11 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton said today that U.S. warplanes striking at Serb 
positions near the Bosnian town of Gorazde acted in "an entirely 
appropriate way." 
  He downplayed Russian objections to the attack, saying he 
had 
"a good talk" with Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday and 
that foreign ministers of both countries would continue 
communications today. 
  In Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters that the U.S. has no right 
to bomb Bosnian Serb positions without consulting Russia first. 
  Clinton said U.S. warplanes acted with U.N. civilian 
authorization and that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali backed such a move in an earlier statement. 
  The U.S. president made these remarks before a meeting of 
his 
national security advisers at the White House.

  [Text] Washington, April 11 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said Washington is ready to act again 
against the Bosnian Serbs if necessary. 
  Confirming that a second air attack today destroyed at least 
a Serb tank and two armored personnel carriers, Christopher said 
the two U.S. FA-18 fighters that conducted the strikes were 
responding to U.N. commander Sir Rose's request. 
  He again took pains to downplay differences with Russia over 
the attacks, he said the two countries share the goal of seeking 
an end to the hostilities. 
  In Moscow, Yeltsin told reporters that the U.S. has no right 
to bomb Bosnian Serb positions without consulting Russia first. 
  Christopher urged the Bosnian Serbs to end the attacks on 
the 
Bosnian town of Gorazde, a Muslim-dominated enclave, and return 
to the negotiating table. 
  He said he had been in almost hourly contact with U.S. 
special envoy on Bosnia Charles Redman and Washington's 
ambassador to Bosnia. 
  Christopher disputed suggestions that the attacks would 
lessen the possibility of a solution and said NATO and the U.S. 
still favor a comprehensive settlement to the war.

  [Text] Washington, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
remains concerned about Russia's biological weapons program and 
seeks complete termination of such a program, the State 
Department said today. 
  "The United States has determined that the Russian offensive 
biological warfare program inherited from the Soviet Union 
violated the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) through at 
least March of 1992," State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry 
said. 
  "We've been engaged in an effort to work with the Russian 
leadership to ensure complete termination of the illegal 
program," McCurry said. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree in April, 
1992, to prohibit biological weapons programs. Five months 
later, Russia, Britain and the U.S. confirmed in a joint 
statement full compliance with the BWC. 
  McCurry said the status of the Russian biological weapons 
program, which included production, weaponization and 
stockpiling, "remains a little unclear" to the U.S. and 
Washington was engaged with Russia to find out answers to 
questions like that.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- Scientific and 
technological cooperation between China and the United States, 
which benefits both countries, has vast potential and promising 
prospects, said Chinese State Councillor Song Jian, who is to 
leave here for the United States tomorrow. 
  Before departure for attending the sixth meeting of the 
joint 
commission of the Sino-U.S. scientific and technological 
cooperation, Song, also minister in charge of the science 
commission, told XINHUA that the scientific and technological 
cooperation between China and the United States began in 1979, 
when Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping visited the United States and 
signed an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation 
with then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
  On the basis of the agreement, he said, the two countries 
have in the past 15 years reached cooperative accords in 29 
fields including education, agriculture, oceanography, public 
health, environmental protection and basic science, launched 
more than 1,000 cooperative programs and exchanged more than 
10,000 personnel. 
  Song listed some of the fruits achieved through bilateral 
cooperation, which included the establishment of Beijing 
electron- positron collider, Sino-U.S. joint investigation on 
the west Pacific Ocean and the setting up of China seismic data 
network. These items are of great scientific and economic 
significance, he added. 
  Such cooperation is beneficial to both sides, the State 
Councillor said, adding that the U.S. side can get 150 thousand 
mini-films and other materials from China's seismic data network 
every year, which are of important value to the study of seismic 
forecasting and basic seismic study. 
  In agricultural aspect, Song noted, China has offered U.S. 
side a rich assortment of agricultural resources. 
  Meanwhile, Song added, the Chinese side has learned and 
absorbed the advanced scientific theories and management, 
mastered some of advanced scientific methods and technology and 
trained scientific talents. 
  Sino-U.S. joint commission on scientific and technological 
cooperation hold its meetings every two years in the capitals of 
the two countries by turns and the forthcoming Washington 
session is the sixth meeting of the commission, which will be 
co-chaired by Song and John Gibbons, U.S. Director of the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy. 
  The agenda of the Washington meeting will include a review 
of 
achievements of Sino-U.S. scientific and technological 
cooperation, intensive discussions on further cooperation in 
public health, environmental protection, energy and materials, 
besides probing ways for businessmen's involvement in these 
aspects. 
  The two countries will sign new agreements and renew old 
ones 
for scientific and technological cooperation. 
  Song believed that his U.S. tour will help enhance Sino-U.S. 
scientific and technological cooperation to a new height. 
  As a noted scientist, Song said that science and technology 
belong to all the mankind. The Chinese scientists are willing 
to make new and greater contributions to the international 
scientific and technological cooperation, he said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Liu Flies to U.S. in Search </F>
of Hi-Tech Farm Goods"] 
  [Text] Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang headed for 
Washington yesterday for high-level meetings that he hopes will 
step up farm aid between the two nations. 
  Liu's two-week visit to America coincides with the Sixth 
Meeting of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and 
Technological Co-operation, scheduled for tomorrow. 
  He will lead a nine-member mission in talks with the U.S. 
Agricultural Secretary Mike Espy, as well as join State 
Councilor Song Jian's science delegation at the biannual 
commission. 
  Liu is the highest-ranking Chinese agricultural official to 
visit the United States this year. 
  During his talks with Espy and other officials, Liu is 
expected to explore Sino-U.S. ties in the farm sector. 
  China wants to introduce the latest American technology in 
high- quality seed breeding, bio-ecology and the processing of 
farm and sideline products, the ministry said. 
  "We also hope to strengthen our technical and economic co- 
operation with U.S. farmers, who have shown interest in China's 
vast agricultural resources," said Liu Chongmeng, deputy 
director-general of the ministry's International Co-operation 
Department. 
  China and the U.S. have enhanced agricultural co-operation 
over the past years, and China has provided America with more 
than 12,000 scientific and technical research products on 
agriculture, especially on disease-resistant plants. 
  In trade, the government has taken positive steps to 
strengthen ties with the U.S., Liu Chongmeng noted. 
  Agreements signed by Minister Liu and Secretary Espy call 
for 
the Chinese to designate South China's Hainan Province for trial 
production of the American TCK immune wheat seeds, starting this 
year. 
  The government hopes the U.S. will take a positive attitude 
toward improving quarantine procedures on imports of Chinese 
vegetables, fruits and potted landscape, Liu Chongmeng added. 
  During Liu Jiang's U.S. tour, he also plans to visit New 
York, Chicago and Los Angeles to look at American farms and 
agricultural business, and to meet local leaders and 
entrepreneurs. 
  Liu's farm delegation includes the vice-governors of 
Liaoning 
and Sichuan, the two top agricultural producing provinces.

<F P=106> [Article by staff reporter Yu Donghui (0151 2639 2547)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yi, 
minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, heads the 
Chinese Government economic relations and trade delegation 
flying to the United States today to attend the Sino-U.S. Joint 
Committee for Commerce and Trade. In addition, a 220-member 
delegation for talks on Sino-U.S. trade and investments is ready 
and waiting and will be attending two large-scale activities, a 
seminar on investment and trade and successive talks in Los 
Angeles and New York, in mid- April. 
  These will be largest-scale activities in investment and 
trade China will have sponsored in the United States since 
China's reform and opening up in the 15 years since Sino-U.S. 
diplomatic relations were established. This shows China's 
aspirations and sincerity in expanding opening up, strengthening 
Sino-U.S. relations in trade and economic cooperation, and 
welcoming U.S. businessmen to make investments in China. 
  On the eve of her departure for the United States, Jiao 
Sufeng, foreign investment administration director of the 
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, agreed to a 
special interview with this reporter. 
  Jiao Sufeng disclosed that the current activities in 
investment and trade include trade talks and inviting 
investments, with 927 projects in that category. The members of 
the delegation are from nine of China's central ministries and 
commissions, 26 provinces and municipalities, and a dozen or so 
trade companies. 
  Viewing the investment projects and the members of the 
delegation, we find three major characteristics, namely: 
  --The focus is on infrastructure projects. There are 175 
projects involving energy resources, transportation, and 
telecommunications, with a capacity for absorbing $5 billion to 
$6 billion of foreign funds. From this we can see that China's 
absorption of foreign funds will gradually change from leaning 
toward regions to leaning toward industry. 
  --A high proportion of the projects are of the capital- and 
technology-intensive type. There are 338 projects concerning 
raw materials, electronic machinery, the petrochemical industry, 
the light and textile industries, and the metallurgical 
industry. Beyond a doubt, they are very attractive to large U.S. 
transnational companies. 
  --Central and western provinces are taking an active part. 
Out of the 26 provinces and cities represented on the United 
States visit, 16 are provinces, cities and autonomous regions in 
China's hinterland, namely Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, 
Shaanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, 
Jilin, Shanxi, Xian, and Wuhan. This is related to the 
structure of the projects, while demonstrating the momentum of 
China's opening up in all directions. 
  The current visit to the United States will once again show 
the world that China, this largest developing country, has a 
huge market filled with temptation. China's bountiful 
resources, industrial foundation and technological force of an 
initial range, and cheap labor match very well U.S. abundant 
funds and advanced technology. The key to developing Sino-U.S. 
relations should be augmenting trade and economic cooperation 
characterized by mutual interests and benefits. 
  U.S. investments in China grew steadily between 1979 and 
1993. By the end of last year, China had already approved 12,000 
projects involving U.S. investments. The negotiated sum was 
$10.6 billion, with an actual investment of $5.2 billion, next 
only to Hong Kong. In 1993 in particular, U.S. businessmen 
invested in some 6,700 projects in China, with a negotiated sum 
of $6.8 billion, of which some $2 billion was already invested. 
  All the signs are that although some troubles and 
contradictions often surface in Sino-U.S. trade and economic 
relations, U.S. political and entrepreneurial circles continue 
to show strong interest and great confidence in China. That is 
evidenced by the fact that since the beginning of this year, 
U.S. Government officials, nongovernment delegations, large 
companies and financial groups have come to China one after 
another. 
  In view of this, the current large-scope activities in trade 
and economic relations are aimed chiefly at establishing 
extensive ties with U.S. figures from economic and 
entrepreneurial circles, briefing them on China's policy of 
reform and opening up and conditions in economic development, 
and providing them with opportunities for investment and trade. 
Jiao Sufen indicated that strengthening ties and deepening 
understanding is more important than signing some contracts. 
  A relevant figure stressed that China welcomes U.S. 
investments, and the United States needs the Chinese market. 
Harmony between the two sides spells mutual benefits; and 
confrontation means crippling both. The best policy is to seek 
common ground while reserving differences, and seek cooperation.

  [Text] United Nations, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- In addressing the 
UN Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations on 5 April, 
Chinese representative Zhang Yan said that it is important and 
timely for the committee to reexamine the issue in all aspects 
at this critical hour so as to sum up experiences and seek 
improvements. 
  Zhang Yan said: Peacekeeping operations, as an important 
means employed by the United Nations to safeguard international 
peace and security, play a useful role in preventing the 
expansion of conflicts and promoting the settlement of disputes; 
and the actions have received worldwide attention. However, 
because of the need to expand peacekeeping operations rapidly, 
they are confronted with many new problems. 
  He said: The Chinese delegation maintains that the urgent 
task for the United Nations is, under the guidance of its 
charter, to draw up a set of universally acceptable and 
effective guiding principles so that peacekeeping operations 
will have a solid political and legal foundation. The issue 
that needs a priority solution is that peacekeeping operations 
must strictly abide by the aims and principles of the UN Charter 
so that the operations can maintain a correct political 
orientation; peacekeeping operations must adhere to settling 
disputes by peaceful means and the nonuse of force; and the UN 
Security Council must be cautious in making decisions and it 
must safeguard the United Nations' initiative and leading role 
in peacekeeping operations. 
  According to a report, the United Nations has been engaged 
in 
17 peacekeeping projects, and 71,816 soldiers and policemen from 
70 countries are carrying out peacekeeping missions in hot spots 
around the world. 
  Peacekeeping budgets and expenditures have also grown 
substantially along with the increase in peacekeeping missions. 
Reports say that the expenses for peacekeeping operations during 
the 1986-91 period were approximately $380 million per year on 
average but that expenses soared to $1.73 billion in 1992 and to 
approximately $3.6 billion in 1993.

  [Text] New Delhi, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Julius Chan, Papuan 
New Guinean deputy prime minister and minister of finance and 
planning who has been heading the Papua New Guinean delegation 
to the 50th annual meeting of the Asian-Pacific Economic and 
Social Countil, met with Liu Huaqiu, Chinese vice foreign 
minister and head of the PRC delegation, here today. 
  Julius Chan said: Papua New Guinea and China share many 
similarities and common interests. Since the establishment of 
diplomatic relations, the two countries have scored notable 
achievements in bilateral cooperation, especially in economics 
and trade. The prospects for further cooperation between the 
two countries are great. The Papua New Guinean Government is 
willing to strengthen cooperation, expand exchange, and 
establish all-around mutually beneficial friendly and 
cooperative relations with China. He added that the Papua New 
Guinean Government will continue to implement the "One China" 
policy and hopes the Chinese people will accomplish the great 
cause of motherland reunification at an early date. 
  Liu Huaqiu said: It is China's established policy to 
strengthen and develop friendly and cooperative relations with 
Papua New Guinea and other South Pacific nations. We are happy 
to see more and more South Pacific countries adopt the strategy 
of "integrating with Asia" and attach great importance to 
developing relations with China. China is willing to expand 
cooperation with them on the basis of the five principles of 
peaceful coexistence, and we believe there are broad prospects 
for cooperation. 
  On 7 April, Liu Huaqiu also met with Serge Vohor, head of 
the 
Vanuatu delegation who is the minister of economic affairs and 
tourism; as well as heads of the Bangladesh and Sri Lankan 
delegations.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- The first meeting of 
the Asia-Pacific Port State Control Committee (PSCC) was opened 
here today. 
  Participating in the meeting are representatives from the 16 
Asia-Pacific port countries and regions who signed the 
Asia-Pacific Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control 
(AP-MOU), as well as representatives from six international 
agencies and maritime authorities, who have been invited as 
observers of the meeting. 
  The AP-MOU, signed in December 1993 in Tokyo, is a regional 
agreement for cooperation among Asia-Pacific coastal countries 
and regions to ensure maritime safety and prevent ocean 
pollution caused by ships. It's the third regional cooperative 
mou on port control in the world, following the paris and latin 
American mous in this field. 
  So far 16 countries and regions have signed the AP-MOU, 
namely, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, Republic of 
Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Solomon Islands, Thailand and 
Vanuatu. 
  Authorities of these signatory nations will use the AP-MOU 
to 
survey and inspect foreign-flagged ships which anchor in their 
ports, in accordance with related international maritime safety 
and pollution-prevention conventions. This aims to control and 
gradually eliminate low-standard ships from merchandise 
transport so as to ensure maritime safety and oceanic 
environmental protection. 
  Sources from the Chinese Ministry of Communications, which 
is 
in charge of the country's maritime affairs, said that as early 
as 1987 the bureau of harbor superintendency of China began to 
carry out demonstrations on port control affairs, and to date 
the work has been extended to 12 ports.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Spark Program has 
been very fruitful since it was launched eight years ago. 
  More than 14 million experts in different fields have been 
trained in 367 state and 173 provincial centers, who have played 
a key role in the development of rural economy, especially in 
the coastal provinces. 
  Some 50,000 projects have been implemented through the 
program, covering 85 percent of the country's counties. Half of 
the projects have generated obvious economic and social profits. 
  These were revealed at an international conference on 
China's 
Spark Program, which ended in this capital of Zhejiang Province 
Friday [8 April]. 
  The conference was jointly sponsored by the SCST [State 
Commission for Science and Technology], the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation and the U.N. Development Program. 
Participating were delegations from 18 countries and from 17 
provinces in China. 
  The Spark Program was launched eight years ago, aimed at 
spreading modern farming techniques and train technical 
personnel for both farming and industrial enterprises. 
  Experts attended the conference agreed that the shift of 
focus in the program will make rural enterprisers to be "ready 
for the market economy and world economic competition" in the 
country's better off coastal areas, in addition to training more 
technicians and experts in certain lines of production. 
  "Technical training and product development will be combined 
in the process to better transform science into productivity," a 
SCST official said. 
  In the less developed inland rural regions in the country, 
the program will center on promoting production and product 
development based on their local natural resources, according to 
the SCST. 
  The SCST and local science and technology commissions will 
help to establish more pilot group companies in the countryside, 
whose annual output value will hit 100 million yuan (11.63 U.S. 
dollars), and generate an output value of more than 10 million 
yuan a year. Some 100 such companies have already been 
established through the program. 
  The SCST cited Li Lianzhi as an example. Li, now president 
of Tianjin driving school, used to be a farmer peddling 
vegetables. After being trained in the spark program, he now 
possesses 4 research institutions, 89 branch companies and 35 
enterprises, whose annual output value has reached 100 million 
yuan. 
  The Spark Program provided township enterprises with easily 
applicable technologies and better management expertise, the 
SCST said. 
  It is also conducive to narrowing the gap between the rural 
and urban areas and between the coastal and inland economies, 
experts said. 
  Groups of technicians in research institutions and 
universities were organized by the state and local science and 
technological commissions to spread technologies, solve 
technical problems and launch technical projects for the rural 
and inland regions in winter or summer vacations and holidays. 
  Brought to the farmers are not only advanced and easily 
applicable technologies, but also new bio-technology. 
  "Farmers have come to realize the importance of science and 
technology in farming, livestock and fish breeding, and running 
enterprises," a scst official said. 
  As a result, many training centers and research institutions 
have been established spontaneously by the farmers-turned 
entrepreneurs, the official said.

<F P=106> [Commentary: "GATT Re-Entry"] </F>
  [Text] A Chinese delegation left for Morocco yesterday to 
attend a meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT). Along with other participants, it will sign the Final 
Act of the Uruguay Round negotiations and the Agreement on the 
Establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
  This means that China, which has taken part in the Uruguay 
Round world trade negotiations, undertakes to fulfill all the 
obligations stipulated in the Uruguay Round package and further 
open its markets to its trade partners. These steps will help 
to strengthen the world's multilateral trading system as 
represented by the WTO, coming into being next year. 
  China has long sought to resume its status as a contracting 
party of GATT. Moreover, the relevant talks must be concluded 
successfully before WTO is formally established so that China 
can be a founding member of the international trade body. 
China's application to re-enter the organization has received 
the backing of most of GATT's members. 
  But the talks have continued for eight years and regrettably 
with no conclusive result so far. 
  In order to speed up the talks, China has displayed great 
sincerity and complied with the agreements of the Uruguay Round 
negotiations. 
  Meanwhile, China has taken steps to integrate its trade and 
economy with those of the rest of the world. One example is the 
market-based pricing system being instituted in China, one of 
the principal demands of GATT. And China has promised to 
further perform its duties in boosting an open market even after 
it re- enters GATT. 
  However, China is a developing country. Our government is 
quite right to reject the demand made by certain nations, that 
China undertake the same commitments in Gatt as a developed 
country. For that is far above the actual level of China's 
economic development. 
  From an all-round perspective, now China is basically 
qualified to resume its status in GATT and become a founder 
member of WTO. 
  Pursuing a policy of opening to the rest of the world, China 
has witnessed the rapid growth of its trade and economy in 
recent years. It deserves a due place in the world multilateral 
trading system. Without the participation of China, a nation 
with one fifth of world's population and a dynamic growth rate, 
the WTO cannot claim universal membership. 
  GATT members should remember that delaying China's re-entry 
into GATT will be in no one's interest. If this happens, China 
will provide market access on a reciprocal basis. 
  It is our hope that under the principle of an exchange based 
on equality and mutual benefit, most of GATT's signatories will 
take measures to enable China to re-enter GATT at an early date 
and to become a founder member of the WTO.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "No Concrete Result From Pak-U.S. Nuclear Talks"] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad, April 10 (XINHUA) -- The talks between a 
senior U.S. official and Pakistani leaders on the nuclear issue 
and F-16 aircraft Saturday [9 April] produced no concrete 
results with both sides sticking to their respective positions. 
  However, the two sides termed the dialogue as "productive" 
and agreed to continue the talks at various levels through 
"quiet diplomacy." 
  Speaking at a press conference here Saturday, U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said he had a "more 
productive" dialogue on important issues including nuclear 
non-proliferation with Pakistani leadership. 
  "This dialogue will continue as we search for ways to make 
more substantial and bilateral progress to advance our goals in 
the region as a whole, " he said. 
  Talbott, who flew into Islamabad from New Delhi on Friday as 
part of the U.S.' effort to "rid South Asia of nuclear weapons," 
brought two proposals regarding the verifiable capping of 
Pakistan's nuclear program in exchange for F-16s and the 
convention of a multilateral conference on nuclear 
non-proliferation and regional security in South Asia. 
  He spent a busy day Saturday, meeting President Farooq 
Leghari, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar 
Asif Ahmad Ali, officials of Foreign Office as well as some 
opposition leaders. 
  "Pakistan reiterated its position of not accepting 
unilateral 
capping of its nuclear program and called for an equitable and 
balanced approach towards non-proliferation in South Asia," said 
a Foreign Office spokesman Saturday while briefing newsmen about 
the wide-ranging talks with Talbott. 
  "Unilateral capping of nuclear program is not acceptable and 
that remains our position," he reaffirmed. 
  Pakistan has been insisting that it would not unilaterally 
open its nuclear facilities for inspection unless the same is 
done by India, a neighboring country with which it had fought 
three wars since 1947. 
  Talbott, on his part, stressed at the press conference that 
F-16s is a part and parcel of the U.S. initiative to secure a 
verifiable cap of Pakistan's nuclear program. 
  "The status of F-16s and our proposal about capping of 
Pakistan's nuclear program are obviously tied up together and 
they will be considered together," he claimed. 
  Washington suspended all its military and economic aid to 
Pakistan in October 1990 under Pressler Amendment on suspicion 
that Pakistan has developed a nuclear device which Pakistan 
denied. 
  Pakistan's nuclear program also triggered U.S. refusal to 
deliver those F-16s which Pakistan had already paid for. 
  Meanwhile, in a statement issued Saturday, Nawaz Sharif, the 
country's main opposition leader, also rejected any inspection 
and verification of Pakistan's nuclear program, saying these 
will be tantamount to a rollback.

  [Text] Islamabad, April 10 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott today termed his visit to 
Pakistan as a "complete success," saying it laid down the basis 
for moving ahead in positive direction on a variety of issues. 
  He was talking to newsmen at Chaklala airbase near Islamabad 
prior to his departure after ending a three-day visit to 
Pakistan. 
  "I have a high degree of optimism that we will be able to 
achieve concrete results in the future that will serve the 
security and political interests of Pakistan," he said. 
  He said Pakistan and the United States will pursue their 
approach towards nuclear non-proliferation in South Asia. 
  Talbott flew into Islamabad Friday [8 April] from New Delhi 
as part of Washington's efforts to "rid South Asia of nuclear 
weapons." 
  He met President Farooq Leghari, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto, Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali and senior 
Foreign Office officials and discussed with them a wide-range 
issues including nuclear non-proliferation. 
  Meanwhile, talking to journalists today after seeing off 
Talbott, Foreign Secretary Najmuddin A. Sheikh said Pak-U.S. 
dialog on nuclear issue will continue but the dates for the next

  [Text] Washington, April 11 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Assistant 
Secretary of State Robert Gallucci will leave here tomorrow for 
a visit to China, South Korea and Japan, the State Department 
announced here today. 
  Department Spokesman Mike McCurry told a regular news 
briefing that in all the three capitals, Gallucci "plans to meet 
with government officials to discuss the North Korean nuclear 
issue and international efforts to resolve it." 
  "We will continue what has been a very extensive dialogue 
with all three governments on that issue," McCurry said. 
  Gallucci is the chair of the U.S. administration's senior 
policy steering group on Korea. 
  Asked what he is going to talk to the Chinese about in 
Beijing, McCurry said that "they'll talk about everyone's 
understanding of the inspections and the report that the IAEA 
(the International Atomic Energy Agency) is looking at." 
  They will also discuss "the diplomatic efforts that have 
been 
underway at the United Nations," the spokesman added. 
  Gallucci will join U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry in 
Seoul on April 17 and then he will accompany Perry to Tokyo on 
April 20.

Shanghai: "Whither Will Nuclear Crisis on Korean Peninsula Go?"] 
  [Text] Shanghai, 6 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--On 4 April, the DPRK 
rejected the recent statement made by the UN Security Council 
chairman. The statement urged the DPRK to fulfill the nuclear 
safety accord and to allow International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] inspectors to complete the activities prescribed by the 
agreement reached between the agency and the DPRK last 25 
February. A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said: Since the 
DPRK is in the special position of temporarily suspending its 
withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it is 
"utterly unjustifiable" to ask the DPRK to fulfill the nuclear 
safety accord and to accept additional inspections. On the 
other hand, the DPRK urged the United States to stop exerting 
pressure on it and to settle the nuclear problem on the Korean 
Peninsula through dialogue between the two countries. This move 
by the DPRK undoubtedly made the "nuclear crisis" on the 
peninsula even more subtle. 
<H5>  The United States Is Determined To Exercise a War Deterrent </H5>
  Zhuang Jianzhong, senior analyst in international strategy 
and researcher at the Shanghai International Strategy Institute, 
while analyzing the case, said: As far as the United States is 
concerned, the main purpose and direct effect of bullying the 
DPRK is to guard against nuclear proliferation. The chief U.S. 
strategic consideration since World War II is that the greatest 
threat to the United States comprises nuclear weapons. Hence, 
the United States is extremely sensitive to the issue of nuclear 
proliferation. Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union, 
the CIS no longer trains its nuclear weapons on the United 
States, thus eliminating the greatest U.S. nuclear enemy. 
Hence, the United States holds that, with the end of the Cold 
War, the fact that extremist countries in some regions may 
possess nuclear weapons poses the greatest threat to the United 
States. Therefore, its chief task is to ban nuclear development 
in these countries. 
  The abovementioned reason also explains the uncompromising 
stand by the United States on the DPRK nuclear issue. 
Meanwhile, the United States attaches great importance to 
stability in the East Asian region, which is the key part of 
Asia as well as an important component of the U.S. Asian-Pacific 
strategy, whereas the DPRK nuclear issue has become the serious 
hidden danger to the United States. As far as the political 
aspect is concerned, the United States intends to play a leading 
role in Northeast Asia and to show that both Japan and the ROK 
need U.S. support. 
  The United States is resolute in bullying the DPRK into 
accepting nuclear inspection. As far as the U.S. military 
strategy is concerned, the 1970's theory of brinkmanship has 
changed into the theory of war deterrent in the 1980's and 90's. 
The United States holds that, apart from wielding military 
pressure to achieve results just as it did during the Cuban 
missile crisis, it can also resort to direct military operations 
as it did in Grenada and Panama. According to a report published 
by THE WASHINGTON POST on 31 March, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry 
said that the United States would try its best to prevent the 
DPRK from developing nuclear weapons, even at the risk of waging 
a war. 
  Viewed from a deeper angle, the DPRK in U.S. is the most 
hardline communist stronghold and the United States wants to 
compel the DPRK to give in through this incident. 
<H5>  China in a Decisive Position </H5>
  China also hopes for a stable and denuclearized Korean 
Peninsula. China can be described as occupying a decisive 
position and having a great and unprecedented say in this matter 
because it interacts with both the DPRK and the United States. 
Jiang Zemin and Li Peng remarked separately on this matter, 
expressing the hope that the nuclear issue could be settled 
through peaceful talks between the DPRK and the United States. 
This has been very rare in previous regional conflicts and the 
fact that the UN Security Council adopted the chairman's 
statement as proposed by China also shows how influential China 
is. By comparison, Russia does not have much influence on it. 
  In Zhuang Jianzhong's view, the DPRK does not really want to 
wage war with the ROK and the United States because its national 
power is too poor. At present, the DPRK still wants to upgrade 
its diplomatic standing by establishing ties with the United 
States and engaging in talks with them. It is then looking 
forward to receiving economic aid from others. 
<H5>  The DPRK To Consent To Reexamination </H5>
  To sum up, squabbles and conflicts might arise but 
everything 
depends on the development of the situation. At present, the 
U.S. announcements to deploy Patriot missiles in the ROK and to 
conduct joint military exercise with the ROK are just responsive 
actions, far removed from waging war against the DPRK. 
According to Zhuang Jianzhong, the DPRK will finally accept the 
UN Security Council's request to reexamine its nuclear 
facilities, as long as it is done in a dignified manner.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs 
claimed tonight that Serb forces have successfully repulsed 
today's NATO air raid and Muslim offensive against Serb 
positions in the Gorazde area. 
  It was reported that following Sunday's air raid by two U.S. 
F-16 war planes on the Serb positions southwest of Gorazde, two 
U.S. F-18 jets carried out another bombardment of these 
positions this afternoon. 
  A statement issued by the general staff of the Bosnian Serb 
forces confirmed the second NATO air strike and said it was 
accompanied by an offensive by the Muslim Army. 
  However, it added, the Serb Army repelled "the enemy's 
powerful assaults" and held their positions. 
  It also said a NATO C-130 transport, landing on Tuzla 
Airport 
this afternoon, carried NATO rapid reaction force units and a 
lot of weapons and ammunition. 
  The Serb general staff learned from reliable sources that 
the 
troops, from the NATO base in Frankfurt, will fight alongside 
Muslim soldiers against the Serbs. 
  These facts showed that the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
here has stepped over its peacekeeping mandate and will thus be 
held responsible for the further escalation of the Bosnian war, 
the statement stressed. 
  Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serbs' parliament, 
told the newspaper "POLITIKA" that NATO's second air raid 
indicated that the UN is deliberately helping the Muslims in 
their spring offensives in the Gorazde area. 
  Yasushi Akashi, the UN chief representative in former 
Yugoslavia, explained to the press in Zagreb today why he twice 
asked the NATO to bomb Serb positions. 
  He said that the Bosnian Serb Army had repeatedly attacked 
downtown Gorazde and caused heavy losses and casualties there. 
  He had no choice but to request NATO air raids because the 
Serb Army continued their assaults regardless of repeated UN 
warnings. 
  Akashi also warned that if the Bosnian Serbs dare to 
continue 
their offensives against the Muslims, fresh air strikes will be 
launched to stop them.

<F P=106> [From the "Forum" column: Article by Nihal Jayawickrama, </F>
senior lecturer at Hong Kong University: "Don't Let Basic Law 
Hand China a `State Secrets' Clause:] 
  [Text] The secret trial and conviction in Beijing of a 
Hong Kong journalist and a Chinese bank official for the "theft 
of state secrets", and the grossly iniquitous prison sentences 
imposed on them, have focused attention once more on a crude 
legal and judicial system that refuses to comply with the 
universally accepted minimum standards of criminal justice. 
  But even this outrageous abuse of state power does not 
appear 
to have alerted the Hong Kong community to the very real 
probability that, in barely three years, a law identical to that 
which was invoked to commit these two persons to prison, for the 
crime of disclosing interest rate and gold transaction changes, 
may be introduced into our own legal system. 
  Article 23 of the Basic Law states that the Hong Kong 
Special 
Administrative Region (SAR) shall enact a law to prohibit the 
"theft of state secrets". Today, Hong Kong has its own Official 
Secrets Act. It is a law that seeks to protect from "damaging 
disclosure" information relating to "defence", "security", 
"intelligence" and "international relations". Each of these 
terms is defined in the law with reasonable clarity. While many 
may argue against the reach of this law, few would deny the need 
to protect these interests even under the most open and 
democratic system of government. 
  The Joint Declaration promised that laws previously in force 
in Hong Kong shall be maintained in the SAR. This implied that 
a localised version of the Official Secrets Act would continue 
to operate after 1997. But contrary to that promise, the Basic 
Law decreed that Hong Kong shall also criminalise the "theft of 
state secrets". It was thereby made clear that, "one country; 
two systems" notwithstanding, it was the intention of the 
Chinese authorities that the unique Chinese socialist law 
concept of secrecy be applied and enforced in Hong Kong after 
1997. 
  From recent events we gather that apart from relatively 
trivial information relating to interest rate movements and the 
sale of gold in the international market, the Chinese judiciary 
also regards an embargoed public speech of a senior party 
official as a "state secret". None of these items of 
information qualifies to be an official secret either in Hong 
Kong or in Britain today. Indeed, no sanction has ever followed 
the regular publication of obviously leaked "predictions" of 
budget proposals. When some years ago the embargoed text of the 
Queen's Christmas Day speech was published in advance, the only 
admonition from the palace was a firm declaration that Her 
Majesty was not amused. 
  What has emerged, therefore, are two distinctly 
contradictory 
conceptions of official information. We believe that the free 
flow of such information serves not only to check corruption and 
the abuse of power, but also to increase efficiency and promote 
accountability. The Chinese authorities, on the other hand, 
consider the rigorous control of information as indispensable to 
sustain the essential authoritarianism of their autocratic 
system. Investigative journalism which is fundamental to one 
system is obviously anathema to the other. 
  There has also emerged two substantially different 
conceptions of the role of the judiciary. Their willingness to 
proceed in secret, to deny the accused persons their basic right 
to a defence, and then to impose such grossly disproportionate 
sentences, only tend to confirm the active role of Chinese 
judges in strengthening and consolidating the "dictatorship of 
the proletariat". To even suggest that judges ought not to be 
subservient to the government, as we believe here in Hong Kong, 
would probably be tantamount to blasphemy. 
  Therefore, to enact a law in Hong Kong to criminalise the 
"theft of state secrets" is to alter significantly the existing 
Hong Kong system. It will result in placing an almost 
insurmountable obstacle in the movement towards democracy and 
autonomy. It will erode the principles of the rule of law and 
public accountability, and debilitate at least two of our 
essential institutions: a free press and an independent 
judiciary. It ought not to be done. 
  Unlike those who collaborated in the drafting of the Basic 
Law, a substantial section of today's political leadership 
enjoys a legitimacy which they have acquired through popular 
election or acceptance. If they do not focus on this issue now, 
history is not likely to look upon them too kindly.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "He Who Defies the Law Will Surely Be Punished </F>
According to the Law -- Further Discussion of Xi Yang Case"] 
  [Text] Relevant departments in Beijing have indicated that 
MING PAO journalist Xi Yang was charged for his involvement in 
spying and stealing state secrets on the mainland rather than 
carrying out normal news coverage or "mistakenly trespassing on 
the restricted zone." Through another defendant, Tian Ye (bank 
staff member), Xi Yang spied and stole China's financial and 
economic secrets in June and July last year. China suffered 
serious economic losses when the secrets were published in MING 
PAO. The court holds that Xi Yang's move constituted a crime of 
spying and stealing state secrets and the case was very serious. 
  What secrets did Xi Yang spy out? According to information 
released by the Chinese Government sources last October, the 
financial secrets stolen by Xi Yang include: Unreleased plans 
of the People's Bank of China concerning deposit and loan 
interest rate changes, the decision of the People's Bank of 
China on participating in international bullion transactions, 
and other important financial secrets. 
  According to the Section One of Article 51 of the "PRC 
Criminal Law" and "Supplementary Provision on Punishing the 
Crime of Leaking State Secrets," for his crime of stealing state 
secrets Xi Yang could have been sentenced to a set term of more 
than 10 years' imprisonment, life imprisonment, or even death, 
and deprived of his political rights. 
  Obviously, Chinese judicial organs have tried Xi Yang 
according to the law because his illegal activities violated 
China's laws. China is now administering the country by law and 
anyone who dares to defy the law will be punished. 
  Since reform and opening up, China has made marked progress 
in building its socialist legal system, and the officials and 
inhabitants have enhanced their sense of the legal system. 
Although China's legal system has yet to be further enhanced 
and China is proceeding in this direction, the marked progress 
made by China is this field is known to all. It is puzzling 
that some political groups in Hong Kong and at the press office 
where Xi Yang worked totally ignored this. If the remarks made 
by the outside are excusable owing to the relatively weak links 
in China's legal system in the past (particularly during the 
"Cultural Revolution"), why are people flagrantly trying to 
blame the move when China has vigorously strengthened its legal 
system and acted according to the law? Some people are 
criticizing China every day for its rule by man at the expense 
of rule by law, saying that there is no judicial independence in 
China. However, when China is practicing law and independence 
of the judiciary, they again are making indiscreet remarks, 
confusing right and wrong, wantonly throwing mud at China in an 
attempt to meddle in and undermine China's legal system and 
independence of the judiciary through various channels, and even 
are calling on foreign forces to interfere in China's internal 
affairs. What is all this for? 
  The editorial of a newspaper said yesterday: "According to 
information released by XINHUA (that is, the aforementioned 
important financial secrets), it may be secrets and even 
classified documents to the officials, but it is apparently a 
piece of news to a journalist. He tries to obtain it as a piece 
of news material and report it as a piece of news of public 
interest. This is the professional duty of a journalist." 
Hence, the paper believes that it will "obtain" the material, 
which is of news value, whether or not the "government regards 
it as secret or classified documents" and whether or not it is 
illegal. Are they not encouraging or even forcing journalists 
to violate the law (an editorial of a newspaper referred to it 
by the fine-sounding name of "taking risks in breaking rules")? 
Naturally, the agency with such a viewpoint is trying to defy 
the law in mainland China. They regard China's secrets as 
nothing important, but dare not apply the same method to 
"obtain" secrets of the Hong Kong or British Governments. Such 
a dual standard is identical to their concept of news. However, 
he who defies the law in mainland China will be punished by the 
law. 
  The Chinese judicial authorities handled the Xi Yang case 
according to the law and for his repentance, also sentenced him 
leniently. As Xi has lodged an appeal, the authorities are 
making arrangements for the second trial and have approved the 
defendant's lawyers hired by MING PAO on behalf of Xi Yang. As 
the case involves state secrets, it will not be tried openly. 
This shows the reason, as well as legal principle of the 
judicial authorities. 
  The recent criticisms by a number of Hong Kong political 
figures (some are even judges) and by the agency where Xi Yang 
served that China's judicial system has and will continue to be 
proved to be wrong. When people from the mainland come to Hong 
Kong, they should abide by Hong Kong laws. Hong Kong people 
(including journalists) also should abide by China's laws when 
they travel in mainland China. This is an important aspect of 
the "one country, two systems" concept, which has been proved by 
the Xi Yang case.

  [Text] Local delegates to China's National People's 
Congress (NPC) have fallen out over the text of a letter to 
their chairman Qiao Shi, which requests a detailed explanation 
of the verdict on jailed Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang. At least 
one delegate has refused to sign an amended version of the 
letter, on the grounds that it implied China mishandled the case. 
  Xi, a Chinese national resident in Hong Kong, was arrested 
in 
Beijing late last year on charges of espionage and stealing 
state secrets. His trial was conducted in secret earlier this 
year, and the verdict and 12-year sentence were announced last 
week. 
  A special meeting of local NPC delegates was held last 
Friday 
to discuss the severity of Xi's case. But at least one of the 
delegates who attended the meeting, surveyor Kan Fook-yee, 
refused to sign an amended version of the letter, saying the 
initial draft had taken a "more neutral" stance on Xi's case. 
  The letter, drafted by Cheng Yiu-tong, Ng Hong-man and Peter 
Wong, was circulated among other local delegates. It had asked 
the NPC Standing Committee to demand that the Beijing Municipal 
People's Intermediate Court reveal the full text of the verdict 
against Xi. It also urged that the hearing of Xi's appeal 
against his sentence be conducted in full accordance with 
Chinese law. 
  Mr Kan said the amended version, after other delegates had 
added their opinions, insinuated that China had mishandled Xi's 
case. He said he would not sign a letter which took a specific 
stance on the case, before the Chinese government was given an 
opportunity to provide a full explanation. Mr Kan argued it was 
not proper to question the fairness of the Chinese judiciary 
without being fully aware of the circumstances of Xi's case. 
  Another delegate and lawyer, Dorothy Liu, said she had 
noticed differences between the two versions. But she did not 
think the amended version contained any improper suggestions. 
Miss Liu had already signed the amended letter which was 
expected to reach the NPC chairman later this week.

  [Text] Local delegates of the National People's Congress 
will sign a letter to their chairman Qiao Shi urging that 
Chinese authorities give a detailed account of the verdict 
against Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang. The letter drafted by 
Cheng Yiu-tong, Ng Hongman and Peter Wong Mankong, is 
circulating among other local delegates and is expected to be on 
its way to Mr Qiao early this week. The letter asks the 
congress' executive committee to press Beijing Municipal 
People's Intermediate Court to reveal the full text of the 
verdict that brought Xi a 12-year jail sentence. It also urges 
for a fair hearing of Xi's appeal in full accordance with 
Chinese law. 
  Mr Wong warned that the emotional public reaction may harm 
Xi's appeal. He also appealed to reporters and legislators not 
to resort to the British Government for help, saying this would 
complicate the issue. 
  A law lecturer yesterday pointed out that China had violated 
its own statutes when it refused to publish specific offences 
for which Xi, 38, had been convicted. Lecturer of the City 
Polytechnic of Hong Kong Priscilla Leung said Chinese law 
stipulated that these details had to be announced at the time of 
sentencing. The court, however, had released only a brief 
statement saying that Xi was to serve 12 years in jail, with a 
loss of political rights, for "spying and stealing state 
secrets". 
  Ms Leung said only very serious circumstances would attract 
a 
severe penalty of more than 10 years. She called for a clearer 
definition of the term "state secret" to put the severity of 
this offence in perspective and to protect the journalistic 
profession. She added that there was no specific law to protect 
journalists under existing Chinese jurisdiction. 
  Journalist colleagues at Xi's newspaper, MING PAO, and 
student representatives continued to protest outside the Happy 
Valley headquarters of XINHUA (the New China News Agency) 
yesterday. More than 200 representatives of the Hong Kong 
Federation of Students called for a fair and open trial and 
respect for press freedom. MING PAO colleagues ended their 
three-day hunger strike at 10 pm. Other staff distributed 30,000 
copies of a 15-page colour special on Xi.

<F P=106> [By Xu Ximin, Hong Kong delegate to the Chinese People's </F>
Political Consultative Conference, Preliminary Working Committee 
member, and publisher of MIRROR magazine: "Urgent Need To 
Reform China's Legal System"] 
  [Text] I am shocked and frustrated, especially as a 
publisher and one who always thought Xi Yang would be released 
soon. Certainly, he does not deserve such a harsh punishment. 
  I am not saying he did not breach Chinese law, but what he 
did do was fully in keeping with his role as a responsible 
reporter. His wrongdoing, which included the disclosure of the 
unpublished interest rate adjustment by the People's Bank of 
China as well as information about the bank's international gold 
transactions, did bring some adverse effects to the Chinese 
economy. 
  And that was the reason why he was charged with "spying and 
stealing state secrets". But gathering information through 
personal contacts is important, especially in Hong Kong where 
the media is highly advanced. 
  Every year Hong Kong reporters reveal the Budget in advance. 
The Government may face economic losses since this news allows 
people to prepare for its new measures. But no reporter has 
been punished for such disclosures. The idea in reporters' 
minds is they will be the best journalist if they reveal 
accurate and exclusive information. 
  In addition, the "damage" Xi did was very little when 
compared with some unscrupulous mainland bank officials, who 
illegally lent money to others and disrupted the economic order 
in China. Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji still gave lenient 
treatment to them by letting them off without any criminal 
charges. 
  So why should the authorities sentence Xi to such a heavy 
jail term? I explained these points to officials of the Beijing 
Municipal People's Procuratorate and they agreed. They also 
told me Xi had not spied for any foreign country or used the 
unpublished information for business purposes. 
  These were the reasons why I was previously optimistic Xi 
would be released or, at least, only receive a light sentence. 
  Twelve years in jail is too heavy a penalty. What we must do 
is hope for a lighter sentence after the appeal. 
  The case itself shows the backwardness of the Chinese legal 
system, which is in urgent need of reform. The Chinese 
judiciary has failed to comply with the basic principle of a 
fair trial that justice should not only be done, but seen to be 
done. 
  I believe the case was dealt in accordance with Chinese law 
but people may doubt that. The trial was not open to the 
public, even Xi's family and his employer Ming Pao were not 
allowed to listen, and no details about the hearing have been 
released. 
  Although authorities defended this because the case related 
to state secrets, they should have at least announced the start 
and end of the trial and its result. 
  The Chinese Government should be able to release more 
details 
on the Xi Yang case without breaching the principle of not 
disclosing state secrets. And it should allow Xi's family to 
visit him, and let some Hong Kong representatives, like the 
local delegates to the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference or National People's Congress, to be present. That 
would also help restore Hong Kong people's confidence in the 
mainland legal system. 
  Now it is inevitable local journalists will be 
psychologically affected by the case, worrying they may one day 
be arrested and jailed when covering news in China. 
  In the long term, Xinhua or the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office, should give some guidelines to Hong Kong journalists 
working in China. 
  But this is only wishful thinking. The reality is China has 
not yet drafted any specific law on journalism, even though the 
issue has been discussed for more than 10 years. Existing 
Chinese laws were drafted more than 15 years ago, some even 
before the Cultural Revolution, and have failed to keep up with 
the pace of economic reform.

  [Text] China has widened the scope of its united-front 
campaign by enlisting prominent liberals, more professionals and 
sons and daughters of local billionaires to serve as Hong Kong 
affairs advisers. Among the 50 advisers announced yesterday 
were leading banker Sir Quo-wei Lee, veteran legislator Elsie 
Tu, appointed legislator Vincent Cheng Hoi-chuen and celebrity 
and writer James Wong. 
  Yesterday's third round of invitations took to 141 the 
number 
of Hong Kong affairs advisers to Beijing. The appointment 
ceremony will be held in Beijing next month. Beijing officials 
said they would consider inviting even more to give their views 
on territory affairs. "We are also considering ways to 
strengthen the participation of advisers in the work of the 
Preliminary Working Committee," a mainland official said. 
  Eight of the latest batch are Legislative Councillors. They 
are Mrs Tu, James Tien Pei-chun, Peggy Lam Pei Yu-dja, Hui 
Yin-fat, Frederick Fung Kin-kee, Henry Tang Ying-yen, Vincent 
Cheng and Tang Siu-tong. About a quarter of the lawmaking body 
-- 15 legislators -- now also serve as Beijing advisers. 
  Unlike the previous rounds of appointments, leaders of minor 
liberal parties have been invited. As expected, the liberal 
flagship -- the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) -- has been 
snubbed again. However, Lau Kong-wah, a former core member of 
the UDHK who later quit the party, is on the list. As well as 
Mr Fung, Chang Kamun, who is the council chairman of the 
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL), joins 
the group. Mr Fung is the ADPL's chairman. The Meeting Point's 
chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung and two founding members, Dr 
Thomas Chan Man-hung and Dr Tsang Shu-ki, accepted invitations. 
Dr Chan and Dr Tsang are economists at post-secondary 
institutes. 
  A mainland official said the time was ripe to canvass the 
views of liberal elements. "They are invited because we want to 
have a wider spectrum of views," he said. "The closer the 
changeover of sovereignty, the greater the need for a wide range 
of views... We have no fundamental difference with the 
liberals. They just want a faster pace of democracy." The 
official, who was involved in the selection process, said it 
would be impossible to bring in members of the UDHK who were 
connected with "subversive" activities against China. 
  In a move that could undermine the authority of the British 
administration in the countdown to 1997, Beijing offered seats 
to some political figures with close ties to the Hong Kong 
Government in the past. They include Mr Cheng, Hong Kong Bank's 
chief economist and former member of the Government think-tank; 
Sir Quo-wei, chairman of Hang Seng Bank; and Nicky Chan 
Nai-keung, formerly secretary for lands and works. 
  In this round, younger members of the territory's richest 
families have been offered the opportunity to join politics. 
Among them are Richard Li Tzar-kuoi, elder son of tycoon Li 
Ka-shing; Anna Pao Pui-hing, eldest daughter of the late 
shipping magnate Sir Yue-kong Pao, and Ian Fok Chun-wan, son of 
Henry Fok Ying-tung. The senior Fok is now vice-chairman of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, ranking as a 
vice-minister under the Chinese hierarchy. The three are less 
well-known in the political arena. Asked if their appointment 
was connected with their family ties, the mainland official 
said: "It's hard for me to answer this question."

<F P=106> [By Irene So and Linda Choy] </F>
  [Text] The appointment of a former United Democrat (UDHK), 
Lau Kong-wah, to China's advisory body was criticized as a 
further step to isolate the party whose previous attempts to 
communicate with Beijing officials have been turned down. 
Describing the appointment as a "united front tactic", chairman 
Martin Lee Chu-ming said: "It shows the Chinese Government is 
continuing to isolate the UDHK in building up a united front by 
recruiting more democrats as advisers." 
  Mr Lau, a member of the Sha Tin District Board and Regional 
Council, resigned from the party one year ago because he was 
dissatisfied with the lack of communication between the central 
and district levels of the party. Mr Lau would not say whether 
his former membership of the UDHK was related to the appointment. 
  Mr Lee dismissed the suggestions that some UDHK members 
might 
follow suit and leave the party in order to join the united 
front. "Even if China wants to appoint UDHK members in future, 
our central standing committee may not approve it," Mr Lee said. 
  The newly-appointed advisers yesterday rejected suggestions 
that their acceptance of China's offer meant they were shifting 
to the pro-China camp. Many appointees said the need to improve 
communications with the mainland because of the deadlock over 
the territory's political development had prompted them to take 
up the posts. 
  Hang Seng Bank chairman Sir Quo-wei Lee, formerly an 
Executive Councillor said there was a need to reflect the views 
of Hong Kong people. Sir Quo-wei, who dismissed the suggestion 
that he was shifting to the pro-China camp politically, added: 
"It is not necessarily anti-British to become a Hong Kong 
affairs adviser." 
  Another appointee, the vice-chancellor of the Hong Kong City 
Polytechnic, Patrick Cheng Yiu-chung, said he believed there was 
no difference serving advisory groups under British rule and 
those under China's. "I have served on numerous advisory 
committees set up by the Hong Kong Government in the past 10 
years or so. My students protested that they were only 
decorative bodies to mislead the public, but I still took the 
posts as long as I could achieve something. I really do not see 
any difference between helping the British Government and the 
Chinese Government," he said. Mr Cheng said it was difficult 
for the two countries to cooperate over political issues and 
more preparation should be laid in other areas of the transition. 
  Another appointee, former chairman of the Law Society Donald 
Yap, said there was a pressing need to communicate with China. 
But he said he had yet to formulate his own views on subjects 
such as the composition of the Court of Final Appeal. The legal 
profession has expressed strong opposition towards the 
Sino-British agreement on the court. As for the jailing in 
China of Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang, Mr Yap said Beijing should 
either give more details about the case or explain why it could 
not.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Critics' Role in Keeping Two Systems"] </F>
  [Text] Two cheers for China's new list of Hong Kong 
affairs advisers. By including people from the "moderate" 
democratic camp, including Meeting Point, the Association of 
Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) and even the Hong Kong 
Bank's Legislative Council representative Vincent Cheng 
Hoi-chuen, Beijing has moved towards broader consultation. 
  A third cheer would be misplaced. The selection is better 
than the uncritical supporters found in the previous lists but 
the new list contains no consistent critics of Chinese policy. 
It does include a few who could be relied on to argue logically 
against flawed ideas in their areas of expertise. The question 
which almost certainly will arise, however, is would many be 
prepared to speak out publicly against a Chinese position? The 
most striking, if not surprising, omission is that of outspoken 
supporters of political reform. The ADPL has broadcast its 
disagreement with Chris Patten's attempts to broaden the 
franchise, as has the newly appointed Elsie Tu. Meeting Point 
faces both ways. Mr Cheng prefers to keep his ideas to himself. 
Even the appointment of former United Democrats member Lau 
Kong-wah appears to be a slap in the face for his old political 
allies. 
  The appointment of moderates and formerly pro-British 
figures 
is a typical united front tactic. It rewards defection and 
makes life in the pro-China camp seem attractive to the 
waverers. But as a means of effective, broad-based consultation 
it is highly limited. If China really wanted to know how its 
policies and pronouncements would affect Hong Kong, it should be 
prepared to approach its critics. 
  This may be an academic point: those members of the United 
Democrats China has branded subversives could hardly accept the 
position in the unlikely event they were approached. Even lower 
profile United Democrats members would regard appointment as a 
poisoned chalice. So polarised has opinion become, service as 
an adviser might be denounced as collaboration. 
  But China has contributed to this air of anxiety and 
suspicion. Had it appointed and listened to all shades of 
opinion from the start, it would not now be faced with such 
hostility and distrust. 
  It should rethink its approach, declaring itself open to all 
opinions. Hearing the views of people who are prepared to say 
only what they think Beijing wants to hear does not advance 
China's understanding of the complexities of Hong Kong society. 
Appointing democrats as advisers might be counter-productive. 
But inviting critics to give their views -- and listening to 
them -- might help heal some of the wounds of the past five 
years. It might also lead to more balanced, less 
confrontational policy -- for the good of Hong Kong. 
  One reason for listening to all shades of opinion is to 
prevent the further erosion of confidence in the concept of "one 
country, two systems" after 1997. 
  Liberal lawyers were shocked at Duanmu Zheng's recent 
prediction that the common law system would gradually disappear. 
The Vice-President of the Supreme People's Court of China and 
former Basic Law drafter said judgments based on precedent, 
instead of the available evidence, relied too much on the 
British system. He praised the mainland system as simpler. 
  Coming from a man of such influence, the remarks were seen 
as 
a threat. The subtext read into his statement was that the 
independence of the judiciary enshrined in the British legal 
system (as well as the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law) 
would be phased out with it. 
  Among lawyers appointed as Hong Kong affairs advisers, a 
different view prevails. A gradual change is seen as 
inevitable. Chinese company law is already copied from Hong Kong 
law. Given the relative maturity of the two systems, it is 
likely Hong Kong law will continue to influence China more than 
the other way round. 
  The opposing views are not mutually exclusive. It is 
possible for Hong Kong to influence mainland law without 
preventing the dismantling of local judicial independence. 
Phasing out the reliance on precedents would make political 
manipulation easier, but not inevitable. Other former British 
colonies have stopped relying automatically on English legal 
precedents, often following instead the thinking behind relevant 
judgments in other common law jurisdictions. What matters is 
not the English system per se, but judicial independence, the 
presumption of innocence, and the maintenance of the rule of law 
over the arbitrary "rule of man". 
  By listening to all shades of opinion, Beijing could help 
assuage local fears of political manipulation. Consulting only 
those prepared to give China the benefit of the doubt will 
increase the suspicion and fear among those it still excludes.

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by Political Editor Chip Tsao: "Power Pagoda Is </F>
Not Immune to its Own Divisions"] 
  [Text] China made another move yesterday to tighten the 
web of tungzhan - the Maoist ploy of producing a so-called 
united front -- by appointing another batch of 50 Hong Kong 
affairs advisers. With this "magic weapon", as Mao proudly put 
it, the Communist Party conquered the Kuomintang and won the 
civil war. This time the Chinese used it on Chris Patten, yet 
whether it still functions as convincingly as it did 50 years 
ago looks less assured. 
  The most remarkable feature of the latest round of the 
united-front battle is the winning over of 15 legislators -- a 
quarter of those who sit under the dome of Hong Kong's 
legislature. Beijing also claimed the trophy of one former Hong 
Kong government civil servant, although the names of the most 
precious -- John Chan, former secretary for education and 
manpower, and Yeung Kai-yin, former secretary for the treasury 
-- are still missing. It has been reported that they declined 
offers to become advisers. 
  As the 1997 handover approaches, the strength of Beijing's 
united front seems to be growing impressively. Beijing has 
managed to build a pagoda of a powerbase, which is designed to 
make every inhabitant happy. While the professions of all these 
members -- ranging from pig farmer to retired Supreme Court 
judge -- remain comparable to those in Canterbury Tales, the 
political message is clear. 
  The district affairs advisers form a grassroots base, a 
shadow of the Hong Kong government's district boards and 
regional councils. On top are the Hong Kong affairs advisers, 
who comprise an impressive number of politicians, businessmen 
and academics. One stair up from that is the more ambitious 
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), a group of 30 Hong Kong 
members rumoured to be the pool of rising stars from which the 
potential future chief executive of the Special Administrative 
Region (SAR) is to be chosen. Apart from these new residents, 
there are the supposedly more respectable veteran patriots: the 
Hong Kong deputies of China's National People's Congress (NPC) 
and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Not 
only does this huge institutional structure provide the training 
ground for the post-1997 power struggle among locals, it also 
enables Hong Kong people to glimpse the cumbersome bureaucracy 
of politics in the SAR. 
  The solicitor and NPC deputy Liu Yiu-chu is not the only one 
to be openly bitter about some former colonial servants, such as 
Sir S Y Chung, who has jumped the "patriotic" queue to become a 
Hong Kong affairs adviser. Asked what he could achieve as a 
Hong Kong affairs adviser, David Chu, an electrical engineer and 
businessman trained in the United States, complained that much 
"advice" he offered fell on deaf ears. Henry Fok, a top 
pro-China Hong Kong tycoon, said humbly that he was too "lazy" 
to participate in much work. Wu Kang-min described his own 
performance as "so-so". "The title of Hong Kong affairs adviser 
was little more than that of a British gong," he said. 
  But a British honour is still not quite the same thing. The 
Queen is always less generous about giving too many away at one 
time, knowing that the value will slip if the market is flooded. 
Many PWC members and Hong Kong affairs advisers, such as Rita 
Fan and Lau Wong-fat, have never declared their intentions to 
return their CBEs or OBEs -- although they know it would help 
their political futures. 
  Commentators might hail China's "tolerance" in appointing a 
small number of moderates -- notably the legislator Fung 
Kin-kee, leader of the Association for Democracy and People's 
Livelihood, and Anthony Cheung, chairman of Meeting Point. The 
objective is clearly to divide the democratic elements in the 
Legislative Council in order to, as Mao said, "unite the great 
majority and conquer the tiny minority" -- the "tiny minority" 
being Martin Lee's United Democrats. Such a divide-and-conquer 
ploy could indeed turn into a double-edged knife. Liu Yiu-chu 
has already caused enough division within the troops of the 
united front. 
  People like Fung and Cheung, with their eyes fixed on the 
1995 Legco election cannot afford to behave in too obsequious a 
manner towards Beijing. That might look offensive to the 
electorate. The result is they will blow the fresh air of 
democracy by speaking for Hong Kong's interests in the group. 
This, in turn, will have an effect upon the others, who might 
join the race to be seen as outspoken. The Xi Yang case is one 
example. Tam Yiu-chung's call for a cap on Chinese speculation 
in Hong Kong's property market is another. And there will be 
more. 
  Even those who prefer to say what Beijing loves to hear are 
now giving their future master a dose of trouble. Some PWC 
members "advised" Beijing to ask civil servants to biao-tai -- 
declare one's position before 1997 -- but this was dismissed by 
Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. 
Other proposals to add "objective standards" for returning Hong 
Kong emigres to re-establish their right of abode have been met 
with indifference from China. 
  So the united front does not look that united after all. It 
has still to be seen who is the master at playing the 
divide-and-conquer game, a pastime that Beijing has always 
accused Britain of indulging in. At least for the time being, 
there is every reason to believe the British are enjoying some 
quiet satisfaction.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Does China Want Advice or an Echo?"] </F>
  [Text] Those with a taste for irony cannot help but notice 
that China has given an official advisory role to a quarter of 
the members of the Legislative Council [Legco]: A body it 
publicly disdains. 
  Yesterday, China announced the names of another batch of 
advisers on Hong Kong affairs, including a number of Legco 
members. Also, as expected, Beijing has appointed a couple of 
prominent liberals, in a significant gesture intended to enhance 
the credibility of the new group and to help split the 
pro-democracy camp. 
  We would like to believe China's motivation is less cynical 
and more straightforward than the announcement suggests. In 
other words, that the Chinese government was keen to appoint a 
wider spectrum of members and therefore receive a broader range 
of local opinion. 
  This view would be sustainable if China had enrolled 
political leaders who secured the highest numbers of votes in 
past elections. Instead, Beijing has opted for a clutch of 
politicians who have never stood for office or have done so and 
been rejected by the electorate. 
  There is one significant exception to this general rule of 
Chinese appointments: Elsie Tu. Tu is undeniably a popular 
politician, who made her reputation as a champion of the 
underdog and as someone who was fearless in standing up to the 
authorities. 
  Idealists may believe China is soliciting Tu's advice 
because 
the government in Beijing is keen to have an outspoken 
campaigner hammering away from inside. 
  Realists are more likely to conclude that Tu has been 
appointed as a reward for her unflinching opposition to Governor 
Patten's democratic reform plans. 
  Here is the rub. China's appointments appear to have been 
made on the basis of reward for services rendered. In this case 
the service of opposing the reform proposals. 
  The appointment of Frederick Fung, the leader of the 
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood and Anthony 
Cheung, a Meeting Point leader, appears to be even more 
cynically motivated. China has rightly identified the weak 
links in the democracy camp's chain and has employed a tactic 
frequently used by the rulers of the British Empire at the 
height of their powers. 
  The divide-and-rule tactic was a hallmark of British 
colonial 
policy. Chinese leaders seem to have been studying these 
methods and concluded that one of the best ways of weakening the 
democracy camp was to pick off those most likely to wobble when 
pushed. 
  Having started with the appointment of advisers who were 
either very rich, very loyal to China or very adept at changing 
sides, the government in Beijing has grown wise and realised 
appearances are important. 
  Thus, this third batch gives every appearance of creating 
balance. The clutch of liberals are joined by a number of 
establishment politicians and some respected professionals. 
  Yet, are there any signs the Chinese government really wants 
to receive Hong Kong advice from a genuine cross-section of the 
community? China stoutly refuses to contemplate talking to 
members of the United Democrats, the territory's largest 
political party. This is in sharp contrast to its willingness 
for dialogue with the Kuomintang -- the Communist Party's bitter 
rival in the civil war. Aside from the United Democrats, there 
is a large pool of people who have become involved in politics 
and shown their ability to understand the issues facing Hong 
Kong. There also are a great many genuinely independent 
personalities who would have much to offer an advisory body; not 
the least because they would provide blunt advice, however 
unpalatable. 
  China should know some of the best advice comes not from 
friends, nor from sycophants who are anxious to please, but from 
impartial sources or even enemies. 
  The latter have an uncanny knack of zeroing in on weaknesses 
which more sympathetic parties might be inclined to overlook. 
  Interestingly, however, some of China's most outspoken 
advice 
has come from some of its oldest Hong Kong allies, who clearly 
feel secure enough to speak bluntly on occasion. Some of these 
long-term supporters of China are firmly entrenched in 
grassroots organisations which provide a good sounding board for 
popular sentiment. 
  Hopefully, some of the newer advisers, appointed yesterday, 
will seize this opportunity to treat their new position not as a 
Chinese version of the British honours system, but as a serious 
opportunity to keep China informed of Hong Kong sentiment. 
  China would do itself a favour if it was prepared to cast 
the 
net wider in searching for advice but, as this is unlikely, a 
heavy burden of responsibility lies on those chosen to act as a 
bridge to the new regime. 
  If they dodge that responsibility by simply mouthing lines 
they believe their new masters want to hear, they will have much 
to answer for.

  [Text] In a move that has shocked British officials, China 
is proposing to further restrict the eligibility criteria for 
Hong Kong's new Court of Final Appeal (CFA). Non-Chinese will 
in effect be barred from holding the three positions held by 
"local judges". 
  The Legislative Council has already refused to endorse the 
1991 Sino-British agreement on the establishment of the 
post-1997 CFA because it allows only one overseas judge to join 
the other five justices who will make up the court. 
  Now it appears that China has an even more restrictive 
definition of who will qualify to serve as the three "local 
judges". A senior Chinese official told Eastern Express 
yesterday that they must be "Hong Kong permanent residents 
without any right of abode in any foreign countries". This 
requirement is the same as that which applies to the Chief 
Justice, who will be the fifth member of the CFA. 
  China's new definition drew an immediate hostile response 
from a senior government official. "The Joint Declaration, the 
Basic Law and the Sino-British agreement on the Court of Final 
Appeal are very clear on this point. The words have a simple 
and plain meaning. If this is the Chinese view they ought to 
let us know through the formal channels, i.e. the Joint Liaison 
Group (JLG). If they would do so they would have to explain how 
this view could be made consistent with what the agreements 
actually say," the government official said. 
  The mini-constitution, or Basic Law, for Hong Kong after 
1997 
does not offer any precise definition for the nationality and 
residence status of the local judges. A second draft bill for 
the establishment of the FCA is being finalised by the Legal 
Department and will be submitted to the Executive Council 
shortly. 
  The Government maintains that the bill will be drafted on 
the 
basis of the Sino-British agreement, which states that Hong Kong 
"local" judges refers to judges who are permanent residents. 
They may be expatriates and no nationality requirement should 
be imposed. 
  A locally-based British official said the definition of the 
word "local" was a difficult and sensitive issue. We do not 
have a definition of right of abode and of what is 'Chinese' 
yet. That obviously will affect the definition in terms of 
judges in CFA." 
  The legislator Simon Ip, former chairman of the Law Society, 
said the attention of legislators and the legal profession would 
be focused on any nationality requirement for the three local 
judges. 
  Ip said that China's requirements would be unacceptable to 
the legal profession and to himself.

  [Text] Secret accounts holding millions of dollars used by 
the Mafia to bribe Italian politicians, judges and police have 
been traced to Hong Kong and are set to be exposed, legal 
sources said yesterday. The territory has become a focal point 
for Italy's corruption investigators as they zero in on public 
figures who switched bribes from Rome to numerous company 
accounts in Hong Kong. 
  The man heading the inquiry, Judge Antonio Di Pietro, has 
asked the Legal Department for permission to expose the graft to 
a "blowtorch of scrutiny", a source told the SOUTH CHINA MORNING 
POST. Judge Di Pietro, who requires a constant security cordon 
because of his prominence and success as Italy's numero uno in 
the "Clean Hands" inquiry, needs the green light from the Hong 
Kong Government before he can press ahead. 
  "A Hong Kong judge will hold a hearing in chambers soon to 
decide whether to grant the request to investigate company 
accounts and question their directors in the territory," the 
legal source said. "We understand that Judge Di Pietro will be 
visiting Hong Kong and he will attend the hearing in chambers. 
Lawyers in Hong Kong will have been instructed by the Court of 
Milan to proceed with it," the source said. 
  Providing the proper procedure is followed and supporting 
documents from the Court of Milan are all in order, the Hong 
Kong judge would usually grant the request under the terms of an 
international mutual legal assistance treaty. 
  A massive web of corruption spanning a generation of 
Italians 
and embroiling hundreds of elite figures including five former 
prime ministers has been steadily undone since "Clean Hands" was 
launched two years ago. The cost of exposing the graft tainting 
Italy's judiciary, police force, parliament and private sector 
has been severe, with mob retaliations including the murder of 
Mafia-busting Judge Paolo Borsellino and five bodyguards. 
  Judge Di Pietro told an Australian Institute of Criminology 
conference on Thursday that his investigations were particularly 
concentrated in the territory where about 20 companies had been 
operating on behalf of Italian politicians. He said Hong Kong 
was favoured by politicians for holding and laundering funds, 
much of which was switched to the Bahamas and Liechtenstein. 
  Singapore and the Cook Islands have also come under Judge Di 
Pietro's focus as transit points for tainted cash. "We have 
found a common denominator in these kinds of inquiries. The 
utilisation of funds which were offshore or in countries with 
legislation that was open to this kind of exploitation," he 
said. He said the front companies involved were not only 
Italian, but also multi-nationals and other foreign ventures. 
  A diplomat in the Italian Consulate in Hong Kong, Davide 
Lacecilia, said he had no knowledge of the inquiry in the 
territory. Judge Di Pietro worked independently of Italy's 
consulates, he said.

<F P=106> [By Anhui radio station correspondent Hua Yan (5478) and </F>
ANHUI RIBAO correspondents Li Changwen (2621 2490 2429) and 
Huang Xiaohong (7806 2556 4767)] 
  [Text] At a provincial meeting on propaganda and 
ideological work held on 5 March, Comrade Fu Xishou delivered an 
important speech. 
  Comrades Lu Rongjing, Wang Taihua, Liu Guangcai, Du Cheng, 
Tu 
Yijin, Yang Duoliang, Wang Sheyun, and Hou Yongtong attended the 
meeting, which was presided over by Comrade Fang Zhaoxiang. 
  Fu Xishou's report is composed of three parts: first, 
concerning the economic situation in 1993; second, concerning 
this year's economic work; and third, opinions about propaganda 
work in the economic field. 
  While talking about Anhui's economic situation since 1993, 
Fu 
Xishou said: Anhui enjoyed fairly rapid development in 1993. 
Despite economic fluctuations, Anhui has achieved its goal of 
maintaining rapid economic growth. As a result, Anhui ranks 
high in economic growth among all provinces in China. Bumper 
agricultural harvests and overall improvement of the rural 
economy have effectively supported the rapid growth of the 
national economy. Industrial production, which has increased by 
a large margin and enjoyed a large expansion in overall economic 
performance, has played a role in spurring rapid economic 
growth. Fairly good results have been achieved in the 
construction of infrastructural projects, adding more strength 
for economic development. In line with rapid economic growth, 
Anhui's incomes have remarkably improved, as have the incomes of 
its urban and rural residents. Important progress has been 
achieved in reform and opening up. The national economy has 
become more market-oriented. As a result, economic development 
is further invigorated. 
  While talking about this year's economic work, Fu Xishou 
stated: Generally speaking, the basic tasks for this year's 
economic work are to deepen reform, promote development, and 
maintain stability by seizing opportunities and by doing our job 
in a thorough manner. Efforts should be made to ensure that 
reform, development, and stability will coordinate and promote 
one another. To achieve good results in performing this year's 
work, he put forward the following requirements: We should have 
a full understanding of current favorable opportunities and make 
good use of them. We should try in every possible way to 
maintain good momentum in our economic growth. Major efforts 
should be made in optimizing economic structures and enhancing 
economic performance. Particularly, we should rely on 
scientific and technological progress in a bid to manufacture 
more products with less input. In carrying out this year's 
reform, we should continue to concentrate on changing the 
management mechanism of state-owned enterprises; on actively 
exploring effective methods to establish a modern enterprise 
system; on accelerating reform in finance, taxation, banking, 
foreign trade, foreign exchange, planned investment, and other 
fields; and on establishing a macroeconomic control system that 
meets the needs of a market economy. More efforts should be 
made to carry out reform. With new breakthroughs in reform, we 
can achieve greater economic development. We should discover in 
a timely fashion and pay great attention to the problems 
cropping up during the course of reform and economic development 
so as to maintain stability of the overall situation. 
  Concerning how to carry out the current propaganda work in 
the economic field, Fu Xishou put forth the following opinions: 
First, it is necessary to uphold the correct guidance of public 
opinion so as to steer Anhui people's enthusiasm and creativity 
to the drive of reform and economic development. This year's 
reform is unprecedentedly large in scale. We should have a 
clear-cut stand in publicizing and supporting reform. We should 
provide effective ideological guarantees and a fine public 
opinion environment for the introduction of major reform 
measures. Second, it is necessary to establish and give 
publicity to Anhui's new image. In doing so, the people of 
Anhui should seize opportunities, deepen reform, open up wider 
to the outside world, and speed up economic development. In 
addition, we should also try to do a good job on the propaganda 
and ideological front. We should have a good command of the 
overall situation, persist in seeking truth from facts, and 
neither overestimate nor underestimate our capability. We 
should make more efforts in giving publicity to Anhui's 
achievements and progress. Third, we should actively explore new 
methods for carrying out propaganda work under a socialist 
market economy. In light of the central work and important 
plans of the party and government, we should effectively 
organize large propaganda campaigns and enhance our ability in 
organizing such campaigns. Meanwhile, we should pay attention 
to in-depth publicity. Particularly, we should be good at 
scooping out economic news which are of important significance 
of the times. Continued efforts should be made to publicize our 
excellent enterprises and quality products. Fourth, leaders at 
all levels should pay great attention to propaganda and 
ideological work, and should support such work with real actions. 
  More than 570 comrades heard Fu Xishou's report. They were 
party secretaries and propaganda department heads of all 
prefectures and cities; directors of all county-level propaganda 
developments; responsible persons of relevant units directly 
under the provincial government; responsible persons of 
universities and large enterprises; and responsible comrades who 
attended the provincial meetings on radio and television work, 
cultural work, foreign propaganda work, press and publication 
work, and work concerning provincial federations of literary and 
art circles.

  [Text] The provincial party committee and provincial 
government yesterday afternoon held a provincial telephone 
meeting on rural work. The meeting was presided over by 
Governor Zhu Senlin. Vice Governor Ou Guangyuan briefed the 
participants on the guidelines laid by the national meeting on 
rural work, and gave some opinions on the actual circumstances 
of the province. 
  Ou Guangyuan said: Party and government cadres at all levels 
must treat agriculture, especially grain production, as a major 
task that must be accomplished to stabilize society and the 
country. He stressed that this year's task of growing grain 
over 49 million mu of land must be completed. This is 
mandatory, he said. If the early rice-growing quota is not 
fulfilled, then the deficiency must be made up by growing more 
late rice. He pointed out that how well the grain-growing task 
is completed must be taken as a principal criterion for the 
assessment of the performance of leading people at all levels. 
  Ou Guangyuan said: While completing the grain-growing task, 
we are to apply the method of subsidizing agriculture with 
profits earned from industry to increasing grain growers' income. 
  Addressing the meeting, Governor Zhu Senlin stressed that it 
is necessary for people to be fully aware that grain production 
is an important factor to ensure social stability. Grain and 
food supply is an important matter in our efforts to keep 
commodity prices stable. All local authorities must 
persistently implement the system by which designated officials 
assume responsibility for production, supply, marketing, and 
storage of grain, as well as the relevant performance assessment 
system. Since grain production promises low economic returns, 
one cannot totally rely on market regulation with regard to 
grain trade, instead, one must strengthen macroeconomic 
regulation by administrative and economic means. 
  Zhu Senlin said: In order to implement all the measures for 
increasing grain output and returns, all kinds of services must 
be introduced in good time, thus ensuring that peasants' income 
will increase. We can no longer tolerate cases such as those in 
which grain growers' income remains constant or even decreases 
despite increase in grain output.

  [Text] Chengdu, China, April 10 KYODO -- Locals in the 
western part of China's remote Sichuan Province have long 
consumed Matsutake mushrooms without realizing that a highly 
profitable export item for the Japanese market was growing under 
noses. It took an enterprising private Japanese businessman to 
stumble onto the possibility and create a highly profitable 
business at 50 dollars a kilogram for an initial investment of 
only 100,000 dollars. 
  The Matsutake processing plant is only one of a number of 
Japanese business ventures that have "mushroomed" in the 
economic development zones surrounding the provincial capital of 
Chengdu. 
  With central government approval, Chengdu is now bent on 
becoming the economic hub of the previously backward inland 
areas of the Chinese southwest. 
  There are five development zones in Chengdu, each offering 
special privileges and competing fiercely for foreign 
investment. Some are out for the latest "cutting edge" 
technology, others are more intent on creating jobs. 
  The Longguan Development Zone, in a prime agricultural 
district alongside the Chengdu-Chongqing Expressway now under 
construction, is in the latter category. Longguan plays host to 
the successful Matsutake business, one of 50 foreign enterprises 
now in the area. 
  On a more ambitious scale, the giant motorcycle manufacturer 
Yamaha Motor Co., whose main operation is the Jianshe 
Manufacturing Plant Chongqing, produces various engine 
components in the Longguan Zone. 
  Another Japanese company, which Chinese officials did not 
name, was said to be holding talks with a local military factory 
converted to civilian use about a project to produce car and 
motorcycle engines. It is part of the potential development of 
Chengdu as an "automobile city," an idea floated by General 
Motors of the United States, whose officials have visited the 
area several times for discussions and a feasibility study. 
  Longguan, meanwhile, will see former military manufacturers 
set up shop to work on civilian aerospace projects and produce 
agricultural machinery such as tractors and car engines. 
  The central government has set aside 500 million yuan to 
move 
in a number of factories. Some 10,000 workers will transfer to 
Longguan this year, and the figure will eventually climb to 
100,000, creating a vast satellite city only a few kilometers 
from Chengdu. 
  The nearby expressway, due for completion in the second half 
of the year, will give the growing industrial zone easy access 
to Chengdu International Airport 35 kilometers away in one 
direction and Chongqing, a Chang Jiang River port, some 360 
kilometers in the other. 
  District officials are running a major sales drive to fill 
the vacant spots in the 9.94 square kilometer development zone, 
and the surrounding countryside. Incentives for businesses to 
relocate there include "fast track" processing of their 
applications by the bureaucracy, no interference by the state as 
long as no laws are broken and generous tax reductions. 
  In line with the central government's new "open policy," 
district officials are relaxed and pragmatic. Nothing is 
impossible, they suggest, for the potential foreign investor. 
  For example, involvement in real estate operations is 
theoretically forbidden to foreigners to prevent them from 
buying and selling Chinese land. But, hint officials, why not 
come in and register as something else -- say a tourism business 
-- and then ask the local planning commission to extend the area 
of business into real estate? Nothing could be simpler in the 
new capital-oriented Chinese society.

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (XINHUA) -- China's capital city of 
Beijing will step up its infrastructural construction this year, 
Mayor Li Qiyan said Friday [8 April]. 
  It plans to earmark 12.5 billion yuan to boost the 
development of several major projects including water, heat and 
electricity supply and highways, Li said at a meeting of the 
municipal people's congress. 
  Li said that the city's total investment in infrastructure 
reached 10.36 billion yuan last year, a sturdy 76.2 percent rise 
from the year 1992. 
  A number of major projects such as the expressway leading to 
the capital airport, the eastern section of the third ring 
highway and part of the Beijing-Shijiazhuang Expressway have 
already opened to traffic, he said. 
  It also added another length of 61.6 kilometers of highways 
and 15 flyovers last year, he said. 
  In addition, the first phase of a large sewage treatment 
plant with a disposal capacity of 500,000 tons of waste water 
has been put into trial operation. 
  The mayor said that emphasis of the infrastructural 
construction this year will also be placed on improvement of the 
housing conditions of the city dwellers. 
  He said the total floor space to be built this year is 
expected to surpass 6.5 million square meters that will house 
95,000 residents. At the same time, efforts will be made to 
rebuild or repair the shabby and dangerous houses. 
  Over six million square meters of houses were built last 
year, making the total housing built over the past 15 years 
adding up to 110 million square meters, he added. 
  The official said that the average living space per capita 
of 
the urban people has now increased to 12.5 square meters while 
that of the farmers in the suburban area is 23.7 square meters.

  [Text] Vice President Rong Yiren met with Dr. Arpad Bogsch, 
director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
[WIPO], and his wife at the Great Hall of the People here this 
morning. Dr. Bogsch is an old friend of the Chinese people. 
This is his 15th visit to China. 
  Rong Yiren said: As China's economy develops and as its 
reform and opening deepen, it has become increasingly aware of 
the importance of protecting intellectual property rights. 
Since signing a series of intellectual property rights 
conventions, China has become more keenly aware of protecting 
intellectual property rights. We must strengthen education to 
let all our people clearly and correctly understand this. 
  He pointed out: The symposium in Kunming on Asian copyright 
protection cosponsored by China's State Copyright Administration 
and the WIPO will provide a good educational opportunity. 
  He continued: The Chinese Government supports the protection 
of intellectual property rights and will make constant efforts 
to improve work in this field. 
  Dr. Bogsch said: The Chinese Government has adopted a 
prudent policy on intellectual property rights. The WlPO has 
cooperated with China for more than 20 years. The Chinese 
Government has attached great importance to enacting laws as 
well as rules and regulations governing intellectual property 
rights. This will bring benefits to China's foreign relations, 
to its economic development, and to its economic, trade, and 
cultural exchanges with other countries.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- One Chinese leading 
official called in a national sports meeting here on Friday [8 
April] that all sports officials should explore a new way for 
further development of sports in the country. 
  Li Tieying, State Councillor and member of the Political 
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, said that the new way 
should be adapted to the socialist marketing economy system. 
  "The new way should be in line with the law of the modern 
sports development, be beneficial to the construction of the 
socialist spiritual civilization and be helpful to meet the 
increasing needs of the Chinese people to sports," he said. 
  He praised sports officials, coaches as well as athletes for 
their success in the past years. 
  China gave the world a surprise in the year 1993 when 
Chinese 
athletes collected a total of 103 world titles and broke 57 
world records including those set by star long distance women 
runners. 
  The state councillor said the achievements that China had in 
sports demonstrated great intelligence and sports talents of the 
Chinese people. "So long as we have tried our best, we could 
scale new peaks in sports one after another," he added.

<F P=106> ["Full text" of 12 April RENMIN RIBAO editorial: "It Is </F>
Necessary To Permanently Sound the Warning Alarm of 
Anticorruption and Advocation of Honesty"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- Today, this paper made 
public two important cases of economic crime, the verdict of 
which was decided by the Higher People's Court of Beijing 
Municipality. The first case is: Shen Taifu, former president 
of the Beijing Changcheng Machinery and Electric Science and 
Technology Industrial Corporation (hereafter referred to as 
Changcheng Corporation), took advantage of his position to 
embezzle public funds by resorting to fraud and other means. He 
also unscrupulously bribed state functionaries. Because he 
committed the crimes of embezzlement and offering bribes, he was 
sentenced to death according to law. Sun Jihong (Shen Taifu's 
wife), an offender in the same case, was also sentenced to 15 
years of fixed-term imprisonment after being convicted of the 
crime of embezzlement. The second case is: Li Xiaoshi, former 
vice chairman of the State Science and Technology Commission, 
accepted bribes from Shen Taifu and other people, and also took 
advantage of his position to embezzle public funds. Because he 
committed the crime of accepting bribes and embezzlement, he was 
sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 20 years, a punishment 
for committing more than one crime. 
  As everybody knows, the illegal fund-raising activities 
conducted by Changcheng Corporation has been a major financial 
case rarely seen since the founding of New China. The size of 
the capital raised by the corporation, the scope of such 
activities, and the odious consequences caused by the case are 
shocking. This has once again proved that in the process of 
reform, opening to the outside world, and building a socialist 
market economic structure, it is very important and necessary to 
adhere to the principle of "grasping two links simultaneously," 
persist in cracking down on serious economic crimes, strengthen 
the building of a clean government, and continue to launch the 
anticorruption struggle in a sustained way. We should educate 
the cadres and the masses by taking advantage of the negative 
examples involving Shen Taifu and Li Xiaoshi, and draw useful 
lessons from them. 
  Under the signboard of establishing civilian-run collective 
enterprises and developing high science and technology, Shen 
Taifu played the sinister trick of accumulating wealth by unfair 
means by using high returns as a bait and taking advantage of 
the weaknesses of some people who hoped to get quick returns 
through investment and who were not familiar with financial 
investment. He was the loudest advocate in raising funds to 
develop energy-saving electrical machinery. For a time he 
became a dignified noted figure devoted to pushing reform and 
developing high science and technology. In fact, there was 
neither operation nor development in this so-called machinery 
and electric science and technology development enterprise, and 
Shen Taifu himself had no specialized strong points in this 
field. What he did was unscrupulously squandering the huge sum 
of money he had swindled. The case of Shen Taifu should serve 
to wake us up to this fact -- some economic criminals are very 
good at pretending. Under an impressive signboard, they can 
take advantage of loopholes in our work to market their 
treachery by fishing in troubled waters. The principle of 
opening up fund-raising channels to establish civilian-run 
science and technology entities is correct, but enlivening the 
economy must be done in an orderly manner, and breaking the law 
is not permitted in opening to the outside world. If we pay no 
attention to this point, we will be taken in by people with 
ulterior motives like Shen Taifu. We must support those people 
who are genuinely devoted to reform, but we must expose those 
who seek private gain and even violate laws and discipline under 
false pretenses. We must never let these people harm the 
country and the people and smear the reputation of reform. The 
masses should also improve ability to distinguish people, 
enhance their awareness of the legal system, and learn necessary 
economic knowledge in order to avoid being taken in. 
  Using money to clear obstacles and get things done was 
Shen Taifu's habitual tactic. In this way senior cadre Li 
Xiaoshi became captive of "sugarcoated bullets." Li Xiaoshi was 
not unaware of Shen Taifu's sinister intentions, but he, out of 
greed, used his power and influence to clear the obstacles in 
support of Shen Taifu. What were hidden behind all of these were 
nothing but a succession of deals between power and money. 
However, the external cause can be activated only through the 
internal cause. "Things must first rot before they are infested 
with worms." The fact shows that Li Xiaoshi's embezzlement and 
bribe-taking did not start at the Beijing Changcheng Corporation 
case, and this was why he was instantaneously hit by Shen 
Taifu's sugarcoated bullets. The fact that Li Xiaoshi 
degenerated from a senior cadre to a criminal offender provides 
us with a penetrating lesson, which shows that powers in the 
hands of cadres, especially leading cadres, of some government 
departments can often easily become the target sought after by 
lawless elements. Each and every cadre must clearly understand 
that power in our hands is given by the people and cannot be 
sold out. Resisting the temptation of money and performing 
duties with honesty and self-discipline is the basic requirement 
of cadres. Should they lower guard and be swollen with selfish 
desire, they will make blunders sooner or later. 
  It is also necessary to point out that in order to hoodwink 
the public and fabricate lies, Shen Taifu extended and succeeded 
partially in extending his sinister hand to some press units and 
other government departments. Through publicizing this typical 
case, we should educate journalists to strictly abide by 
professional ethics, to stop "paid news," and to safeguard the 
party's clean reputation in the journalistic undertaking. 
RENMIN RIBAO, as the organ of the party Central Committee, is 
determined to set a good example in stopping "paid news" and 
strengthening the construction of clean government, and we 
sincerely request the supervision by readers at large. 
  Shen Taifu has been executed and Li Xiaoshi punished, and 
the 
judicial organ will, after verifying facts, successively deliver 
verdicts on some other people involved in the case. All of 
these can serve as a warning to certain people: It will be a 
miscalculation to exploit the opportunity of relaxation to 
invigorate economy and to try by hook and by crook to 
unscrupulously reap some profit. No matter how criminals 
conceal themselves and resist obstinately, they cannot escape 
the punishment by law in the end. We must resolutely implement 
the party Central Committee's plans on the anticorruption drive. 
Leading cadres at all levels must take the lead in complying 
with various regulations for honesty and self-discipline to 
ensure the achievement of more conspicuous results in the 
anticorruption drive. In the course of reform, opening up, and 
modernization construction, the fight against corruption is a 
protracted task and the warning alarm of anticorruption and 
advocation of honesty must sound continuously.

  [Text] In light of the new circumstances emerging in the 
province's current grain and cooking oil markets, Vice Governor 
Sun Kuiwen pointed out at the 8 April provincial emergency 
telephone conference on stabilizing prices and market supply of 
grain: Governments at all levels should adopt resolute measures 
to further stabilize grain and cooking oil prices. Grain and 
cooking oil prices have gradually gone up since late March. In 
particular, there has been a relatively big fluctuation in grain 
and cooking oil prices recently. 
  Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen pointed out: The current price 
fluctuation on grain and cooking oil markets have primarily 
resulted from the price increase in other provinces and from the 
state's hiked grain procurement prices. It is by no means caused 
by the lack of grain and processing capacity. There is an 
extremely ample supply of grain and a good assortment of grains 
in the province. By the end of March, the province has laid up 
24.5 billion jin of grain. This amount of stored grain is 
capable of meeting the demands for two years or so, if 
calculated according to the province's consumption in a normal 
year. Of this, the stored soybean is 3 billion jin, that can 
produce 450 million jin of soya-bean oil, also capable of 
meeting the province's consumption of more than 2 years. 
Therefore, the provincial government hopes that the vast numbers 
of grain producers, dealers, and consumers will clear their 
minds of doubt, have a correct understanding of the grain and 
cooking oil markets situation, and overcome the abnormal 
mentality. 
  Vice Governor Sun Kuiwen demanded: All localities in the 
province should strengthen market management, resolutely check 
the rising trend of prices of grain and cooking oil, and 
stabilize prices. All localities should give full play to the 
role of state grain departments as the main channel to ensure 
the supply of grain. Grain and cooking oil processing 
enterprises should ensure the quality of finished grain products 
and cooking oil products in line with market demands and should 
ensure the timely supply. All grain shops should improve grain 
dealing business. Efforts should be made to ensure the supply 
of grain and cooking oil to large- and medium-sized cities, to 
industrial and mining areas, and to poverty-stricken areas. 
Continued efforts should be made to ensure the supply of grain 
and cooking oil to colleges, universities, and secondary 
specialized schools as well as to the troops. New methods 
should be carried out in terms of grain and cooking oil prices. 
The provincial government has decided to comprehensively set 
the market supply prices by giving consideration to the 
necessary factors of all counties and cities. All grain 
departments and all other units and individuals dealing grain 
and cooking oil must follow the grain and cooking oil prices set 
by local governments and must hang out their shingles to sell 
grain and cooking oil. At the same time, the grain and cooking 
oil prices in all localities should not be higher than the 4 
April local price levels of other varieties. In addition, all 
departments should coordinate with one another to resolutely and 
severely deal with all price violation behaviors. All localities 
should strengthen leadership and establish strict responsibility 
system to successfully stabilize the grain and cooking oil 
prices.

  [Text] Over the past year, Gansu's anticorruption struggle 
has scored some initial successes with the result that the 
province has now wiped out some of its notorious malpractices. 
  Since last August, all levels in Gansu have conscientiously 
carried out three anticorruption tasks outlined by the central 
authorities, with the result that a total of 712 leading cadres 
have confessed and rectified their wrongdoings. Of a total of 
391 leading cadres with concurrent jobs in various economic 
entities, some 261 have resigned one of their two jobs. 
  In the September-December period of 1993, the discipline 
inspection and supervision organs at all levels in Gansu 
investigated and handled a large number of major and serious 
cases in a timely fashion. They filed for investigation and 
prosecution a total of 610 law-violation and 
discipline-violation cases involving a total of 94 cadres at the 
county or provincial department section level, and a total of 10 
cadres at the prefectural or provincial department level, 54.48 
percent of which have now been wound up. They conscientiously 
investigated and severely handled a batch of major economic 
cases, including 167 cases involving 10,000 yuan or more each, 
and recovered economic losses worth 12.8 million yuan. 
  The provincial discipline inspection commission held its 
enlarged second plenary session yesterday to sum up the 
province's anticorruption struggle over the past year and made 
arrangements for the province's discipline inspection and 
supervision work in 1994. 
  Sun Ying, the provincial party committee deputy secretary, 
and Yang Huaixiao, provincial party committee standing committee 
member and provincial vice governor, attended yesterday's 
enlarged plenary session.

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- It is extremely unfair 
for the United States to sanction Taiwan for its alleged 
continued trade in forbidden wildlife products, a Presidential 
Office spokesman said Tuesday [12 April]. 
  "The Republic of China [ROC] has not lagged behind other 
countries in preservation of endangered species," Raymond Tai, 
deputy secretary-general to the president, said after learning 
that U.S. President Bill Clinton issued an order on Monday 
prohibiting import of wildlife species and products from Taiwan 
in retaliation for Taiwan's failure to stop illegal trade in 
rhino horns and tiger bones. 
  "We has made enormous efforts to protect wildlife and have 
launched massive crackdowns on illicit wildlife product trade in 
recent years," Tai stressed. "The U.S. should not have used 
outdated data and photos to back its charges against Taiwan." 
  Tai reaffirmed Taiwan's commitment to stamping out illegal 
wildlife trade, saying the Legislative Yuan will soon pass a 
package of amendments to the wildlife conservation law that 
significantly increase penalties for offenders. 
  Premier Lien Chan also blasted the U.S. sanctions as "unjust 
and unfair," saying the U.S. should take note of Taiwan's 
progress in wildlife conservation and reconsider its decision as 
soon as possible. 
  Lien also ordered the Council of Agriculture (COA) to 
present 
within two weeks a comprehensive program for consolidation of 
rhino horn and tiger bone stocks, crackdown on illicit wildlife 
trade, wildlife product examination and conservation manpower 
training. 
  The COA has set up a special task force to intensify 
crackdowns on wildlife trade. COA officials said the United 
States has agreed to negotiate with Taiwan over wildlife trade 
issues. If the Legislative Yuan can pass the conservation law 
soon, the officials said, the U.S. may shorten the period of 
trade sanctions on Taiwan.

<F P=106> [By reporter Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and 
Portuguese Prime Minister Silva this morning agreed that the 
Joint Declaration on the Macao issue signed by the governments 
of the two countries seven years ago is "a historic document 
with far-reaching significance." They pledged to strengthen 
Sino-Portuguese cooperation to ensure a smooth transition of 
Macao and its stability and development. 
  The two leaders made the pledge when they talked to Chinese 
and Portuguese reporters on the occasion of the seventh 
anniversary of the signing of the joint declaration. 
  Li Peng noted that Silva's visit bears a special 
significance 
as it coincides with the seventh anniversary of the joint 
declaration. 
  He said: The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration is a historic 
document with far-reaching significance. It has set an example 
for other countries in settling problems left behind by history. 
Since the signing of the joint declaration, friendly relations 
and cooperation between China and Portugual have developed 
smoothly. Both sides have earnestly implemented the joint 
declaration, and cooperation on the Macao issue has yielded 
fruitful results. 
  Li Peng said: Macao enjoys social stability and economic 
growth with its residents living a peaceful and happy life. 
This is the result of joint efforts made by China and Portugal. 
China and Portugal share the common goal and common interests 
in ensuring Macao's smooth transition, stability, and 
development. 
  He expressed the conviction that with continued joint 
efforts 
and more effective friendly cooperation, Macao's smooth 
transition and power transfer will be realized. 
  Silva said: He and his Chinese counterpart signed the joint 
declaration in Beijing seven years ago. It is a historic event. 
The declaration accords with the two sides' common desire of 
resolving the Macao question through frank, sincere, and 
friendly dialogue between the two governments. 
  He said: "Such a spirit has continued to this day, and we 
will continue to preserve and carry it forward." 
  He said: "The ways and means for the settlement of the Macao 
issue enshrined in the joint declaration have two objectives: 
First, we want ensure Macao's stability and economic and social 
progress as well as its residents' confidence in the future; 
second, we want to boost relations between Portugal and the PRC 
from a new angle." 
  He said: "Today, the reason we mark the seventh anniversary 
of the joint declaration lies in the fact that the declaration 
has been implemented smoothly." 
  Silva said: As he began his official visit to China, he 
would like to reaffirm that the Portuguese Government will 
earnestly implement the stipulations of the joint declaration 
and continue the dialogue between Portugal and China on the 
Macao question so as to ensure Macao's stability and progress 
and to maintain the residents' way of life and the special 
features of their culture after 1999. 
  He said: Portugal and China will fulfill their historical 
obligations and make stronger the link between the two peoples 
by way of ensuring Macao's stability, especially as Macao is the 
strongest point of the link. 
  Prior to the ceremony, Premier Li Peng presided over a 
welcoming ceremony in honor of Prime Minister Silva, his wife, 
and other members of his party at the square off the east gate 
of the Great Hall of the People. 
  Zhu Lin, Li Peng's wife; Vice Premier and Foreign Minister 
Qian Qichen; Feng Zhijun, vice chairman of the Central Committee 
of the China Democratic League; and Liu Xiliang, chairman of the 
Chinese Government reception committee and vice minister of 
radio, film, and television, attended the welcoming ceremony.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Vice-President Rong 
Yiren met here today with a delegation from the Japan 
Association of Corporate Executives (JACE), led by Chairman 
Hiroshi Watanabe. 
  JACE is one of Japan's four most influential economic 
organizations, with heads of major enterprises among its members. 
  JACE puts great emphasis on economic cooperation and 
exchanges with China and has sent several delegations to China, 
Rong said during the meeting. 
  Rong believes that JACE's current visit will help strengthen 
bilateral economic exchanges and friendly relations. 
  Watanabe said JACE is ready to conduct regular exchanges 
with 
China's state economic and trade commission to help cultivate 
Chinese modern entrepreneurs. 
  Rong appreciated Watanabe's move, saying that facing an 
economy which is growing "continuously, quickly and healthily," 
China is in urgent need of talents. Though China will train 
qualified personnel by itself, it heartily welcomes foreign 
friends to lend a hand for this purpose. 
  Rong expressed the hope that China and Japan will improve 
their mutually beneficial cooperation in economics, which is an 
impetus to the two countries' economic growth. 
  Praising China's achievements in fostering economic growth 
and maintaining domestic stability, Watanabe expressed the 
confidence that a large group of outstanding entrepreneurs will 
crop up in China in the wake of the thriving economy.

  [Text] Beijing, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier and Foreign 
Minister Qian Qichen met with a delegation from the U.S. Center 
for Strategic and International Studies [CSIS] led by former 
U.S. Secretary of Defense Brown. The meeting took place this 
afternoon at Ziguang Pavilion in Zhongnanhai. The host and his 
guests exchanged views on Sino-U.S. relations and other 
international issues of common concern. 
  Qian Qichen stated: The 20th century, which will soon be 
over, has witnessed two world wars and many regional conflicts. 
In the coming century, China hopes to see a diversified world 
with equality among all nations, and without hot or cold wars. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: The relationship between China and 
the United States, though containing some twists and turns as 
well as contradictions, is not a relationship of confrontation. 
There is no conflict of fundamental interests between the two 
countries, and they should constantly promote cooperative 
relations in every field. 
  Brown said his current China tour is aimed at seeing old 
acquaintances and making new friends, as well as exchanging 
ideas with Chinese scholars and officials on a wide range of 
issues. He hoped the exchange will be helpful in resolving 
problems in bilateral relations. 
  The U.S. guests are visiting China at the invitation of 
China's Center for International Studies.

  [Text] Canberra, April 11 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese delegate 
said today that China "has always pursued a policy of opposing 
illegal migration and trafficking." 
  Feng Shibin, Chinese delegate and counsellor of the Chinese 
Embassy in Australia, made the remarks at a two-day informal 
regional consultation on illegal migration held here today. 
  The consultation, hosted by the Australian Department of 
Immigration, offers a forum to exchange views and information on 
the problem of illegal migration in the region. 
  Feng said that the Chinese Government has adopted a series 
of 
effective measures to prevent illegal migration, including the 
strengthening of legislation, the strict law enforcement, 
education and economic development. 
  He described the illegal migration as an "international 
problem," which he said "can not be solved by any single 
country." 
  "The Chinese Government is willing to cooperate with other 
countries in the effort to prevent illegal migration," he 
stressed. 
  China, he said, maintains that all countries should further 
increase their cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and 
equal consultation. 
  Feng concluded that "normal exchanges of personnel should be 
guaranteed" while cracking down on illegal migration and normal 
contacts between people in different countries should be 
encouraged and facilitated. 
  The consultation was attended by delegates from 17 nations 
of 
the region and the office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees.

<F P=106> [Report: "XINHUA Hong Kong Deputy Director Zhang Junsheng </F>
Says Xi Yang Case Is Handled According to Law and Brooks No 
Interference"] 
  [Text] Frederick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Hong Kong 
Association of Democracy and People's Livelihood, and its 
members Lo Cheung-kwok, Leung Kuang-cheung, and Wang Kwok-tong, 
made an appointment with Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the 
XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong Branch this afternoon [9 April] and 
submitted a letter on Xi Yang's case addressed to the Beijing 
Municipal Higher People's Court. 
  While talking about Xi Yang's case with Lo Cheung-kwok and 
his group, Zhang Junsheng said: "I returned from the mainland 
on a business trip only last night. This morning, I heard that 
you wanted an appointment with me. To make the meeting as early 
as possible, we arranged for the meeting this very afternoon. I 
am sorry for the inconvenience, since it is a weekend. 
  "Just now you talked about Xi Yang's case. That has been a 
very unfortunate incident, indeed. I put it that way because 
none of us hoped to see anyone breaking the law, nor did we hope 
to see such a penalty meted out for that matter. However, a 
penalty must be meted out to any lawbreaker according to the law. 
  "I believe you must have read about a ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE 
dispatch today. This is basically a legal affair. From the 
related information available to us, we can see that the case in 
question involved the stealing of state secrets. In handling 
this case, the judicial department carried out an investigation, 
enforced custody, and interrogated strictly according to legal 
procedures. 
  "Some people say that the reporter `intruded in an 
off-limits 
area by mistake' in the course of normal news coverage, 
consequently violating the law. Still others think that it was 
entirely a matter of press freedom. I do not think this is 
correct. This was by no means normal news coverage. When Hong 
Kong reporters go to the mainland for news coverage, they have 
to send an application beforehand. Take our XINHUA NEWS AGENCY 
Hong Kong Branch for example. We often help Hong Kong reporters 
conduct news coverage on the mainland. However, we have never 
received an application from Xi Yang to cover the People's Bank 
of China, nor have we ever made any arrangements to that end. 
To our knowledge, Xi Yang had never made any similar 
application to the People's Bank of China, nor had he gained 
permission to conduct news coverage on related issues, nor had 
the People's Bank of China appointed its worker Tian Ye to 
accept Xi Yang's interview. It follows that Tian Ye had no 
right whatsoever to provide Xi Yang with information on related 
matters. This being the case, this was not a matter of news 
coverage, not a matter of press freedom, but an issue of 
violating the law. 
  "To handle a criminal case according to the law is entirely 
the responsibility and power of the judicial department, which 
brooks no interference. It would also be violating the law to 
interfere with judicial departments in ruling on a case 
according to the law. It would also be wrong to affect judicial 
fairness through creating public opinion to add pressure on 
judicial departments. People should refrain from turning a 
legal issue into a political one. It is my hope that the 
British Hong Kong Government will stay away from this matter, 
which is within the realm of China's sovereignty. On a 
television newscast, we saw Mr. Chris Patten say "The closer 
1997 approaches, and the greater the number of similar 
incidents, the more uneasy people will be and the more Hong Kong 
residents will worry about the future." Such words are wrong, 
and intentionally sow discord. Actually, Chris Patten has 
hinted that Hong Kong residents will increasingly conduct 
law-breaking activities in the mainland. That is throwing mud 
at Hong Kong residents." 
  Regarding the letter submitted by the Association of 
Democracy and People's Livelihood, Zhang Junsheng said he would 
relay it to the relevant department.

  [Text] Two Hong Kong journalists have been harassed by 
Chinese security police for allegedly violating China's law on 
state secrets. 
  A book marked for "internal circulation" was found in their 
luggage when security police searched their hotel room in 
Wenzhou in Zhejiang province on April 4. 
  The police claimed the journalists had violated China's Law 
on the Protection of State Secrets, saying that as "non-mainland 
people" they should not possess books bearing the mark "internal 
circulation". 
  The two women journalists from the Hong Kong 
Chinese-language 
daily The Express--who wish to remain anonymous in the wake of 
the Xi Yang case--recently went to Wenzhou to report on 
voluntary medical work by a team of Hong Kong doctors, nurses 
and therapists. 
  The 12-person medical team were providing a free service to 
500 rural patients. 
  On April 4, the two journalists--a reporter and a 
photographer--visited the city's bookstores and made several 
purchases, for which they were given receipts. 
  When the security police searched their hotel room they 
found 
medical documents provided by local medical officials at Wenzhou 
city hospital. 
  Though the journalists proved they bought their books in a 
local bookstore and the documents were given to them by a local 
hospital for publicity purposes, they were still warned by the 
police. 
  The books and other printed matter were confiscated. 
  Chiu Sin-tsang, the chief editor of The Express, yesterday 
said he could not yet comment. 
  Daisy Li, chairwoman of the Hong Kong Journalists' 
Association, said the Express incident posed a new threat to 
normal journalistic activities. 
  "We are very concerned (about) this incident, which may 
cause 
tremendous anxiety among (the) local press," she said. 
  "China can have a very arbitrary definition of so-called 
classified materials, which in this case are books and publicity 
materials," Li said. 
  She said China should make clear which materials 
"non-mainland people" should not hold. 
  This latest incident indicates China has not only hardened 
its stance when dealing with the press in the capital, but has 
extended its hardline policy to other provinces.

  [Text] A British demand to be involved in the new Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] passports has been 
rejected by China. A Hong Kong-based senior Chinese official 
told EASTERN EXPRESS that all matters relating to SAR travel 
documents were within China's, "sovereign right" and were "none 
of Britain's business", adding that London's demand was 
"ridiculous". News of the rejection is a serious blow to the 
British Joint Liaison Group team which has tried repeatedly 
since last July to discuss the issue with Beijing. All 
approaches have been met with silence from China. 
  A British official said London needed to be involved in the 
process because Hong Kong was still under British rule. "In 
practical terms, the passport will have to be issued in Hong 
Kong," he said. "They are not going to be issued in Beijing, 
"So we need to be fully involved in that activity since Hong 
Kong is still under British administration." 
  The Chinese official said the Hong Kong Immigration 
Department must "co-operate" with China in working out the 
technical details of SAR passports. Matters to be sorted out 
include how Hong Kong residents who qualify as permanent 
residents of the SAR should apply for and take delivery of the 
document. The Immigration Department will also need to develop 
new technology to register passport holders and monitor the 
document's use. 
  Beijing is still considering a design for the passport and 
three options have been submitted to the Chinese government so 
far. 
  China's Foreign Ministry will lobby other countries for 
official recognition of the passport and, where applicable, 
exemptions from visa requirements for passport holders. The 
Chinese official said negotiations with countries over the use 
of the SAR travel document would be conducted through Chinese 
embassies. 
  The British official maintained that such matters would be 
best handled on a joint basis, but he would not disclose what 
role Britain wanted to play in the process saying: "We need to 
reach consensus with the Chinese on who does what and when." 
  Hong Kong passport holders, he said, already enjoyed freedom 
of travel to many countries because of previous arrangements 
made by Britain. "Therefore we need to be involved in 
discussions with other countries as well," he said. The British 
official believed there were other complications that needed to 
be resolved, including the definition of who qualifies for Hong 
Kong SAR citizenship and right of abode after 1997. 
  A meeting of the Joint Liaison Group will be held tomorrow 
to 
discuss the right of abode issue. The British official said he 
did not expect a breakthrough. "Other complications are that 
from China's point of view, it is not easy for them to give up 
their sovereign right on this issue," he said. "Having the 
British or Hong Kong government involved is seen as a delegation 
of their sovereignty. Our objective is to ensure ordinary 
travellers in Hong Kong have the necessary documents for them to 
continue to travel freely after 1997." 
  The European Union has said it will recognise the new SAR 
passport because provisions for it were included in the Joint 
Declaration.

<F P=106> [By Liu Yun-lung (0491 0061 7893): "Opinion Poll Shows a </F>
Quarter of Hong Kong People Favor Independence"] 
  [Excerpts] A survey by Baptist College and the University 
of Science and Technology suggests that the Chinese-British 
dispute has produced a bad impact on Hong Kong voters' voting 
intentions. More than 40 percent of respondents indicated that 
they had no confidence at all in whether the Chinese side would 
consider Hong Kong people's greatest interests in implementing 
the Basic Law. 
  In addition, more than 40 percent of Hong Kong people are 
willing to see Hong Kong's reversion to the mainland under the 
principle of one country, two systems, provided they can decide 
the outcome of history, but a quarter of them favor "making Hong 
Kong independent" and 15 percent are willing to see "Hong Kong 
continuing to remain a British colony," a fall of 6 percent 
compared with the percentage in August last year. 
  Baptist College and the University of Science and Technology 
conducted a "sociopolitical volatility" telephone survey under 
their "Hong Kong in Transition Program." In February they made 
2,610 random telephone calls for sample surveying, during which 
1,074 qualified residents were contacted, while the rest were 
not residential telephone numbers. 
  In this survey, 626 people who met the requirements were 
interviewed, which was 59 percent of residents contacted. With 
95 percent accuracy, the sample survey error was under 4 percent. 
  Lau Chui-wai, a lecturer at Baptist College in charge of the 
research program, said that Hong Kong people's anxiety remained 
high in the past year. Almost half (40 percent) of respondents 
expressed different worries, including worries over their 
personal standard of living, personal freedom, family life, Hong 
Kong's future, and post- 1997 political prospects. 
  She stressed that these worries continued because of the 
breakdown of the Chinese-British talks but that people's worries 
over Hong Kong's future seem to have eased. In comparison with 
last year, respondents worried about the "1997 issue" fell by 9 
percent, and 10 percent of respondents expressed extreme worry 
about personal freedom and Hong Kong's political prospects. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Baptist College and University of Science and Technology 
survey suggests that most respondents said that Hong Kong would 
have corruption problems similar to those on the mainland after 
1997 and believe that mainland corruption has spread to Hong 
Kong. 
  The "sociopolitical volatility" telephone survey indicates 
that 66 percent of the 423 respondents who frequently go to the 
mainland said that a corruption problem similar to that on the 
mainland would appear in Hong Kong after 1997, a 7 percent 
decrease compared with August last year, the number of those 
answering "no idea" increased by 8 percent, and the number of 
respondents saying that mainland corruption would not endanger 
Hong Kong remained unchanged. 
  This survey also discovered that Hong Kong people no longer 
had illusions about the Hong Kong Government, because they 
generally believe that corruption has spread to Hong Kong. 
Sixty eight percent of respondents said that corruption was a 
big problem facing the Hong Kong Government, an increase of 4 
percent on August last year, while 18 percent said it was not a 
problem, a fall of 7 percent.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Hong (1776 3216)] </F>
  [Text] Los Angeles, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yi, 
Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation says, the 
practice whereby the United States deliberates China's MFN 
status every year has resulted in a sense of great instability 
in the minds of the broad industrial and commercial circles both 
in China and the United States; should additional conditions be 
attached the consequences will be even more serious. 
  At the opening ceremonies of the Sino-U.S. talks on trade 
and 
investment projects held today, this female Chinese minister 
stressed that China hopes to resolve the MFN status 
unconditionally. The MFN status is a pure trade issue; it is 
unwise to link it to the "human rights" issue, nor does it 
comply with strategic thinking. 
  The Chinese Government trade and economic relations 
delegation headed by Wu Yi arrived in Los Angeles on 8 April and 
will leave for Washington D.C. tomorrow to attend the Eighth 
Session of the Sino- U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and 
Trade. During the four-day stay in Los Angeles, Wu Yi has 
answered questions on the MFN status on several occasions put by 
figures from various circles. 
  She said that the MFN status is the kernel clause in the 
Sino- U.S. Agreement on Trade Relations signed in 1979. It is 
not a favor bestowed by one country on another but an 
arrangement of mutual benefit on an equal footing. 
  She believed that, should the United States cancel the MFN 
status, China would suffer certain losses; however, the United 
States would likewise suffer and its losses would be bigger than 
those of China. The United States would lose the huge Chinese 
market whereas more products, technology, and funds from other 
countries would find their way into the Chinese market. 
  Today, Wu Yi repeatedly called on the United States to adopt 
a practical attitude, weigh the pros and cons, and remove 
manmade obstacles to enable Sino-U.S. ties in trade and economic 
relations to develop healthily.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said here today that the Chinese Government attached great 
importance to the development of oil and natural gas, both on 
land and offshore. 
  During a meeting with Kenneth Derr, chairman of the Chevron 
Corporation of the United States, Li said that China would like 
to cooperate with foreign petroleum companies, including 
Chevron, in this regard. 
  Li told the U.S. guest that since China began its 
exploitation of offshore oil fields in the 1970s, the industry 
had taken shape, and its prospect were very bright. 
  With development of the economy and improvement of people's 
living standards, China's demands for petroleum products would 
rise, Li said. Therefore, the country will accelerate the 
development of the industry. 
  He described the oil field in northwest China's Tarim Basin 
as one with great potential, and he extended a welcome to 
foreign oil companies to join in its development. 
  Li hoped that Chevron would be successful in the exploration 
for oil in East China Sea. 
  Chevron and China signed an agreement on the development of 
oil in that area last year. 
  Derr said that as one of the largest energy companies in the 
United States, Chevron had advantage in terms of capital and 
technology. The corporation has decided to strengthen the 
cooperation with China, in which it had confidence. 
  Derr and his party arrived here to participate in the 
strategic plan meeting from April 11 to 18, which is sponsored 
by Chevron Overseas Company. 
  Among those at today's meeting were Gan Ziyu, vice minister 
of the State National Planning Commission, and Wang Yan, general 
manager of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin met with Washington Governor Mike Lowry and his 
party here today. 
  Extending a welcome to Lowry on his first visit to China, 
Jiang said he hoped U.S. guests could visit China more 
frequently in the future so as to gain a better understanding of 
China's reform, opening and modernization drive. 
  Previously, Jiang met with the governor in Seattle where he 
was attending an APEC meeting last November. 
  Lowry and his party came to China as guests of the 
government 
of southwest China's Sichuan Province, with which Washington has 
been a sister state since 1981. 
  During the meeting in Zhongnanhai, Jiang expressed hopes 
that 
Sichuan Province and Washington State would make greater efforts 
to push forward the cooperation links between them, and between 
the two countries as well. 
  Lowry said his visit to Sichuan was impressive and that his 
delegation is "here to learn and further strengthen cooperation 
with China."

  [Text] Washington, April 12 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton said today he wouldn't rule out the possibility of 
expanding American-led air attacks against Serbs in Bosnia. 
  "If the U.N. forces there were put at risk, as they were in 
the shelling of Gorazde, we would offer close air support," 
Clinton told reporters at the White House. 
  "Every time we have been firm, though, in the end it's been 
a 
winner for the peace process, and I think it will be here," the 
President said. 
  It was reported that after two days of NATO air attacks on 
Serb troops, Gorazde's Muslim defenders were firing at Serbs in 
an attempt to provoke a response which could bring more NATO air 
strikes. 
  Clinton cautioned the Bosnian government forces "not to try 
to take advantage of this and violate the understandings 
themselves." 
  He stressed, "We have to be firm in our reaction to plain 
violations of the United Nations resolutions, and in what we 
said our policy would be." 
  "We have to be firm in pursuing the policy that we say we 
have," Clinton said, "it's our only chance for success." 
  Russia Monday [11 April] vigorously denounced NATO air 
attacks against Bosnian Serbs, warning that the move would lead 
to an escalation of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Clinton said he had assured Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
that the United States had no interest in using NATO's airpower 
to affect the outcome of the war. 
  "But we do want to protect the U.N. mandate and we do want a 
negotiation there," he said, "and I think that is what we are 
going to get."

visits scheduled to be exchanged between China and Russian this

the two countries. 
  During the meeting, Qian Qichen and Panov had a friendly 
conversation on bilateral relations and international issues of 
common concern. 
  Qian Qichen said: Russia is a large country that plays an 
important role in international affairs. China always puts its 
relations with Russia in an extremely important position [shi 
fen zhong yao de di wei 0577 0433 6850 6008 4104 0966 0143] in 
foreign policy. In recent years, friendly relations and 
cooperation between the two countries have developed steadily 
and healthily in various fields. 
  Qian Qichen pointed out: The development of friendly and 
good- neighborly relations between China and Russia not only 
benefits the two countries themselves, but also constitutes a 
stabilizing factor for the Asia-Pacific region and the world as 
a whole. 
  Qian Qichen expressed his belief that Sino-Russian relations 
will be further developed through joint efforts. 
  Panov expressed his satisfaction with the positive results 
of 
his current visit to China, holding that Russia-China relations 
will become better and better. 
  Vice Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo held talks with Panov on 
bilateral relations and other issues of common concern this 
afternoon.

  [Text] Moscow, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Russia today denounced 
again the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions near 
the town of Gorazde, urging an immediate end to the use of force 
in the former Yugoslav republic. 
  In a statement released here, Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the 
State Duma (lower house of the parliament), noted that the exact 
number of victims of NATO air strikes at Serb positions near the 
Bosnian town of Gorazde is still unknown and the military losses 
and the number of existence of civilian casualties have not been 
reported. 
  The statement said the air strike against Bosnian Serbs 
showed that NATO has easily ignored not only the view of Russia, 
but also the achieved agreements. 
  "We demand an immediate end to the unilateral, unsanctioned 
use of military force by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
and urge the parliaments of all the states of the world to 
actively contribute to the process of achieving a peaceful 
political settlement of the Yugoslav crisis," the statement said. 
  According to the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY, the Duma speaker 
said 
on another occasion earlier today that NATO air strikes against 
the positions of Bosnian Serbs may be "an obstacle" to Russia's 
joining NATO's "partnership for peace" program.

  [Text] Madrid, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, on an official visit to Spain, voiced here today 
his opposition to the NATO air strikes against Serb positions in 
Bosnia. 
  At a press conference held after his talks with Spanish 
Prime 
Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Yeltsin said those who ordered the 
attacks will have to assume responsibility for possible 
subsequent failure of the peace plan for the area. 
  Yeltsin was angered by not being consulted on the air 
strikes 
on Sunday and Monday, asking about how Russia could enter into 
partnership with NATO when Russia is ignored constantly. 
  He said Russia has enough means and forces to impose its 
influence on the situation in former Yugoslavia and have its 
views considered in the world political arena. 
  Yeltsin arrived here Monday for a three-day visit for 
discussions with Spanish leaders on promotion of bilateral 
relations and international issues.

<F P=106> [Article from the "Perspective" column by Gao Haorong (7559 </F>
3185 2837): "A New Development in the Dispute Over the Korean 
Nuclear Issue"] 
  [Text] Recently, the United States and the ROK took a 
series of striking measures on the DPRK nuclear issue: The 
United States called off the third high-level talks with the 
DPRK and announced that the "Team Spirit 94" joint military 
exercise would be resumed. Clinton ordered the deployment of 
"Patriot" missiles in the ROK and wrote a letter to ROK 
President Kim Yong-sam, reasserting that the United States would 
abide by its security defense pact with the ROK. The ROK called 
an emergency security defense meeting to discuss measures to 
enhance its security and readjust its policy toward the North. 
Kim Yong-sam also issued a "Grade A alert" order, urging the 
Army to be at the higher alert level from 23 to 31 March so as 
to ward off any military threat posed by the DPRK. The 
International Atomic Energy Agency adopted a resolution on 21 
March, saying that the inspection of nuclear facilities in the 
DPRK could not confirm whether nuclear material had been 
transformed for military purposes and asked the DPRK to let the 
UN Security Council handle the case. 
  In face of these moves, the DPRK made its own response: 
  1. It reported, in a massive and rapid way, U.S. moves 
to strengthen its armed forces in the ROK. The DPRK news 
media rapidly reported that President Clinton ordered the 
deployment of "Patriot" missiles in the ROK as well as U.S. 
attempts to resume the joint military exercise. DPRK news media 
quoted foreign news agency reports that a U.S. "Patriot" missile 
battalion -- equipped with over 40 missile launchers and 
composed of 850 soldiers -- had left the United States for the 
ROK. The United States is studying military measures at the 
next stage, including dispatching aircraft carriers to the 
waters of the Korean Peninsula. A U.S. fleet composed of 30 
naval vessels has already arrived at a site from which it can 
reach the coast of the DPRK within 24 hours. The 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Karl Vinson and six 
frigates have left the Japanese port of Yokosuka for a location 
which can be used for maneuvers toward the Korean Peninsula. 
The United States is also considering the possibility of 
launching its own military exercise on the East Korean Sea (the 
Sea of Japan). 
  2. The situation on the Korean Peninsula is considered 
to be "going to extremes," so the DPRK must "be on due 
alert." A number of commentaries published by the DPRK's 
NODONG SINMUN said that the adventurous moves of the United 
States and the ROK "are pushing the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula toward extremes." The situation "is getting more and 
more serious." The military steps taken by the ROK under U.S. 
manipulation "have gone beyond the stage of simply posing a 
threat to us, but represent extremely serious provocations." As 
demonstrated by the development trend, the "situation is so 
grave and risky that it is more and more likely for war to break 
out on the Korean Peninsula." 
  3. The ROK authorities were accused of completely 
sabotaging reciprocal visits of special envoys and South-North 
dialogue and of pushing the situation toward confrontation and 
war." A spokesman from the DPRK's Fatherland Unification 
Committee issued a statement on 22 March, saying that the 
measures discussed at the ROK emergency security meeting were "a 
kind of full-scale confrontation and war." The statement said: 
Kim Yong-sam "is following foreign forces, unilaterally 
suspending dialogue with his nation, and pushing the national 
situation toward the dangerous brink of war," and his crime "is 
leading to a serious situation." It shows that, with the 
presence of traitors and renegades of our nation, such as Kim 
Yong- sam, "it is impossible for the North and the South to 
achieve reconciliation and unity, but it is rather possible to 
fall victim to foreign forces." The statement urged the Korean 
people to undertake a decisive struggle to eliminate this 
traitor. A commentary published by NODONG SINMUN on 25 March 
said that the major purpose of Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan was 
to discuss the issue of objecting to "international cooperation" 
with the DPRK. The DPRK "will always take heed of" military 
activities launched by the Kim Yong-sam clique under foreign 
manipulation. 
  4. The DPRK made clear that it would never yield to 
power politics or pressure and that it was prepared for every 
situation that could arise. The commentary published by 
NODONG SINMUN said: The DPRK will never fall victim to power 
politics or pressure and it will never, under whatever 
circumstances, tolerate any infringement of its national dignity 
and sovereignty. The DPRK is not afraid of sanctions and will 
never yield to pressure. The DPRK is prepared for every 
situation that could arise, and it will respond to dialogue with 
dialogue and to war with war. Even if weapons fiercer than 
"Patriot" missiles are deployed in the south by the United 
States and the ROK, the DPRK will not be intimidated. The DPRK 
people and the People's Army will severely punish renegades of 
our nation and will defend our fatherland and our nation. The 
United States and the ROK should remember that, when they tried 
to settle problems by power politics and pressure, they also got 
into trouble.

  Gombosuren made these remarks while meeting reporters upon 
his return to Ulaanbaatar after ending a week-long formal visit 
to China. 
  He said that during his visit, he and Vice Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen exchanged views on bilateral 
relations, especially economic and trade relations between 
Mongolia and China, and international issues of common interest. 
He also delightedly told reporters that Chinese Premier Li Peng 
will pay a formal visit to Mongolia at the end of this month. 
He said the major achievements of his visit were that he and

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- Mongolian Minister 
of External Relations Tserenpiliyn Gombosuren, who just returned 
from a formal visit to China, pointed out that developing 
relations with the PRC is one of the most important policies of 
the Mongolian Government. 
  Gombosuren made the above remarks during an interview this 
evening with a reporter of the Mongolian Television Station. 
  He said establishing good relations with China and Russia is 
an important step for Mongolia to improve its external 
environment in order to survive and develop. 
  He also said: Taiwan is a part of China and is not an 
independent political entity. Mongolia develops economic, 
trade, and cultural relations with Taiwan just in the way it 
develops relations with other Chinese provinces and cities. He 
emphatically pointed out that this is a long-held stand of the 
Mongolian Government.

  [Text] Tokyo, 11 Apr (XINHUA) -- At a meeting at the prime 
minister's residence today with Wang Xiaoxian, vice president of 
the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign 
Countries [CPAFFC] and of the China-Japan Friendship 
Association, Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said his 
recent visit to China was a great success. 
  According to the Japanese prime minister, he was very 
pleased 
with his fruitful talks with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Li 
Peng, and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji during his recent visit to 
China. 
  Today, Tsutomu Hata, Japanese deputy prime minister and 
concurrently minister of foreign affairs, met with Wang Xiaoxian 
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Hata said: We must ensure 
good Sino-Japanese relations because they are very important for 
peace and stability in Asia and the world as a whole. Hata 
disagreed with the so-called theory of Chinese threat, which was 
spread by some people. 
  Wang Xiaoxian and the CPAFFC delegation he led also met 
separately with Koshiro Ishida, director general of management 
and coordination; Satsuki Eda, director general of science and 
technology; Ryoko Akamatsu, minister of education; Kanju Sato,

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Japanese Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata today denied reports that the seven-party 
ruling coalition is on the verge of collapse over the selection 
of a new prime minister to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa who 
resigned last Friday [8 April]. 
  Hata, who is also leader of the Japan Renewal Party, the 
coalition's core force, told a press conference in Tokyo that 
the eight-month-old alliance has not broken up because meetings 
of the representatives from the ruling parties are still being 
held. 
  "It is true that various emotions are entangled," Hata 
said,"but if we go back to the starting point of why we 
established the coalition, I believe we can restore it." 
  The coalition is splitting into two camps over who should 
succeed the outgoing prime minister. 
  The camp led by the Renewal Party today rejected a call by 
Social Democratic Party Chairman Tomiichi Murayama to hold a 
meeting of all the seven parties' leaders to discuss the choice 
of Hosokawa's successor.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Senior opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) member Michio Watanabe has given 
up his plan to run for the office of prime minister that 
Morihiro Hosokawa suddenly quit last Friday [8 April], the NIHON 
KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported today. 
  Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and former foreign 
minister, hit a snag as he apparently failed to garner enough 
supporters within the LDP for his bid to run for the top 
government post, the leading business daily said. 
  Two major forces in the ruling alliance -- Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government) -- had been 
backing Watanabe as a replacement for Hosokawa under the 
assumption that the Social Democratic Party, the largest 
contingent in the coalition, and the new party Sakigake 
(Harbinger) be ousted from the coalition and Watanabe and his 
followers join the coalition. 
  However, Shinseito and Komeito seemed to have reached the 
conclusion that they could hardly push ahead with their Watanabe 
campaign in view of the slim possibility of his bolting from the 
LDP with his followers to team up with them, news reports said, 
quoting sources close to the two parties.

<F P=106> ["Roundup" by Tan Jianrong: "Japan's Ruling Coalition Moving </F>
To Heal Rift"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The eight-month-old 
seven- party ruling coalition, which was on the brink of 
collapse over the selection of a successor to departing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, is moving to grope for ways to keep 
the alliance intact, political sources said today. 
  The coalition has reportedly arrived at a consensus on 
continuing consultations on the premise that Deputy Prime 
Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata be jointly supported 
as the single candidate for the premiership which Hosokawa 
abruptly quit last Friday [8 April]. 
  After days of infighting since last Friday, the two rival 
camps -- one led by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the 
other led by Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) -- voiced their 
wishes yesterday to restore their unity and to agree to nominate 
Hata to succeed Hosokawa, the sources said. 
  The SDP-led caucus also includes the new party Sakigake 
(Harbinger) and the Democratic Socialist Party. It is pitted 
against the Shinseito-led bloc that includes Komeito (Clean 
Government Party), the Japan New Party (JNP) and the United 
Social Democratic Party. 
  The move toward reconciliation apparently reflects the 
failure of either coalition camp to find a prime ministerial 
candidate who could gain enough votes from the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to emerge on top. 
  "I'm pretty sure we can resolve our problems and maintain 
our 
coalition government," SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo said 
yesterday. 
  Kubo's Shinseito counterpart, Ichiro Ozawa, told reporters, 
"everything is going in the right direction," indicating the 
bikering among the coalition partners over the choice of 
Hosokawa's successor was ending. 
  Because of this new development, chances slimmed markedly 
for 
senior LDP member Michio Watanabe to run for the office of the 
new prime minister. 
  Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, was tipped one of the most promising contenders for 
the premiership if he bolted from the LDP with enough followers 
to join hands with the Shinseito-led camp. 
  However, the Shinseito camp began yesterday to abandon their 
plans to back Watanabe in view of the slim possibility of his 
leaving the largest opposition party to team up with them. 
  Inside the coalition, the two rival camps had separately 
tried to woo members of the LDP, which lost power last summer 
after an uninterrupted 38 years of single-party rule. 
  None of the three groups -- the two coalition camps and the 
LDP -- has the parliamentary majority necessary to choose the 
next prime minister on its own. 
  The Shinseito-led faction only has 157 members in the 
511-seat House of Representatives. So a reneging Watanabe would 
have had to persuade at least 95 LDP members to vote for him to 
add to the support from the Shinseito-led camp. 
  But Watanabe had reportedly collected only some 20 
signatories willing to defect by the time he gave up his bid for 
the top government post. 
  Despite the broad agreement in the ruling coalition, 
differences reportedly remain over the procedures for settling 
the successor issue. It has not been decided yet whether the 
matter will be addressed in a forum of secretaries general of 
the coalition parties, or through direct talks among the leaders 
of all the seven ruling parties. 
  The SDP-led block abhors Shinseito's Ozawa, the main 
strategist in the Hosokawa administration. It has been 
insisting on a meeting of all coalition leaders, apparently in 
an attempt to prevent shinseito's Ozawa and his main political 
ally, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa from taking the 
lead in the picking of a replacement for Hosokawa. 
  Shinseito and Komeito, for their part, remain adamant 
contending for a secretaries general-level caucus to discuss the 
matter first.

world, and in developing bilateral ties. 
  The president said that he was convinced that the 
Sino-Portuguese ties will develop smoothly as long as the 
principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit were 
adhered to. 
  On the issue of Macao, he said that during Silva's visit to 
China in 1987, the two governments signed the joint declaration 
on the question of Macao, which was of great significance. 
  Since the declaration became effective, Jiang said, the two 
countries had seriously abided by it. 
  He added that it has been proved that the joint declaration 
had laid down a sound foundation for the stable development of 
Macao, and the friendly cooperation between the two sides on the 
issue, as well as set a good example for peaceful solution of 
the historic problems between different countries. 
  Since there were only just over five years left for the 
transition period of Macao, Jiang said, and lots of work had to 
be done by the two countries, many problems had to be solved as 
soon as possible. 
  He pointed out that as long as the two countries 
strengthened 
consultation and cooperation, various problems in the transition 
period would be solved properly. 
  Silva said that since the signing of the joint declaration 
seven years ago, the two countries had been cooperative not only 
in carrying it out, but in other aspects. 
  He said that the two countries shared views on many 
international issues, faced similar tasks of developing the 
national economy and improving people's livelihood, and had 
common interests in solving the problem of Macao. 
  "I hope," he said, "the current visit will further the 
bilateral cooperation in fields of politics, economy and 
science." 
  Jiang asked Silva to convey his regards to Portuguese 
President Mario Soares. 
  Among those at the meeting were Peng Qingyuan, vice-chairman 
of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the 
Chinese Kuomintang, Liu Xiliang, chairman of the Chinese 
Government Reception Committee and Vice-Minister of Radio, Film 
and Television, and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu.

  [Text] This is the second day of Prime Minister Cavaco 
Silva's visit to China. He broached the question of Timor 
today. He asked the Chinese Government to contribute to a just 
solution to the problem of East Timor. He stressed that the 
Chinese contribution should come within the UN framework. 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] We believe that there are two 
issues in Timor: the question of respect for human rights, which 
we will continue to advocate here and anywhere else in the 
world, and there is the question of the occupation by a foreign 
power of a territory that, according to international law, is 
still under Portuguese administration. Therefore, we are asking 
the Chinese Government for support, so that within the UN's 
framework, under the auspices of the UN secretary general, a 
just and internationally accepted solution can be found for the 
problem of Timor. [end recording] 
  As for the nationality of the Macanese, Cavaco Silva said 
that he had been informed that the Chinese authorities did not 
intend to impose Chinese nationality on the residents of Macao 
who are of Portuguese descent and culture.

  [Excerpts] Portugal and China -- what good friends we are. 
On this the third day of his visit to the People's Republic, 
Prime Minister Cavaco Silva announced that Portugal advocates 
the lifting of sanctions imposed on China over human rights 
violations. He stated this at a news conference in Beijing. 
Our special correspondent Marina Pimentel was there: 
  [Begin recording] [Pimentel] The Portuguese Government has 
offered to help Chinese businesses find markets in the EU, and 
has called for the lifting of sanctions imposed on China by the 
EU after the Tiananmen massacre. 
  [Cavaco Silva] We think the continuation of sanctions still 
being enforced by the EU is no longer justified. 
  [Pimentel] This announcement helps one understand why Li 
Peng 
has thanked Cavaco Silva for the role played by Portugal in the 
rehabilitation of China's international image. When asked by 
reporters whether the Portuguese Government is not guilty of 
double standards on the human rights question, Cavaco Silva 
implies that the moderation of his criticism of human rights 
violations in China has already enabled him to secure Beijing's 
support on the East Timorese question. [passage omitted] 
  After 1999 the Beijing authorities will not be imposing 
Chinese nationality on the so-called Macanese -- a community of 
some 10,000 people born in Macao but of mixed Portuguese and 
Chinese descent. The Macanese will be free to choose their 
nationality. Cavaco Silva stated at the news conference that he 
has received this pledge from the Chinese authorities. So the 
fears of the Macanese over their future when Macao is handed 
over in five years' time have in principle been removed. This 
is so far the most significant political result of Cavaco 
Silva's visit to China. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's economic pragmatism 
has come to the fore in the speech he has given in China: 
  [Begin Cavaco Silva recording] Portugal can operate as the 
door that will allow China into Europe. And in the same way 
that we see Macao as the springboard for Portuguese businesses 
into China, I believe Portugal can play a similar role in 
allowing Chinese businessmen into the European community. 
  I have also emphasized to the Chinese authorities our 
support 
for the full integration of China in the international economic, 
trade, and financial system. To this end we have been 
advocating and will continue to advocate China's full membership 
of the GATT system. [end recording] 
  Our special correspondent in Beijing, Feliciano Estevao, 
reports in connection with Cavaco Silva's speech: 
  [Begin Estevao recording] It is true that Cavaco Silva has 
given much to the Chinese authorities. For one thing he has 
volunteered his image and prestige in support of the cause of 
China's penetration of the EU's markets. As is known, in the 
aftermath of the Tiananmen events, China was banished from the 
political diaries of the EC countries. Second, Portugal 
supports the normalization of relations between the European 
Union and China. Cavaco Silva is of the view that there is no 
longer any justification for continuing to enforce sanctions, 
namely those banning visits by heads of state and monarchs to 
the People's Republic of China. Third, Cavaco Silva has 
unhesitantly advocated China's integration in the international 
economic and financial system, namely its membership of GATT.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The PEOPLE'S DAILY 
[RENMIN RIBAO], China's leading national newspaper, carries a 
commentary today marking the seventh anniversary of the signing 
of the joint declaration on the question of Macao between China 
and Portugal. 
  The occasion coincides with the current visit to China by 
Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, who signed the 
document in 1987. 
  The commentary describes the joint declaration as a 
historical document of great significance. "It has set a good 
example for solutions to historical problems between countries," 
it explains. 
  The signing of the pact boosted Sino-Portuguese relations to 
a new stage, it says. 
  In March 1993 the Basic Law of the Macao Special 
Administrative Zone of the People's Republic of China was passed 
at the first session of the Eighth National People's Congress 
(NPC). 
  As the fundamental law of Macao, the commentary continues, 
the Basic Law puts forward the basic principles of the Chinese 
Government in the joint declaration into a legal form with 
concrete regulations on the basic systems of society, politics, 
economy and culture in Macao. 
  The law has won wide support from the Macao people, it says. 
  In the seven years since the signing, the friendly relations 
and co-operation between China and Portugal have made smooth 
progress. 
  Exchanges of visits between high-ranking leaders of the two 
countries have pushed forward the bilateral relations and 
promoted friendly cooperation on Macao issue between the two 
countries. 
  It says the two countries have abided by and faithfully 
implemented the declaration and conducted effective co-operation 
on the issue. 
  The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group have held 19 plenary 
meetings and a number of experts' conferences on the issue. 
  The two countries have achieved progress in solving problems 
in the transition period such as those concerning language, the 
civil service and Macao joining international organizations. 
  They have succeeded in solving problems concerning funds and 
aviation in the construction of the Macao International Airport. 
  The commentary says the completion of major construction 
projects in recent years has injected new energy into the 
economic development of Macao. 
  It noted that the sincerity and friendly co-operation 
between 
the two countries in implementation of the joint declaration is 
the guarantee of Macao's stability and development. 
  It is in the common interest of the two countries to 
implement the joint declaration and realize the stable 
transition and smooth return of Macao to Chinese sovereignty in 
1999, the commentary notes. 
  Experience has proved that co-operation is not only 
beneficial to both China and Portugal but also to Macao, the 
commentary says. 
  It notes that as long as the two countries take the whole 
situation into account, persist in close consultation and 
strengthen co-operation, any problem arising during the 
transition can be solved, so as to create conducive conditions 
for the stable transition and smooth return of Macao's 
sovereignty to China.

  [Text] Favorable trade relations between both countries has 
been the key objective of Prime Minister Cavaco Silva's visit to 
China. Today, it was announced that a Portuguese investment, 
trade, and tourism mission will open in Beijing. For the trade 
minister, who is accompanying the prime minister, the next 12 
months will see many economic deals between Portuguese and 
Chinese businessmen take shape. 
  [Correspondent Joana Sa Moraes] Cavaco Silva is in China. 
This is the third day in Beijing. Today he will give a dinner 
for about 300 people and will visit the Temple of Heaven. 
Cavaco Silva has already met the Chinese President Jiang Zemin 
today and the Vice President Rong Yiren, who is considered to be 
mainly responsible for the country's development into a 
socialist market economy. Until a year ago, he led the largest 
economic group in China. 
  Portuguese Minister Faria de Oliveira said today that ICEP, 
Portuguese Investment, Trade and Tourism, will open a mission in 
Beijing in the next few months. This is good news for the 
strengthening of economic relations between the two countries. 
  Yesterday about 300 Chinese businessmen and managers met 
Portuguese businessmen accompanying the Portuguese prime 
minister. Business contacts have multiplied in the last few 
days. Other bilateral projects have been announced: A joint 
wine-producing company, an accord providing for the supply of 
digital bases to China, a Marconi delegation in Beijing, as well 
as other investments in pharmaceuticals, cement, bathroom 
fittings, and cork products.

<F P=106> [Article by special correspondent Francoise Crouigneau in </F>
China: "Dissident Issue Tarnishes French-Chinese Reunion"] 
  [Text] The French prime minister's four-day visit to China 
was slightly marred by the arrest of some dissidents, and hence 
will not turn out to be as successful as expected. Nonetheless, 
it does mark the return to normalized French-Chinese relations, 
and leaves room for hope that some major contracts might be 
wrapped up this summer. 
  By making an official visit to Beijing and Shanghai, the 
prime minister knew he was indulging in a perilous undertaking. 
The aim was to give official confirmation of French-Chinese 
reconciliation and to create a political environment that might 
benefit French companies, without ceding any ground regarding 
the respecting of human rights. Beijing's determination to 
press home its "different" point of view, compared with values 
which it deems overly Western and, in fact, dangerous for a 
state that is deeply divided, put an end to this hope. 
  The return to calm which Edouard Balladur was praying for 
turned into an actual escalation of the situation when two 
dissidents were arrested in Beijing and three more were detained 
in Shanghai. Called upon to explain themselves, the Chinese 
authorities minced their words and duly denied that the arrests 
had taken place. And on Sunday morning, after Edouard Balladur 
had left, one of the "non- arrested" dissidents was released, 
only to be placed under close surveillance in Shanghai. 
Diplomats unconvincingly pointed out that the Chinese often 
resort to this system of arrests to coincide with official 
visits by foreign leaders. However, the damage had been done. 
The French prime minister who had repeatedly emphasized that 
success in this area would depend on discretion and a lack of 
publicity could only watch as he fell into the trap that he had 
thought he could avoid. The same trap into which U.S. Foreign 
Secretary Warren Christopher had stumbled more cruelly in 
mid-March. By openly linking human rights with most-favored 
nation status, he ran up against a wall of rejection deemed to 
have dealt the United States a stinging blow. In fact, it has 
pushed Washington to the point today of looking into the details 
of a most-favored nation clause that would apply solely to U.S. 
private companies or investments in China. 
<H5>  Upcoming Economic Tests </H5>
  Today, France is avoiding any such contortions. However, 
even if the results of economic reconciliation are confirmed 
over the coming months, any such rapprochement will now be 
politically tainted. And the international authority that 
Edouard Balladur might have hoped to gain from his trip to China 
will have been considerably lessened. It remains to be seen 
whether the Chinese leaders are ready to prove concretely that 
any link between human rights and business is, as they like 
putting it, as outdated as the Cold War. If this is the case, 
then the minor advances made during Edouard Balladur's visit in 
cultural and economic terms will not have been made in vain. 
  In a country where the French language occupies a marginal 
position, the opening of a pedagogical cultural center in 
Beijing is not of negligible importance. The promise to create 
a post dedicated to economic expansion in Canton, where the 
consulate was closed as a punishment for French sales of Mirage 
2000-5 aircraft to Taiwan, should enable France to start off on 
the best footing again. At the same time, France has 
non-negligible chances of being "awarded" the contract for a 
second nuclear power station in Daya Bay, for reasons of 
"loyalty." Which is music to the ears of Framatome, the French 
manufacturer of nuclear reactors, which completed Daya Bay I 
last year, together with Spie Batignolles. 
  And without harboring overly high hopes of a 2,500-km TGV 
[high- speed train] link between Beijing and Shanghai actually 
going ahead, the Chinese leaders have placed too great an 
emphasis on the common interests of both countries in this 
respect to abandon all hope regarding the results of the 
electricity minister's next visit to Paris, or the mission that 
Industry and Foreign Trade Minister Gerard Longuet will lead in 
the early summer. Only then will we be able to assess how 
successful the trip by the French prime minister really was. 
And know how far Paris is prepared to go to support new 
contracts thanks to the financial protocol which has to be 
completed by that time. Leaving aside the Daya Bay II project, 
valued at something like 15 billion francs, or the Elf refinery 
due to be built near Shanghai. 
  On the other hand, if Beijing continues to make an indirect 
link between human rights and economic dossiers in an attempt to 
raise the stakes, then we might well wonder about the 
significance of the invitation to visit France which Edouard 
Balladur confirmed to President Jiang Zemin, on behalf of 
Francois Mitterrand. One thing is certain. France cannot 
implement any Asian policy that does not take China into 
account. Obviously, if Beijing wants to avoid confining itself 
to two dialogue partners (the United States and Japan), but also 
seeks to play Europe, then it simply must have the French card 
at its disposal. However, what was supposed to mark a new phase 
in French-Chinese relations could take on all the allure of a 
long, hard march...unless a shift in French foreign policy is 
confirmed, and the defense of human rights is openly uncoupled 
from diplomatic and strategic imperatives.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (AFP) -- The Chinese government 
officially confirmed Wednesday that dissident Xu Wenli, detained 
last Friday in Beijing, is free. "Xu Wenli has complete freedom 
of movement," a Public Security Ministry spokesman told AFP by 
telephone. The spokesman said "Xu has been free since Saturday 
after being held legally for 24 hours." But according to 
relatives, the dissident was only released Tuesday. 
  Xu, 49, a leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement and 
one of China's longest serving political prisoners, had been 
detained as part of a police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and 
Shanghai that coincided with the visit of French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur.

  [Text] One of China's most prominent dissidents, Xu Wenli, 
has been released from police custody after being held for 
questioning for five days, relatives said yesterday. 
  Mr Xu's sister said the former Democracy Wall activist was 
released from a police station yesterday morning and had 
returned to his nearby home. Another relative said he appeared 
in quite good health and did not seem to have been adversely 
affected by his ordeal. 
  However, Mr Xu still appears to be under some form of house 
arrest. A contingent of police officers were still stationed at 
the entrance to his apartment complex yesterday, preventing 
foreign journalists from entering. And the caretaker at Mr Xu's 
building was refusing to put telephone calls through to his 
apartment. 
  The Ministry of Public Security said Mr Xu, 50, had been 
summoned by police on Thursday after "violating the conditions 
of his parole" but refused to say what offences he had allegedly 
committed. It is generally assumed, however, that Mr Xu was 
taken in connection with the investigation into Wei Jingsheng's 
political activities. 
  Wei was detained on April 2 as he tried to return to Beijing 
from nearby Tianjin. The Public Security Ministry later 
confirmed that Wei was being investigated for "suspected new 
crimes" committed while on parole and while being deprived of 
his political rights. 
  Mr Xu had met Wei on several occasions since the latter's 
release from more than 14 years in jail last September. But Mr 
Xu had kept a relatively low profile since being released from 
12 years in jail last May, not talking to foreign journalists or 
openly criticising the Government. 
  In Los Angeles, the U.S. Commerce Undersecretary said the 
Clinton administration was "deeply troubled" by Beijing's recent 
crackdown on dissidents and warned China that it must do more if 
it wants to maintain U.S. trade privileges. Jeffrey Garten said 
both nations want to see a renewal of China's Most Favoured 
Nation (MFN) trading status, with the clock ticking ever closer 
to a June deadline for action. 
  "I know that the Government of China understands the stakes, 
as do we," Mr Garten said. "I strongly hope that enough progress 
will be made on the human-rights front to allow both countries 
to move to a more normal trading framework and then beyond." 
  Mr Garten, the department's top man for international trade 
matters, spoke as a high-level Chinese delegation began a U.S. 
tour aimed at pressing upon the Clinton administration the value 
of continued U.S.-Sino trade. Mr Garten praised the delegation 
head, China's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation Wu Yi, and stressed the value of continued U.S. 
relations with the world's fastest growing economy. 
  Ms Wu, however, warned that the U.S. would lose the huge 
China market if it revoked MFN. Products, technology and 
funding from other countries would flow into the mainland, she 
said. 
  She said China would suffer as a result of the termination 
of 
the MFN status, but added it would hurt the U.S. even more.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Text] Shanghai dissident leader Zhang Xianliang was 
abused and attacked in a labour reform farm on the outskirts of 
the city, his wife said. 
  Yan Huili, Zhang's wife, said her husband had lost about 
four 
kilograms, was suffering poor health and his meagre food rations 
were being stolen by other inmates. 
  Zhang, 48, one of China's most respected dissidents, was 
sentenced last year to three years' "re-education through 
labour" for allegedly "inciting incidents" and organising 
activities in Shanghai to mark the fourth anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre. 
  Another jailed activist, Fu Shenqi was being treated poorly 
at the Dafeng Labour Farm near Shanghai, but was not suffering 
any major health problems, his wife, Li Liping, said. 
  In a letter smuggled out of Qingpu Labour Reform Farm, Zhang 
had said he was abused by other prisoners under the orders of 
team leader Chen Qingxing, Ms Yan said. 
  He was constantly followed by at least two prisoners who 
shouted obscenities at him and pushed him around, she said. 
  Zhang had complained of poor food, and said other prisoners 
even stole food from his meagre diet. 
  During Ms Yan's last visit, watched by farm officials, Zhang 
had been unable to say much about his treatment, but she had 
learned from other sources that her husband was suffering chest 
pains, had sleep problems, had lost control of his right thumb 
and could not keep his hands steady. 
  "They would not allow him to see doctors and only give him 
the medicine which I brought to him during the monthly visit," 
she said. 
  Fu, 40, was detained last year for allegedly "instigating" 
others to protest against Zhang's detention. 
  Ms Li said her husband was barred from keeping notes and 
reading, and could write to his family only under official 
supervision. 
  She said the authorities had not replied to Fu's appeal, and 
no date had been fixed for the hearing. 
  Fu filed an appeal in January after the Shanghai Huangpu 
District Court rejected his lawsuit against labour-reform 
authorities for illegal detention. 
  Both wives said their families were under great financial 
stress because of their husbands' detention. 
  Ms Yan had had to sell her personal belongings. Ms Li had 
difficulty paying for Fu's expenses in the labour farm and was 
living in extreme misery. She said she could not work because 
of illness and could no longer support Fu's parents.

<F P=106> [By Tsao Hsun-piao (2580 8113 1753): "Deng Xiaoping Again </F>
Rectifies the Behavior of Senior Leaders, Recommends Two 
Generals Help Jiang Zemin Control the Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] Deng Xiaoping turned up in Shanghai during the 
spring festival, and his senile state was a breath of cold air 
for people on the mainland. Many people are discussing the 
topic: What will happen in China when Deng dies? 
<H5>  Deng Once Again Rectifies the Behavior of Senior Leaders </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping arrived in Shanghai at the end of November 
last 
year, just as the senior level in China was vigorously carrying 
out activities to commemorate the 100th birthday of Mao Zedong. 
These activities were not planned to be on such large scale 
when the senior level of the CPC made arrangements in May of 
last year. By last September, CPC elders Chen Yun, Peng Zhen, 
and others directly intervened and decided at short notice that 
the scale of the commemorative activities must be expanded. The 
demand by Chen, Peng, and others was: Mao Zedong was the 
creator of New China and the founder of the CPC, and today's 
China is a continuation of China's revolutionary yesterday and a 
development of the undertaking initiated by Mao Zedong; this 
history cannot be cut apart. We are all Mao Zedong's students, 
and what we are doing are the things which Mao Zedong wanted to 
do but failed to do. We must carry out education of this kind 
for the broad masses, establish the high authority of the CPC, 
and establish the authority of the third generation of CPC 
leaders with Jiang Zemin as the core. 
  It was against this background that the senior level of the 
CPC launched activities to commemorate the 100th birthday of Mao 
Zedong in an extraordinary scale, and praises for Mao Zedong 
rolled like great waves, while some "leftists" within the party 
who had ceaselessly attacked reform and opening up on the 
mainland through various pretenses in recent years, also took 
the chance to "give vent to their anger" and voiced their 
grievances against the policy of reform and opening up. One of 
their methods was to blur the difference between the Mao Zedong 
era and Deng Xiaoping era, obscure the difference between the 
"socialism" before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC 
Central Committee and the "socialism" after the reform and 
opening up, cover up Mao Zedong's serious theoretical and policy 
failures and the great disasters they brought to the Chinese 
people, and attempt to recreate "the fairy tale of Mao Zedong." 
The wild performance by the "leftist" forces within the party 
was naturally resisted by persons of various quarters, as well 
as the people on the mainland. Among the senior leaders of the 
CPC, Wan Li, the former chairman of the National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, refused to attend or participate in 
any activities "commemorating Mao Zedong." Many conditions were 
conveyed to the Deng Xiaoping Office, and Deng Xiaoping 
asked after hearing them: "Is Deng Liqun (people call him the 
underground general secretary) very active? This is a chance 
for him! It is quite reasonable to say that the things we are 
doing today are the things which Chairman Mao wanted to do but 
failed to do in the past, but it is neither thorough, nor 
accurate. We should say that today we have done many things 
which were not thought about by our predecessors, or even things 
they were against, otherwise, there is no need for us to replace 
"take class struggle as the key link" with "take economic 
construction as the center," or to replace the planned economy 
with the market economy, or to emancipate minds, seek truth from 
facts, and address false cases and miscarriages of justice, or 
to practice reform and opening up. We must grasp the 
opportunity to carry out reform and promote development, and at 
any time and under any condition, things must obey this overall 
situation, and the commemorative activities in this time must 
also pay attention to this problem." Ding Guangen, head of 
the Propaganda Department, relayed this remark to CPC General 
Secretary Jiang Zemin, and immediately made arrangements for 
various CPC news units to shift the central task to publicizing 
implementation of the "decision" by the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee. Therefore, shortly after the 
new year, the activities commemorating Mao Zedong ended 
abruptly. This may be seen as Deng Xiaoping's 
rectification of the behavior of senior CPC leaders. 
<H5>  Deng Recommends Two Generals Help in Grasping the Army </H5>
  But Deng Xiaoping's health and energy are not as good as 
they 
used to be, and he is unable to look at many important issues. 
A person who knows the inside story disclosed that 
recently Deng's words and deeds have shown some delicate 
changes, one of which is Deng has dropped the habit of 
"disregarding majority opinion" in doing things and paid 
keen attention to the opinions of the several old men who are 
still healthy in the party, and increased interactions with 
them. A particularly obvious change is that he had once become 
estranged from Wan Li, but he recently went to talk to Wan Li 
several times, and asked Wan Li to improve relations with 
Jiang Zemin and Li Peng. He also asked Jiang Zemin and Li Peng 
to "take more initiative and have a more harmonious relationship 
with Comrade Wan Li." This spring festival, Jiang and Li 
each went to Wan Li's residence to greet him, and this is one of 
the signs. 
  Second, Deng is concerned about Jiang Zemin's role in 
the Army. Recently, he recommended Chief of the General Staff 
Chi Haotian and Deng Office Director Wang Ruilin help Jiang 
Zemin to grasp army work. The rumors that Chi Haotian will 
be promoted to the post of vice chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, and Wang Ruilin will serve as general secretary of 
the Central Military Commission have kept coming, and it is 
estimated that this is linked to Deng's arrangements. This move 
shows Deng's worries about the current situation of the Army. 
It has been alleged that, since the Yang brothers were stripped 
of their posts in the Army, there have been big changes and 
adjustments within the Army, and the ability to coordinate among 
major military regions, among various arms of the service, and 
between the Central Military Commission on the one hand and 
major military regions and various arms of the service on the 
other hand, has decreased; and because Zhang Zhen and Liu 
Huaqing, who are responsible for helping Jiang Zemin, have not 
served in important posts within the Army, plus the fact that 
both of them have reached advanced age and therefore it is 
difficult for them to personally oversee the daily work of the 
Army, the only way to strengthen the Central Military 
Commission's command and coordination abilities is to let Chi 
Haotian and Wang Ruilin take up important posts at an 
appropriate time, to fill the power vacuum between the senior 
and lower levels of the Army. It is still not known when Chi 
and Wang will take up new posts. There may still be some twists 
and turns. But will such a move bring down Jiang Zemin's 
"highest authority" within the Army? However, without such a 
move, it is not easy to stabilize the Army. The abovementioned 
situation shows that Deng is spending more energy on 
political stability and party unity in preparation for the days 
when he is no longer around. 
<H5>  Can the Authority of the Third Generation Be Established? </H5>
  Deng Xiaoping and other political old men of the CPC have 
reached a consensus: To maintain political stability in the 
days when they are no longer around, the most important thing to 
do is to establish the authority of the "leaders of the third 
generation with Jiang Zemin as the core." However, like any 
country which is ruled by a single party, the decrease in 
authority of the central leadership seems to be a law without 
exception. Under the current condition that the political power 
of the CPC is relatively concentrated, establishment of highest 
authority often depends on personal ability and charisma, but in 
the situation whereby many political old men are still alive and 
the promotion of reform and opening up leads to decentralized 
and diversified decisionmaking, the basic elements for training 
personal ability and charisma do not exist. Judged from the 
process of birth of the third-generation leaders of the CPC, 
they "suffer from an inherent shortage." For example, they had 
to take the stage hastily and did not have outstanding work 
merits. 
  At present, Chen Yun's health is obviously better than Deng 
Xiaoping's, and people are generally concerned that if Deng 
Xiaoping passes away before Chen Yun, then Chen Yun will 
actually become the top man in China's political arena. Will 
China's reform and open- door policy then be rolled back a bit? 
Will the personnel structure and power pattern of the 
"third-generation leadership" remain unchanged? When Chen Yun 
turned up on a public occasion in Shanghai this spring festival 
to make a speech, there were two points which were very 
eye-catching: He stressed the need to establish the "authority 
of the CPC leadership with Jiang Zemin as the core," saying that 
without such authority great things cannot be done; second, he 
said that development must correspond to the country's strength, 
and construction scale must not exceed the country's current 
ability to sustain it. These two points in fact are an old 
point of view he has clung to for many years, namely, the need 
to strengthen the central leadership's planning and control over 
economic work. It seems that this idea of Chen Yun now enjoys a 
dominant position at the senior level of the CPC, whereas Deng 
Xiaoping's remark that "Shanghai can go even faster" which he 
made in Shanghai, and his basic advocacy of "development is the 
last word" and "go faster if one can" do not sound as pronounced 
and prominent as Chen Yun's idea. 
<H5>  Zhu Rongji Is Under Increasing Pressure </H5>
  According to analyses by persons close to the decisionmaking 
organs at the senior level of the CPC, the critical problem 
affecting the central authoritative status of Jiang Zemin and 
others is not that they do not have adequate power, but their 
lack of ability to use power, as well as the declining rallying 
power of the traditional political system. This year has seen 
the highest number of important reform measures announced by the 
senior level of the CPC in more than 10 years, and the width and 
depth of the reform are unprecedented. Judged from the reform 
plans that have been announced, we should say that they are 
comparatively reasonable and correct in terms of a basic way of 
thinking and framework. But to implement these plans, there are 
obstacles and difficulties in terms of time, condition, means, 
and so on, and if these problems are not properly handled, the 
reform will change direction and shape, or even lead to the 
result that the old system returns. 
  Many economists point out that the basic way in which the 
mainland promotes reform plans is the model of top-down 
administrative orders, and the goal of reform is to decentralize 
decisionmaking power and build an orderly, standardized, and 
indirect macroregulation and control system on the premise of 
strengthening market economy mechanisms. However, the current 
practice is that the central leadership is ceaselessly gathering 
and centralizing power, restraining the vigor in localities and 
enterprises for economic development, and restricting the 
decisionmaking-power decentralization which is needed for the 
formation of market economy mechanisms. Between the means of 
reform and the goal of reform there emerges a relatively big 
conflict. Speaking in terms of the order of formation of market 
economy mechanisms, the building of a state macroregulation and 
control system should be a "post-market behavior." First there 
should be growth of a market economy, then there can be the need 
and condition for building the state's macroregulation and 
control functions. 
  Amid the reform and opening up on the mainland over the 
past 10 years or so, development of the market has just begun, 
the framework of the old system has not yet completely 
disintegrated, and many economic relations have yet to be 
straightened out and established according to the principle of 
the market economy. Under this condition, using administrative 
organization and means to establish state macroregulation and 
control functions will not lead to an outcome which is identical 
with the goal of reform. When trying to handle the 
above-mentioned contradictions, the senior level of the CPC, 
especially Zhu Rongji, who is in charge of the economy, has met 
with pressures and criticisms which increase in an unprecedented 
scale. 
  However, the perplexity currently facing Zhu Rongji is not 
the contradiction between reform and the forces against reform, 
but the contradiction between different ways to promote reform. 
On the one hand, this kind of contradiction shows that on the 
problem of how to promote the reform, it is necessary for 
various quarters to support one another and coordinate among 
themselves, and to have a process of "grinding and integrating," 
compromising, and eventually reaching consensus. On the other 
hand, it also shows that within the framework of the traditional 
political system of the CPC, when the political authority of the 
old generation retreats and the political authority of the new 
generation has not yet been established, to ponder problems and 
do things, the traditional way in which everyone marches in the 
same pace once an authoritative order is given, can on longer be 
used. More help should be sought from the democratic style of 
consultations with various quarters, exchanges on equal footing, 
and mutual compromises. Regarding this point, people hope that 
Zhu Rongji should have more awareness, because people pin more 
hopes on him than other figures. 
<H5>  The Authorities Put Stability in the First Position </H5>
  This year, China's reform and development duties are heavy, 
and its social, political, and economic environments have 
contradictions and perplexities which are more serious than 
those in the past. Inflationary pressure continues to increase, 
the spreading tendency of corruption has not been effectively 
checked, the situation of law and order is deteriorating, about 
half of state-owned enterprises are losing money or are in a 
semi-stoppage state, and the "debt chains" of some 370 billion 
yuan have once again pushed a majority of state-owned 
enterprises into a financial and debt dilemma, while the number 
of unemployed and job-waiting staff and workers rapidly 
increases, tens of millions of rural laborers move in a 
disorderly manner to various parts of the mainland, and all 
these might lead to serious social unrests. Properly solving 
and handling these problems and ensuring accomplishment of 
reform and development duties is a serious test to the authority 
of the senior level of the CPC. 
  The CPC's work principle this year is to uphold "reform, 
development, and stability" simultaneously; judged from the work 
procedure, it has put stability in the first position. For the 
sake of stability, both reform and development must pay a 
relatively big price in terms of "reducing speed." The 
senior level of the CPC recently decided that, for the need 
to stabilize the overall situation, the reform plans to be 
announced this year must be slowed, and their contents must be 
adjusted, and some polices must be amended while one or two 
policies must be suspended. If some reform plans are not 
accepted by the society when they are announced, they should be 
shelved. Therefore, the general situation on the mainland this 
year will not be reform and development "on the doubt;" at most, 
in the area of reform, it can only be the adjustment of pace, 
mediation of contradictions, accumulation of strength, and 
preparation work. In the area of development, it can only be an 
effort to decrease the inflation rate, suppress the scale of 
capital construction, continue to carry out adjustment of 
industrial structure and product mix, and control the 
development speed within 10 percent, so as to avoid big 
fluctuations in economic development. 24 February 1994

<F P=106> ["CHINA DAILY Commentary": "A Long-Term Battle"] </F>
  [Text] The Shen Taifu and Li Xiaoshi bribery and 
embezzlement cases are just the latest major corruption scandals 
to have been made public since the govenment declared its 
renewed commitment of fighting graft last year. 
  The cases show that, though initial successes have been 
achieved, the crackdown on corruption is an urgent as well as a 
long-term battle, as was said by Party General Secretary Jiang 
Zemin not long ago. 
  Any relaxation in the fight against graft will nullify all 
the achievements that have so far been made. 
  More than 60,000 people were reportedly indicted on charges 
of corruption last year. Fifty-four percent of the cases 
involved bribery and 24 percent involved embezzlement. 
  And unless corruption is effectively checked, it is liable 
to 
spread like a virus through the body politic. 
  The virus is particularly rampant at the moment as the 
country moves from a planned economy to a socialist market 
economy, which is at its primary stage. The transition means 
that there are many administrative loopholes which may be 
exploited. 
  Corruption, with its promise of easy, big profits, can only 
result in the downfall of weak-willed ranking officials and 
public servants and tarnish the image of the government. 
  The fate of Shen Taifu, president of the Beijing Great Wall 
Machinery and Electronics Group, and Li Xiaoshi, former vice- 
minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, is a 
case in point. 
  And now both of them have been dealt with by the law. 
  All government functionaries should learn a salutary lesson 
and refrain from trying their luck in defiance of Party 
discipline and State law. 
  History shows that serious corruption can jeopardize the 
State and even lead it to destruction. 
  But the sad fact that there has been an increse in disclosed 
corruption cases as the country turns to a socialist market 
economy cannot be blamed on the policy of reform itself. 
  On the contrary, the reforms aim to eliminate corruption for 
good in the long run. 
  And in the meantime, the continued fight against corruption 
will ensure the implementation of the reforms and guarantee the 
country's opening to the outside world. The battle is also of 
crucial importance to the setup of socialist market economy. 
  And, as the war against corruption continues, there is an 
urgent need for strengthened legislation to close the loopholes 
for potential offenders. 
  Though the majority of government officials and public 
servants are honest, the few, like Li Xiaoshi, have taken 
advantage of the power vested in them. 
  And the stable environemnt which is necessary to reform and 
development can be undermined by corruption. 
  The crackdown on graft is a war we cannot afford to lose. 
  Public support and governmental determination are essential, 
if this arduous and prolonged war is to be won. 
  The Party and government have shown great determination by 
taking concrete measures and they have enjoyed public support 
because people at large intensely resent corrupt officials and 
civil servants who prey on our society. 
  Long-term plans should be worked out to ensure the 
operation's continued success. The crackdown is already a major 
item on this year's Party and State agendas. 
  And the major cases of corruption that have so far been 
exposed should be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. 
  Only thus can we ensure a clean government, which will lead 
this country to prosperity.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (CNS) -- The maximum punishment 
for presons found guilty of infringing trademarks has been 
increased to a seven years' jail term up from the original three 
years and the rise of 300 percent in the fine imposed. 
  Director of the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce Mr Liu Minxue said in a news briefing today that the 
punishment for breaches of trademark and false registration of 
trademarks was harsh. He said he was convinced that with the 
growing development of the commodity economy and international 
trade, infringements of trademarks and counterfeit registration 
of trademarks had tended to increase, becoming a public hazard 
in the international community. Light punishment according to 
law against such crimes was to blame for rampancy of the offence. 
  Following the learning of experience acquired by foreign 
countries in this sector, Mr Liu said that the Chinese 
authorities had revised the trademark law in accordance with its 
own situation while at the same time the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress had approved supplementary 
regulations on the punishment for counterfeit registration of 
trademarks and the State Council had endorsed the revision of 
the detailed regulations on the implementation of the trademark 
law. Legislation meanwhile had strengthened protection for the 
exclusive use of trademarks and the revised law had boosted the 
administrative enforcement of the law to deal with trademark 
infringement. The law stated that the industrial and commercial 
administration could increase administrative punishment for 
violation of trademark to a fine of not more than 50 percent of 
the turnover or not more than five times the profits obtained 
from the illegal practice of committing breach of trademark, an 
increase from the original imposition of a fine equivalent to 
not more than 20 percent of the illegal turnover or to a sum not 
more than twice the illegal profit. Persons found guilty of 
committing false registration of trademarks would receive the 
maximum jail term from the original three years to seven years.

  [Text] Shenzhen, April 12 (CNS) -- The taking away of 
documents labelled as confidential by travellers departing 
through the Shenzhen Customs is rampant and the number of such 
cases uncovered by the Customs is on the rise. 
  Statistics released by the Luohu Customs on the Chinese side 
show that the Customs checked 20 such cases involving some 100 
confidential documents between last January and March. During 
the period between March 15 and 21 alone the Customs uncovered 
six cases in which several secret documents were discovered. 
  The taking away of state-level secret documents and 
information out of the border without prior application to the 
state department responsible for such secret information, 
according to the official in charge of the Shenzhen bureau 
responsible for the safeguarding of secret material, is in 
violation of the law and will be dealt with by the judicial 
department. The number of cases where confidential documents 
were being illegally brought out of the country through the 
Shenzhen Customs saw a sharp increase during the past six 
months. There were 49 such cases transferred from the Kowloon 
Customs to the Shenzhen bureau of secrets last year, a rise of 
nearly 100 percent over the year before and the number of these 
cases are showing an upward trend this year. 
  People who took secret documents through the customs are 
mainly Mainland personnel going to Hong Kong on business trips 
as well as overseas businessmen and the documents mainly deal 
with economic affairs and trade. 
  The official appealed to the public and especially to the 
customs officers to increase their awareness of the maintenance 
of secrecy. He also called for observation of the law and 
regulations by overseas visitors and said that they should not 
illegally obtain and take documents out of the country.

"Attach Importance to Strictness and Establish a New Image for 
Civil Aviation"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- A consistent demand of 
the civil aviation industry by the party Central Committee and 
the State Council is to persistently attach importance to 
strictness -- carrying out strict management, setting strict 
demands, and strictly enforcing discipline. The persistent 
emphasis on strictness is determined by the characteristics, 
important responsibility, important role, and important impact 
of civil aviation. 
  We must fully affirm the remarkable achievements made by 
civil aviation in recent years. However, civil aviation also 
has such problems as a serious safety problem, a declining rate 
of the normal carrying out of scheduled flights, and a poor 
quality of service. These problems have caused the extremely 
great concern of the party Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the broad masses of the people. It is time that these 
problem be dealt with. Their main causes are poor management, 
slack discipline, and a sloppy work style. Poor management is 
equal to no management. 
  Civil aviation work has a direct bearing on the image of the 
party and the government, on the people's lives and safety, and 
on the great undertakings of reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. For this reason, the civil aviation industry must 
adhere to high standards, set strict demands for itself, and 
carry out strict, scientific, and modernized management. 
  To persistently attach importance to strictness, we must 
emphasize centralization and unity and ensure that government 
decrees are implemented by all concerned. Civil aviation should 
deepen reform and change the operational mechanisms of its 
enterprises. In operation and management, it should streamline 
procedures, delegate powers to lower levels, and invigorate its 
business. However, as for safety measures, air traffic control, 
operational standards, and law and discipline enforcement, it 
must uphold a high degree of centralization and unity and carry 
out strict management, and it must not let each of its 
subordinate units go its own way. The more a trade or 
enterprise is developed and invigorated, the more it needs to 
improve its management. The State Council has decided to 
promote the status of the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
to a ministerial-level organ. The fundamental purpose of doing 
so is to improve the management of civil aviation. The civil 
aviation administration should fully understand the profound 
meaning and great significance of the decision and take it as an 
opportunity to improve management and exercise government 
authority. 
  To persistently attach importance to strictness, the leaders 
should take the lead in being strict and perform actual deeds. 
The efforts should start right away with the leaders and the 
leading organs. To be strict with his subordinates, a superior 
must first be strict with himself. In light of the problems 
existing in the leadership of the civil aviation industry, the 
party committee of the Civil Aviation Administration of China 
has set three demands for the leading cadres at all levels. One 
is to attach importance to strictness and to oppose the nice-guy 
mentality. Next is to work hard, perform actual deeds, and 
oppose formalism. The third is to consider the interest of the 
whole and oppose selfish departmentalism. Leading cadres at all 
levels must seriously fulfill the three demands. In the civil 
aviation industry, strictness should be an important criterion 
for personnel employment. Anyone who is weak and poor in 
management and who has no desire to accomplish much is not 
qualified to be a leader. Anyone who carries out strict and 
successful management should continue to do so, and those who 
practice poor management should improve the situation as soon as 
possible. 
  To persistently attach importance to strictness, it is 
necessary to establish a strict responsibility system. The 
leaders, functional departments, and personnel in charge of 
various businesses in all civil aviation units and departments 
should carry out the tasks of safety, normal operation, and 
service. A clear and definite system of responsibility for 
safety, normal operation, and good service should be established 
so that each attends to his duties. 
  To persistently attach importance to strictness, we should 
give wide publicity to the need for strictness. We should make 
strictness a general practice so that all civil aviation 
employees fully understand the purpose, significance, and need 
for being strict and working strictly according to the rules in 
all departments, businesses, and jobs. Being strict should 
become the order of the day and all workers and staff members 
should conscientiously adhere to it. Anyone who upholds strict 
standards and makes outstanding achievements should be highly 
commended. Those who works sloppily should be sternly criticized 
and educated. Law and discipline violators should be harshly 
punished. In short, strictness should prevail from top to 
bottom, with each level strictly supervising the next lower 
level, and a new image for civil aviation should be established.

  [Text] Hefei, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Hope Project has 
helped 24,000 school-age children in east Anhui province return 
to the classroom in the past four years, provincial education 
officials said here. 
  With nearly 10 million yuan it has raised, the project has 
set up schooling foundations in 21 counties and built 21 primary 
and secondary schools, the officials said. 
  Poverty, plus the big flood in 1991, has led to the exodus 
of 
thousands of children in the province from their schools. 
  But the Hope Project, which is helping to reverse the trend, 
has received wide support both from within and from outside the 
province. Donors range from kindergarten children to professors 
and government officials, as well as companies and other 
institutions. 
  State Councilor Peng Penyun now personally underwrites one 
child's schooling. Youths in Tianjin made donations to build 
three schools. The China Pingan Insurance Company donated 
500,000 yuan to help 1,000 children with their education. The 
company also helped build a primary school at Liuan County. 
  Donators also included business people and artists from Hong 
Kong and Taiwan. 
  Overseas institutions and individuals have also given a 
helping hand. Chinese Americans in Los Angeles funded China's 
first Hope Project school in Jinzhai County. A Hong Kong 
entrepreneur donated 200,000 yuan. The United Nations 
Children's Fund and a British organization for children have 
also contributed to the cause. 
  In 1993, the province raised 11 million yuan through the 
issue of a "love heart" lottery. 
  Zhang Zongyou, a sophomore at Fuyang Teacher's College, has 
become China's first college student to reach campus through 
Hope Project help.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Eastern China's Fujian 
Province is trying to woo more investment from Hong Kong, Macao 
and Taiwan through improving its infrastructure facilities. 
  Wang Jianshuang, deputy-governor of the coastal province, 
told some delegates to the provincial people's congress and 
members of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference today that Fujian is to carry 
out preferential policies and upgrade its basic facilities and 
industries so that overseas investors can reap best economic 
returns in the province. 
  Continuous efforts will be made in the construction of the 
Xiamen special economic zone, the Fuzhou bonded zone and 
economic and technological development zones among others. 
  Investment in infrastructure sectors, including airports, 
railways, ports, electricity power plants, water supply and 
telecommunications, will be increased to 26.2 billion yuan, up 
20.4 percent compared with last year. 
  In addition, he said, the province will offer legal services 
for overseas investors and inquiry services on other issues of 
concern such as foreign exchange reforms and tax reforms in 
China. 
  He said that key sectors needing overseas investment include 
infrastructure construction projects, agriculture and the 
transformation of state-owned enterprises and finance, commerce, 
entertainment, information services and real estate. 
  The province is the home of many overseas Chinese. Figures 
from the provincial government show that there are eight million 
overseas Chinese who originally lived in the province. About 80 
percent of Taiwanese originated from Fujian. 
  By the end of March, a total of 13,543 foreign-funded 
enterprises were approved, with a contractual investment volume 
of 24.4 billion U.S. dollars. Actual investment reached 6.6 
billion U.S. dollars, about one-tenth of China's total overseas 
investment.

  [Text] Quanzhou, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the 
implementation of the new taxation system this year, various 
kinds of taxes collected by Quanzhou City have grown steadily. 
In the first two months alone, various kinds of taxes collected 
by the city reached 300 million yuan, 26.8 percent up on the 
same period last year. 
  This year is the first year in which China has implemented 
its new taxation system. It is known that in implementing the 
new taxation system, the Quanzhou City government has 
extensively publicized the new tax laws to increase 
understanding of them among people in various circles. At the 
same time, taxation departments at all levels have also 
energetically conducted special inspection, especially 
inspections of some major taxpayers whose tax payments are in 
arrears, and they have fixed time limits for tax payments. As a 
result, the new taxation system has been operating quite 
effectively. 
  At the same time, taxation departments have seriously done a 
good job in guiding taxpayers to calculate and pay value-added 
tax and other taxes. They have also taken special measures 
toward supply and marketing enterprises, materials enterprises, 
and commercial enterprises to guard against fraud. 
  Moreover, taxation departments have concentrated their 
efforts on the collection and management of various kinds of 
local taxes to prevent tax losses.

  [Text] Jinan, April 13 (XINHUA) -- A long, winding 
ecological forest belt embracing the easternmost tip of the 
Shandong Peninsula in eastern China has taken shape through 
decades of efforts by local people. 
  The coastal green protective line is typically 100 to 2,000 
m 
wide, with trees of selected species, shrubs and grass. 
  The belt is playing a great part in preventing the loss of 
water and the erosion of soil in the coastal areas. 
  Every year millions of tourists come here to enjoy 
themselves 
in the dense woods and on the soft, sandy beaches. 
  To take advantage of the large stretches of wooded areas, 
local governments are planning varieties of forest and island 
tourist cooperative projects with foreign businessmen.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Foreign investment 
has kept flowing into the Pudong New Area of east China's 
Shanghai, the country's leading industrial center. 
  Information from the Pudong New Area Bureau of Economy and 
Trade reveals that in the first three months of this year, 
Pudong approved the establishment of 299 foreign-funded 
enterprises, involving a total foreign investment of 1.06 
billion U.S. dollars. The two figures represent sharp increases 
compared with corresponding figures for the same period last 
year. 
  In the first few days of April alone, Pudong signed letters 
of intent for investment with a dozen international consortiums. 
  Investment has come mainly from such countries as the United 
States and Japan as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan. It has also 
come from other parts of the world, such as Panama, Puerto Rico, 
Bolivia, Israel and Western Samoa. 
  By the end of last month, investors from 40 countries and 
regions had made investment in Pudong's 1,927 projects, with a 
total investment of 4.33 billion U.S. dollars.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 12 (XINHUA) -- China's largest 
industrial metropolis of Shanghai has launched a program to 
develop the area in the western suburbs. 
  The area, with nearly 300 ha under the development program, 
will become another of the city's new industrial bases. 
  It is only six km from the Hongqiao International Airport 
and 
linked closely with Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui Provinces. 
  Within the area, necessary key infrastructural facilities 
such as a transformer substation, a water plant and a 
program-controlled telephone system have been built. 
  So far 32 industrial projects, mainly from joint ventures 
with businessmen from Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, have 
become established in the area with a total investment of more 
than 80 million U.S. dollars. 
  Among them technology-intensive and labor-intensive projects 
co-exist, as do those which are export-oriented or serving 
domestic markets.

  [Text] Shanghai, 17 Mar (XINHUA) -- The purpose of the 
people's government is to serve the people. When Comrade Jiang 
Zemin was Shanghai mayor, he called on the municipal government 
to do practical things for the people. That was seven years 
ago. Now, the municipal government has completed 97 practical 
things for the people, all of them were closely related to the 
masses daily lives. The municipal government's move won praises 
from the masses. 
  For the past seven years, the Shanghai municipal government 
organized personnel and sent them to solicit the masses' 
opinions. Based on the masses' opinions, the municipal 
government prepared a practical-things list for that year in 
line with the principle of financial and manpower availability 
and with the principle of doing things in a down-to-earth 
manner. To ensure the completion of that year's list, relevant 
departments would cooperate with each other and give priority to 
completing those practical things. The 97 practical things that 
the municipal government has completed are concentrated mostly 
in the food supply, housing, and transport areas, things that 
the masses show most concern for. 
  For the past seven years, housing construction has always 
been on the municipal government's practical-thing list. The 
municipal government has helped relieve Shanghai's overcrowded 
housing situation to some extent. Shanghai built over 600,000 
housing units in the last seven years, thus adding 0.7 square 
meter to the per capita living space for its citizens. The 
municipal government has always paid attention to the "vegetable 
basket project" because it directly affects the interests of all 
citizens. The government has helped improve the nonstaple food 
supply. 
  Citizens living in outlying areas or in new residential 
areas 
once complained about the unavailability of public telephone 
service at night. They said they were at a complete loss when 
emergencies occurred. To meet their demands, the municipal 
government entered the "emergency telephone" item on its 
practical-thing list. Following coordination with many relevant 
departments, it was decided that telephones at plants, stores, 
schools, and organs operating at nighttime would be open for 
public use. The new arrangement thus added 2,400 nighttime 
emergency telephones in the municipality. Last year, the 
municipal government also set up a "110 police information 
telephone" network to enhance the people's sense of security. 
  Shanghai municipal government's persistence in doing 
practical things for the citizens in the last seven years has 
helped improve the living environment and quality of the masses. 
The elated masses called the government's practical-thing 
projects "projects of conscience."

<F P=106> [By reporter Guan Xiangdong (7070 0686 2639)] </F>
  [Text] Haikou, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- According 
to a conference of Hainan taxation bureau chiefs held a few days 
ago, the new taxation system, which converges with Hainan's 
preferential policies, is operating smoothly in Hainan. While 
implementing the new taxation system, the taxation policies for 
the Hainan Special Economic Zone [SEZ] will remain unchanged. 
  When the new taxation system converges with Hainan's 
preferential policies, the 15 percent income tax for enterprises 
and other policies concerning the term of exemption will 
continue to be effective. The specific contents of the term of 
exemption include: 
  First, a 15 percent tax rate will be levied on the income 
from the production and operation of enterprises run by foreign 
and interior province investors in Hainan. They are exempted 
from local income taxes. 
  Second, preferential treatment will be given to income taxes 
delivered by enterprises in light of different trades, term of 
operation, and investment amount. For example, enterprises 
engaged in harbor, port, airport, highway, railway, power 
station, coal mine, water conservancy, and agricultural 
development, whose term of operation exceeds 15 years, may be 
exempted from income taxes for five years from the year they 
start making a profit, and their income taxes will be reduced by 
50 percent from the sixth to the tenth year. Enterprises 
engaged in industrial, transportation, and other productive 
trades, whose term of operation exceeds 10 years, may be 
exempted from income taxes for two years from the year they 
start making a profit, and their income taxes shall be reduced 
by 50 percent from the third to the fifth year. Income taxes of 
the enterprises regarded by the Hainan Government as advanced 
technological enterprises shall be reduced by 50 percent from 
the sixth to the eighth year. When the period of aforementioned 
tax exemption expires for enterprises engaged in industrial and 
agricultural production, an enterprise must pay income tax of 10 
percent if its exports exceed 70 percent of its output value in 
the year. Enterprises engaged in service and catering trades 
whose total investment exceeds $5 million, or 20 million yuan, 
and whose term of operation exceeds 10 years, shall be exempted 
from income taxes for one year from the year they start making a 
profit; their income taxes shall be reduced by 50 percent for 
the second and third year. Foreign-funded banks, Sino-foreign 
banks, and other foreign-funded financial organizations may 
enjoy the preferential treatment of exemption and reduction in 
income taxes. More preferential policies shall be granted to 
the use of foreign capital in developing basic facilities and 
productive enterprises in Tongshi and the nationality autonomous 
counties. 
  Third, foreign-funded enterprises which use their profits 
made in Hainan to reinvest in running enterprises in Chinese 
territory or expand production for a term of not less than 5 
years may get a refund of 40 percent of the income tax paid for 
reinvestment. If the reinvestment is made in Hainan's 
infrastructure, agricultural development, and exports or if the 
enterprises are regarded by the Hainan Provincial Government as 
advanced technological enterprises, they will receive all the 
income taxes paid for reinvestment. If the enterprises withdraw 
within five years, they must pay the aforementioned refunded 
income taxes. 
  Fourth, dividends, interests, rent, franchise royalty, and 
other incomes gained by investors outside the territory which 
have no offices in Hainan may be exempted from income taxes. 
  Moreover, there are preferential treatment for exchange 
taxes 
in the following three aspects: 
  First, the consumption and value-added taxes in the 
production process imposed on the goods produced and marketed on 
the island, except cigarette, alcohol, sugar, and mineral oil, 
will be reduced by 50 percent. The consumption and value-added 
taxes in the production process on other goods will be exempted. 
  Second, the dutiable consumer goods exported directly by the 
production enterprises in Hainan or the dutiable consumer goods 
exported through the foreign trade enterprises shall be exempted 
from consumer taxes in the production process. There will be no 
value-added tax on direct export goods. An application can be 
filed to the taxation organs for tax reimbursement on imported 
items. Value-added and consumer taxes will be levied on products 
sold to foreign trade enterprises for exports. After the goods 
are exported, the foreign trade enterprises may apply to the 
taxation organs for tax reimbursements in light of relevant 
provisions. 
  Third, income of foreign-funded banks and Sino-foreign banks 
(insurance companies) in the Hainan SEZ shall be exempted from 
business taxes for 5 years, beginning from the date of their 
operation. When the exemption period expires, the business tax 
imposed on these banks shall be reduced by 3 percent.

  [Text] Over the past two months since the new taxation 
system was introduced, Hainan's tax revenue has seen a steady 
increase. By the end of February, the province had collected 
486 million yuan in industrial and commercial taxes, 
representing an increase of 77.5 percent over the same period of 
the previous year, and completed 16.4 percent of the tasks 
assigned by the state, of which the central tax amounted to 119 
million yuan and the local tax stood at 366 million yuan. 
  Since the beginning of this year, in accordance with the 
requirements of the new taxation system and in light of the 
realities of the Hainan special zone's market economic structure 
and economic development, tax authorities at all levels in the 
province have done a good job of investigating tax funds and 
have delegated tax collection plans at all levels down to the 
tax collecting units. At the same time, they have persisted in 
managing taxation in accordance to the law and have strengthened 
tax collection and management, thus enabling the province to 
maintain a relatively good momentum of tax revenue growth. In 
terms of taxes, business tax, state-owned enterprises' income 
tax, and additional revenue from education fees saw 
comparatively large increases.

<F P=106> [By staff correspondent Yang Liu (2799 2692)] </F>
  [Text] Hainan Province, China's largest special economic 
zone, has decided to build a large international airport under 
the name of Meilan in Haikou. The authorities are planning to 
share the rights and interests generated from the development of 
the Haikou Airport, now shared by civilian and military 
authorities, with the Army at a ratio of two to one. 
  Hainan personnel said that the Haikou Airport can no longer 
meet the passenger and cargo transportation demand posed by the 
zone's vibrant tourism and economic growth. The authorities 
have decided to spend 3 billion yuan building the Meilan 
International Airport in the eastern part of Haikou. 
  The Meilan Airport will have two runways, each 3,600 meters, 
and a 70,000 square meter terminal, the construction of which 
will begin this year and will be completed within four years. 
  Capital for the new airport comes from the following three 
sources: (1) issuing shares; (2) the auction of the 3,000 mu 
of land at the Haikou Airport; and (3) inviting foreign capital 
(including foreign government loans and foreign participation as 
shareholders). 
  The Haikou Airport currently in use was built in the 1950's 
as part of a Chinese Naval unit and was expanded in the 
mid-1980's into a civilian-military airport. Last year it 
handled a total of 1.2 million passengers; it is one of China's 
busiest airports. 
  With an area of 4,400 mu and adjacent to the city, the old 
Haikou Airport carries premium commercial value. The local 
government and the Navy have worked out a deal on the 
development of the airport land. 
  The Hainan Government will give the Navy 800 million yuan to 
enable it to build a new military airport somewhere on Hainan 
Island, and 1,400 mu of the old airport land earmarked for the 
development of tertiary industry. 
  The Hainan Provincial Government will get the remaining 
3,000 
mu of airport land and the right to auction and develop it. The 
authorities are hoping for 4 billion yuan of income from the 
3,000 mu of land. Deducting 800 million for the Navy, the 
government will have 3.2 billion to spend on the new airport and 
other commercial projects. It is perfect. 
  Also, Hainan Province has recently set up a Property Rights 
Exchange Center and arranged for the first "Convention of 
State-Owned and Collective Property Rights Exchange" to be held 
in Haikou from 8 to 13 April. 
  So far, 33 Hainan enterprises (manufacturers, hotels, and 
airlines) have applied for admission to the property sale 
convention. Items on offer include the Hainan Airline and part 
of the property rights of the Meilan Airport and Sanya Fenghuang 
Airport, which the authorities are planning to sell to foreign 
companies. Sources say property sales transaction commissions 
for the Hainan Government are temporarily set at 4/1,000.

  [Text] Provincial Party Committee Secretary Li Changchun 
yesterday delivered at the provincial discipline inspection 
commission sixth plenary session a speech in which he 
emphatically called on the party committees and governments at 
all levels in the province to acquire an in-depth understanding 
of and push forward the ongoing anticorruption struggle in a 
thorough and protracted manner. 
  Secretary Li Changchun stated in his speech at yesterday's 
closing session: The ongoing anticorruption struggle is an 
important strategic measure aimed at consolidating and enhancing 
ties between the CPC and the masses in the new situation, 
bolstering the CPC's ruling-party position, and enabling the CPC 
to more successfully undertake the important historical mission 
of guiding reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization 
drive. The ongoing anticorruption struggle is at once the most 
effective way to mobilize more than one billion Chinese people 
to participate in reform, opening up, and the modernization 
drive with burning enthusiasm and the prerequisite of reform, 
development, and stability. 
  Secretary Li Changchun noted: In the next stage of the 
anticorruption struggle, we will make continued efforts to 
attain the three anticorruption goals put forward by the central 
authorities, will conscientiously investigate and tackle local 
and departmental problems, will implement to the letter the five 
regulations on ensuring honest performance and discipline 
observance among party and government cadres at the county or 
provincial department section level, as mapped out in 1993 by 
the central authorities, will conscientiously carry out the five 
new regulations promulgated this year by the central authorities 
of ensuring honest performance and discipline observance among 
party and government cadres at the county or provincial 
department section level, will make redoubled efforts to build 
an anticorruption system on the basis of self-examination and 
self-rectification among party and government cadres, and will 
expedite the pace of investigating and handling major and 
serious cases, especially those exposed this year. 
  Secretary Li Changchun maintained: The party committees and 
governments at all levels throughout the province should 
strengthen leadership over the investigations into and the 
handling of each and every major and serious case, should 
resolutely punish corrupt elements irrespective of their rank or 
position, and should make continued and redoubled efforts to 
straighten out professional malpractices and resolutely wipe out 
unreasonable and indiscriminate charges. 
  Secretary Li Changchun emphatically noted: To successfully 
further the ongoing anticorruption struggle, it is imperative to 
combat corruption by looking into both the root causes and 
symptoms of corrupt phenomena, fundamentally remove the soil 
that breeds corruption, and work hard to build a restriction and 
supervision mechanism capable of combating corruption and 
ensuring a clean government. To this end, it is imperative to 
strengthen education and guidance in this regard and step up 
legal system building, thereby making it possible for people 
from all walks of life in the society to supervise party and 
government cadres. 
  Secretary Li Changchun asserted: The fundamental difference 
between the CPC and other political parties lies in the fact 
that the CPC has all along maintained close ties with the broad 
masses of the people, this being one of the CPC's fine 
traditions and styles. Carrying forward such a fine tradition 
and fine style still has great significance in the new situation 
of socialist market economic structural building. As long as we 
continue to maintain close ties with the masses and resolutely 
eradicate corrupt phenomena, the CPC and the broad masses of 
cadres and people will be able to forge ahead with one heart and 
one mind and maintain long-term political stability. 
  Secretary Li Changchun stressed: The on-going anticorruption 
struggle is an important political task for the entire party. 
Party committees and governments at all levels in the province 
should attach utmost importance to, should earnestly strengthen 
leadership over, and should protractedly further the struggle in 
accordance with a series of principles and policies mapped out 
by the central authorities. The principal party and government 
leaders should take personal charge of and assume overall 
responsibility for the ongoing anticorruption struggle and 
should also study, coordinate, arrange for, and press ahead with 
the on-going anticorruption struggle in a timely fashion. 
  Yesterday's closing session was attended by a number of 
provincial party, government, and military leaders, including 
Ren Keli, Song Zhaosu, Lin Yinghai, Wu Guangxian [provincial 
military district political commissar], Zheng Zengmao 
[provincial higher people's court president], Song Guochen, 
Zhang Deguang, Zhang Wenbin, Liu Yujie.

  [Text] Yesterday morning, the sound of firecrackers, 
gongs, and drums reverberated in Taihang Shan and red flags and 
floral hoops were flapping in the breeze along the banks of the 
Zhang He. The unveiling ceremony for "the Monument to the Army 
and the People Working Together in the Technological 
Transformation Project of the Hongqu Canal" and its opening to 
navigation ceremony was solemnly held at the top of the canal in 
Pingshun County, Shanxi. Persons in charge of the joint 
committee of the State Planning Commission and the Leading 
Groups for the Economic Development of Impoverished Areas of the 
State Council and the Jinan Military Region, representatives of 
the troops assisting with the project and relevant departments 
directly under the provincial government, leading cadres of 
Anyang and Linzhou Cities, and cadres representing Changzhi City 
and Pingshun County, Shanxi attended the ceremonies. 
  On 15 March of this year, construction on the 11 km 
technological transformation project of the main canal started. 
Some 1,600 officers and men of the 54776 and 54639 troops under 
the command of the Jinan Military Region and more than 10,000 
militia men and workers from Lizhou took part in the project. 
They worked together in unity, raced against time to accelerate 
the tempo of construction with a indomitable spirit, and 
completed the construction task 15 days ahead of schedule with 
good quality. Thus a magnificent chapter of the Army cherishing 
the people, the people supporting the Army, and the Army and the 
people working together in river harnessing was added to the 
annals of the Hongqu Canal. While assisting in the 
construction, Army officers and soldiers, the people of Pingshun 
County, Shanxi, militiamen and workers of Linzhou [words 
indistinct] and forged a profound friendship. After completing 
their mission, being reluctant to part, the people of Pingshun 
County and Linzhou said farewell to the officers and soldiers 
returning to their posts. 
  At the ceremonies, leaders of Lizhou city and Pingshun 
County 
delivered ebullient speeches. Entrusted by the Jinan Military 
Region and on behalf of the officers and men of the provincial 
military command and troops stationed in Henan, Major General 
Wang Yingzhou spoke, thanking Premier Li Peng and other leading 
comrades for showing concern for army building and the people of 
Linzhou for showing profound love for the Army made of the sons 
of the people. Wang Yingzhou said: The inscriptions written by 
Premier Li Peng and other leading cadres are the remarkable 
generalization of the wishes of the broad ranks of officers and 
men, the highest awards to the project assisting troops, and the 
encouragement of the work of supporting the government and 
cherishing the people. We must strive to do more with better 
results in serving the overall interests of the states and 
actively participating in and assisting local economic 
construction. 
  On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, 
Ma Xianzhang, Standing Committee member and director of the 
organization department of the provincial party committee, made 
a speech, expressing his thanks to the officers and men of the 
troops assisting the project and the people of Pingshun County, 
Shanxi. He hoped that with the pioneering and indomitable 
spirit and the spirit of the Army and the people working 
together, which were currently displayed in the technological 
transformation project of the Hongqu Canal, Linzhou would speed 
up the pace of economic construction and play a vanguard role on 
provincial wide scale, and at the same time, unfold a vigorous 
mass campaign to learn from the People's Liberation Army, and 
create a new situation in the double-support work. 
  Ma Xianzhang, Wang Yingzhou, Yang Gui, and other comrades 
unveiled the monument. On the marble of the monument was 
engraved State Council Premier Li Peng's inscription reading 
"the Army and the people share deep love, the Hongqu Canal flows 
endlessly" and State Councillor Chen Junsheng's inscription 
reading "the monument to the Army and the people working 
together in the technological transformation project of the 
Hongqu Canal" and the inscription of Li Changchun, secretary of 
the Henan Provincial CPC Committee, which reads "the Hongqu 
Canal is full of the tender sentiments of the Army and the 
people." After unveiling the monument, provincial and city 
leaders and leaders of Pingshun County, Shanxi together opened 
the sluice gate of the canal. [words indistinct]

  [Text] Guiyang, April 13 (XINHUA) -- An "aid-the-poor" 
campaign is off to a good start in southwest China's Guizhou 
Province. 
  In Guizhou there are more than 10 million people living 
below 
the poverty line, one-eighth of the country's total of such 
people. 
  This month the first batch of over 410,000 donated items, 
worth four million yuan, have been sent to two poverty-stricken 
areas with an annual per capita income below 200 yuan and over 
three million people living in dire poverty. 
  Minority nationalities, including the Miao, Bouyi and Yao, 
account for over 90 percent of the population in the mountainous 
areas of Guizhou. 
  The drive is being headed by Governor Chen Shineng and 
Secretary of the Provincial Communist Party Committee Liu 
Fangren. 
  According to a local official, individuals and more than 100 
enterprises based in cities in Guizhou have contributed money or 
articles to the poor.

<F P=106> [Report by Gong Dulun (7895 6236 4858), chief procurator of </F>
the Sichuan Provincial People's Procuratorate to the Second 
Session of the Eighth Sichuan Provincial People's Congress, 22 
January 1994: "Work Report of the Sichuan Provincial People's 
Procuratorate"] 
  [Text] Fellow Deputies, 
  Since the First Session of the Eighth Sichuan Provincial 
People's Congress, the procuratorates at all levels throughout 
the province, under the leadership of the CPC Sichuan Provincial 
Committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and under the 
supervision of the provincial people's congress and its standing 
committee, have seriously implemented the spirit of the 14th CPC 
National Congress and the directives of the central authorities 
on combatting corruption. They have firmly implemented the law, 
firmly handled cases, strengthened their various legal 
supervisory functions, investigated and dealt with large and 
serious cases of graft and bribery, struck at the various types 
of criminal activities, and made obvious achievements. In 
promoting the building of clean government in our province and 
the building of socialist democracy and the legal system, and in 
guaranteeing the smooth development of our province's reform and 
opening up and economic construction, they have made positive 
contributions. 
<H5>  I. Placing Stress on the Investigation and Handling of </H5>
Major and Serious Cases, While Continuing To Strike Firmly at 
the Various Types of Criminal Activity 
  A. Taking the investigation and handling of large and 
serious cases as the focal point and deeply developing the 
struggle to combat criminal activities involving bribery and 
corruption. Investigating and handling bribery and 
corruption and other such economic crimes is a major function of 
procuratorial organs. Since last year, the procuratorates at 
all levels throughout the province have strengthened their 
investigation and handling of large and serious cases. 
Particularly in August last year, after the central authorities 
issued the directive on further grasping the struggle against 
corruption properly and realizing first-stage achievements 
within a year, we made emergency mobilization arrangements in 
the procuratorial organs throughout the province. We also 
adopted a series of measures such as implementing chief 
procurator responsibility systems for the handling of cases and 
the measure whereby grass-roots level organs grasped the 
investigation and handling of large and serious cases after the 
provincial and city procuratorates have decided on the division 
of the cases. Unified command and coordination have also been 
strengthened. We have done well in internal mobilization and 
the procuratorate heads at the provincial, city, and county 
levels have sent circulars to the leading cadres within the 
party at their respective levels, details of the situation in 
the struggle against graft and bribery. The "100 Day Anti-Graft 
and Pro-Clean Government Publicity Activities" were carried out 
throughout the province and the procuratorate report center 
telephone numbers at all levels were again publicized to 
encourage the people to make reports. We have stressed policies 
and tactics and handled cases in a firm, cautious, and correct 
way, to guarantee the healthy development of the struggle 
against graft and bribery. By the end of last year, the 
procuratorates throughout the province had jointly received 
20,446 reports of graft, bribery, and other economic crimes, 
59.9 percent up on 1992. A total of 4,472 cases of graft, 
bribery, and embezzlement of public funds were filed and 
investigated. Of these, 2,445 major cases, or 54.7 percent of 
the total, involved amounts in excess of 10,000 yuan, an 
increase of 43.8 percent over 1992. Sixty-nine serious cases 
involving cadres at the county and office level were 
investigated and handled (including two cadres at the department 
level), a 27.7 percent increase on 1992. Of the major cases 
investigated and handled, 280 involved 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, a 
76.1 percent over 1992; 233 involved 100,000 to 500,000 yuan, an 
increase of 1.5 times; 27 involved 500,000 to 1 million yuan, an 
increase of 92.8 percent; and 23 cases involved amounts in 
excess of 1 million yuan, an increase of 10.5 times. Through 
handling these cases, over 150 million yuan of state and 
collective economic losses were recovered. Under the influence 
of laws and policies, 100 criminals gave themselves up. The 
general situation of cases in the various sectors handled by the 
various levels of procuratorate throughout the province were as 
follows: 
  1. Criminal cases were filed and investigated against a 
total of 631 personnel from party and government organs. This 
was 12 percent of the total number of persons involved in the 
cases registered, a growth of 16.8 percent over 1992. Over the 
period from September 1992 to April 1993, Gao Wancheng [7559 
8001 2052], a government inspector and Liu Jiehui [0491 2638 
6540] the city financial bureau director, both of Hechuan City, 
improperly lent out more than 23.4 million yuan in funds. They 
extorted 740,000 yuan as "service charges," of which over 
400,000 yuan was shared between them and over 300,000 yuan was 
used for offering bribes. Liu Jiehui also engaged in real 
estate business through companies under the financial bureau 
and, together with others, accepted bribes of 270,000 yuan. Two 
deputy bureau directors from this bureau, together with the head 
and deputy head of the bureau's rural finance section, embezzled 
over 220,000 yuan in public funds. During the investigation of 
this case, other cases were also successively investigated, 
including the one where Lai Zhaofen [6351 0340 5358], the head 
of the comprehensive department under the Chongqing City 
Financial Bureau and Xu Yijian [6079 0110 6432], the deputy head 
of the central district financial bureau of this City, had 
received bribes; as well as cases whereby the managers of the 
securities companies under seven district and county financial 
administrations had engaged in graft, received bribes, and 
improperly used public funds. The funds involved in these 
crimes totalled 1.8 million yuan and a total of 28 major cases 
involving amounts in excess of 10,000 yuan were pursued against 
36 people. Of these, six were county- or office-level cadres. 
Shi Renfu [4258 0088 1381], the deputy head of the student 
enrolment office of Luzhou City had, since 1989, made use of his 
position and on pretexts such as helping examinees to contact 
tertiary institutions and gain entry and arranging study 
opportunities, he successively extorted 323,000 yuan from 415 
examinees and their parents in six counties and districts. He 
also held a further 321,000 yuan of unexplained origin. After 
the procuratorial organs filed a case, completed investigations, 
and brought charges, the Luzhou City Intermediate Court tried 
the case and sentenced Shi to death. 
  2. Graft, bribery, and other economic crime cases were 
filed and investigated in respect of 61 justice administration 
personnel, an increase of 84.4 percent compared to 1992. Wang 
Xingbin [3769 5281 2430] of the People's Armed Police under the 
Fengjie County Public Security Bureau, collaborated with other 
people in using measures such as falsely recorded expenditure 
and fraudulent checks to illegally obtain 208,000 yuan. He has 
already been tried and sentenced to death by the Wanxian City 
Intermediate Court. The cases investigated and handled also 
include: One wherein an assistant procurator, Zhang Weilin 
[1728 4850 2651] of the Qingyang District Procuratorate in 
Chengdu City, accepted 130,000 yuan in bribes while handling 
cases; another in which Guo Xuegang [7559 1331 0474], the deputy 
president of the Yuqi Court under the Zizhong County Court, 
extorted and accepted bribes; and a case wherein Zhong Zhengping 
[6988 2973 1627], a lawyer from the Luzhou Lawyers Office, while 
handling a case, embezzled 10,000 yuan of recovered funds from 
an enterprise. 
  3. Criminal cases were filed and investigated in respect of 
115 administrative and law enforcement personnel. From 1990 to 
January 1993, Shuai Xinglong [1596 5281 7127] secretary of the 
party group and Li Tingjun [2621 1656 0971], the deputy bureau 
head, both of the Santai County State Land Administration 
Bureau, used their positions and, through the printing of 
land-use certificates, the examination and approval of land 
requisition, the payment of wages to temporary workers, the 
purchase of goods, the holding of meetings, and so on, they 
raised prices and submitted false expense claims, thereby 
corruptly obtaining 160,000 yuan through bribes and the 
embezzlement of public funds. In December 1992, Tang Xinguo 
[0781 2450 0948], the deputy bureau head of the technology 
supervision bureau of Chenghua District, Chengdu City, together 
with Zhao Yong [6392 0516], the head of the investigation team 
of this bureau, while investigating and handling cases involving 
fake and low-quality products being handled by individual 
operators, sold off the illicit goods and divided the 20,000 
yuan obtained between themselves. Liu Guangquan [0491 0342 
2938], the head of the commercial inspection bureau in Neijiang 
City, used the convenience of his office to embezzle 22,000 yuan 
and accepted 7,000 yuan in bribes. 
  4. Close to 400 cases of graft, bribery and other economic 
crimes were filed and investigated within the banking system. 
Those who received bribes generally used their privileged 
positions to lend out state funds as interbank loans and to 
issue credit in violation of regulations. This greatly 
disturbed the state's normal financial order and resulted in it 
being impossible to recover a great amount of the funds. In 
September last year, the Chengdu City Procuratorate investigated 
and handled a case in which five section-level cadres of the 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of Sichuan Province used their 
positions and colluded with other people. Under the pretext of 
interbank lending, they used the credit for personal gain and 
the individuals received "benefits payments" from this. Thereby, 
they lined their own pockets with public funds. Zhong Nianlin 
[6988 1819 2651], the deputy section head of the commercial 
credit section of this branch received 144,000 yuan in bribes. 
Tang Anwei [0781 1344 0251], the deputy head of the planning 
section received 60,000 yuan in bribes. Zhou Xin [0719 2946], 
manager of the Industrial Bank Company under this branch, 
received 150,000 yuan in bribes. Ran Longlin [0373 7127 2651], 
the deputy head and others, a total of three people from the 
Bishan County Construction Bank, while issuing credit, used the 
pretext of "consultancy fees" and demanded bribes from those 
obtaining credit. The bribes totalled 220,000 yuan. Xu Yuelin 
[1776 1471 2651], a business operator in the securities business 
section in the Jiangbei District Branch Office of the 
Agricultural Bank, received 310,000 yuan in bribes through the 
issuing of credit. Yi Bingqian [2496 4426 6692], a worker in 
the Chongqing City Branch of the Communications Bank, colluded 
with financial personnel in an enterprise and changed the 
enterprise's 24 million yuan savings account into a trust 
account. Thereby, from the interest differential, they 
criminally obtained 700,000 yuan, of which Yi Bingqian received 
400,000 yuan. The illegally obtained booty has all been 
recovered. The Chongqing City Intermediate Court has already 
sentenced him to death, suspended for two years. From June 1992 
to April 1993 Zhang Gefei [1728 2706 7236], a teller at the 
Central District Insurance Office in Leshan City, embezzled 
679,000 yuan. He fled after the offence but was subsequently 
apprehended. On 27 September, the Leshan City Intermediate Court 
tried Zhang and sentenced him to death. The head and deputy 
head of the accounting and finance section who bore major 
responsibility in this case were sentenced to prison terms for 
dereliction of duty. 
  5. A number of major cases were also discovered in some 
enterprises. Hu Changxian [5170 2490 0341], the chief engineer 
(deputy office head level) of the Chongqing Special Steel 
(Group) Company took advantage of his position in wholesaling 
steel products to accept bribes of 50,000 yuan. The courts have 
sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment. Su Yuxiang [5685 3254 
3276], of the Yonghong Real Estate Development Company of 
Mianyang City, and Chen Qiuju [7115 4428 5468], the deputy 
general manager and cash handler from the same company, while 
engaged in real estate business in Hainan in April last year, 
embezzled 1.08 million yuan and absconded with the money. The 
procuratorial organs, after receiving the case, immediately 
organized the pursuit and apprehension of these persons and 
recovered all the booty. On 14 September, the Intermediate 
Court of Mianyang City sentenced Su Yuxiang to death and also 
sentenced Chen Qiuju to death, with the sentence suspended for 
two years. Qu Kaijun [4234 7030 6511], the Hailande Commercial 
and Trade Department manager and Qin Gesheng [6009 7245 0524], 
the business manager of the overseas enterprise branch of the 
Chongqing International Company, embezzled 690,000 yuan. The 
court tried them and sentenced the two criminals to death, with 
the sentence suspended for 2 years. 
  6. Over the year, 338 cases of tax evasion and tax 
avoidance were filed, investigated, and handled. Of these, 20 
were major ones involving over 100,000 yuan, a 66.7 percent 
increase over 1992. Two cases involved amounts over 1 million 
yuan. The crime of defrauding the state of export drawbacks is 
a new one which has appeared in recent years subsequent to the 
reform of the taxation and foreign trade structures. Since 
1992, throughout the province, nine such major cases have been 
detected involving a total of 20 million yuan. In March and 
April last year, Dai Fuquan [0108 1381 0356] and He Kai [0149 
0418], both working in the Kaijiang Branch Office of the 
Zhongjiang County Industrial and Commercial Bureau, as well as 
Lin Xinquan [2651 0207 0356], an official from the county 
taxation bureau, improperly used operating licenses, tax 
registration certificates, fictitious factories, fake receipts 
and fake tax completion certificates to faudulently obtain 1.94 
million yuan in state export drawbacks. Tan Qikun [6223 0366 
0981], the head of the office of the Deyang City Taxation 
Bureau, Li Biyou [2621 4310 0645], the deputy head of the Deyang 
City Demobilized Military Cadres School, and Li Fumin, [2621 
4395 3446], a purchaser for the Shoufeng Township Supply and 
Marketing Cooperative in the city's central district, colluded 
with each other to obtain by deception 1.84 million yuan in 
state export drawbacks. 
  A total of 181 cases of fake trademarks were filed, 
investigated, and handled, an increase of 33 percent over 1992. 
Of these, seven cases involved over 1 million yuan in illicit 
funds. In October last year, on the basis of reports by the 
masses, the Yibin Branch Procuratorate investigated and dealt 
with a case involving a conspiracy by the managers of the Dalian 
Glass Factory and the Beijing Xiangxue Seafood Products Factory 
whereby they illegally produced 300,000 fake crystal bottles for 
Wuliangye wine. The Chongqing City procuratorial organs also 
apprehended six illegal producers of, and dealers in, imitation 
brand-name cigarettes, seizing over 3,000 cartons and over 
240,000 counterfeit brand labels. They detained 19 people 
involved in these illegal activities. Wang Tianfu [3769 1131 
4395], the manager of the Jiangjin Branch of the Bank of China, 
and others, used bank funds to assemble 226 fake Chongqing 
Jialing motorcycles, the illicit amount totaling 1.4 million 
yuan. The Shifang County Procuratorate investigated and 
arrested Liu Bangyun [0491 1620 0061], an employee of the 
Fangting Grain Station under the county grain bureau who, in 
collusion with the unemployed Huang Kaihong [7806 7030 3163], 
leased a disued wine cellar and used industrial alcohol to 
manufacture fake wine which they sold. This resulted in 13 
persons suffering severe alcohol poisoning after drinking the 
wine. Four of those persons died and seven lost the sight or 
most of the sight in both eyes. The Deyang City Intermediate 
Court tried them for the crime of selling poisonous and harmful 
foodstuffs and both Liu Bangyun and Huang Kaihong were sentenced 
to death. 
  The successes achieved in fighting graft and bribery were 
mainly realized following the increased attention given by the 
party and the people after the issuing in August of a party 
central committee directive on further properly grasping the 
struggle against corruption. Party committees at various levels 
gave attention to and strengthened leadership over the 
investigation and handling of major and serious cases. The 
broad masses warmly supported and actively participated in 
making reports against criminals, while the province's 
procuratorial personnel impartially implemented the law, did 
everything they could, and went all out in their work. This 
provided a clear contrast with the first half of the year when 
reports from the people declined, as did the number of cases 
filed. We need to draw experiences and lessons from this and 
carry forward the struggle against corruption in a deep-going 
and sustained way. We cannot allow laxity at any time. 
  B. Actively developing the struggle to firmly strike 
at and seriously punish crime. Last year, the province's 
procuratorate actively coordinated with the public security 
organs and the courts and, in a planned and focused way, 
launched various specific struggles provincewide to "oppose 
theft," "strike at robbery," surround and annihilate "road and 
railway criminals," strike at the abduction of women, prohibit 
prostitution, eliminate the "six evils," and so on. After 
August in particular, with the unified deployment and leadership 
of the provincial party committee, the procuratorial organs 
actively participated in the unified provincewide struggle to 
rigorously strike at crime. As a result, there was a great 
increase in approvals for arrests and prosecutions. Over the 
year, requests were submitted by public security organs for 
approval to arrest 62,072 persons. Of these, 57,537 requests 
have been dealt with and the arrest of 53,317 persons was 
approved. This was an increase of 40.2 percent over 1992. 
Requests for transfer to prosecution and exemption of 
prosecution for 56,250 persons were received from the public 
security organs. Of these, 50,483 have already been handled and 
48,183 persons have had public prosecutions initiated against 
them. This was 15.3 percent up on the 1992 figure. 
  During the struggle to rigorously strike at crime, the 
procuratorates at all levels throughout the province took as 
their striking focus crimes such as murder, robbery, rape, 
hoodlumism, the abduction and sale of women and children, crimes 
involving serious violence, and gang crimes. Priority 
deployment of forces was made against vicious crimes which had 
major influence and presented a great danger to society. In 
such cases, there was advance intervention, firm handling, and 
timely examination of arrest applications and the examination of 
prosecution applications. The number of persons for whom 
arrests for serious crimes were approved was 16,104, or 30.2 
percent of the total number of persons arrested. At Spring 
Festival last year, there was a very major case of robbery and 
murder in Chengdu City. The criminal brothers Zhou Qiang [0719 
1730] and Zhou Tong [0719 1749], using the sound of the Spring 
Festival firecrackers as cover on two occasions, armed with 
guns, they entered houses and robbed and killed people. They 
killed six people and stole 600,000 yuan in property. The 
procuratorate organs engaged in advanced intervention and 
twodays after the public security organs had requested 
permission to arrest them, the permission was granted. Within 
four days of the transfer prosecution application, the 
prosecution was being pursued in court and, as a result, the 
criminals were firmly punished in a timely way. On 4 May last 
year, the Fengshan Cultural Troupe from Dianjiang County 
performed at Gaofengzhen in that county. Hong Kang [3163 1660], 
Chen Jiankang [7115 0256 1660], Chen Tao [7115 3447] and others, 
a total of six people from the county, did not buy tickets but 
forced their way into the theater, rushed onto the stage, and 
assaulted a male performer. After the performance was over, 
they also subjected the performers to indignities and seized and 
raped three female performers. This had an extremely odious 
effect and the cultural troupe was forced to disband. After the 
public security organs had investigated this case, the county 
procuratorate sent personnel to provide advance intervention and 
the arrest permission was swiftly given. On 13 October, the 
Fuling District Intermediate Court sentenced Hong Kang, Chen 
Jiankang, and Chen Tao to death for rape and hoodlumism, while 
the other three criminals were sentenced to prison terms ranging 
from eight to 12 years. The masses were extremely pleased by 
this. 
  C. Seriously investigating criminal cases involving 
violation of citizens' democratic rights and crimes of 
dereliction of duty. Over the year, 897 criminal cases 
involving violation of rights and crimes of dereliction of duty 
were filed and investigated. Of these, 104 were major cases and 
and 53 were extremely serious cases, representing increases of 
33.3 percent and 29.2 percent respectively on 1992. In April 
last year, Bai Tianliang [4101 1131 0081], deputy secretary of 
the Daqi District CPC Committee in Youyang County, together with 
the deputy district head Peng Defu [1756 1795 1381] and Li 
Maohong [2621 5399 4767], the acting party secretary of the 
Daxiang Township CPC Committee, engaged in the arbitrary 
collection of charges and the levying of fines. If the masses 
did not obey, these officials adopted various modes of 
punishment, including public parading in the streets, forcing 
people to kneel for long periods, forcing people to stand for 
long periods, and binding and beating people. They also took 21 
peasants into custody illegally. The reaction of the local 
masses was extremely intense. With the support of the county 
party committee, the county procuratorate filed and investigated 
charges of illegal detention against Bai Tianliang and the 
others. In another case, the Hanyuan County Procuratorate 
investigated the extremely serious 12 July fire and found that 
it was an incident involving criminal culpability. The 
procuratorate filed and investigated a case against the person 
who caused the conflagration, the petrol station supervisor Gao 
Jun [7559 6511]. From this case it was discovered that Li 
Keping [2621 0344 1627], the deputy section head of the planning 
section of the county branch of the People's Bank of China had 
received bribes. In August 1993, the Sichuan Meishu Publishing 
House published the Taiwan children's comic book "An Abrupt Turn 
in Thinking." In this book, two pictures and associated texts 
seriously harmed the feelings of Muslim people, leading to 
demonstrations and sit-down protests by tens of thousands of 
people in several provinces, and the seeking of audiences with 
higher officials to lay complaints. This had serious political 
effects and harmed social stability. After the provincial 
procuratorate received the matter, it swiftly filed cases and 
commenced investigations against Li Kanglin [2621 1660 2651], 
the deputy head of the provincial Meishu Publishing House and 
others, a total of three people who had been negligent in their 
duties. The procuratorate also collected together copies of "An 
Abrupt Turn in Thinking" and burned them, to guard against the 
incident from expanding further and to bring stability back to 
social order. In other cases, 57 justice administration 
personnel were investigated for the crimes of self-serving 
misconduct, extorting confessions through torture, and illegal 
detention. Zhou Zhaofu [0719 2507 1381], a judge in the Ziyang 
City Court, while hearing a case of robbery, absolved the 
offender from guilt. On many other occasions while handling 
cases, Zhou used his position to extort bribes and he thereby 
received a total of 18,000 yuan. The procuratorial organs filed 
a case charging him with self-serving misconduct and carried out 
an investigation. 
<H5>  II. Strengthening the Consciousness of Supervision, </H5>
Strengthening Supervision of Law Enforcement 
  Since the beginning of last year, the procuratorates at all 
levels throughout the province have seriously implemented the 
spirit of the 14th Party Congress and the First Session of the 
Eighth NPC, have firmly implemented law supervision 
responsibilities, and have realized new advances in various 
aspects of law supervision work. 
  The strengthening of supervision over investigation has 
mainly involved the supervision and prevention of mistakes and 
leaks in investigative activities through the examination of the 
arrest approval and prosecution approval functions. Last year, 
the procuratorates at various levels throughout the province 
decided not to allow the arrest of 4,343 persons whose arrest 
was unnecessary or against whom a case could not be built. They 
also made decisions in accordance with the law, not to allow the 
prosecution of 206 persons who should not have had criminal 
responsibility assigned to them. During investigations, they 
also pursued and captured in a timely way, 540 criminal elements 
who had slipped through the net and prosecuted 355 persons. In 
respect of illegal activities which occurred during 
investigation activities by the public security organs, they put 
forward 331 ideas on redressing the problems. In strengthening 
supervision over the administration of justice, the various 
levels of procuratorate have, in response to illegal activities 
which have occurred during trials in the people's courts, put 
forward 64 suggestions on redressing the problems. In 
investigating the 112 appeals which held that court decisions 
and rulings were erroneous, courts have heard 28 of these 
appeals and in 17 cases the decisions or rulings were changed. 
There has also been strengthening of supervision over prisons 
and detention centers and over enforcement. Last year, in 
response to some prisons and detention centers not firmly 
enforcing the law, taking money to offset punishment, and 
arbitrarily levying charges, a special investigation was carried 
out. The problems noted in the investigation report attracted 
great attention from the provincial people's congress and the 
NPC Standing Committee. This led to the judicial organs 
rectifying the unhealthy trend in levying charges. Supervision 
over the implementation of reduced sentences, release on parole, 
and release from custody to obtain medical treatment was 
strengthened, while improprieties were swiftly discovered and 
redressed. When crimes were discovered they were swiftly 
investigated and dealt with. Zheng Wanming [6774 8001 2494], 
head of the Mianzhu County Detention Center, by illegally 
arranging for 27 criminals to be released for medical treatment, 
extorted over 14,000 yuan cash and a pair of gold earrings from 
the family members of the criminals. He also privately released 
two offenders. Zhang Wanming has already been tried and 
sentenced to 9 years imprisonment. Over the year, through 
examination of prisons and detention centers, a total of 33 
cases were filed and investigated against 38 prison and 
detention center staff for crimes such as graft, bribery, 
corporal punishment, cruel treatment, and the private release of 
prisoners. At the same time, the procuratorates conducted 
activities by which they struck at those personnel who committed 
crimes while engaged in administering reform through labor and 
education through labor. Over the year, the arrest of 61 
persons was approved and public prosecutions were initiated 
against 916 persons. This safeguarded order during the 
transformation of prisons and detention centers. The 
examination of complaints and petitions was strengthened and 
there was reexamination of cases against which petitions were 
lodged. In this way, if there were cases they were examined and 
if there had been mistakes they were redressed. Over the year, 
585 cases were filed for the examination and handling of 
petitions which came under the jurisdiction of the procuratorial 
organs. Through investigation, 226 verdicts were sustained, 73 
were corrected, it was suggested that the courts reexamine 10 
cases, and one application was rejected. By handling these 
cases, the supervisory restraints within the procuratorial 
organs were strengthened and the solemnity of the law was 
maintained. 
  In order to raise the quality of work in receiving the 
masses, the procuratorates throughout the province developed 
reception activities in a civilized way. Fifty-three civilized 
units were recognized and it was decided to confer the title 
"Civilized Reception Hall" on 32 reception halls. Of these 
reception halls, those of the Chengdu City Procuratorate and the 
Bazhong City Procuratorate have been awarded the title 
"Civilized Reception Hall" by the Supreme People's 
Procuratorate. Civil and administrative inspection was also 
strengthened. Protests were lodged in accordance with the law 
against civil and administrative decisions and orders which had 
been put into effect but which were obviously erroneous. We 
upheld the policy of "positive, earnest, and stable" actions. 
With one hand, we grasped basic work while, with the other we 
grasped the handling of cases and thereby developed supervision 
through the handling of cases. Throughout the year, 1,258 
petitions against civil and administrative decisions and orders 
made by courts, and which had already been put into effect, were 
accepted. Of these, the handling of over 1,038 has already been 
completed and in 371 instances, cases were filed. In 75 of 
these, it was suggested that the court redress the matter, while 
in 18 cases appeals were filed in court. By the end of the 
year, three judgements had been revised and the legitimate 
rights and interests of the party's concerned had been 
maintained. 
  Strengthening railway supervision work. In the 
struggle to combat graft and bribery, the Chengdu Railway Bureau 
Branch Procuratorate and the procuratorates at the six branch 
railway bureaus, centering around the rectification of railway 
practices and with the work focus placed on investigating the 
use of railcars and tickets for private gain, put all their 
efforts into investigating and handling large and serious cases. 
Over the year, they filed and investigated 70 cases relating to 
graft, bribery, and other economic crimes. Of these, 29, or 
41.4 percent of the total, were large or serious cases. An 
amount in excess of 1.31 million yuan in economic losses was 
recovered for the state. In the struggle to "seriously strike" 
at such crimes, the railway procuratorates at both levels 
actively participated in various specific struggles and 
improvements. The focus was placed on striking at a group of 
"railroad robbers," to safeguard railroad order. Throughout the 
year, the arrest of 1206 criminals was approved and public 
prosecutions were launched against 1103 persons. 
<H5>  III. Opposing Corruption, Promoting Clean Government, and </H5>
Doing Well in Building a Procuratorial Contingent 
  From the beginning of last year, under the new situation of 
establishing a socialist market economy structure, the 
procuratorates at various levels throughout the province 
strengthened ideological and political work. They earnestly 
arranged for the police to study the spirit of the documents of 
the 14th Party Congress and the First Session of the Eighth NPC 
and of a series of speeches by General Secretary Jiang. They 
used Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics to unify understanding. They educated 
the police in strictly implementing the law, in observing 
discipline, in opposing corruption, in promoting clean 
government, and in rectifying the irregular practices within the 
procuratorates. In a situation where the tasks are onerous and 
the conditions arduous, the procuratorial police throughout the 
province maintained high morale, devoted themselves to the 
service of the public, struggled hard, carried out their duties 
tenaciously, and manifested the characteristics of procuratorial 
police. 
  In accordance with the central directives and provincial 
committee's deployments, we strengthened our own work of 
opposing corruption and promoting clean government. In response 
to problems existing in our ranks whereby the law is enforced 
insufficiently rigorously, where violations of the law are not 
investigated, where there are instances of exceeding authority 
in the investigation of cases and of arbitrary levying of 
charges, in July and August procuratorial organs throughout the 
province carried out education and a readjustment in respect of 
strictly implementing the law. Since September, the leading 
cadres at and above the county and office levels have carried 
out a clean government self-discipline inspection and, at the 
same time, further rectified unhealthy trends within their own 
systems. 1. The procuratorial organs throughout the province 
ferreted out 180,000 yuan in arbitrarily levied "prosecution and 
examination exemption fees," "nonarrest and nonprosecution 
education fees" and so on, returning the money to those who had 
originally paid such fees. They investigated the "bail by which 
one obtains a guarantor and awaits trial out of custody," which 
was being levied by departments and, in July, in accordance with 
a directive from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, stopped the 
levying of this bail. 2. Since the beginning of last year, 
procuratorial organs throughout the province have, in accordance 
with relevant stipulations from upper levels, been engaged in 
sorting out 123 companies of various sorts which have been 
established. 3. The provincial procuratorate, in accordance 
with stipulations by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, issued 
timely circulars prohibiting procuratorate staff from 
intervening in economic disputes and from exceeding their powers 
in handling cases. In respect of those few procuratorates and 
procuratorial policemen who intervened in economic disputes and 
exceeded their powers in investigating cases, firm examinations 
and rectifications were carried out. 4. Throughout the 
province, 38 cases were filed and investigated in respect of 
violations of law and discipline by procuratorial policemen and 
in eight cases, criminal charges were laid. In opposing 
corruption and promoting clean government, in accordance with 
the stipulations of the Supreme People's Procuratorate and in 
the light of reality, two sets of "eight prohibitions" 
disciplinary rules for procuratorial organs and officials were 
formulated and it was required that the procuratorates and their 
staff throughout the province observe and implement these. 
  In looking back at work over the year, the main problems 
which have existed in procuratorial work have been as follows: 
1. In the struggle to combat graft, insufficient stress has 
been placed on investigating and handling large and serious 
cases in key sectors, while in leading the organs in 
investigating and handling there has been the fear of 
difficulty. During the handling of such cases, investigators 
have thus shrunk back and been overly cautious. 2. Supervision 
of problems such as cases which are not investigated, people 
paying fines rather than undergoing imprisonment, and money 
being used to pay off prison terms, has been insufficiently 
strict. Further, phenomena such as enforcement of the law being 
insufficiently rigorous and violations of the law not being 
investigated occurred frequently. 3. Some procuratorates pay 
insufficient attention to policies and tactics during the 
handling of cases, their work is crude and simplistic, and they 
sometimes violate the law in handling cases. 4. Many district 
and county procuratorates are seriously lacking in funds for 
handling cases and their equipment is backward. This has 
seriously hampered the strict enforcement of the law. 
  Fellow deputies: 
  The "CPC Central Committee Decision on Certain Questions 
Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economy 
Structure" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee, pointed out that it is necessary to 
strengthen the building of the legal system and of clean 
government and to firmly and unyieldingly carry out the struggle 
against graft. The central political and law conference pointed 
out that it is necessary, while accelerating the pace of the 
reforms by which we are establishing a socialist market economy 
structure, to safeguard the state's political and social 
stability. In 1994, the tasks of procuratorial work throughout 
the province are as follows: We will uphold guidance by the 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; 
implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th 
CPC Central Committee; firmly uphold the policy of "grasping 
with two hands and ensuring that both hands are tight"; 
strengthen legal supervisory functions; strictly enforce the 
law; vigorously grasp the handling of cases; centralize 
strengths in investigating and handling graft, bribery, and 
other large and serious cases; strike at various types of 
criminal activities; protect the legitimate rights of citizens; 
safeguard political and social stability; create a fine legal 
environment for reforms, opening up, and modernization; and 
guarantee the establishment and development of a socialist 
market economy structure. 
  We must develop the struggle against graft in a deep-going 
and sustained way; centralize our strengths in investigating and 
handling the large and serious cases which occur in party and 
government organs, judicial organs, administrative law 
enforcement departments, and economic management departments; 
and we must investigate and handle crimes involving legal 
personnel engaging in bribery, tax fraud, use of false 
trademarks, and smuggling. It is necessary to strike at serious 
criminal activities in a sustained and unwavering way, to 
actively participate in the various specific struggles and 
improvements in "seriously striking" at such activities, and 
continue to strengthen examination and handling of crimes such 
as "violation of rights" and dereliction of duty. 
  It is necessary to employ the principle of "seriously 
enforcing the law and firmly grasping the handling of cases" in 
handling overall procuratorial work and to strengthen the 
various types of legal supervisory functions. In supervision of 
investigations, we must strengthen supervision over situations 
where cases exist but have not been investigated and where fines 
replace imprisonment. In the supervision of trials, we need to 
improve the level of public prosecutions and increase the 
strength of appeals. In supervising implementation, it is 
necessary to strengthen examination of the way in which cases of 
reduced sentences, parole, and allowing prisoners to remain out 
of custody to receive medical treatment are handled and also to 
investigate cases where persons are held in custody beyond the 
period of their sentence. When the law is broken or perverted 
and a criminal case has been demonstrated, it must be firmly 
investigated and handled. Civil and administrative supervision 
involves appeals in accordance with the law against civil and 
administrative judgements and rulings made by the people's 
courts which are already in effect but which are obviously 
erroneous. It is also necessary to pay full attention to the 
examination and handling of judicial officers who are corrupt or 
who have perverted the law. It is also necessary to do well in 
terms of the dual internal restraints and in guaranteeing the 
quality of cases. We must continue to do well in the 
self-strengthening of the procuratorial contingent and raise the 
political quality and law enforcement level of the enforcement 
personnel. They should seriously study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, more strongly uphold 
the party's basic principles, uphold the idea of "grasping both 
types of work simultaneously," and uphold the firmness and 
consciousness of the struggle against graft. It is necessary to 
do well in the ideological construction of procuratorate leading 
groups at all levels, to increase their cohesiveness and their 
fighting strength. It is necessary to continue to carry out 
education in opposing graft and promoting clean government and 
to correct the various unhealthy trends. It is necessary to 
continue to perfect the target responsibility systems and 
case-handling responsibility systems and we must actively 
explore measures for reforming the procuratorial cadre personnel 
system to encourage the procuratorial police to exert themselves 
and be zealous in their work. We must also continue to do well 
in professional training and raise the level of law enforcement. 
We must build procuratorates in accordance with the law, carry 
out examinations strictly, implement the law firmly, and 
establish strict discipline. 
  We must consciously and actively accept supervision by the 
people's congresses and their standing committees and handle 
matters strictly in accordance with the law. At set intervals 
we must, in accordance with the law, report on our work to the 
people's congresses and their standing committees and fully 
respect their deliberations and opinions. We must warmly accept 
examination of law enforcement work by the people's congress 
standing committees and handle those cases handed over by 
people's congresses. We must actively and responsibly deal with 
proposals, suggestions, criticisms, and ideas put forward by 
people's congress representatives. It is necessary to 
strengthen links with local people's congress representatives 
and open-mindedly listen to their suggestions, criticisms, and 
ideas on our work, so that we can continually improve 
procuratorial work.

  [Text] [Correspondent] In 1994, financial organs in Tibet 
will gradually bring their operations in line with national 
practices and make strategic preparations for financial reform. 
Based on the principle of vigorously promoting sustained, rapid, 
and healthy development of Tibet's economy, financial 
departments in Tibet will give full play to their role in 
overall financial regulation and control and in optimizing the 
allocation of resources. As for this year's work, they will 
give priority to increasing credits and funds for rural and 
pastoral areas and to offering assistance to poverty-stricken 
areas. 
  [Video shows a person speaking into a microphone and a 
caption saying he is Ouzhu Lanjie (2962 3796 2597 2638), deputy 
director of the People's Bank of China Tibet Branch] 
  [Begin recording] [Ouzhu Lanjie] As far as the entire 
nation is concerned, 1994 is a very important year for the 
reform of the financial system. The general outline for reform 
of the national financial system has been drawn up and reform 
measures will be carried out this year. However, because it is 
different from other regions, Tibet is still at the preparatory 
stage of financial reform. We must carry out these financial 
reform measures to follow the general trend. In coordination 
with reform by financial institutions, we have made some 
important adjustments in Tibet's financial work this year. 
These adjustments will be focused on financial work in rural 
and pastoral areas. Based on the guidelines of the CPC Central 
Committee's Financial Work Conference and Rural Work Conference, 
and the National Financial Work Conference, we have increased 
our investment in farming and animal husbandry sector. Last 
year, we increased credits for farming and animal husbandry 
sector by 16.7 percent over the previous year. This year, on 
the basis of such a high percentage of increase last year, we 
will increase the investment of credits in farming and animal 
husbandry sector by 30 percent over last year. The investment 
of credits in village and town enterprises will be even greater. 
We will increase the credits for village and town enterprises 
by 37 percent from last year. 
  Farming and animal husbandry sector is a very important part 
of Tibet's economy. We should focus our financial work on 
farming and animal husbandry sector and increase credits for 
farming and animal husbandry production in rural and pastoral 
areas. We will extend more loans on easy terms to the farming 
and animal husbandry sector. Moreover, we have made a careful 
and complete plan to help poverty- stricken rural and pastoral 
areas shake off poverty and improve their living standards. We 
arranged a low-interest loan with far more favorable conditions 
than other kinds of loans to help poor areas. At the same time, 
banks and credit cooperatives at all levels will pay special 
attention to assist-the-poor work and make the best use of the 
funds for eliminating poverty. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Video report by unidentified announcer; from the "Regional </F>
News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Housing reform is an important 
component of Tibet's economic restructuring in 1994. It is also 
a major reform of common concern to urban residents and the 
broad masses of staff and workers. 
  Why do we need to conduct housing reform? How do we carry 
out Tibet's housing reform in 1994 and 1995? These are the two 
topics people are most concerned about at the moment. 
  Tibet's current urban housing system is a welfare system 
whereby actual services are distributed in kind in the form of 
low rent with heavy subsidies. According to relevant 
statistics, during the 40 years between 1952 and 1991, Tibet 
invested about 800 million yuan on housing construction projects 
for urban residents. It is assumed people should be very 
satisfied with such great efforts of the government when state 
and local governments have been facing relatively tough 
financial difficulties. In fact, it is not so. There is a very 
large gap when we compare the masses' actual needs. Unfair 
housing conditions are relatively common. The practice of the 
past several decades has shown that not only can the current 
housing system not resolve China's urban housing problems, but 
it has also deadlocked the way to resolve urban housing 
problems. To change the situation and get out of the current 
predicament, we must resolutely conduct housing reform. [video 
shows medium shots of an unidentified middle-aged man in a 
western suit reading a script into a microphone] 
  [Begin recording] The major tasks of reforming Tibet's 
housing system in 1994 and 1995 are as follows: First, we 
should appropriately raise the rent of state housing units. 
Rental reform is a first step in reforming Tibet's housing 
system in 1994, and it is the beginning of Tibet's efforts in 
this regard. 
  Second, we should comprehensively implement a housing 
pension 
fund system. The housing pension fund is a long-term savings 
aimed at resolving housing problems of staff and workers. It is 
a principal means to transform a housing unit under a welfare 
system whereby actual services are distributed in kind in the 
form of low rent into a housing unit maintained by wages. It 
has important significance in strengthening the sense of 
security in the staff and workers by having their own housing 
units and in raising their ability to acquire housing units on 
their own. 
  Third, we should actively carry out the four-pointed tasks 
to 
sell state housing units, including reforming Tibet's housing 
system, and commercializing and socializing housing units. 
Selling state housing units is one of the major reform 
measures, has strong policy tenor, involves many sectors, and is 
complicated. Additionally, Tibet's basic administration over the 
sales of state housing units has been relatively poor, and its 
preparatory work in various aspects has been inadequate. To 
actively and prudently sell state housing units and to ensure a 
smooth progress in related work, we should strictly implement 
four measures in restricted sectors in 1994 and 1995 and will, 
after gaining experience, gradually implement them across Tibet 
in an all-around manner afterward. 
  Fourth, we should gradually establish government unit 
housing 
funds. While conducting housing reform, the state, units, and 
individual workers should jointly make financial contributions. 
How do the state and units get their funds? According to 
relevant state policies, most of the funds must be derived from 
existing housing funds. In other words, existing funds 
currently allocated by the state and units for housing, 
production, operation, and consumption should be reallocated, 
straightened out, gradually lumped together, and used to form 
government unit housing funds. The funds should be 
rationalized, consolidated, specialized, and used only to reform 
urban housing system and to construct housing projects. [end

  [Text] The Diqing military subdistrict has deployed 10,000 
Army officers, soldiers, and militiamen in an emergency disaster 
relief operation, rescuing people and livestock afflicted by the 
greatest snowstorm of the past 40 years, thus effectively 
alleviating the aftermath of the disaster. 
  An extremely strong snowstorm in the Diqing Zang Nationality 
Autonomous Prefecture hit the prefecture in late March. To 
fight the snowstorm, the Diqing military subdistrict promptly 
organized soldiers and militiamen and set up first-aid 
detachments to plunge into an emergency operation. (He 
Zhiguang), commander of the military subdistrict, acted as the 
general commander of the operation. Under his command, fighters 
and militiamen protected with their own bodies the great dam of 
the Chongjiang He hydropower plant in Zhongdian against the 
snow, rescued more than 100 teachers and pupils of the Sanba 
Primary School in Weixi County who were trapped by flooding, and 
made arrangements for pupils to continue their studies. So far 
the soldiers and militiamen in the Diqing military subdistrict 
have rescued more than 1,700 people, took good care of more than 
1,300 people, and saved economic losses worth more than 12 
million yuan.

  [Text] At a time of strictly dealing blows to various 
criminal activities, the security organs across the region 
dedicated two months to waging a special struggle against 
abductors and traffickers of people. Twenty-eight criminal 
gangs were smashed, 110 human traffickers were arrested, and 170 
women who had been abducted and trafficked in were rescued. 
  Over the past years, some lawbreakers ganged up with one 
another to wantonly engage in the criminal activities of 
abducting and trafficking in women and children in order to reap 
staggering profits. The women who had been abducted and 
trafficked in suffered all kinds of humiliation. Some of them 
were even killed or cruelly injured by their buyers when they 
gave a strong resistance. Some of them could not withstand 
humiliation and committed suicide. Xia Lingfeng, who was from 
Yunnan, was sold to Wang Erliang, a villager of Dalumao township 
of Jungar Banner, for 5,000 yuan. Xia managed to run away 
several times. Wang Yingxiang, Wang Erliang's father, took her 
back and broke her legs with a bat. After disclosing this case, 
the Jungar Banner security bureau immediately rescued her and 
duly punished the buyers. 
  Through this struggle, the broad masses of security cadres 
and policemen spared no hardships to conduct investigations 
among each village and each household, persisted in the 
principle of being resolute and steady, rescued all the women 
who asked to be rescued if discovered, and rapidly and sternly 
punished all the abductors and traffickers. An extraordinarily 
powerful criminal gang involving 69 persons with two brothers, 
namely Li Daichun and Li Dailin, as chief culprits, was 
destroyed at a time by the Togtoh County security bureau. The 
Hohhot city security bureau arrested a four-member criminal gang 
with Gan Ming as chief culprit. 
  On 14 January, 52 women, the third group of women saved 
through the special struggle, got on a train back home.

  [Text] Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, recently gathered responsible comrades of the 
agriculture and industry committee of the municipal party 
committee, the municipal agriculture commission, and pertinent 
departments to conscientiously study the guidelines of the 
recent central rural work conference and the important speeches 
of Comrades Jiang Zemin and Li Peng and to conduct investigation 
and study on ways to strengthen Tianjin's agriculture and rural 
work. Gao Dezhan pointed out: Agriculture is the foundation of 
the national economy. As the suburban-type agriculture holds a 
particularly important position in Tianjin's entire economy, we 
should all the more attach great importance to it. We should 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central rural 
work conference and make sure that we truly attach importance to 
agriculture and exert efforts to make agriculture and rural work 
successful. At present, we should concentrate on spring 
plowing, spring sowing, and wheat field management, conquer the 
drought, and strive for a good harvest this year to make 
contributions to Tianjin's reform, development, and stability. 
  During a discussion, Gao Dezhan and the participants 
conscientiously analyzed Tianjin's current development of 
agricultural production and rural economy and studied ways to 
implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference 
rapidly. He said: The rural work conference recently held by 
the party Central Committee was a very important conference. 
Conscientious implementation of the guidelines of the conference 
not only has very important significance in the endeavor to 
achieve success in agriculture and rural work for this year and 
for some time to come, but, in particular, it also has important 
immediate significance in accomplishing the general task of the 
work of the entire party, promoting sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic development, and safeguarding social stability. 
We must conscientiously implement the guidelines of the central 
rural work conference and, proceeding from Tianjin's reality, 
make earnest efforts and adopt effective measures to address the 
existing problems and weak links and promote Tianjin's 
agriculture and rural work with great efforts. 
  Gao Dezhan said: To successfully implement the guidelines of 
the central rural work conference, the municipal party committee 
held a meeting of secretary and deputy secretaries to study and 
arrange this work, which, it decided, will be carried out in two 
stages. In the first stage, beginning immediately, we will 
conduct investigation and study on Tianjin's agricultural 
production and existing problems and concentrate efforts on 
spring plowing. In the second stage, we will hold a municipal 
rural work conference in early April to tackle some fundamental 
problems in line with the guidelines of the central rural work 
conference and Tianjin's reality. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: Tianjin has won great achievements 
in agriculture and rural work over the past few years, but to 
win greater development in the new situation of establishing the 
socialist market economy system more rapidly still requires 
large amounts of painstaking work. We should first solve well 
ideological problems and acquire a new understanding of the 
position of agriculture as the foundation not only of the 
national economy but also of reform, development, and stability. 
Reform and development need a stable social and economic 
environment, which first depends on the stability and 
development of agriculture and rural areas, the ample supplies 
of farm and sideline products, and the basic stability of the 
market. As ours is a suburban-type agriculture, we should all 
the more attach importance to the production of grain, cotton, 
and oil-bearing crops, and we also have the conditions to make a 
success of it. The "vegetable basket" is the key link of the 
suburban-type agriculture. We should strive to raise the 
quality, improve the efficiency, and expand the scale of this 
type of agriculture. Agriculture should be restructured on the 
premise that the production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing 
crops is stabilized. To increase the income of peasants, we 
should rely both on the development of township enterprises and 
diverse production and on the great development of agriculture 
and rural economy. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out: The basic task of Tianjin's 
agriculture and rural work for this year is to conscientiously 
implement the guidelines of the central rural work conference 
and achieve success in 1) ensuring the production and supplies 
of grain, cotton, edible oil, and the "vegetable basket," 2) 
developing the rural economy in all sectors to increase 
peasants' income, 3) strengthening rural spiritual civilization 
and maintaining rural social stability, and 4) further improving 
rural grass-roots organizations. 
  Gao Dezhan emphasized: We should further strengthen party 
leadership over agriculture and rural work. Ideological 
understanding and all work should be in place. When work is not 
in place, we cannot say that we have attached importance to or 
strengthened leadership over agriculture and rural work. We 
should conscientiously institute the system of responsibility 
for work targets and assign tasks and targets to lower levels 
and to every person. Districts and counties engaged in 
agriculture should hold responsibility for the planting areas, 
output, and peasants' income. Success in agriculture is a task 
for the entire society. All trades and professions should 
attach importance to and support agriculture, voluntarily do 
practical work for agricultural development, and serve it well. 
We should send a group of cadres to rural areas as soon as 
possible to help with their work. 
  Gao Dezhan particularly emphasized: As we have entered the 
crucial period for agricultural production, we should seize the 
right farming season and concentrate efforts on stabilizing the 
areas sown with grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops and on 
winter wheat management, spring plowing, and spring sowing. We 
should mobilize the masses to combat drought to plant crops and 
protect seedlings and strive for a bumper harvest of summer 
grain and a bumper harvest for the whole year. The municipal 
party committee and government decided to adopt resolute 
measures in the near future to make sure that rural comrades 
have sufficient time and energy for spring farming. Pertinent 
departments of the municipality should be determined to reduce 
meetings and go down to rural areas to help solve problems. 
Responsible comrades of the districts and counties engaged in 
agriculture should avoid going out of town. They should devote 
more time to rural areas and concentrate on the current spring 
farming. 
  Fang Fengyou, standing committee member of the municipal 
party committee and director of its organization department; and 
Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary general 
of the municipal party committee; participated in the 
investigation and study activities.

<F P=106> [Speech by Sun Weiben, secretary of the Heilongjiang </F>
Provincial CPC Committee, delivered at the third plenary session 
of the provincial discipline inspection commission on 25 March: 
"Subject to and Serve the Overall Interests of the Work of the 
Entire Party and Carry Out the Anticorruption Struggle 
Persistently, Thoroughly, and More Effectively"] 
  [Text] The Central Discipline Inspection Commission held 
its third plenary session to make specific arrangements for this 
year's anticorruption struggle in the new situation in which the 
entire party and entire country were making efforts to 
thoroughly implement the guidelines of the 14th party congress 
and the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
Committee, accelerate establishment of the socialist market 
economy system, and maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development. Comrade Jiang Zemin's important speech 
given at the session realistically assessed the previous 
anticorruption struggle, put forward opinions of the party 
Central Committee on the next stage of the anticorruption 
struggle, and urged the entire party to make unremitting efforts 
to carry on the struggle persistently, thoroughly, and more 
effectively. It represented another important policy decision 
on comprehensively promoting reform, construction, and 
development made by the party Central Committee after taking the 
overall situation into consideration, and it is also the 
concrete embodiment of the party Central Committee's adherence 
to the principle of attending to two tasks simultaneously and 
being competent in both in the new situation. We should 
thoroughly understand and resolutely implement it. 
  Since August last year when the party Central Committee and 
the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, at its second 
plenary session, made important arrangements for the coming 
anticorruption struggle, party committees, governments, and 
discipline inspection and supervision organs at all levels 
across the province have adopted a firm attitude, actively taken 
action, and carried out a great amount of painstaking work. The 
vast number of cadres and the masses have also shown 
wholehearted support and actively participated in the work. 
Thanks to the efforts for over half a year, we have achieved 
good results in the three tasks of the anticorruption struggle 
at varying degrees, some of which are fairly remarkable, and 
checked the development and spreading of negative and corrupt 
phenomena. This has played a positive role in promoting 
Heilongjiang's reform, opening up, and economic construction and 
in safeguarding its political stability. Judging from the 
situation of the entire province, however, development in the 
anticorruption work has been uneven, some results have not been 
consolidated, and our work is still falling rather far behind 
and cannot satisfy the masses when considering the problems that 
actually exist and the expectations of the masses. Thus, the 
tasks for the next stage are still very arduous. This third 
plenary session of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission has made specific arrangements for Heilongjiang's 
anticorruption struggle for this year. Party committees, 
governments, and discipline inspection and supervision organs 
should conscientiously relay the guidelines of this session, 
meticulously organize their implementation, and, after 
consolidating the achievements already won, carry out this 
year's anticorruption struggle persistently, thoroughly, and 
more effectively. I will speak on four issues. 
  1. In-depth development of the anticorruption struggle is an 
important prerequisite for deepening reform, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability, and it should be 
regarded as the major work of the entire party. 
  This year is a crucial year for accelerating establishment 
of 
the socialist market economy system and maintaining sustained, 
rapid, and healthy economic development. Seizing the 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside 
world, promoting development, and maintaining stability meet the 
overall interests of the work of the entire party and entire 
country. Proceeding from the overall interests, the party 
Central Committee recently emphasized repeatedly and prominently 
that, in view of the current very heavy tasks for reform, 
development, and stability, we should continue to take the 
anticorruption struggle as the major work of the entire party. 
Our party and government leading comrades at all levels must 
have a clear and full understanding of this. 
  First, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption is a 
strategic policy decision adopted by the CPC Central Committee 
after making a correct appraisal of the work at the preceding 
stage. Last year, after experiencing the spreading of corrupt 
phenomenon, our party made up its mind to mobilize the whole 
party to launch the anticorruption campaign and set a time limit 
to resolve the problems strongly complained by the masses. 
Through six months' endeavor, it can be said that some results 
have been achieved. However, some measures adopted at that 
stage were merely aimed at bringing about a temporary solution 
to problems. In checking the spreading of the trend of 
corruption, some cardinal problems have not yet been solved and 
some deep-rooted problems have not yet been touched. Viewed 
from the problems already revealed, corrupt phenomenon has now 
infiltrated into most spheres of social life. Worse still, 
corruption has seriously made inroads on our party and 
government organs and on the ranks of cadres. This is a great 
shock to us. Therefore, we must foster the idea of fighting a 
sustained battle and strive to, in line with the strategic 
arrangements of the CPC Central Committee, thoroughly resolve 
problems instead of merely bringing about a temporary solution 
so that we can deepen the anticorruption campaign step-by-step. 
  Second, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption is 
an 
internal demand to deepen reform and accelerate development. 
The endeavor in anticorruption and the endeavor in reform, 
opening up, and economic development promote and complement each 
other. On the one hand, accelerating reform, opening up, and 
economic development will create essential material foundation 
and condition for checking corruption. On the other hand, 
anticorruption constitutes an important guarantee and essential 
measure for promoting reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. Failing to check corruption will not only 
seriously damage the image and authority of the party and the 
government and dampen the initiative of the vast numbers of 
cadres; but will also make the party's organizations and 
discipline listless, hamper the implementation of the party's 
principles and policies concerning reform and opening up, as 
well as the major policy decision concerning economic 
development, and destroy the hard-won achievements in reform and 
construction. In particular, under the current situation that 
old systems are being replaced by new ones and the legal system 
is not perfect enough, some corrupt phenomena will certainly 
arise and interfere with and hamper the smooth progress of 
reform and construction. If we fail in the economy, we will 
come to grief, and if we let corrupt phenomena spread unchecked, 
let embezzlement and bribery run wild, and divorce ourselves 
from the masses, we will also come to grief. It is absolutely 
wrong to set anticorruption against reform, opening up, and 
economic development. The practice of anticorruption at the 
preceding stage shows that anticorruption work did not affect 
reform and opening up but became an important guarantee for 
reform, opening up, and economic development. Therefore, the 
more we carry out reform and opening up, accelerate the 
establishment of the socialist market economic structure, and 
develop the economy, the more we should oppose corruption and 
strengthen the building of party style and the improvement of 
administrative honesty. This is an important experience in 
building the socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  Third, persistently and profoundly opposing corruption 
constitutes an important condition for maintaining political and 
social stability. This year, China will set forth more major 
reform measures than those in any other year. Along with the 
constant deepening of reform and the readjustment of relations 
of interests, many new contradictions and problems will emerge. 
In particular, some enterprises in the province have suffered 
losses for a long time, and considerably more workers and staff 
members have been unable to receive their wages on time. 
Failing to effectively check and punish corruption will sharpen 
contradictions, bring out incidence, and affect unity and 
stability. At the same time, we should clearly notice that at 
present the hostile forces at home and abroad are still waiting 
for opportunities to create confusions and disturbances and are 
trying every possible means to "Westernize" and "split" China. 
If the party itself is unable to resolve the problems 
concerning corruption, it will also provide a handle and a 
condition for the hostile forces to launch an attack on us. For 
this reason, party and government leading comrades at all levels 
must have the sense of worry, always keep sober-minded, launch 
the anticorruption campaign in a sustained and profound manner, 
provide necessary conditions for maintaining social stability, 
and create a fine social and political environment for reform, 
opening up, and economic construction. 
  Fourth, opposing corruption in a deep and sustained manner 
is still strongly expected and required of the cadres and the 
people inside and outside the party. According to the sample 
survey on 5,000 people (households) made by the provincial 
discipline inspection commission and the municipal urban survey 
team, only 53.3 percent of them were satisfied or comparatively 
satisfied with the anticorruption work and 45.4 percent were not 
satisfied. Simultaneously, 57.1 percent of the people maintained 
that some corrosive phenomena were brought under control through 
the previous-stage struggle and that the achievements in 
opposing corruption are not consolidated. The broad masses of 
the cadres and the people earnestly expect that the struggle 
against corruption must be waged neither in the form of 
formalism nor in a perfunctory way. They hope to see real 
results as soon as possible. We must pay high attention to the 
people's opinions and voices. We must firmly foster the mass 
viewpoints of Marxism, enhance the sense of responsibility and 
the sense of urgency, adopt resolute and forceful measures to 
solve the problems that the people have strong complaints, and 
also closely rely on the support of the people to wage the 
anticorruption struggle in a sustained and profound manner. 
  2. Ensuring the realization of the current targets is the 
major task for opposing corruption. We must exert efforts to 
grasp consolidation, deepening, and fruitful achievements. 
  The practice of the previous anticorruption struggle proved: 
To grasp the current-stage targets, we should first start from 
bringing about a temporary solution. Through the special 
struggle, we should concentratively solve some general problems 
of which the people have strong complaints, control the tendency 
that corrosive phenomena spread unchecked, and then gradually 
eliminate the sources and deep- layered problems that cause 
corrosive phenomena. These ideas and methods are accurate and 
effective. The general requirements for the 1994 anticorruption 
work are to comprehensively fulfill the three tasks as defined 
by the central authorities and to make efforts to grasp 
consolidation, deepening, and fruitful achievements. Grasping 
consolidation means that we should thoroughly grasp the work 
that started last year, ensure to see results in the work, and 
avoid going back to where we start. Grasping deepening means 
that the problems that have been sorted out should resolutely be 
corrected and handled, simultaneously we should firmly formulate 
and perfect relevant management systems and preventive measures, 
and gradually solve the sources and deep- layered problems that 
bring about corrosive phenomena. Grasping more fruitful 
achievements means that we should sum up and draw on the 
experiences gained in the previous stage, improve and intensify 
work measures, and make greater achievements. According to the 
work ideologies and the unified arrangements of the central 
authorities, the party committees and governments at various 
levels and the party and government leading comrades should base 
themselves on consolidating and developing the work achievements 
done in the previous year and comprehensively fulfill the 
anticorruption tasks in the previous stage. 
  First, leading cadres should really be honest and 
self-disciplined and see real results in this regard. Leading 
cadres' administrative honesty and self-discipline is one of the 
three tasks for opposing corruption, as well as a key link to 
deepen the anticorruption work. Viewing the situation that the 
three tasks were fulfilled this year, we know that some leading 
cadres were relatively poor in terms of their administrative 
honesty and self-discipline mainly because some leading cadres 
were poor in their self-disciplinary awareness and exemplary 
functions and kept silent about major charges and admitted minor 
ones. Therefore, some deep- layered problems were not exposed 
and even some prominent problems were not conscientiously 
solved. The masses have many complaints. This year, the central 
authorities set forth five new requirements for leading cadres' 
administrative honesty and self-discipline and defined to 
continuously adopt self-investigation and self-correction 
methods. In reality, this is the party's important measure for 
cherishing and protecting cadres, as well as an extremely good 
opportunity for the broad masses of the cadres to conduct 
self-education, self-improvement, and self-extrication. We must 
cherish this opportunity, use the regulations on administrative 
honesty and self-discipline to restrict and standardize our 
activities, and consciously examine and correct existing 
problems. Of course, the problems of all the people cannot be 
solved through self-investigation and self-correction. We must 
strengthen organizational supervision over the people without 
awareness and have them be supervised by the masses. The 
provincial discipline inspection commission stressed the 
necessity to combine leading cadres' self-investigation and 
self-correction with the supervision by the masses, the special 
clearing-up, and the cadres' administrative honesty. This is 
extremely necessary. The provincial party committee has decided 
that in the first half of this year the leading bodies should 
regard the "new five principles" on administration honesty and 
self discipline as an important matter when holding their 
democratic life meetings. Prior to democratic life meetings, 
they should extensively solicit opinions from the masses. After 
the meetings, they should also circulate a notice in a certain 
scope to solicit appraisal and supervision. They should 
specially clear up the illegally purchased sedans and illegally 
occupied houses that have been listed by the central authorities 
in the "new five principles" related to administrative honesty 
and self discipline. Based on carrying out investigation to know 
the real situation and formulating work plans and the provisions 
of policies, departments responsible for the work and units 
taking the lead in the work should earnestly organize the 
enforcement of these principles. Efforts should be made to test 
the extent of honesty duty performance enacted by leading bodies 
or cadres that have encountered more complaints lodged by the 
masses and have not carried out self-improvement. In the course 
of testing the extent of honesty duty performance, it is 
necessary to integrate discipline inspection with organizational 
disposal and to adopt necessary organizational measures to deal 
with the problems cropping up by having cadres perform their 
official duties honestly and in setting forth employment 
orientation. Discipline inspection commissions and 
organizational departments at all levels should coordinate with 
one another and do a good job in earnestly grasping the work. 
  Second, we should reinforce the dynamics in handling serious 
and appalling cases. Whether we can resolutely and effectively 
investigate and handle the large number of serious and appalling 
cases, as well as punish the large number of corrupt elements, 
represent an important sign to determine whether we can deepen 
the struggle against corruption. In line with the arrangements 
made by the central authorities we should regard as a focal 
point the work of continuously investigating and handling the 
cases committed by party and government leading organs, leading 
cadres, judicial departments, administration and law-enforcement 
departments, economic management departments, and the working 
personnel of these departments. We should emphasize 
investigating and handling the violation cases committed by 
leading cadres, by personnel in charge of enforcing the law and 
discipline through practicing favoritism and irregularities and 
bending the law by taking bribes, by personnel in charge of 
enforcing the law through violating the law, and by legal 
persons through violating the law and discipline. Party 
committees at all levels should resolutely eliminate the 
interference of pleading for mercy and establishing 
relationships with personnel and support the organs of 
discipline inspection, supervision, and procuratorate to 
investigate and handle the large number of serious and appalling 
cases. The principal leading personnel of these party 
committees should take personal charge of a case if necessary. 
All important cases and clues reported by the masses should be 
earnestly investigated and handled. Party committees at all 
levels may dispatch their reserve cadres to the discipline 
inspection commission to help it handle the cases. Only by so 
doing can they not only make up the manpower shortage in 
handling cases but also train their cadres to upgrade their 
party spirit. Governments and financial departments at all 
levels should make all-out efforts to ensure the supply of funds 
for handling the cases. By no means should we have the handling 
of cases be adversely affected by the shortage of manpower and 
funds. In investigating and handling serious and appalling 
cases, the organs of discipline inspection, supervision, and 
public security at all levels should closely coordinate with one 
another; supplement one another in strong points; and do a good 
job in conducting linking work. In investigating and handling 
serious and appalling cases, the party committee may exercise 
unified command and concentrate all social forces on waging 
total warfare in handling the cases and warfare in handling the 
key cases so as to make a breakthrough in this regard as soon as 
possible. Meanwhile, the party committee should hold open 
trials by selecting a large number of typical cases to frighten 
criminal elements and to create a momentum of deeply opposing 
corruption. 
  Third, in correcting the malpractice cropping up among 
various industries and trades, we should give the work priority 
to the key problems in this regard. The present phenomena of 
malpractice and of trading between power and money, particularly 
those prevailing among industries and trades, as well as 
departments that are holding the power of personnel and 
financial affairs and of material supply, are still relatively 
serious. The provincial party committee defined last year the 
task of carrying out investigation, dissection, clearing-up, and 
correction over the key problems cropping up among 10 
departments and will firmly grasp the task this year. According 
to the unified arrangements made by the central authorities and 
the provincial party committee, a good job should be done in 
conducting education and rectification in the contingent of 
political and legal personnel and in emphatically resolving the 
problems of enforcing the law unfairly; bending the law for 
private gains; and enforcing the law by violating it. In line 
with the reform in the financial systems and the task of 
conducting special consolidation over the problems on the 
financial front with regard to seeking personal gains by taking 
advantage of loans, the administration and law-discipline 
enforcement organs on the industrial-commercial front and tax 
front should enhance the building of systems for administration 
honesty. They should enforce in an overall way the systems of 
two openness, one supervision, and of the internal restriction 
of power. On the fronts of public health and education, which 
are closely related to the masses, we should generally conduct 
education on professional ethics and emphatically resolve the 
problems related to the ethics and morale of medical circles. 
All in all, by proceeding from the reality and according to the 
characteristics of various industries and trades as well as of 
various departments, we should define the focal points of 
consolidation; integrate work style rectification with the 
establishment of systems; unite administration honesty with 
administration industriousness; and conduct the comprehensive 
management of public security through multiple forms and methods 
to enable the morale of various industries and trades, as well 
as of various departments to achieve an obvious turn for the 
better. 
  3. Deepening reform is the fundamental way to tackle 
corruption and the anticorruption work should be carried out in 
close coordination with the implementation of major reform 
measures. 
  The current anticorruption struggle is carried out in the 
process to accelerate establishment of the socialist market 
economy system. We should coordinate our endeavor to oppose 
corruption and advocate honesty with implementation of major 
reform measures. We should, on the one hand, pay attention to 
providing, by opposing corruption, favorable conditions and 
guarantees for implementation of various reform measures and, on 
the other, start with deepening reform and establishing 
necessary systems to fundamentally prevent and check corrupt 
phenomena so that we can bring about both a temporary solution 
and a permanent cure. 
  First, we should strictly enforce discipline and carry out 
orders and prohibitions to ensure implementation of all reform 
measures. Our party's historical experiences proved that party 
discipline should be all the more strengthened whenever there is 
major social change. This year, the central authorities will 
issue a series of major reform measures for establishing the 
socialist market economy system. Whether we can ensure the 
smooth implementation of government orders is a matter 
concerning the success or failure of reform. Therefore, we 
should strengthen the restriction of party discipline and ensure 
a high degree of political and ideological unity and a high 
degree of unity in organization and action of the entire party. 
Party organizations at all levels and cadres with party 
membership should strictly abide by the party's political and 
organizational discipline; resolutely implement the policies and 
measures of the party Central Committee and the State Council 
for reform, development, and political stability; carry out all 
orders and prohibitions; and act in unison. It is not permitted 
to comply in public but oppose in private, act one's own way, 
and obstruct and interfere with the progress of reform; it is 
not permitted to take advantage of reform to line one's pockets 
and seek illicit interests; and it is not permitted to take 
advantage of one's authority to create difficulties to or extort 
money from enterprises and grass-roots levels. Discipline 
inspection and supervision organs at all levels should 
strengthen supervision and inspection in a planned manner 
according to established priorities, with the focus on 
implementation of the "decision" of the third plenary session of 
the 14th party Central Committee and implementation of the 
series of major policies and measures of the party Central 
Committee and the State Council for deepening reform, developing 
the economy, and safeguarding political stability. 
  Second, when major reform measures are issued, we should 
adopt preventive measures from the angle of improving party 
style and administrative honesty and formulate corresponding 
regulations and measures to make sure that good results are 
achieved both in deepening reform and in opposing corruption and 
advocating honesty. In implementing major reform measures and 
economic policies, it is impossible to be perfect at the very 
beginning, and it is unavoidable that some people will take 
advantage of the loopholes created by the temporary imperfect 
supervision, management, laws, and regulations to indulge 
themselves in some new corrupt and unhealthy trends. At a 
discussion and study session for provincial-level cadres held in 
November last year, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "Is not it 
time to make it a regulation for party committees and 
governments at all levels, while implementing the major policies 
and measures of the central authorities for economic 
development, reform, and opening up, to list improvement of 
party style and administrative honesty high on their agenda, put 
forward realistic and feasible support measures, and 
conscientiously implement them together." In compliance with 
this requirement, party committees, governments, and pertinent 
departments, when issuing major reform measures, should conduct 
study early and work out measures to address the problems that 
may arise in party style and administrative honesty. Discipline 
inspection and supervision organs, in particular, should 
actively participate in this work and take the initiative in 
intensifying investigation and study on the forefront of reform, 
opening up, and economic construction to learn about and analyze 
the new conditions and new problems, to help party committees, 
governments, and pertinent departments study and formulate 
measures for preventing and checking unhealthy trends, and to 
use these measures to standardize the behaviors of party and 
government leading cadres and ensure the healthy development of 
economic construction, reform, and opening up. 
  Third, we should strive to study and explore a new way for 
preventing corruption by relying on reform and building systems. 
One of the important reasons for the reappearance of passive 
corrupt phenomena is that we have failed to improve the 
situation by checking the sources of corruption and eliminating 
the soil and conditions that give rise to corruption. To solve 
the problem on corruption, we must keep an eye on the overall 
situation, grasp the sources of corruption, resolve problems in 
terms of systems and the legal system, and take both radical and 
stopgap measures. Through deepening reform of the financial, 
taxation, banking, and investment systems, we should resolve the 
problems on arbitrarily pooling funds, donations, and fees from 
enterprises, extorting money or articles from enterprises, and 
taking advantage of lending loans, collecting taxes, and 
approving projects to seek personal gain; through promoting 
reform of the cadre personnel system, we should give public 
examinations, recruit people by invitation, and introduce the 
competitive and incentive mechanisms, adopt the method of 
clearing the channels for exchanging cadres and ensuring that 
those who assume leadership posts can work at higher or lower 
levels as required, and solve the unhealthy trends in the course 
of carrying out cadre personnel work; through public bidding, we 
should check the unhealthy trends in real estate development and 
contract of projects; and through deepening reform of the 
housing system, we should solve the unhealthy trends in housing 
distribution and using public funds to furnish houses above the 
set standards or reselling public houses at a profit. We should 
formulate a method and a system of supervising and controlling 
power performance, such as making the work procedures public, 
analyzing and restricting the internal powers, assuming 
important posts on rotation, and jointly managing official work, 
and gradually institutionalize and legalize the anticorruption 
struggle. 
  4. Since upholding the principle of taking a two-handed 
approach is our party's strategic principle and an art of 
leadership, we must strengthen leadership over anticorruption 
struggle in the course of carrying out all fields of work. 
  Persisting in taking a two-handed approach and be tough with 
both is an important component of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory 
on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the 
strategic principle which our party should uphold for a long 
time, and the Marxist art of leadership. According to the 
previous experience and lessons, the trend of being soft with 
one hand and hard with the other hand will easily appear when 
the reform and economic work tasks are very heavy. This year 
more reform measures will be issued, the strength in this aspect 
will be great, and risks will appear. Under such circumstances, 
we should all the more uphold the principle of taking a 
two-handed approach and be tough with both, and should all the 
more strengthen leadership over anticorruption. In this 
connection, we should continue to stress the following few 
points: 
  First, we should continue to implement the system of 
assuming 
responsibility over anticorruption work and form a trend of 
making both party and government organs jointly grasp and manage 
this work. Fighting corruption is a common task of the whole 
party. People who are in charge of the work of the party 
committee or the government must attend to and grasp the 
anticorruption work well. Grasping two tasks does not mean that 
one task should be grasped by the party committee and the other 
task should be grasped by the government. Instead, they should 
closely combine two tasks, grasp them well, and seek 
achievements. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should properly handle the relations of reform, development, 
stability, and anticorruption, firmly attend to the central task 
of economic construction, persist in taking a two-handed 
approach, give consideration to the overall situation, combine 
the work of fighting corruption with deepening reform, promoting 
development, and safeguarding stability, continue to introduce 
anticorruption to all fields of work, and establish a strict 
responsibility system. The party and government top leaders 
should assume full responsibility, and personally resolve major 
problems. Party and government leading bodies should share the 
work, really assume responsibility over the anticorruption 
struggle work on all fronts, and realistically form a situation 
in which the party and government jointly manage this work. 
Governments at all levels, operational departments, and 
pertinent departments in all trades should grasp not only the 
economic efficiency and targets in the course of grasping 
economic work, but also the work style and common practices of 
organs and various trades; in addition to grasping the economic 
factors that affect economic work, they should also pay 
attention to solving noneconomic factors that affect economic 
development. We should persist in simultaneously planning, 
inspecting, and summing up the economic work and anticorruption 
struggle, combine the two, and make them promote each other. 
  Second, we should strengthen supervision, inspection, 
examination, and guidance. This year, the provincial party 
committee will continue to send inspection groups, examination 
groups, and investigation groups to grass-roots areas to 
supervise, examine, and guide the work of various localities and 
departments in opposing corruption and advocating administrative 
honesty. Leading cadres at all levels should try their best to 
go deep into some key departments, grass-roots units, and the 
places that are weak in anticorruption work to find out problems 
in a timely manner and give specific guidance to them. Those 
who only talk but not practice and those who are poor in 
conducting the anticorruption work should be criticized or 
warned and should be given resolute organizational measures if 
necessary. We should strengthen investigation and study, pay 
attention to new circumstances and new problems in a timely 
manner, and mete out countermeasures to ensure the sound and 
orderly development of an anticorruption campaign. 
  Third, we should genuinely and sincerely support discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs to perform duties. Discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs shoulder arduous and heavy 
tasks in the first line of anticorruption work. Leading 
comrades of party committees and governments at all levels 
should pay high attention to and wholeheartedly support the work 
of these organs. First, efforts should be made to give full 
play to the role of discipline inspection and supervisory organs 
as the advisers and assistants to the party and the government. 
Party committees and governments at all levels, principal 
responsible comrades in particular, should frequently listen to 
the work reports of discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs, help these organs resolve all sorts of problems in a 
timely manner, and support them to conscientiously perform their 
functions of supervising, inspecting, coordinating, and 
comprehensive guiding anticorruption work. Second, discipline 
inspection and supervisory organs should be supported to enforce 
discipline and handle cases. When investigating and handling 
major discipline violation cases in particular, party committees 
and governments should serve as a powerful backing for 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs. Leading comrades 
at all levels should not only personally take a hand in handling 
cases but also support discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs to handle cases impartially and help these organs break 
with favoritism through connections and resist the practice of 
pleading for mercy. The discipline violation cases committed by 
members of discipline inspection and supervisory organs should 
also be dealt with without shielding and leniency. Third, 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs should be supported 
to resolve practical problems. Discipline inspection and 
supervisory organs shoulder heavy tasks and face relatively more 
problems. Some problems they face cannot be resolved by 
themselves. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should show concern for the work and life of the ranks of 
discipline inspection and supervisory cadres and should do 
several tangible things for these organs every year, such as, 
providing sufficient and competent members for their leading 
bodies, facilitating the exchanges of discipline inspection and 
supervisory cadres, improving the conditions for handling 
affairs and cases, and allocating sufficient funds for these 
organs. In the forthcoming organizational reform, party 
committees and governments should give full consideration to the 
anticorruption work and to the practical demand of discipline 
inspection and supervisory work so that the strength of 
discipline inspection and supervisory organs will not be 
weakened. Comrades of discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs should also continuously carry forward the spirit of 
selfless dedication, being devoted to one's duty, being 
law-abiding, and making innovations, and should do outstanding 
and fruitful work to make new contributions to launching the 
anticorruption campaign in a sustained and profound manner, to 
ensure reform, opening up, and economic development, and to 
safeguard political stability.

doing business at the country trade fairs to resolutely 
implement the ceiling prices set for the aforementioned product 
varieties, put price tags on the products, and sell these 
products in line with the price tags. Those units that refuse to 
implement the ceiling prices, abritrarily raise the prices, and 
sell these products above the ceiling prices will be strictly 
handled in case they are discoverd.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province is launching an environmental protection 
campaign to increase its residents' awareness of pollution 
problems. 
  The province, one of the major heavy industrial centers in 
China, has been plagued by industrial pollution for a long time. 
Shenyang, capital of the province, and Anshan, a steel city, 
and other large and medium-sized cites were once 
pollution-ridden and are now still facing serious problems of 
pollution. 
  To reduce pollution and better protect the environment, the 
province is now taking every possible measure to make its 
residents aware of pollution problems. 
  Children in schools all over the province are given books on 
environmental protection which explain in simple and clear 
language the relationship between nature and human beings, and 
between environmental pollution and disease. 
  Two special primary schools have been established, where 
students are examined on the subject of environmental protection 
as well as other subjects. 
  Government officials are also required to stay abreast of 
problems of pollution. They are given lectures on the basics of 
environmental protection and its relationship with economic 
development. 
  Factories are now paying attention to environmental 
protection as well as to safety in the workplace. Newspapers 
give prominent space and radio and TV use prime time to cover 
stories on environmental protection. 
  The chief of the provincial bureau of environmental 
protection has even hosted radio phone-in programs on 
environmental protection.

<F P=106> [By reporter Wang Sumei (3769 4790 2734): "Create a </F>
Civilized, Beautiful, Orderly, and Efficient Overall 
Environment"] 
  [Text] "We should adopt effective measures and mobilize 
all forces in society to create a civilized, beautiful, orderly, 
and efficient overall environment and to further promote the 
opening up of the entire province in level, sphere, and 
quality." This was set forth at the meeting on improving 
investment environment held by the provincial government on 24 
March. 
  As introduced, since the commencement of reform and opening 
up, the province has made great progress in building investment 
environment. The province has renovated and built Dalian and 
Shenyang international airports, rebuilt Dandong, Jinzhou, and 
Anshan airports, expanded Dalian port, and newly built Yingkou, 
Dandong, and Jinzhou ports. Shenyang-Dalian Expressway has 
closely combined the port city group with the central city 
group, with Shenyang as the center. Over the past two years, 
the province has again added a number of port berths and small 
wharves, has developed the roll-on ship service, and has newly 
opened the Shenyang-Irkutsk, Shenyang-Hong Kong, and 
Dalian-Tokyo air routes, with the total number of air routes 
reaching 68, and with the number of cities linked by these air 
routes reaching 33. The province has also newly added 400,000 
lines of telephone switchboards, with the total installed 
capacity reaching 1 million lines. Most cities and counties in 
the province have been furnished with international direct 
dialing facilities. 
  A total of 21 development zones of various kinds have been 
approved in the province, with a total planned acreage of 407 
square kilometers. A total of 1,486 foreign-funded enterprises 
have entered these development zones, and $5.27 billion in 
foreign capital has been utilized. Last year, breakthroughs 
were made in bonded areas, foreign-invested banks, and 
large-scale land development. 
  It is revealed that compared to tangible investment 
environment, the intangible investment environment has dropped 
in quality over the past several years, thus provoking much 
complaints among foreign traders. For instance, some of our 
departments have handled the contradictions emerging in reform 
only from the angle of their own departments instead of 
considering the overall situation of reform, thus giving rise to 
the phenomenon that too many checkpoints are set, too many 
interferences are imposed, one project is approved by many 
places, and a contract is transferred among many departments. 
  Lagging behind in management and service, tangible 
environment has been unable to exploit its due role. Some 
hotels and inns experiencing power and water failure have not 
adopted remedy measures, thus making foreign traders unable to 
have a bath at night and wash their face in the morning. 
  Although furnished with good installations, some of our 
airports lack emergency measures and are poor at meeting 
emergency under special cases. At the same time, our custom 
situation and our board and lodging situation are unable to 
satisfy foreign traders, and our urban public hygiene 
environment has become worse and worse. 
  To further improve investment environment, the provincial 
government has defined six construction targets, namely, 
"efficient working functions, scientific management norm, 
quality service, beautiful urban environment, fine social order, 
and excellent moral practice." In addition, corresponding 
measures have been adopted for this work in a bid to achieve 
results within this year and to embark on a new stage in three 
years.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Rural people in 
northeast China's Liaoning province are making a fortune in 
urban areas these days, instead of hawking their farm and 
side-line products for a living as they did a few years ago. 
  Like rustics in other parts of China, farmers in the 
province 
are now enjoying an increasingly important role in the urban 
economy. 
  In Anshan, one of the province's largest industrial cities, 
50,000 farmers are now engaged at construction sites in the 
city. They earned more than one billion yuan last year, 
one-third of the total earned by all builders in the city. 
  The rural builders have won out in fierce competitions with 
urban builders owing to their flexibility in business operation 
and a strong sense of responsibility as well as efficiency. 
  They have received national prizes for painting, glazed tile 
stamping and terrazzo floor polishing. A construction team led 
by Dong Shaowen, a former farmer, won the top national building 
prize last year. 
  A village-run real estate development company in the suburbs 
of Shenyang, capital of the province, has built more than 140 
buildings for sale, covering a total floor space of 500,000 
square meters. 
  In the coastal city of Yingkou, rural builders are playing 
an 
equally important role as urban builders in the construction of 
a port in the city. 
  A farmer in the suburbs of Dalian, also a coastal city of 
the 
province, invested 400,000 yuan in the city's sports shop seven 
years ago. The shop has now topped 30 million yuan in sales. 
It has business with more than 600 enterprises from over 20 
provinces and cities in the country. 
  Rural people are also found dealing with refrigerator 
production, top-class shoe-making, department stores, 
restaurants and entertainment centers. 
  Experts say rural people not only make money but also 
re-invigorate their ideas in urban areas. With the market 
economy being established in the country, rural people are sure 
to play an even bigger role in the country's urban market.

  [Text] Individual-run and privately owned enterprises have 
become important network centers of economic development in 
Liaoning. The province of Liaoning is noted for its large 
number of large and medium-sized enterprises and also for its 
rich actual strength of publicly owned enterprises. In line 
with the demand of developing the socialist market economy, the 
province has formulated policies and measures for developing 
individual-run and privately owned enterprises over the past 
few years and created a relaxed environment to encourage the 
rapid development of such enterprises. By the end of 1993, the 
province's number of individual-run and privately owned 
enterprises reached 745,000. The industrial output value 
scored by these enterprises reached 11.8 billion yuan and 
accounted for 4.22 percent in the province's total industrial 
output value. The volume of retail sales scored by these 
enterprises reached 22.2 billion yuan and accounted for (?40.2) 
percent in the province's total volume of retail sales. They 
provided 1.62 billion yuan of taxes for the province, which 
accounted for 6.7 percent in the province's financial and tax 
revenues.

<F P=106> [Xinjiang Government Work Report delivered by Abulaiti </F>
Abudurexiti, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional 
People's Government, on 24 February at the Second Session of the 
Eighth Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's Congress] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  On behalf of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People's 
Government, I now submit a government work report for your 
examination and approval, and also for suggestions and comments 
from the members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference. 
<H5>  Review of the 1993 Work </H5>
  For us, 1993 meant a year of advancing victoriously along 
the 
path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a year of 
achieving remarkable results in reform, opening up, economic 
construction, and other undertakings in the autonomous region. 
In 1993, under the correct leadership of the CPC Central 
Committee, the State Council, and the autonomous region's party 
committee, and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
important remarks and guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC 
National Congress, we persisted in making economic construction 
the central task; constantly carried out indepth reform, opened 
ourselves up wider to the outside world in line with the 
requirements for building a socialist market economic system; 
and timely adopted macroeconomic regulation and control measures 
to deal with contradictions and problems which cropped up in the 
course of economic development, to restore financial order, to 
stabilize economic situation, to help maintain the sustained and 
healthy development of the national economy, and to bring about 
great progress in various social undertakings. The total value 
of the gross domestic product of the entire region is projected 
at 49.796 billion yuan (current year value; the same below), up 
9.5 percent from the previous year; gross industrial and 
agricultural output value at 63.564 billion yuan, an increase of 
8.5 percent; revenue at 3.47 billion yuan, up 33.08 percent; 
expenditures at 6.446 billion yuan (including new expenditures 
due to wage adjustments in fourth quarter); various bank deposit 
balances at 40.632 billion yuan, an increase of 6.742 billion 
yuan over the previous year; various loan balances at 46.765 
billion yuan, an increase of 8.65 billion yuan; and the region's 
total social product retail amount at 18.465 billion yuan, up 
17.2 percent. Savings deposits of urban and rural citizens 
increased, and the people's standard of living improved. The 
region fulfilled or overfulfilled annual targets in most of the 
major economic indices. Political stability, national unity, 
economic development, and social progress in the region can be 
witnessed from the following: 
<H5>  1. Sixteen Consecutive Bumper Harvest Years for </H5>
Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Production 
  In 1993, all levels of government conscientiously 
implemented 
the party's rural policies; constantly deepened rural reform; 
established and improved rural cooperative economic 
organizations and socialized service system; timely readjusted 
agricultural and crop-growing structures by taking the law of 
the market into consideration; attached greater importance to 
science and technology and to popularizing advanced agricultural 
technologies which are suitable for rural areas; increased 
investments in agriculture through various means; 
conscientiously implemented projects financed by the World Bank; 
expanded the program of providing job opportunities instead of 
simply handing out subsidies; adhered to the policy of promoting 
infrastructural construction in agriculture and animal husbandry 
centering on water conservancy projects; improved conditions for 
production; managed to cash all "IOUs" from farmers and herdsmen 
despite fund shortages; and timely scrapped documents on 
irrational burdens and eliminated excessive fees imposed on 
farmers and herdsmen, thereby protecting the interests of 
farmers and herdsmen. The region won the fight against a number 
of natural disasters and achieved a sixteenth consecutive bumper 
harvest year thanks to the joint efforts of all cadres and the 
broad mass of farmers and herdsmen of all nationalities, and to 
the support rendered by all trades and professions. The total 
output value of agricultural products for the entire year is 
projected at 18.753 billion yuan, an increase of 4.4 percent 
over the previous year; total grain output at 7.09 million 
tonnes, up 0.4 percent over previous year, another record; total 
cotton output at 680,000 tonnes, an increase of 1.9 percent; 
total output of edible oil crop at 370,002 tonnes, up 3.9 
percent; total beet output at 2369,100 tonnes, down 28 percent; 
total amount of livestock at 35,147,200 head, an increase of 0.6 
percent; and total meat production at 383,000 tonnes, up 6 
percent. Reforestation on flatland areas exceeded 100 million 
mu for the first time, an increase of 28 percent. Village and 
township enterprises saw great development, with gross output 
value and total income reaching 6.209 billion yuan and 6.492 
billion yuan, representing increases of 42.4 percent and 57.3 
percent respectively over the previous year and registering the 
fastest growth in recent years. The lives of farmers and 
herdsmen improved, with per capita annual net income reaching 
778 yuan, an increase of 38 yuan and a growth of 5 percent. New 
progress was made in the work of helping the poor, with the rate 
of poor households advancing out of poverty reaching over 93 
percent. 
<H5>  2. Industrial Output Continues To Grow and Transport Service </H5>
Continues To Expand 
  In 1993, various localities and departments continued to 
deepen enterprise reform and to readjust enterprises' structure 
and product mix. Thanks to attaching importance to 
technological progress and intensifying technical 
transformation, 150 new products of autonomous-regional grade 
were developed. Supervision over product quality was tightened, 
and the manufacturing and sale of fake and shoddy goods was 
cracked, so as to help improve product quality. To help 
enterprises turn losses into profits and rationally conserve 
energy and reduce consumption, implementation of the system in 
which enterprises are responsible for their own profits and 
losses was continued. Measures were taken to reduce stocks; to 
recover capital; to tighten control over financial resources; to 
clear overdue debts; to restructure the transportation sector 
rationally; and to divert management over highways from that 
over railways. Industrial production started to rebound since 
March. The region's total industrial output value reached 
44.811 billion yuan, up 10.9 percent over the previous year; the 
volume of rail freight was 20.174 million tons, an increase of 
6.8 percent over the 1992 figure; and the volume of airway 
passengers was 2.1 billion person-km, up 16.7 percent over the 
previous year. Highway transportation was further improved, and 
fairly rapid progress was made in the posts and 
telecommunications business. 
<H5>  3. Major Progress Was Made in Capital Construction in </H5>
Infrastructural Facilities and Basic Industries 
  In 1993, the region's total investment in fixed assets 
amounted to 23.195 billion yuan, up 36.4 percent over 1992. Of 
this total, local investment was 7.385 billion yuan, an increase 
of 30.9 percent. Of local investment, investment in capital 
construction was 3.560 billion yuan, up 23.9 percent; investment 
in technical transformation was 1.110 billion yuan, up 56.3 
percent. Fairly good progress was made in 35 key construction 
projects, of which eleven have achieved all their objectives and 
went into operation; another seven were partially put into 
operation with their single item or part of the projects 
completed as scheduled. Among these key projects, the first 
phase of Urumqi petrochemical polyester project was put into 
operation completely; Xinjiang Sodium Carbonate Plant went into 
operation on a trial basis ahead of schedule; installation of 
major equipment for the Dushanzi ethylene project was basically 
completed; investment of 307 million yuan was made to expand No. 
8 Iron and Steel Plant; and investment of 980 million yuan was 
made to accelerate construction of the Urumqi Railway Bureau 
section of the Lanxin Railway. Track-laying for 475.5 km of the 
main line was completed, and 191 km of the line was put into 
operation. Nine major highways were completed; the total length 
of newly-built and reconstructed highways totalled 724.6 km; the 
Beitun-Dahuangshan section of state highway 216 was inaugurated; 
construction began on the (?Xian)-(?Lanzhou)-(?Urumqi) optic 
fiber communication line; a 550-million-yuan investment was made 
to develop posts and telecommunications industries; 100,000 
telephones were installed; construction of key ports was 
accelerated; investments of 9,500 million yuan was made to 
explore oil, up 39 percent over 1992; generating capacity was 
110,000 kw; and the storage capacity of dams was 640 million 
cubic meter. 
<H5>  4. New Progress Was Made in Foreign Trade and Economy </H5>
  Various localities and foreign trade departments actively 
developed foreign trade and consolidated economic and technical 
cooperation and exchange with foreign countries. Border trade 
in particular grew by a large margin on the basis of 
breakthrough progress achieved in 1992, and has become a vital 
foundation of regional foreign trade. The total volume of 
imports and exports amounted to $912 million, up 30.3 percent 
over 1992. Of the total, the volume of imports and exports on a 
barter basis was $577 million, up 80.2 percent and accounting 
for 63.3 percent of the total volume of foreign trade. Three 
hundred and sixty three foreign-funded enterprises were approved 
in 1992, and foreign capital of $243 million was utilized, an 
increase of 86.9 percent. This was a year when the greatest 
amount of foreign capital was utilized. Great progress was made 
in outward investment and service cooperation. The second 
Urumqi trade fair was successfully launched. Foreign exchange 
income from tourism grew in a stable manner, and comprehensive 
capacity to receive tourists was further strengthened. In 1992, 
Xinjiang received 241,000 tourists from home and abroad, earning 
foreign exchange of $40 million, an increase of 12.6 percent. 
<H5>  5. Marked Acceleration in the Pace of Economic System Reform </H5>
  Last year the region saw new progress in reforming the 
economic system. Centering on implementing the "Regulations on 
the Transformation of the Management System of State-Owned 
Industrial Enterprises," the transformation of the government 
functions, and the changing of enterprises' management 
mechanisms, the autonomous region introduced 10 sets of policies 
which played a positive role in invigorating the economy and 
enterprises. Over 400 enterprises and 200,000 staff members and 
workers across the region were involved in reforming the labor 
and employment system; some 100,000 staff members and workers 
from 100 enterprises took part in the scheme of linking their 
job positions and wages to job performance and technical skills. 
More enterprises were selected to experiment with shareholding 
and the shareholding cooperative system. The autonomous region 
approved the establishment of 112 shareholding enterprises, with 
a total registered capital of 1.47 billion yuan. Experiments 
with civilians managing state-owned enterprises were gradually 
conducted. New progress was made in readjusting the enterprise 
organizational structure. Now the region boasts 31 different 
types of enterprise groups. Efforts to foster market systems 
showed initial results. Distribution systems were further 
improved and developed. Major reform of the grain procurement 
and marketing system was conducted, resulting in improved 
distribution of agricultural and animal husbandry products. 
Commercial procurement and marketing for state-run cooperatives 
witnessed brisk development. The pace to accelerate price 
reforms was accelerated. The authority to decontrol prices was 
further delegated. The proportion of market regulated prices 
increased markedly. Reform of the housing system was carried 
out step by step. The structure of the ownership system was 
further improved. The development of the individual and private 
economy showed excellent momentum. There were 280,000 private 
industrial and commercial enterprises employing 430,000 people 
in the autonomous region, representing an increase of 15.9 
percent and 19.5 percent respectively from the previous year. 
<H5>  6. Comprehensive Development of Science, Technology, </H5>
Education, Culture, Public Health, Sports, and Other Social 
Undertakings 
  The autonomous region implemented an economic 
construction-oriented policy in developing science and 
technology. By adapting to the requirements of a market 
economy, the autonomous region constantly deepened reform of the 
scientific and technological structure, greatly developed 
technology market, and energetically tackled scientific and 
technological projects and technology popularization, thereby 
promoting economic development. Implementation of the 
"Help-the-Poor Through Science and Technology," the "Spark 
Plan," and the "Torch Plan" went smoothly. The autonomous region 
achieved 330 major scientific and technological achievements 
last year, 140 more than the previous year. Construction of a 
new and high technology industrial development zone proceeded 
smoothly. Some 200 new and high technology projects were 
realized. Income derived from technology trading is expected to 
top 922,000 yuan. Work on patent rights achieved great 
development. The autonomous region saw the application of 
patent rights for 642 products, an increase of 28 percent. 
Education saw further development. Primary education was 
further enhanced; vocational education achieved progress. Adult 
education developed steadily. More autonomy rights for running 
institutes of higher learning were granted. Measures were taken 
to encourage people to run schools. Remarkable results were 
achieved in promoting education among minority nationalities. 
Efforts to establish public health network in counties, 
townships, and villages were beefed up. Medical and sanitation 
conditions improved in rural and pasture areas. Greater 
importance was attached to the work of family planning, and 
constant efforts were made to promote family planning among 
minority nationalities. A total of 16 prefectures and cities 
comprehensively fulfilled the population and family planning 
responsibility plan. Major breakthroughs were made in the area 
of sports. Athletes of the autonomous region won medals at the 
Seventh National Games. The autonomous region further 
invigorated and enhanced management over the cultural market. 
Radio, film, television, news, and publishing departments 
contributed to the spreading of the party's line, principles, 
and policies as well as to reform, opening up, and stable 
development in Xinjiang. Xinjiang also conscientiously unfurled 
a major campaign to check enforcement of the law on 
environmental protection. Greater importance was attached to 
enhancing environmental protection work. 
<H5>  7. A Good Social and Political Environment Was Preserved </H5>
  While making efforts to deepen reform and accelerate 
economic 
development, we paid attention to correctly handling the 
relationships between reform, development, and maintaining 
stability, and applied ourselves to maintaining stability. We 
insisted on regarding the preserving of nationality unity as an 
important task, and conducted in-depth nationality unity 
education in various forms and other activities aimed at 
promoting nationality unity and making progress among all 
nationalities. We carried out the anticorruption struggle in 
depth, and results were achieved. Results were also achieved in 
dealing with the "three illegalities," [illegal fee collection, 
imposition of fines, and apportioning of expenses] thereby 
reducing the burden on enterprises and urban and rural 
residents. We resolutely cracked down on the sabotage and 
subversive activities conducted by a very small number of 
nationalist splittists. We applied ourselves to taking 
comprehensive measures to improve social order. We made 
thorough efforts to clamp down on all kinds of crimes and 
illegal economic activities and to wipe out social evils, 
thereby further purifying the social environment. We launched 
educational activities to popularize legal knowledge among the 
masses, enabling cadres and people of all nationalities to have 
a better understanding of democracy and law. We placed greater 
importance on legislation of law. Last year, the Xinjiang 
Regional Government submitted five local laws and regulations 
for examination by the Xinjiang Regional People's Congress and 
its Standing Committee. These laws and regulations have been 
promulgated for enforcement. In addition, 12 administrative 
regulations of various natures were promulgated in the form of 
decrees of the Xinjiang regional government chairman. Because we 
insisted on tightly gripping with two hands and placed 
importance on promoting spiritual civilization, we were able to 
effectively ensure social and political stability, creating a 
good social environment for reform, opening up, and economic 
construction. 
  Over the last year, the Xinjiang Production and Construction 
Corps, adhering to the central task of economic construction, 
quickened the pace of reform and opening up, making considerable 
progress in economic construction and work in other fields, and 
making new contributions to maintaining stability in Xinjiang 
and to the region's development. Chinese People's Liberation 
Army [PLA] units in Xinjiang and the region's armed police force 
and public security cadres and policemen, following the 
honorable tradition of working diligently and selflessly 
dedicating themselves, further built themselves up in the new 
situation and enthusiastically supported Xinjiang's work in all 
sectors, making important contributions to safeguarding and 
developing the frontiers, to consolidating social stability, and 
to strengthening unity. 
  Xinjiang's general situation in 1993 was indeed good. The 
good results should be attributed to the correct leadership of 
the party Central Committee and the State Council, and to the 
spirit of working hard in unison of people of all nationalities 
in Xinjiang. On behalf of the Xinjiang Regional People's 
Government, I hereby express my heartfelt thanks and high 
respect to cadres, workers, peasants and herdsmen, staff members 
and workers of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, 
intellectuals, and scientists and technical workers of all 
nationalities in Xinjiang; to personnel of democratic parties, 
patriots without party affiliation, PLA units in Xinjiang, and 
the region's armed police force and public security officers and 
men; and to cadres, staff members, and workers of central 
authorities units in Xinjiang. 
  Since the 14th CPC National Congress decided to build a 
socialist market economic system, Xinjiang, as other provinces 
have done, has made new progress in carrying out reform and 
opening up. The market mechanism has played an increasingly 
important role in people's economic life; new achievements were 
made in economic construction and work in other sectors. But we 
must realize that in the process of transforming the planned 
economy into a market economy, inadequate emancipation of the 
mind and the lagging behind in reforms in some areas have 
affected our efforts to build a new system and have prevented 
the economy from developing in a healthy manner. While some old 
problems in economic functioning have not been thoroughly 
solved, we need to study many new situations and solve many new 
problems and contradictions. Growth in agricultural investment 
slowed down, providing little potential for future development. 
The weight of village and town enterprises in the rural economy 
was comparatively small. Xinjiang has a weak industrial base, 
its enterprises have far lagged behind in carrying out 
technological transformation, and it has been slow in 
readjusting its industrial structure and product mix. Because 
of these and the restraint caused by shortage of circulating 
funds and transportation capacity, Xinjiang was unable to 
achieve its industrial growth targets and its economic 
efficiency was poor. The ownership structure urgently needs to 
be readjusted; the weight of collective, individual, and private 
economies has been too small. The region's financial 
difficulties worsened. Efficiency of fund utilization was poor, 
and the contradiction between the supply and demand of funds 
remained prominent. The overall retail index totalled 112.6 
percent; price increases were comparatively high. Transformation 
of government functions was carried out slowly, making it 
difficult to meet the needs arising from developing a socialist 
market economic system. Some of the aforementioned problems are 
problems in our work, and some are indications of in-depth 
problems of economic and social development. The fundamental 
way to solve these problems is to deepen reform. 
<H5>  Strive To Make Rapid and Highly Efficient Development of the </H5>
Region's Economy 
  Fellow deputies, 1994 will be another year for continuing to 
maintain good momentum in economic development as well as a 
crucial year for carrying out reforms in an all-around manner. 
The gap between our region and other parts of the country in 
economic development is widening; we are facing more problems 
and difficulties, and our tasks are more arduous. Thus, we 
should enhance our sense of crisis and urgency. However, at the 
same time we should also note we are rich in natural resources 
and have geographical advantages in opening up to the West; the 
state has adopted a preferential industrial policy for the 
western portion of the country; the second Asia-Europe bridge 
has been opened to traffic; and great efforts are being made to 
exploit petroleum. In addition, through more than 10 years of 
reform and opening up, our region has built an economic 
foundation, acquired certain material conditions, and gained a 
wealth of experience. We can certainly bring about highly 
efficient development of the region's economy, provided we 
conscientiously implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary 
Session of the party's 14th Central Committee and the sixth 
plenary session of the fourth regional party committee; make the 
best use of our favorable conditions; seize the opportunity to 
deepen reform and open up wider to the outside world; and 
develop the economy by readjusting its structure and raising its 
efficiency. We are determined to work hard to achieve this 
purpose. 
  In 1994, the main targets of the autonomous region's economy 
are: To increase the total annual output value of goods and 
services for the region to 43.4 billion yuan (the constant value 
of 1990; the same below), an increase of 11 percent over last 
year, and to increase the region's total industrial and 
agricultural output value to 56.5 billion yuan, up 10.8 percent; 
of this 56.5 billion yuan, total industrial output value will be 
36.9 billion yuan, up 13.5 percent, and total agricultural 
output value will be 19.6 billion yuan, up 6 percent. Total 
investment in fixed assets will amount to 9.8 billion yuan, up 
32.7 percent. According to the tax assignment system, revenues 
are expected to total 2.448 billion yuan, and expenditures 6.615 
billion yuan (exclusive of special appropriations by the central 
government); bank deposits will increase by 5.2 billion yuan, 
and bank loans by 11.8 billion yuan. The region's total export 
volume will be $550 million, of which bartering will amount to 
$270 million. The general price index of retail sales will be 
kept at about 110 percent. To achieve the above targets, we 
should do our work well in the following aspects: 
<H5>  1. Accelerate Agricultural and Rural Economic Development </H5>
and Increase Farmers' Incomes 
  Agriculture is the foundation for economic stability and 
development. At no time must we relax our efforts at 
agriculture. We should further strengthen agriculture as the 
foundation of the national economy, stabilize the party's 
various rural policies, and continue to deepen rural reforms; we 
should uphold and improve a multiform system of contracted 
responsibility based on the household contract responsibility 
system with remuneration linked to output and the dual 
management system that combines household with collective 
operations; we should vigorously develop a multiform network of 
social services in rural areas, and strengthen the collective 
economy step by step. 
  We should vigorously readjust and optimize the structure of 
rural production and the internal structure of crop cultivation; 
we should develop a high-yield, good-quality, and 
high-efficiency agriculture, with a view to stabilizing grain 
production, increasing cotton output, improving economic 
results, and raising farmers' incomes. Under no circumstances 
should we relax our efforts at grain production. We should make 
sure we are more than self-sufficient in grain, that grain 
supply and demand are balanced in most localities, and that 
major grain-producing areas should ensure grain supply for urban 
and grain-deficient areas. Various localities and production 
and construction corps must maintain their 1993 levels of grain 
production, and the region's total grain output must not be less 
than 7 million metric tons. Meanwhile, we should vigorously 
develop cotton production and strive to produce over 800,000 
metric tons of cotton in all. We should appropriately increase 
the acreage sown to oil-bearing crops, and do a good job in 
horticulture and in the production of silkworm cocoons and other 
cash crops. We should further improve seeds and varieties as 
well as increase unit production. We should pay attention to 
animal husbandry. While accelerating the settlement of herdsmen 
and the construction of grasslands and promoting a steady 
development of animal husbandry on grasslands, we should develop 
animal husbandry in agricultural areas and intensive, modern, 
and high-efficiency animal husbandry in suburban areas. We 
should readjust the structure of livestock; increase breed 
improvement; and raise the output, quality, and marketable rate 
of livestock. We should vigorously develop forestry work as 
well as continue to improve the natural environment and the 
environment we live in. We should further develop aquatic 
breeding. We should develop a diversified economy by combining 
crop cultivation, breeding, and processing industry in order to 
increase incomes for farmers and herdsmen. We should make full 
use of our agricultural resources and build export-oriented 
agricultural-production areas that combine trade with industry 
and agriculture. We should do a good job in the "vegetable 
basket" project to ensure the supply of non-stable foods for 
urban areas. 
  We should further increase input into agriculture and 
strive to improve production conditions by strengthening the 
construction of farmland infrastructure focused on supplementary 
water conservancy and large and medium key projects, and by 
persistently building irrigation facilities on crop land and 
grassland. We should continue to energetically popularize 
various effective water conservation measures and raise water 
utilization rates. We should pay close attention to 
comprehensive development of agriculture and systematically 
expand crop areas by improving middle and low yield fields, 
controlling saline-alkali land, and building a batch of high and 
stable yield fields. We should continuously raise the level of 
comprehensive farm mechanization. We should strengthen land 
management and protection and encourage compensatory use of 
land. We should continue to promote the building of "five 
good's" in rural areas. 
  Input into science and technology is the key to pushing 
Xinjiang's agricultural and animal husbandry production to a new 
height. We should go all out to promote agricultural production 
with science and technology and, in conjunction with the 
"harvest program," continue to popularize advanced technologies 
for increasing the output and improving the quality of grain, 
cotton, sugar, and livestock. We should stabilize the existing 
ranks of grass-roots scientific and technical personnel, and 
establish and perfect service networks for the diffusion of 
agricultural technology at various levels. We should encourage 
scientific and technical personnel of institutes of agricultural 
sciences at all levels in Xinjiang to go deep into the frontline 
of production to offer technical guidance and service. We 
should step up training in agricultural technology and improve 
the scientific and cultural standards of the masses of peasants 
and herdsmen. 
  We should accelerate the development of village and township 
enterprises and invigorate county economies to promote an 
all-around development of the rural economy. In line with the 
principle of "active support, rational planning, correct 
guidance, and strengthened management," and on the basis of 
stabilizing, consolidating, and improving existing enterprises, 
we should implement "multi-wheel drive and multi-track 
operations," encouraging enterprises to gear production to 
market demands, to rely on scientific and technological 
progress, and to adopt flexible measures and give different 
guidance to suit different local conditions. In localities with 
better conditions, we should concentrate resources to develop a 
number of high quality and efficiency enterprises; in frontier 
counties and townships, we should expedite the development of 
tertiary industries focused on border trade; and in remote poor 
areas, we should introduce commercial and trade activities and 
quicken the development of individual and private economic 
sectors. We should further strengthen macroeconomic guidance 
over village and township enterprises, resolutely closing 
enterprises with poor efficiency and going all out to support 
and create the conditions for enterprises with good efficiency 
so as to achieve a simultaneous increase in output value, sales 
volume, profits, and tax payments of village and township 
enterprises in Xinjiang. While building small rural towns and 
reforming the household registration system, we should pay close 
attention to the construction of small industrial and trade 
areas. 
  We should continue to assist the poor. On the basis of 
consolidating and raising the quality of current aid-to-the-poor 
work, we should unswervingly carry out state and regional 
policies and measures on assisting the poor. Particular 
attention must be paid to supervising, and formulating detailed 
rules for the implementation of the regional preferential 
policies for the four prefectures in southern Xinjiang, exerting 
every effort to fulfill the targeted requirement of making 94 
percent of the population cast off poverty. In addition to 
striving to win more state aid, we must also increase regional 
investments in poor areas, concentrating funds on reinforcing 
agricultural capital construction and improving communications, 
energy, and telecommunications. Meanwhile, we should encourage 
departments and enterprises in economically developed areas to 
assist their counterparts in poor areas, including economic 
cooperation and assistance in terms of scientific, 
technological, and intellectual resources. We should adopt 
special policies toward poor areas and further delegate 
authority to expedite their economic development and efforts to 
shake off poverty. 
<H5>  2. Seriously Do a Good Job in Industrial Production and </H5>
Transport and Improve Economic Efficiency in a Comprehensive Way 
  Accelerating the development of industrial production and 
transport is the key to achieving rapid and highly effective 
economic development. We must seize the opportunity to 
seriously improve the management and overall coordination of 
industrial production and transport services and promptly deal 
with new circumstances and new problems during the course of 
economic operations. It is particularly necessary for us to do 
a good job in coordinating the supply of energy, raw and 
processed materials, and funds and vigorously support the 
production of marketable products of good economic returns. A 
further step should be taken to improve management and marketing 
and increase the share of our industrial products in domestic 
and international markets. We must continue to improve the 
planning and management of railroad transport, increase the 
volume of highway transport to relieve the pressure on 
railroads, make overall arrangements for transporting goods 
eastward, and try in every possible way to complete this year's 
industrial production and transport tasks. We must attach great 
importance to the technological transformation of existing 
enterprises and promote their technical progress in an 
all-around way. We should concentrate our energies on the 
technological transformation of some basic industries and 
infrastructure. Those basic industries include light industy 
and the textile industries with cotton textiles and food as main 
products, the chemical industry with petrochemicals and 
sali-chemicals [yan hua gong 7770 0553 1562] as main products, 
the metallurgical industry with non-ferrous metal and high-grade 
steel as main products, and the construction industry with new 
building materials as main products; while the stress of 
infrastructural construction is on energy sources and 
telecommunications. To ensure good results from the 
technological transformation investment, we must pay attention 
to engineering quality, put completed projects to effective use, 
and strive to achieve desired objectives. We should accelerate 
the importation of advanced technology, make great efforts to 
promote the development of new products and the application of 
new technology by enterprises, and strive to enhance our 
competitive power in the market. We should step up 
technological transformation, ensuring that the total investment 
in technological transformation of state-owned enterprises in 
various localities exceeds 1.5 billion yuan this year. We 
should encourage enterprises to join national enterprise groups 
or transnational corporations. We should recommend that our good 
enterprises enter into cooperation with enterprises of other 
parts of China and attract investment from outside Xinjiang. We 
should boldly conduct experiments on leases and the auction and 
sale of shares of our enterprises, particularly our large and 
medium enterprises which have certain special strength. In this 
way, we will be able to divert some or all of the assets of 
existing enterprises to starting new industries and new 
enterprises, promoting the readjustment of the industrial 
structure, and increasing the scale of production. We should 
vigorously support the establishment and development of central 
enterprises and take advantage of their strength to attract more 
capital and technology investment from other parts of China and 
abroad. We should transform and develop a number of industries 
which are related to the exploitation of petroleum resources, 
and which will help local economic development. We should 
further deepen enterprise reform. We should seriously conduct 
experiments on a modern enterprise system and lay good 
groundwork for it. We should particularly pay attention to the 
implementation of the "Enterprise Law" and "Regulations on 
Transforming the Operational Mechanisms of State-Owned 
Industrial Enterprises" so as to make a breakthrough in changing 
the operational mechanisms of state-owned enterprises. We 
should seriously reappraise the stocks and assets of 
enterprises, define their property rights, and clarify the debts 
receivable and debts payable. We should resolutely stop 
unwarranted pooling of funds, arbitrary requisitioning of 
donations and exactinf fees from enterprises. We should speed 
up the establishment of the social security system and reduce 
the financial burden of enterprises. We should actively create 
the necessary conditions for developing the private economy and 
boldly develop it. We should enlarge the scale of enterprise 
operations and constantly increase the ratio of the individual 
and private sector in the national economy. 
<H5>  3. Step Up the Building of Infrastructural Facilities and </H5>
Basic Industries To Strengthen the Momentum for Economic 
Development 
  We should vigorously reform the investment system and 
gradually establish a financial investment system that is 
conducive to giving play to the basic role of the market in the 
allocation of resources under macroeconomic regulation and 
control. We should rationally define the scopes and 
responsibilities of the regional government and the local 
governments under it in investing in infrastructural facilities 
and public works, establish risk liabilities for corporate 
investment, and change procedures for the examination and 
approval of projects and for starting them; we should institute 
a system for reporting projects to higher authorities for the 
record and a system for registering new projects; we should 
accelerate the development of an investment market, improve the 
investment information feedback network, further expand the 
scale of using foreign capital, and raise funds for investment 
through various channels. 
  We should continue to readjust the investment structure and 
step up the building of key construction projects by investing 
more in them. Effective measures should be adopted to ensure 
the full or partial completion of the construction of the 
Lanzhou-Xinjiang Multiple-Track Railway, the Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi 
optical-fiber cable project, No. 8 Steelworks' extension 
project, and the Manas Power Plant's second-stage project this 
year as scheduled. We should do a good job in building the 
Dushanzi ethylene project, the second-stage Urumqi petrochemical 
polyester project, the Qingshuihe-Yining section of National 
Highway 312, and other key projects and make every possible 
effort to achieve planned progress. We should make full 
preparations for starting the construction of the Urumqi 
Airport's extension project, the high-grade Turpan-Urumqi- 
Dahuangshan Highway, the Urumqi No. 2 Petrochemical Fertilizer 
Plant, No. 9 generating unit of Xinjiang's Hongyanchi Power 
Plant, and the key Wuluwati irrigation project on schedule. We 
should work hard to extend the railway in southern Xinjiang, to 
plan the construction of the key Ertix River diversion project 
and a reservoir in southern Xinjiang, and to make preparations 
for the construction of the key Aksu River diversion project, 
the Jilintao Hydroelectric Power Station, the Hongyanchi No. 2 
Power Plant, the project for comprehensive use of Tarim natural 
gas, as well as other basic projects in agriculture, irrigation, 
communications, energy, important raw and semifinished materials 
which have an important bearing on the region's economy. Every 
effort should be made to successfully build key projects and 
reservoirs. 
<H5>  4. Vigorously Develop a Market Network and Further </H5>
Stimulate the Circulation of Commodities 
  We should stabilize and improve the existing management 
systems for agricultural and livestock products and continue to 
decontrol the management of such products. Agricultural and 
livestock products should be allowed to circulate through 
various channels. We should further reform the region's grain 
purchase and sale system. The autonomous region should continue 
to act according to the state requirements for "ensuring grain 
supply and decontrolling prices" and to implement the "six 
guarantees" and "four decontrols" [bao liu fang si 0202 0362 
2397 0934] policy. Grain selling prices should be decontrolled. 
The grain farmers cannot sell on the market will be purchased 
by state-owned grain departments without limits. The grain 
wholesale right is in the hands of the state-owned grain 
departments in order to ensure that most sources of grain are 
under state control. We should continue to improve the 
management systems for cotton and agricultural capital goods and 
strengthen market management. We should continue to do a good 
job in purchasing agricultural and livestock products and 
conscientiously implement various preferential policies in this 
regard. Banking, financial, and grain departments should 
coordinate closely with one another in raising funds and pay 
farmers and herdsmen for their products in full and on time. We 
should encourage and guide farmers and herdsmen to circulate 
their products on markets. As the markets for grain, cooking 
oil, cotton, fur, and other commodities are picking up, farmers 
and herdsmen should seize this opportunity to sell their 
products. We should quickly change the operating mechanisms of 
commodity-circulation enterprises and strive to make progress in 
implementing the shareholding system and the cooperative 
shareholding system in order to promote enterprises being owned 
by the state and managed and operated by individual people. We 
should develop chain stores step by step and make full use of 
commodity-circulation enterprises' favorable conditions. We 
should accelerate the reform of wholesale enterprises and work 
hard to open markets inside and outside the region, especially 
markets in rural and pastoral areas, so as to expand the 
circulation of commodities. 
  We should comprehensively accelerate the development of 
various kinds of markets, placing emphasis on cultivating 
markets for capital goods and factors of production and 
continuing the improvement of consumer goods markets. It is 
necessary to emphatically take good charge of the development of 
various kinds of wholesale markets, to consolidate and upgrade 
existing wholesale markets for grain, oil, meat, vegetable, and 
other bulk commodities, and to improve services and modes of 
transaction. In market cultivation, we must suit measures to 
local conditions, proceed from realities, and guard against 
building redundant markets. It is necessary to remove the 
barriers between different regions, as well as trade monopolies. 
We should implement the policy of simultaneously committing the 
state, collectives, domestic and foreign capital, as well as 
urban and rural areas, and work hard to secure diversified 
sources of investment in the markets. Departments in charge of 
industry, commerce, taxation, commodity prices, public health, 
urban development, and public security at various levels should 
make a concerted effort and provide the necessary policy 
support. We will then be able to really spur on local industry, 
invigorate the local economy, and make local people prosper with 
every market we set up somewhere, thus promoting distribution 
modernization in the region. 
  We should attach great importance to work related to 
commodity prices and keep price inflation strictly below the 
planned targets. We must view the current price inflation 
correctly and acquire a new mentality toward prices under market 
economic conditions. Because the market economy demands the 
optimization of resource use based on the principle of 
efficiency and open competition among products in accordance 
with the law of value, a rise in market prices within a certain 
limit would be an inevitable and normal phenomenon favorable to 
arousing production initiative and promoting economic 
development. Owing to the introduction of numerous price reform 
measures this year, it is very difficult to hold price inflation 
at around 10 percent under the dual impact of cost increases and 
demand-driven price hikes. We must under no circumstances take 
this lightly. We should keep the general retail price index of 
commodities in check while advancing price reform. It is 
particularly important to take effective measures to resolutely 
contain the rise in the price index of living costs. We should 
take prompt measures to earnestly resolve problems caused by 
rising prices. Efforts should be made to strengthen price 
control and inspection, to reduce intermediaries, to strictly 
prohibit unjustifiable price hikes, to crack down on cheating 
and monopolies on the market, and to investigate and deal with 
the illegal and ultra vires raising of prices in accordance with 
the law to conscientiously protect consumers' rights and 
interests. 
<H5>  5. Advance the Reform of the Fiscal and Banking Systems and </H5>
Take Earnest Charge of Financial and Monetary Work 
  Because new financial sources are limited while essential 
spending has expanded, the regional financial situation in 1994 
will be even grimmer and more difficult than in past years, and 
this situation will remain difficult to fundamentally change for 
quite some time. According to the budget drawn up under the new 
system, this year's spending will exceed revenue by 1.071 
billion yuan, of which the additional spending on wage reform 
alone accounts for more than 900 million. Coupled with deficits 
accumulated over the years, financial shortfalls for 1994 come 
to over 2 billion yuan. We must have a correct, clear 
understanding of the extent of financial difficulties ahead, 
attach great importance to financial problems, and take 
extraordinary measures to realistically increase revenue and cut 
spending, overcome difficulties, and properly settle the issue 
regarding a better livelihood. 
  Based on the principle of "survival first, construction 
second," we have to take strong measures to push down 
expenditures, accelerate organizational reform, streamline 
organs, reduce staff, divide personnel, and cut administrative 
and operating expenses. All party and government organs and 
institutions throughout the region should set up special wage 
funds to guarantee that personnel receive their wages first; the 
remaining funds, if any, may be used for other purposes. We 
should stop processing and the approving construction of various 
unproductive new buildings, halls, and premises, as well as 
various activity centers; resolutely curb unauthorized housing 
renovations, relentlessly eliminate the practice of throwing 
parties and offering gifts using public funds, strictly control 
the criteria for assigning vehicles to party and government 
organs at various levels and institutions and the number of 
vehicles to be allotted, firmly check the unhealthy practice of 
entering a race for buying luxurious cars, realistically cut 
down meeting expenses, rigidly control expenses to be incurred 
by personnel traveling abroad and performing official duties out 
of the town, and continue to exercise control over social group 
consumption, particularly the purchase of minicars. The five 
autonomous prefectures and six autonomous counties that will 
mark their 40th founding anniversary this year should 
realistically use their allotted subsidies for something 
beneficial to the masses. They may well make a change by 
presenting their concrete results in reform, opening up, and 
economic construction as gifts for the occasion. Various 
localities and departments, particularly leading cadres at 
various levels, should firmly foster the thinking of waging hard 
struggle, be prepared to lead a tough life for a long period, 
and resolutely check extravagance and waste. We should 
intensify the management of nonbudgetary funds, tighten 
financial and economic discipline, and creatively solve local 
financial difficulties through self-reliance and by increasing 
local revenues and reducing spending. 
  We should foster the concept of taking the situation as a 
whole, actively and steadily promote financial and taxation 
reforms in Xinjiang in accordance with the central authorities' 
uniform arrangements, accelerate the branching out of taxation 
mechanisms by setting up local taxation organs at various 
levels, properly handle relations between local and state tax 
bureaus, and strengthen tax imposition and collection to ensure 
a steady rise in the collection of revenue. Tax departments at 
various levels must act strictly according to the rules and must 
make tax calculations and collections as stipulated. Except for 
reductions and exemptions authorized by the Tax Law, all 
localities and departments have no power whatsoever to make any 
decision on this subject. We should eliminate practice of tax 
contracts in varied forms, vigorously clear overdue taxes and 
tax money retained by the banks, take serious actions against 
individuals and units found to be dodging and resisting taxes, 
see to it that the old tax system is being smoothly replaced by 
the new one, check possible tax "evasion, fraud, drips, and 
leaks" in the course of transition, make sure that all taxes to 
be collected this year go to the treasury in time and in full, 
actively support production and development, and promote a 
steady rise in revenue by nurturing more sources of taxes. 
  Efforts should be made to continue rectifying the financial 
order by steadily pushing forward the financial reform. Loaned 
capital obtained in violation of the rules will be recalled. We 
should firmly curb illegal fund-raising, indiscriminate 
investment, irrational fund outflows, unauthorized or covert 
interest rate increases, illegal financial institutions, and 
nonfinancial organizations conducting illegal financial 
business. We should establish a strong central bank regulatory 
system in accordance with the central authorities' uniform 
arrangements, steadily push forward the reform of state-owned 
commercial banks and rural financial setups, develop a 
cooperative bank system, further reform the insurance and 
foreign exchange system, and strengthen foreign exchange 
management. We will continue mobilizing the entire society to 
increase bank savings as much as possible, vigorously organize 
urban and rural savings, stabilize and increase bank deposits 
among enterprises and rural institutions, enliven capital funds, 
further rectify the "triangle debts," accelerate cash flows, 
enhance capital returns, actively readjust the credit structure, 
and energetically support local economic development. 
<H5>  6. Further Open Up to the Outside World, Promote the Greater </H5>
Development of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 
  We should take advantage of this opportune time of the major 
reform of the system of foreign trade, work hard to expand 
exports, increase foreign exchange income, and do a good job in 
spot trade. While continuing to promote the major export of 
traditional products such as cotton, we should strive to develop 
petrochemical and other key products which have a stable market. 
We should increase our competitive power in the international 
market, promote the export of new and high technology products, 
and actively increase the stock of commodities for export. We 
should do a solid job of building bases for producing 
export-oriented commodities. We should vigorously develop a 
diversified international market and take advantage of the local 
situation to develop the border trade. We should pay attention 
to the quality and fulfillment of contracts, reduce the 
favorable trade balance [jian shao shun cha 8096 1421 7311 
1567], strive to raise economic efficiency, and give full play 
to the important role of local and border trade in developing 
overall foreign trade. We should transform and improve the 
present specialized trading companies, and encourage companies 
with good conditions to form integrated large-scale enterprise 
groups combining industry, agriculture, technology, and trade 
through investment and participation in stock. These companies 
will jointly develop, produce, and operate in the form of an 
enterprise group with production and scientific research as the 
core and trade as the leading force, and develop international 
operations. By delegating the power of foreign trade operations 
and of doing business as agents to those units, we should create 
conditions for and encourage and guide these large and medium 
industry-commerce-trade enterprise groups to enter the 
international market and become the main force in earning 
foreign exchange. We should strive to form a pattern of foreign 
trade with multilevel and coordinated operations to connect with 
the international market. We should actively improve the 
investment environment and expand the scope of utilizing foreign 
capital and of economic and technological cooperation. We 
should further expand investment fields and attract more foreign 
investment. We should effectively strengthen the administration 
of foreign investment, increase the rate of actual investment, 
and do a good job of running present joint ventures. We should 
actively expand various ways of cooperation with neighboring 
countries and seriously run well enterprises in other localities 
with funds invested by Xinjiang. We should strengthen 
management and raise economic efficiency. We should expand 
lateral ties, open up wider, and extensively attract business 
from other locales. We should continue to run well the 1994 
Urumqi Trade Fair and find new ways to achieve breakthroughs. 
We should step up the construction of open cities, development 
zones, and cooperative zones in the region. We should fully 
utilize tourism resources, and accelerate the development of 
tourism in the autonomous region to earn more foreign exchange. 
We should improve facilities for and develop the border trade. 
<H5>  7. Speed Up Scientific and Technological Research, Make </H5>
Progress in Educational Work, and Promote Economic Development 
  We should attach importance to the role of science and 
technology as the primary productive force, constantly deepen 
the reform of the scientific and technological system, and 
promote a close link between science-technology and economic 
development. We should implement the policy of "development on 
the basis of stability" and accelerate the readjustment of 
scientific research organizations, the change of the operating 
mechanism, and the assignment of capable people. We should 
actively develop privately operated scientific and technological 
research organizations under different ownerships. We should 
encourage the integrated operation of science-technology, 
production and marketing, and continue to support 
science-technology personnel to set up, run, contract for, or 
lease enterprises at the county and township levels. We should 
step up the cultivation and establishment of the technologies 
market, develop science-technology consultative and information 
services, and develop intermediaries for the transfer of 
technologies. We should promote the compensatory transfer of 
technologies and speed up the transformation of scientific and 
technological findings into productive forces. We should 
extensively develop scientific and technological exchanges and 
cooperation based on mutual benefits. We should continue to 
carry out the 305 state projects and other scientific and 
technological projects. We should strive to properly develop a 
new- and high-technology development zone in Urumqi. We should 
find more ways to obtain funds for the development of science 
and technologies, and establish a new system for investment in 
science and technology through various channels and at various 
levels. 
  We must attach great importance to developing education. We 
must earnestly implement "China's Education Reform and 
Development Program" to accelerate the reform of China's 
education structure. We must gradually develop a new system 
that combines the efforts of the government, which assumes 
primary responsibility in education, and the efforts of all 
circles of society. We must further improve nine-year 
compulsory education, adopt effective measures to earnestly stop 
the increase in school dropout rates, and try to achieve the 
goal of universal elementary education as soon as possible. We 
must vigorously develop vocational technical education, 
primarily industry-operated schools, and adult education, 
primarily on-the-job training, to further eliminate illiteracy. 
We must continue to deepen higher educational reform and 
actively adjust college disciplines and courses based on the 
needs of the region's economic and social development. We must 
carry out a reform of student recruitment and graduates' 
employment systems. In light of the region's conditions, while 
advocating that both graduates and units meet face to face and 
choose as they see fit, we propose that this year's graduates 
receive job assignments primarily according to established 
plans. We must strengthen the management and building of the 
ranks of teachers according to the "Law Governing Teachers" and 
work hard to improve educational qualities. We must attach 
greater importance to the development of education for ethnic 
minorities and to the improvement of teaching materials of their 
cultures. We must vigorously promote work-study programs, make 
constant efforts to improve school conditions, and create a 
better environment for educating people. We must firmly 
cultivate an awareness of the importance of talents and develop 
a fine social ethic of respecting knowledge and talents in 
society. We must protect intellectual property rights and 
safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of scientific and 
technological personnel. 
<H5>  8. We Must Earnestly Make Adequate Arrangements To Meet the </H5>
People's Daily Needs and Work Hard To Improve Their Living 
  While attending to economic construction, leaders at all 
levels must pay attention to meeting the daily needs of people 
of all nationalities. We must provide adequate supplies of 
vegetables, nonstaple foods, and other daily essentials and keep 
their prices relatively stable. We must make earnest efforts to 
resolve difficulties encountered by people in outlying rural and 
pastoral areas in attending schools, seeking medical care, and 
drinking tap water. We must earnestly repair and rebuild unsafe 
primary and middle school buildings and build township (town) 
public health centers. We must continue our efforts to improve 
drinking water for disease prevention and bring our primary 
public health centers up to standard. We must resolve the 
problem of counties that still have no electricity. We must 
rebuild disaster-stricken areas. We must accelerate housing 
reform, raise more funds to build homes, and make earnest 
efforts to resolve housing problems encountered by people living 
in unsafe houses and houses with problems. We must step up 
urban construction and county and township road, postal, and 
telecommunications construction to improve people's living 
environment. We must continue to earnestly implement the 
relevant state and regional regulations on reducing peasants' 
and herdsmen's burdens to ensure an increase in their real 
income. We must concern ourselves with the livelihood of 
teachers at local schools, retired personnel, and workers of 
problem enterprises. We must continue to carry out labor 
employment work, give special care to disabled servicemen and to 
families of servicemen and revolutionary martyrs, make 
arrangements for Army cadres who are transferred to civilian 
work, and provide relief to impoverished urban and rural 
residents. We must attach greater importance to disabled 
people's welfare. 
<H5>  9. Make Use of the Xinjiang Production and Construction </H5>
Corps' Strong Points To Revitalize Its Various Undertakings 
  The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is an 
important component of the region. Promoting its development 
has a direct bearing on the region's overall task of reform, 
development, and social stability. It must continue to 
emphasize agriculture as the foundation of the region's economy. 
It must deepen the reform of its agricultural and pastoral 
farms, develop its economy, and increase workers' income. It 
must earnestly adjust the distribution of its production forces. 
The corps' armies and divisions shall concentrate on key large 
and medium enterprises while its farms shall focus on village 
and town enterprises. It shall develop new industries centering 
on the oil industry in southern Xinjiang and the mining industry 
in northern Xinjiang. It shall carry out the construction of 
roads, posts, telecommunications, and other infrastructures, as 
well as the construction of key projects. It shall gradually 
resolve the problem that some of its farms have no electricity. 
It shall deepen enterprise reform, carry out the technological 
transformation of its enterprises in groups, and raise their 
management standards. It shall open itself wider to the outside 
world, improve circulation, and help its farms, enterprises, and 
workers enter the market. It shall continue to strengthen 
science and technology as well as basic education, establish a 
sound social security system, and vigorously develop various 
social undertakings. It must continue to carry forward its 
glorious traditions of supporting local construction. People's 
governments and departments at all levels must also support the 
corps' construction as they did in the past and work hard to 
create fine conditions for its development. 
<H5>  Persistently "Grasping Two Links at the Same Time, Attaching </H5>
Equal Importance to Both" To Promote Comprehensive Social 
Progress 
  Establishing a socialist market economy and accelerating the 
modernization drive are a great historic task in the new period. 
To ensure the success of this unprecedented, pioneering task, 
we must uphold the policy of "grasping two links at the same 
time, attaching equal importance to both," earnestly strengthen 
socialist spiritual civilization, consolidate and develop 
political stability and unity, and promote all-around social 
progress. 
<H5>  1. We Must Continue To Promote Stability To Create a </H5>
Favorable Social Environment for Reform and Development 
  Without a stable social and political environment, reform, 
opening up, and modernization are out of question. We must 
firmly bear in mind Comrade Xiaoping's important thinking that 
"stability is the last word" and unwaveringly promote stability. 
Unity constitutes the foundation of stability. We must hold 
high the banner of great unity between all nationalities; 
persistently, extensively, and profoundly carry out propaganda 
and education on the Marxist view of nationalities and the 
party's nationalities policy among cadres and the masses of all 
nationalities, effectively launch activities to promote national 
unity and progress, and constantly strengthen and develop a 
socialist relationship characterized by equality, mutual 
assistance, unity, cooperation, and the common prosperity of all 
nationalities. We must do so to ensure that the hearts of the 
people of all nationalities are linked to each other and that 
they share a common fate. We must earnestly do a good job on 
matters related to nationalities and religions and 
comprehensively implement the party's policies toward 
nationalities and religions. We must conscientiously implement 
the "Law of the Regional Autonomy of Minority Nationalities" and 
pay particular attention to the training and promotion of ethnic 
minority cadres, especially specialized technical and managerial 
personnel. We must continue to launch activities to support the 
Army and give preferential treatment to families of 
revolutionary soldiers and martyrs as well as activities to 
support the government and cherish the people. We must 
conscientiously strengthen the unity between the military, 
government, civilians, local authorities, the Xinjiang 
Production and Construction Corps, and state enterprises. We 
must strengthen national defense education and enhance the 
people's national defense awareness. We must strictly 
distinguish between and correctly handle two different types of 
contradictions. We must earnestly study and promptly resolve 
new problems and contradictions that might appear as a result of 
interests redistribution and relations readjustment necessary in 
the process of in-depth reform. 
  National separatism still remains the principal threat to 
Xinjiang's stability. We must persistently and relentlessly 
carry out propaganda and education to oppose national separatism 
and safeguard the motherland's unification. We must trust and 
rely on cadres and the masses of all nationalities, take a 
clear-cut stand in struggling against a very few national 
separatists, and sternly crack down on the subversion, 
infiltration, and sabotage activities of hostile forces inside 
and outside Xinjiang. We must earnestly and comprehensively 
tackle problems of public order. We must do a good job of 
mobilizing the masses in maintaining public order and continue 
to uphold the policy of combining professional work with the 
mass line; of combining the efforts of the military, the police, 
and the people; and of combining crackdowns with prevention. We 
must mobilize all forces in society to maintain public order, 
perfect public security and crime-prevention systems, and 
enforce comprehensive crime-prevention measures down to the 
grass roots. We must further improve the method for managing 
the migrant population. We must bring into play the specialized 
functions of judicial, procuratorial, and public security organs 
and adopt effective measures to intensify the struggle against 
serious crime, concentrating on violent crimes and crimes 
committed by gangs. We must launch targeted struggle and 
control activities and punish, in accordance with the law, 
criminals endangering public order. We must firmly stop the 
momentum in the increase of major criminal cases and cases of a 
heinous nature. We must attach importance to strengthening 
militia and reserve forces and bring into full play their 
important role in safeguarding social stability. We must 
continually and persistently wage struggle against all kinds of 
social evils. 
<H5>  2. We Must Strengthen the Building of a Clean Government </H5>
and Continue To Deepen the Struggle Against Corruption 
  Strengthening the building of a clean government and 
combating corruption constitutes the essential condition for 
establishing a socialist market economy; it is also a major task 
vital to the fate of reform and the destiny of the party and 
country. Leading comrades at all levels must be fully aware of 
the importance, necessity, and long-term nature of the struggle 
against corruption and wage it constantly and relentlessly. We 
must further consolidate the achievements made by leading cadres 
in maintaining integrity and self-discipline and in 
investigating and rectifying their own misconduct. Leading 
cadres at all levels must be strict with themselves, consciously 
enforce central and regional regulations on strengthening party 
style and building a clean government, and take the lead in 
combating corruption. We must step up the investigation of 
major and important cases. We must step up our efforts to close 
the investigation of cases with irrefutable proof and with no 
doubts whatsoever, particularly major cases involving leading 
cadres at and above the county and department level, and 
promptly prosecute them. We must continue to control the wanton 
collection of fees and fines and the wanton apportioning of 
expenses and work and rectify unhealthy practices of various 
trades. We must particularly strengthen the supervision and 
inspection of administrative fees and set strict restrictions on 
the authority to approve their collection. 
<H5>  3. Strengthen the Building of Socialist Spiritual </H5>
Civilization and Foster Civilized, Forward-Looking Ethnic 
Standards 
  We should earnestly implement the guidelines of the national 
propaganda and ideology work conference, persist in arming 
people's minds with scientific theory, guide people with the 
correct public opinion, and portray people with a noble spirit. 
We should make ample use of newspapers, radio and television 
broadcasts, publications, and other mass media to publicize in 
depth Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics, and to continuously enhance the 
awareness, steadfastness, and creativity of the masses and 
cadres of all nationalities in implementing the party's basic 
theory and basic line. We should strengthen ideological and 
ethical education -- focusing on patriotism, collectivism, and 
socialism -- and educate the masses and cadres in the spirit of 
building up the country through thrift and hard work, in 
professional and social ethics, and in the basic national 
conditions. We should adhere to the orientation of serving the 
people and socialism and the principle of letting a hundred 
flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend in 
promoting flourishing socialist literature and art. To provide 
multitudinous fine-quality spiritual nourishment for the people 
of all nationalities, we should inherit and carry forward the 
fine traditions of national culture and art, and create more and 
better literary and artistic works a with novel style which 
reflect the spirit of the era of socialism, the rich flavor of 
life, and national characteristics. We should further enliven 
the masses' cultural life, bring radio and television broadcasts 
to a wider audience, broadcast more ethnic language programs, 
publish more books, especially books in ethnic languages, and 
step up efforts to preserve and use cultural relics. We should 
make social science theoretical research serve reform and 
development. We should strengthen the supervision over cultural 
markets according to the law and fight relentlessly against 
pornography, to further purify the social environment. In 
keeping with the requirements for establishing the new system, 
cultural, radio and television, and press and publications 
departments should mobilize the people of all nationalities to 
support and take part in reform, in guiding the attention of the 
masses and cadres to deepening reform and accelerating 
development, and in promptly giving guidance for solving 
problems related to ideology and understanding in the course of 
reform. 
  We should improve work related to physical culture, actively 
prepare for the participation in the Eighth National Games, and 
strive to stage a superior performance once again at this year's 
national games. We should make the third regional people's 
sports meet a great success and should make ample preparations 
for next year's eighth regional sports meet. We should launch 
extensive mass sports activities to improve the people's 
physique. We should deepen the reform of public health and 
actively explore a public health management system and operating 
mechanisms that are compatible with a socialist market economic 
structure. We should reform free medical care, experiment with 
a medical insurance system at selected points, and actively 
develop a sound rural cooperative medical system. We should 
earnestly improve medical ethics and the work style of medical 
personnel, publicize the fine traditions of healing the ill and 
rescuing the dying and of serving the people wholeheartedly, and 
foster a good image of medical personnel by improving the 
attitude and quality of service. We should energetically unfold 
the mass patriotic health campaign. We should reinforce family 
planning and strictly control the population from growing beyond 
the targeted rate. We should continue to implement the regional 
regulations governing family planning among minority 
nationalities in Xinjiang. We should increase environmental 
awareness and strengthen environmental protection by effectively 
implementing the target responsibility system on environmental 
protection and by properly handling the relationship between 
resource exploitation and ecological balance. 
<H5>  4. Actively and Yet Prudently Advance the Reform of the </H5>
Political System 
  We should change the functions of the government, strengthen 
macroeconomic regulation and control, and actively and yet 
prudently advance institutional and personnel reform in close 
conjunction with the establishment of a socialist market 
economic system. In line with the principles of separating the 
functions of the government from those of enterprises, 
simplifying structures, and promoting unity and efficiency, we 
should step up efforts to revise and perfect the general plan on 
institutional reform in the region, which, after approval by the 
central authorities, should be implemented as soon as possible. 
We should strive to complete institutional reform in 
regional-level organizations and have them converge with the 
national public service system before the end of this year. We 
should advocate the rational distribution of personnel by 
systematically dispatching a number of young office cadres to go 
down to replenish the grass roots. While carrying out 
institutional reform, we should rationalize relations, clearly 
define powers and functions, and strengthen the management and 
comprehensive coordination of various trades and professions. 
We should improve intermediary organizations, organize the 
establishment and development of accounting, auditing, and law 
offices and organizations for appraising assets and credits, and 
set up associations of trades and commercial organizations to 
help the government supervise economic activities. We should 
step by step establish and perfect a scientific personnel 
management system of different categories. 
  Strengthening the political construction of socialist 
democracy is the goal of the reform of the political structure 
as well as an important component of the effort to build 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. We should set up a 
sound decisionmaking system and procedures and constantly strive 
to place such a system and procedures on a more democratic and 
scientific footing so as to further harness the enthusiasm of 
the people of all nationalities in promoting reform, opening up, 
and modernization construction, and to effectively protect, 
guide, and mobilize such enthusiasm. Governments at all levels 
must conscientiously accept the supervision of people's 
congresses and their standing committees at the corresponding 
level. We should step up contacts with people's political 
consultative conferences and the democratic parties and bring 
into better play their role in political consultation and 
democratic supervision. We should earnestly handle suggestions 
from people's congress deputies and political consultative 
conference members. To continually broaden channels for the 
masses to take part in the administration and discussion of 
regional affairs, we should set up a sound system under which 
trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's federations, 
and other mass organizations can take part in the work of the 
government in a democratic manner. We should attach great 
importance to improving the legal system, ensuring the unity 
between reform and opening up on the one hand and improving the 
legal system on the other, and seeing to it that economic 
affairs are managed according to the laws. We must pay close 
attention to legislative planning; step up efforts to formulate 
regional laws and administrative rules for standardizing market 
norms, keeping the market in order, strengthening macroeconomic 
regulation and control, improving social security, and 
facilitating opening to the outside world; and promptly amend or 
abolish rules and regulations which prove inappropriate to the 
establishment of a socialist market economic structure. We 
should step up publicity on the legal system to increase the 
whole society's awareness of laws and the legal system. 
Governments at all levels must exercise their powers and do 
things according to the law. We should strengthen the 
construction of law-enforcement personnel, enhance their 
competence and quality of law enforcement, and establish a sound 
law-enforcement supervisory system and legal service 
organizations to provide legal norms and a guarantee for the 
socialist market economy. 
<H5>  5. Further Emancipate Minds To Effectively Improve Work Style </H5>
  To fulfill this year's heavy tasks in reform and 
development, 
we must firmly establish the ideological line of emancipating 
minds and seeking truth from facts, and must dare to do away 
with the outdated ideas of self-enclosure and of sticking to 
conventional practices. Work in all fields must surround, be 
subordinate to, and serve the center of economic construction. 
We must dare to experiment with and explore new reforms using 
the "three conducives" as the criterion for judging the merits 
or demerits and right or wrong of a reform measure. Leaders at 
all levels should set a good example in emancipating minds and 
should carry out work in a creative manner in light of the 
actual condition of each locality. Governments at all levels 
and their functioning departments, and leading cadres in 
particular, must go deep into the grass roots to energetically 
conduct investigations and studies. They must make a determined 
effort to overcome bureaucratism and formalism and work hard to 
free themselves from "mountains of official documents and oceans 
of meetings." In line with Comrade Jiang Zemin's instruction on 
"studying more and socializing less; investigating and studying 
more and airing less subjective views; and doing more concrete 
work and making less empty talk," we must make relentless 
efforts to seek truth from facts, deal with concrete matters, 
and implement policies and measures. Policies, measures, and 
decisions already adopted by the autonomous region must be 
supervised by concerned officials and implemented to the letter. 
Leading cadres at all levels must always bear in mind the 
fundamental objective of serving the people of all nationalities 
wholeheartedly, earnestly heed the opinions of the masses, be 
ready to look into their feelings, show concern for their 
hardships, conduct meticulous and penetrating ideological work 
among the masses, and strive to solve practical problems 
concerning the masses' vital interests, seeing to it that they 
accomplish several concrete tasks for the masses each year 
during their tenure. As long as we closely rely on the masses 
and forge close ties with them, our work in all fields of 
endeavor will be invincible. 
  Fellow deputies, we are facing glorious and yet arduous 
tasks, but we are full of hopes and confidence in Xinjiang's 
future. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and led by the party 
Central Committee, the State Council, and the regional party 
committee, let us adhere to the party's basic line, unite and 
rely on the people of all nationalities, aim at Xinjiang's 
development, make a determined effort at reform, and work hard 
with one heart and one mind to establish a socialist market 
economic structure and to develop Xinjiang's economy with rapid 
speed and high efficiency!

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Two senior leaders of 
non- governmental organizations of the Chinese mainland and 
Taiwan reached three points of common understanding here today 
on a boat-fire accident on Qiandao Lake in east China's Zhejiang 
Province on March 31, which resulted in the death of 24 
Taiwanese and eight mainlanders. 
  Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of the Association for 
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), based in the 
mainland, met here this afternoon with Shih Chi-ping, deputy 
secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) based 
in Taiwan. 
  After the meeting, Tang told reporters that they had reached 
the following three points of common understanding: 
  First, both held that it is necessary to make all efforts to 
step up the investigation of the accident and carry it through 
to the end to find out the truth of the accident and make it 
public by suitable means. 
  Second, it is agreed in principle that the two organizations 
should as soon as possible exchange opinions on incidents 
involving the lives and damage to property of compatriots on the 
mainland and Taiwan. Only after necessary preparations are made 
can it be decided when and where such a meeting is to be held. 
  Third, both held that it is necessary for both organisations 
to do all they can to clear up the negative effects of the 
boat-fire accident on exchanges between the two sides of the 
straits. 
  Tang Shubei said that after the facts of the accident have 
been established, ARATS will inform SEF. 
  As to the proposal of Secretary-General Shih Chi-ping that 
the two organizations should exchange within ten days at a third 
place their opinions on the incidents involving the lives and 
the damages to property of compatriots on both sides of the 
straits, Tang Shubei said that the ARATS will give an official 
answer after studying the proposal. 
  Tang Shubei stressed that the boat fire was merely a sudden 
accident and therefore could not and should not impede the 
development of the relations between the two sides of the 
straits. 
  He noted that the exchanges across the straits benefit the 
people on both sides, stressing that anybody trying to use an 
accident as an excuse to impede these exchanges would be going 
against the interests of the people on both sides of the straits. 
  As a matter of fact, Tang pointed out, leaders of the 
Central 
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State 
Council have paid close attention to the accident. 
  They ordered the leaders of Zhejiang Provincial Committee of 
the CPC and Zhejiang provincial government to deal with the 
aftermath of the accident properly and to go all out to 
investigate the accident together with the Ministry of Public 
Security. 
  Meanwhile, Tang said, many other relevant departments went 
into action immediately after the accident and have done a lot 
of work. They have tried to respect the will of the family 
members of the victims and provided them with help. 
  However, Tang pointed out, since the two sides of the 
straits 
have been isolated from each other for over four decades, they 
have now different regulations and habits in dealing with the 
aftermath of accidents. 
  As a result, the compatriots from Taiwan may not accept 
completely the ways of dealing with the aftermath of the 
accident on the mainland and the mainland side may not 
understand completely the will of the family members of the 
victims. 
  Therefore, it is hard to avoid that the family members of 
some victims from Taiwan have complaints against the departments 
concerned on the mainland in dealing with the aftermath of the 
accident. 
  Tang reaffirmed that the lives and property of compatriots 
from Taiwan are safeguarded on the mainland just as those of the 
mainlanders and no discrimination is allowed, according to the 
law of China. 
  Of course, Tang admitted, the mainland should further 
improve 
the environment of tourism and better guarantee the safety of 
the lives and property of tourists from Taiwan. 
  He pointed out that if anybody, using guesswork, makes 
irresponsible or even insulting speeches, he could only enhance 
the sense of non-confidence among the compatriots on both sides 
of the straits. 
  This not only could not lead to the solution of the problem, 
but might also deteriorate the relations already established 
between the two sides of the straits, Tang said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by reporter Li Xiaozhun (2621 1321 6150): "The </F>
Qiandao Hu Incident Should Not Impair Cross-Strait Ties"] 
  [Text] Hong Kong, 7 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- The 
incident of the death of Taiwan compatriots on the Qiandao Hu in 
Zhejiang has shocked, and attracted the attention of, the 
country and the whole world. Taiwan public opinion had hoped 
that the mainland side would try its best to deal with the 
aftermath of the incident, quickly discover the cause of the 
incident, and make the greatest possible efforts to console the 
relatives of the dead. All these demands are reasonable. 
However, before the whole thing has come to light, it evidently 
is not cool-headed enough and is emotional, with efforts made 
only to criticize the mainland for intentionally withholding the 
truth and even to incite the termination of cross-strait 
exchanges and relations. The Taiwan authorities also have made 
the decision to stop sending tourist groups to the mainland. 
  In the course of Taiwan compatriots making tours of the 
mainland in recent years, the Baiyun Airport incident, the 
Putian road accident, and several other incidents have occurred 
as a result of natural calamities or human negligence. These 
accidents have done considerable damage to tourism of both sides 
of the strait, and in particular, they have left irremediable 
sadness among the family members of the dead. On neither side 
of the strait do compatriots wish to see such accidents. This 
is particularly so in the case of the recent Qiandao Hu 
incident, in which 24 Taiwan compatriots and eight mainland 
compatriots died. Such a tremendous misfortune, and the 
reaction and resentment triggered by it among various circles in 
Taiwan, are understandable. It stands to reason that family 
members of the dead have put forward -- before the cause of the 
accident has been clarified -- various questions; some demands, 
including demands that are not quite realistic; and blame in 
severe terms. 
  According to media reports, the current Qiandao Hu incident 
is quite odd and human causes are not ruled out. However, there 
are many questionable points in the incident which cannot be 
proved for a short while yet, and the side concerned should be 
given enough time to carry out a careful investigation. Media 
reports on the recent incident show that in handling the 
incident, both sides of the strait have shortcomings. The 
mainland side did not have sufficient transparency in carrying 
out its investigation and making proofs, did not appropriately 
satisfy the demands put forward by family members of the dead, 
and was not skillful enough in its approach. As a result, the 
relatives of the dead were full of doubts, misgivings, 
criticism, and blame, and the outside world raised many 
questions. The mainland side should speedily examine those 
aspects and improve them. 
  On the other hand, Taiwan's organizations concerned did not 
confine the discussion to the matter at issue, and vicious 
criticism is not the way to solve problems. Moves such as 
making the decision to terminate tourist exchanges between the 
two sides of the strait and declaring the mainland a high-risk 
region for tourism were even more emotional. The Qiandao Hu 
incident was only an unfortunate incident in which Taiwan 
compatriots died while making a tour on the mainland. Both 
sides should coolly and reasonably make joint efforts to deal 
with the aftermath of the incident, and should not magnify it. 
Still less should political color be intentionally applied to 
this purely chance occurrence in the people's livelihood, nor 
should the development of relations between the two sides be 
impeded. Otherwise, things will not accord with the aspirations 
of compatriots on the two sides of the strait.

<F P=106> [Station editor (Yi Qing) commentary: "Direct Three </F>
Exchanges Inevitable if Mainland and Taiwan Join GATT"; from the 
"News and Current Events" program] 
  [Text] If the mainland and Taiwan join the GATT, there will 
be a positive effect for realizing the three exchanges 
[exchanges of mail, trade, and air and shipping services]. 
GATT's regulations forbid member nations and regions from 
obstructing trade exchanges with each other, and it will also be 
impossible to erect trade barriers even if they want to do so 
because doing so constitutes a violation of GATT's regulations. 
  At present, opinions in Taiwan vary regarding the adoption 
of 
measures to cope with the cross-strait relationship following 
the accession to GATT. At a meeting of senior party and 
government officials in early March, Li Denghui [Li Teng-hui) 
noted that Taiwan is feeling great pressure to effect early 
direct exchanges with the mainland as the time for Taiwan's 
joining GATT draws closer and also keeping in mind the 
requirements for transforming Taiwan into a trading center in 
Asia and the Pacific. He, however, pointed out the need for the 
government to develop the cross-strait relationship by adhering 
to the principles and process of the state reunification plan 
and for applying the exclusion clause so that it will be 
impossible for Communist China to find fault with Taiwan's 
commitment to GATT. 
  Taiwan's commercial and industrial circles, media, and some 
legislators have long questioned the adherence to the principles 
and process of the state reunification plan in developing 
cross-strait relations; they suggested revising the plan to 
realize direct trade, shipping and air services, and mail 
between the two sides of the strait at an early date. At 
interpellation sessions, many legislators asked: If there are 
no direct shipping and air links between the two sides, and if 
there is no direct free flow of goods between the two sides, 
then how can Taiwan put GATT's spirit of free trade into 
practice following the accession to GATT? Therefore, they 
called on the authorities to be pragmatic in dealing with 
cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and to not be bound by 
the inflexible state reunification plan. 
  To realize the three exchanges, they also called on the 
mainland and Taiwan to recognize each other as political 
entities. 
  Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade said that by citing the 
exclusion clause, Taiwan businessmen may trade directly with the 
mainland and invest in the mainland. Xiao Wanchang [Vincent 
Siew], chairman of Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and 
Development, said that in dealing with the mainland, Taiwan may 
not have to resort to the exclusion clause and added that 
Taiwan's response is contingent upon how the communists play the 
card. 
  Gao Konglian [Kao Kung-lien], vice chairman of the Mainland 
Affairs Council, recently said that if the cross-strait 
relationship has entered the medium-term stage as stipulated in 
the state reunification plan following the accession to GATT, 
then the three exchanges between the two sides of the strait 
will of course have no problems. But he also stressed that 
there is no absolute relationship between Taiwan and the 
mainland joining GATT and the entering of the medium-term stage 
of the cross-strait relationship. In pointing out his ambiguous 
remarks, Taiwan's media said that Gao Konglian has further 
complicated the issue. 
  Because of pressures from various sides, the Taiwan 
authorities still have not adopted a clear-cut attitude in 
dealing with the cross-strait relationship following the 
accession to GATT. Because the aim of joining GATT is to 
converge with the international economy and to pursue the 
greatest economic benefits, more and more people on the island 
are beginning to question the inflexible state reunification 
plan. Following its accession to GATT, Taiwan will have to 
address the issue of the three direct exchanges.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Taiwan Businessman Flees With $92,000"] </F>
  [Text] A Taiwan businessman fled Fuzhou last week after 
taking away an estimated 800,000 yuan ($91,955) and leaving 
behind an empty factory and more than 60 workers with no food 
and no place to live. 
  Cai Shunming, a native of Taoyuan County in Taiwan, stopped 
production at the Fuzhou Daguang Paper Products Company Limited 
on March 31, saying he was giving workers a six-day leave for 
Ching Ming Festival, when Chinese commemorate the dead. 
  Most workers left for home. But the remaining 60 female 
workers knew the next day their boss had fled town when they 
discovered the kitchen air blower had been stolen and everything 
in Cai's office removed, according to China Business Times. 
  The company, which was founded last March in the city's 
Xindian Town, manufactured tin foil. It purchased raw materials 
in China and sold products overseas. 
  The tin foil products were made by hand by some 300 women 
hired from places as far away as Shandong Jiangxi, Sichuan and 
Fujian provinces. 
  When the Taiwan businessman skipped town, he was three 
months 
behind in payments to his workers and was in arrears for about 
110,000 yuan ($12,650) in rent to the local industrial zone, the 
newspaper stated. 
  Before skipping town, Cai subjected his workers to inhuman 
conditions according to newspaper reports. 
  He locked the factory gate daily and forced workers to do 
more than 10 hours manual labour daily, some workers said. 
  Four or five women had to share two single beds nightly by 
putting them together. They were forced to take cold-water 
baths. They only had porridge and vegetables for three meals 
daily. 
  Cai refused to admit visitors, including local leaders, on 
the pretext of being a solely Taiwan-funded enterprise, the 
China Business Times quoted a local leader as saying. 
  The Fuzhou city government is now handling the case and 
trying to make proper arrangements for the workers.

  [Text] Hangzhou, 9 Apr (XINHUA) -- Relatives of the 24 
Taiwan compatriots who perished in a fire on a pleasure boat on 
Qiandao Lake left for Taiwan via Hong Kong at 1000 this morning. 
Their departure marked a temporary close to the efforts dealing 
with the aftermath of the accident. 
  On 31 March, a fire broke out on the "Hairui" pleasure boat 
in Chunan County, Zhejiang Province. All 32 people aboard the 
boat -- 24 Taiwan tourists, two guides, and six crew members -- 
were killed. Over the past few days, officials of Hangzhou city, 
Zhejiang Province, in charge of dealing with the aftermath had 
several discussions with relatives of the Taiwan victims on the 
cremation of the bodies. Taking into account the wishes of the 
victims' relatives and the customs of Taiwan, the departments 
concerned did their best in making the most appropriate 
arrangements. On the afternoon of 6 April, all the bodies of 
the dead Taiwan compatriots were placed in coffins, and the 24 
coffins were immediately shipped to a funeral parlor in Tonglu 
County. 
  The remains of the dead Taiwan compatriots were cremated 
yesterday morning. At about 0900, some 50 relatives of the 
victims held a memorial service in Tonglu for the deceased. 
Afterward, they bowed to the employees of the funeral parlor 
and to the personnel in charge of handling the aftermath to 
express their gratitude. Possessions left behind by the 
deceased which had been recovered so far were claimed by the 
victims' relatives. Lin Weiyang, deputy manager of Taiwan's 
Changfeng Tourist Agency and who took part in the handling of 
the remains from beginning to end, said that he was satisfied 
with the assistance offered to the victims' relatives by the 
relevant provincial and city authorities. He told reporters: 
"The mainland authorities in charge of dealing with the 
aftermath have done what they could. We all did our best, and 
the rest remains in the hands of God. May the deceased soon 
rest in peace." 
  Zhejiang Vice Governor Liu Xirong made two special trips -- 
on the day of the Qingming Festival [5 April] and today before 
the relatives' departure -- to meet the victims' relatives and 
to express his condolences. On behalf of the provincial and 
city governments, he expressed profound condolences and 
heartfelt sympathy to the victims' relatives. He said: "We all 
are people of Chinese descent. The sorrow of Taiwan compatriots 
is our sorrow, and their consolation is our consolation. Please 
convey my regards to the other relatives back in Taiwan."

  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Taiwan investment in 
Mainland China is expected to drop as both the government and 
the private sector reacted strongly to Beijing's callous 
handling of the Qiandao (Thousand Island) Lake boat disaster. 
  Twenty-four Taiwan tourists, long with six mainland crew 
members and two guides, were killed in a fire aboard a cruise 
ship in Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province March 31. Most of the 
bodies were burned beyond recognition. 
  Mainland authorities withheld information on the cause of 
the 
disaster and refused to give Taiwan reporters access to the 
site. They performed autopsies on the bodies without consulting 
relatives of the victims and restricted the movement of the 
grieving relatives who rushed to the site after the disaster. 
  In response to the inept handling of the disaster, the 
Ministry of Economic Affairs announced Saturday [9 April] that 
the government will not consider at the moment allowing domestic 
manufacturers to build industrial parks in the mainland. 
  The establishment of industrial complexes on the mainland, 
requiring a large capital outlay, is of little help to the 
upgrading of Taiwan's industrial base, said Yin Chi-ming, 
director general of the ministry's Industrial Development Bureau. 
  Excluding land costs, Yin elaborated, development costs for 
a 
100-hectare industrial zone are estimated at NT$2 billion 
(US$75.47 million). 
  It is inappropriate for Taiwan investors to make such big 
investments in Mainland China, where political and economic 
risks are relatively high, he pointed out. 
  Once the mainland's investment climate improves, the bureau 
will consider approving industrial zone investment on a 
case-by-case basis, he added. 
  Meanwhile, the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Business 
Development 
Foundation decided to cancel a delegation's scheduled visit to 
Hainan island in mid-April. 
  The delegation, comprising several legislators and 
representatives of a dozen listed companies here, originally 
planned to investigate Hainan's investment environment. 
  The prestigious wealth magazine followed suit, canceling a 
"securities tour of Mainland China" slated to begin in late 
April, in protest against Beijing's inhumanity in handling the 
Qiandao Lake disaster. 
  The small and medium enterprises association issued a 
statement, lambasting Beijing's neglect of human rights and 
urging Taiwan investors to avoid the mainland market. 
  Li Cheng-chia, president of the association, said that 
domestic manufacturers should not invest or increase investments 
in Mainland China until after Beijing authorities respond to 
questions posed by the boat disaster. 
  Some domestic enterprises including Rosa Foods Co., Ltd. 
have 
shelved their mainland investment projects to condemn Beijing's 
flagrant violations of human rights.

  [Text] Taipei, April 13 (CNA) -- Despite the current wave 
of boycotts against exchanges with Mainland China, a leading 
plastics producer in Taiwan has decided to go ahead with its 
investment projects there. 
  Nan Ya Plastics Corp. announced following a shareholders' 
meeting Tuesday [12 April] that the company will channel NT$710 
million (U.S.$26.79 million) into the mainland for five 
investment projects. 
  As an affiliate of the renowned Formosa Plastics Group, Nan 
Ya's investment plans have become the focus of attention here. 
  The five projects include a soft PVC [polyvinyl chloride] 
roller-press factory in Guangzhou, PVC pipe factories in Anhui, 
Shangdong, and Fujian Provinces, and a PVC fitting factory in 
Guangdong Province, a company spokesman said. 
  The spokesman noted that the investment plans, which will 
take the form of joint ventures among Nan Ya, other Taiwan 
plastics producers, and their mainland counterparts, will be 
soon submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. 
  If all goes well, he said, the soft PVC roller-press factory 
in Guangzhou will begin production next June. 
  Nan Ya made the decision to open plants on the Mainland at 
the request of downstream plastics producers, many of which have 
relocated to the Mainland and rely on Nan Ya for raw materials, 
he said. 
  Formosa Plastics Chairman Y.C. Wang declined comment on Nan 
Ya's Mainland investment plans. 
  Meanwhile, the domestic business community is still outraged 
at Beijing's inhumane handling of the March 31 Qiandao Lake 
disaster, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed. 
  Both the National Federation of Industries and the General 
Chamber of Commerce called on domestic manufacturers not to 
visit the mainland until Beijing authorities clear up questions 
surrounding the incident. 
  The federation's planned trip to northern Mainland China in 
May was also canceled, and preparations for a seminar on 
business arbitration across the Taiwan Strait were suspended. 
  Taiwan investors must join hands to press Mainland China to 
ensure protection of Taiwan tourists, investors and their 
property on the mainland, Chamber of Commerce President Wang 
Yu-cheng said.

  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Civilian groups went into 
action Saturday [9 April] to protest against Beijing's handling 
of the Lake Qiandao disaster, in which 24 Taiwan tourists 
perished aboard a cruise boat. 
  Li Hsi-yang, president of the Taipei chapter of the Junior 
Chamber of Commerce, said his group would call on Taiwan 
residents to suspend trips to the mainland and Taiwan business 
people to suspend investment there. 
  Li said the news about how Beijing handled the incident 
would 
be relayed to 800,000 Jaycees worldwide in six languages. 
  He added that the Chamber would not rule out the possibility 
of joining hands with other international groups such as the 
Lions Club and Rotary Club in order to inform the world of the 
disaster and Beijing's shoddy handling of the case. 
  He also said he would urge people here to send letters to 
their overseas friends, calling attention to what he said was 
Beijing's reckless attitude toward human life. 
  Meanwhile, Yeh Chi-tien, a singer-turned-legislator, Ko 
Chun- 
hsiung, chairman of the actors association, along with Hung 
Yen-hui, chairman of the recording association, said at a press 
conference that they would call for all Taiwan entertainers to 
stop performing in Mainland China. 
  Yeh said that he would ask the actors association to send 
letters to their counterparts in the United States, Japan and 
Korea for their help in boycotting Beijing. 
  The Chinese New Party sponsored a signature drive to express 
its support and sympathy to the families of the 24 victims and 
as a protest against Beijing.

  [Text] Taipei, April 9 (CNA) -- Southeast Asian countries 
have indicated a strong willingness to strengthen financial 
cooperation with the Republic of China [ROC], Samuel C. Shieh, 
governor of the Central Bank of China (CBC), said Saturday [9 
April]. 
  "The willingness was repeatedly expressed when central bank 
governors of major Southeast Asian countries met here earlier 
this week," Shieh said. 
  The participants, he stressed, had been deeply impressed by 
Taiwan's dynamic economy during three days of discussions. 
  Central bank governors from the forums's nine member states 
-- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, 
Sri Lanka, South Korea, Nepal and the host ROC -- participated 
in the discussions April 6-8 about how to promote regional 
financial cooperation. Cambodia, Fiji, Laos, and Tonga also 
attended the event as observers. 
  With the economic and trade ties between Taiwan and 
Southeast 
Asian countries growing closer, strengthening of financial 
cooperation is necessary, Shieh said. 
  As to complaints of financial investment barriers set by 
Southeast Asian countries, he said those countries are already 
pushing for the easing of restrictions on the establishment of 
branches by foreign banks. 
  ROC investment in Southeast Asia totals around US$16.5 
billion, making Taiwan a major capital supplier to the region. 
  The central bank governors exchanged views on topics ranging 
from international currency cooperation, world economic reports, 
currency policies of the countries in the region, foreign 
exchange management and financial outlooks. 
  The forum, a government-level regional financial cooperation 
organization founded in 1966, will meet in Nepal next year.

  [Text] Taipei, April 12 (CNA) -- The 13th economic and 
technical cooperation meeting Between Taiwan and Saudi Arabia 
opened at the Ministry of Economic Affairs Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Addressing the opening ceremony, Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister S.J. Li said that this session of the Sino-Saudi 
Permanent Joint Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation 
aims to review bilateral cooperation between the two countries. 
  Li pledged that the two countries "will join hands to make 
the best use of what the other can offer in creating the 
greatest well- being for the people." 
  Li represents Taiwan at the meeting, while the 30-member 
Saudi Arabian delegation is led by Ibrahim Bin Salamah, a vice 
minister and concurrently vice chairman of the semi-official 
Saudi Arabia Basic Industry Corporation. 
  The meeting will focus discussion on trade, investment, and 
economic cooperation. 
  The meeting, which will continue through Wednesday, marks 
the 
first vice ministerial-level contact in Taipei since the two 
countries suspended diplomatic relations in July 1990. The last 
meeting was held in Riyadh 1992. 
  Meanwhile, a seminar on Saudi Arabia's investment climate, 
sponsored by the Taipei-based Sino-Arabian Cultural and Economic 
Association, will be held at the Taipei International Convention 
Center Wednesday. 
  This will also be the first time such a seminar has taken 
place here since 1990. 
  The two delegation leaders to the economic and technical 
cooperation meeting will be invited to the seminar, which aims 
to lure Taiwan manufacturers to Saudi Arabia and to promote 
business alliances between the two countries. 
  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has long been one of Taiwan's 
most important trading partners. Taiwan exported about US$500 
million worth of products to the kingdom last year, while 
imports from the kingdom totaled US$1.5 billion.

  [Text] Washington, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi arrived here this 
afternoon at the invitation of U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald 
H. Brown. 
  Wu is in Washington to co-chair with Brown the Eighth 
Session 
of the Sino-U.S. Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade to be 
held Wednesday and Thursday [13 and 14 April] and to conduct 
consultations on how to further expand bilateral trade and 
economic cooperation and other related issues. 
  A 37-member Chinese Government economic and trade delegation 
led by Wu took part in a Sino-U.S. trade and investment 
opportunity conference in Los Angeles before flying to 
Washington, D.C. and will attend a similar event in New York 
next week. 
  As she arrived at Washington's Dulles Airport Wu said that 
the "considerable progress" made in Sino-U.S. trade and economic 
ties had "brought enormous benefits" to both nations since the 
two countries established diplomatic relations. 
  However, she noted that bilateral trade and economic 
relations are still plagued by some problems and difficulties, 
whose solutions require the joint efforts of the governments, 
statesmen, business communities and people in all walks of life. 
  Wu was hopeful, she said, that the Sino-U.S. Seattle summit 
last November could be used as a starting point to maintain and 
boost high-level contact and exchanges between the two countries 
in all fields, strengthen mutual understanding, expand common 
interests, reduce and eliminate differences and bring bilateral 
relationships, including trade and economic aspects, back to 
healthy development.

  [Text] Seoul, April 12 (XINHUA) -- South Korean National 
Assembly Speaker Yi Man-sop today expressed appreciation for 
China's achievements made since the implementation of the 
open-door policy. 
  Yi made the statement when meeting with Wu Xueqian, 
vice-chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference (PPCC). 
  Yi said China's success is attributable not only to the 
resolute determination of the Chinese Government to carry out 
the open-door policy but also to the support of the Chinese 
people. Yi visited China in January. 
  Both sides said they are satisfied with the development of 
bilateral relations since the diplomatic relations were 
established in August 1992. 
  They hold that fuller cooperation between the two sides will 
be conducive to mutual prosperity. 
  South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) Leader 
Kim Chong-pil will host a dinner in honor of Wu later today. 
  Wu arrived here Sunday for an eight-day goodwill visit at 
the 
invitation of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu.

<F P=106> [By reporter Feng Xiuju (7458 4423 5468)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- President Jiang Zemin 
met with Portuguese Prime Minister Silva at Zhongnanhai this 
afternoon. The two leaders expressed full confidence in the 
continuous growth of bilateral relations and the smooth 
implementation of the Sino- Portuguese Joint Declaration on the 
Macao Question. 
  Jiang Zemin recalled with delight the good impression he had 
of Portugal when he visited that country last November. He 
said: "We appreciate Prime Minister Silva's positive efforts at 
developing Sino-Portuguese friendly and cooperation relations." 
  He said: Despite the geographical distance and different 
social systems, China and Portugal share common interests in 
safeguarding world peace and stability, as well as common needs 
to develop bilateral cooperation. 
  He expressed the belief that so long as the two countries 
observe the principles of mutual respect, equality, and mutual 
benefit, bilateral relations will grow continuously. 
  Turning to the Macao question, Jiang Zemin said: During His 
Excellency Prime Minister Silva's visit to China in 1987, he 
signed with the Chinese Government a document of great 
importance, that is, the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on 
the Macao Question. Since the joint declaration was signed and 
since it entered into force, the two countries have cooperated 
in seriously implementing it. Facts show that the joint 
declaration has laid a solid foundation for Macao's stable 
development and the friendly cooperation between the two 
countries on the Macao question. It has also set a good example 
for the peaceful settlement of problems left over from history 
between two countries. 
  Jiang Zemin said: Only five or more years remain in Macao's 
transitional period. The work facing China and Portugal is 
arduous; and the two countries should expedite the solution to a 
number of questions. 
  He said: So long as China and Portugal step up consultations 
and cooperate closely, the two countries will certainly be able 
to properly solve various questions during the transitional 
period. 
  The Portuguese prime minister said: Since the signing of the 
Portuguese-Chinese Joint Decclaration on the Macao Question, the 
two countries have conducted fruitful cooperation in 
implementing it, while smoothly expanding friendly cooperation 
in other areas. 
  He said: Portugal and China share identical views on many 
international issues, face an identical task of improving the 
people's living standards, and have common interests in solving 
the Macao question. "We hope the visit will further promote 
cooperation between the two countries in the political, 
economic, and scientific fields." 
  Jiang Zemin asked Silva to convey his greetings to 
Portuguese 
President Soares. 
  Peng Qingyuan, executive vice chairman of the Kuomintang 
Revlutionary Committee Central Committee; Liu Xiliang, head of 
the Chinese Government Reception Committee and vice minister of 
radio, film, and television; and Jiang Enzhu, vice minister of 
foreign affairs; were present at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (AFP)--Leading Chinese dissident 
Xu Wenli was released here Tuesday after spending five days in 
police detention for apparent parole violations, a friend of 
Xu's said. 
  Xu, a leader of the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement and one 
of China's longest serving political prisoners, had been 
detained Friday as part of a police sweep of dissidents in 
Beijing and Shanghai that coincided with the visit of French 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  Journalists were prevented from entering Xu's home Tuesday 
evening by uniformed and plainclothes police. There was no 
official confirmation of the release by the Chinese authorities, 
who said Monday that they were continuing "investigations" into 
Xu and China's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng who was 
detained April 1. 
  According to the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry, Xu was 
detained for having "violated the terms of his parole." Xu, 
49, was released on parole in May last year after serving 12 
years of a 15-year sentence for "counterrevolutionary" crimes. 
  The detention of Xu -- who has always had a strong interest 
in France and, in particular, its revolutionary history -- was 
an embarrassing snub to the French Government during Balladur's 
visit. It was also followed by the detention of three dissidents 
-- Wang Fucheng, Bao Ge, and Yang Zhou -- in Shanghai, when 
Balladur visited the eastern Chinese city after Beijing. 
  All three dissidents were released Sunday. 
  Wei Jingsheng, who had been released in September six months 
short of a 15-year sentence, is still in detention and 
officially being investigated for "new crimes." Wei's sister, 
Wei Ling, said Tuesday that she had heard "no further news" of 
his present circumstances.

<F P=106> ["Roundup: Anhui Province Becoming New Economic Giant"] </F>
  [Text] Hefei, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Anhui Province is 
emerging as a new economic giant in China by seizing every 
opportunity for development, exploiting its advantages in 
natural resources and opening wider to the outside world. 
  Government statistics show that Anhui's gross national 
product (GNP) -- the total value of goods and services produced 
-- amounted to 94 billion yuan in 1993, up 22 percent over the 
previous year. 
  That was nine percentage points higher than the nation's 
average growth rate, according to an official of the provincial 
statistics bureau. 
  In 1993 Anhui ranked 12th in China in terms of industrial 
output value and eighth in terms of agricultural output value, 
compared to tenth on both counts in 1992. 
  The official said that during the first quarter of 1994 
Anhui 
scored a 25-percent increase in industrial output value. 
  Anhui, a pioneer in introducing the initiative-based 
responsibility system in China's rural areas, has always paid 
close attention to agricultural production and has tried to 
expand the production of township-run factories in a bid to 
increase farmers' incomes. 
  As a result, six million farmers have left the fields to 
find 
jobs in the manufacturing and service sectors. Meanwhile, rural 
industry has become a major driving force behind Anhui's 
economic growth. 
  The output of rural industries topped 110 billion yuan-worth 
and the per-capita income of rural residents rose by 150 yuan in 
1993. 
  The official said that Anhui has become a national 
pacesetter 
in converting state owned enterprises into joint stock companies. 
  By issuing shares, the Meiling Co. Ltd and the Maanshan Iron 
and Steel Company have raised 7.2 billion yuan, about one 
seventh of the total raised nationwide in this way. 
  To date, Anhui has set up 15 stock trading centers, more 
than 
any other province-level area in China. It currently has 416 
joint stock companies. 
  The official said that the provincial government has decided 
to convert 20 percent of major state-owned enterprises into 
stock companies and try the institution of the modern 
enterprises system or corporation system in 50 selected 
state-owned companies. 
  Anhui has also speeded up its construction of roads, harbors 
and airports over the past few years, in an effort to provide a 
better investment environment for overseas firms, he said. 
  For example, new wharves have been built and existing ones 
upgraded in the port cities of Wuhan and tongling on the Chang 
Jiang River. 
  Airports opened last year at Wuhan and anqing and an 
expressway linking the provincial capital of Hefei to Wuhu is 
being built. 
  Anhui exported 960 million U.S. dollar-worth of goods in 
1993, up 16 percent over the previous year, he said. 
  It approved the establishment of 1,040 foreign-funded 
businesses in 1993, involving 703 million dollars in overseas 
investment. 
  In the first quarter of this year six international 
consortiums, including the Sanyo Company of Japan, the Merrill 
Lynch Group of the United States and U.P.I. (Hong Kong) Ltd, 
invested a total of 15 billion yuan in infrastructure projects 
in cities and in upgrading existing companies in other parts of 
Anhui, he said.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 13 (XINHUA) -- There is now a 
thriving real estate business in south China's Guangdong 
Province after seven years' construction, according to the 
provincial Land Administration Department. 
  Land-use rights for 15,100 ha were transferred last year 
alone, creating profits of 11 billion yuan. 
  According to Yuan Zheng, director of the Land Administration 
Department, land use rights for 25,000 ha [hectare] were 
transferred during the past two years in Guangdong, generating a 
total profit of 20.5 billion yuan. 
  Foreign investment absorbed through the transfer of land-use 
rights has made up 42.6 percent of the total amount of overseas 
capital utilized by the province. 
  So far, 72 development zones have been set up in this 
southern province, taking up 13,000 ha. Some 18 billion yuan 
has been used to introduce 3,300 projects into these zones. 
  Yuan stressed that the macro-economic control measures for 
real estate implemented by the central government and the 
provisional regulations on land value-added tax that began to 
take effect this year do not mean restriction of the development 
of the sector but its standardization to ensure that its 
development is steady and sound. 
  The modern market system in Guangdong that has gradually 
been 
set up during the reform and opening-up over the last 15 years 
will surely further promote the rapid development of real 
estate, yuan added.

  [Text] Xining, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The development of 
power industry has given rise to a new economic structure 
featuring salt, petrochemical, steel, lead, magnesium, gold, 
asbestos and ferrosilicon production in this remote province of 
Qinghai Province. 
  According to Liu Yingkuan, head of the provincial 
administration of power industry, by the end of last year the 
province had an installed capacity of 1.73 million kw, 
generating over 6 billion kwh [kilowatt hours] of electricity. 
  The total production value of Qinghai's power industry last 
year was 639 million yuan (about 70 million U.S. dollars). 
  Promoted by the advancing power industry, the province's 
gross national product (GNP) and total industrial and 
agricultural output value has exceeded 10 billion yuan (over one 
billion U.S. dollars) for the first time in history. 
  As a resources-rich province, Qinghai boasts the country's 
largest reserves of salt, potassium, magnesium, lithium and 
asbestos as well as vast reserves of oil, natural gas and gold. 
Most of the mineral resources are located in the Qaidam Basin, 
dubbed the "treasure bowl" of China. 
  The Yellow, Chang Jiang and Lancang Rivers flowing through 
the province promise great potential for development of the 
hydro-power industry. 
  The province's proven exploitable reserves of water power 
stand at 21.65 million kw. 
  Over ten large and medium-sized power stations can be built 
along 276 kilometers of the Yellow River between Longyang Gorge 
and Sigou Gorge. 
  The Longyang Gorge Power Station with an installed capacity 
of 1.28 million kw has produced over 26 billion kwh of 
electricity since it was put into operation in 1989. That has 
relaxed the constricted supply of electric power in northwest 
China and also attracted over 30 big industrial enterprises, 
such as the Qinghai Aluminum Plant and the Minhe Magnesium Plant. 
  Two key state power projects -- the Lijia Gorge Power 
Station 
on the Yellow River, with an installed capacity of 2 million kw, 
and the Xining Qiaotou Thermal Power Plant -- are now under 
construction in Qinghai. 
  Construction of another medium-sized hydro-power station is 
scheduled to start this year. 
  In order to bring the power industry into full play in local 
economic progress, the province has also attached importance to 
construction of small hydro-power stations along its 108 rivers 
including the Golmud, Longwu, Bayin, Baishui and Babao. 
  Up to now, more than 160 small power stations, with a 
installed capacity of 110,000 kw each, have been built on the 
rivers.

  [Text] Budapest, April 13 (CNA) -- Wu Jianmin, spokesman 
for Mainland China's Foreign Ministry, Tuesday [12 April] 
attempted to refute accusations that the Beijing government 
mishandled the March 31 Qiandao boat tragedy in which 24 Taiwan 
tourists died. 
  "We handled the affair in a very proper way. The accusations 
are not true," Wu told CNA Budapest. 
  Wu also said that criticism over the Mainland's human rights 
standards is unwarranted. 
  "It is not true that human rights are not respected," Wu 
said, noting China's success in feeding its people. "There is no 
more hunger in China." 
  Wu, visiting Budapest at the invitation of Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry Spokesman Janos Herman, added that Mainland China is 
focusing on developing basic shelter and care facilities for its 
people. 
  "Our priority is development. China's net population 
increase is 16 million people yearly, we have to care about 
them, create jobs and housing for them," he said.

<F P=106> [Video report on news conference with unidentified foreign </F>
and domestic correspondents sponsored by the State Council 
Information Office on 12 April; place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The State Council Information Office 
today invited Liu Minxue, director of the State Administration 
for Industry and Commerce [SAIC], and Bai Dahua, deputy director 
and director of the State Patent Office, to answer reporters' 
questions on the protection of the right to the exclusive use of 
trademarks registered by foreign companies in China. 
  [Liu, seated and reading from a script] The current 
situation 
with regard to the protection of intellectual property rights in 
China is an issue in which many people in the international 
community are quite interested. We are holding this news 
conference today to brief you on the protection of the right to 
the exclusive use of trademarks registered by foreign companies 
in China, which constitutes one aspect of the protection of 
intellectual property rights. My colleagues and I are very happy 
to exchange our views with you correspondents on this issue. We 
hope that you will give full and extensive publicity 
internationally to the progress China has made in protecting 
intellectual property rights so that countries of the world will 
have a better understanding of intellectual property rights 
protection in China and dispel some people's misunderstandings. 
This will be conducive to the development of China's economic 
cooperation, trade, and friendly cooperative ties with foreign 
countries. 
  The structure of China's intellectual property rights organs 
is different from that of other countries. Trademarks, patents, 
and copyrights are under the jurisdiction of, respectively, the 
State Administration of Industry and Commerce, the State Patent 
Office, and the State Copyright Administration. As the 
competent law-enforcement administrative department of the state 
in charge of trademarks, the State Administration of Industry 
and Commerce has the dual responsibility of trademark 
registration and administration. The SAIC protects, in 
accordance with the law, the right to the exclusive use of 
trademarks registered by domestic and foreign companies, and it 
has made universally acknowledged progress. In particular, its 
work in protecting the exclusive right to trademarks registered 
by foreign companies in China has won praise from international 
intellectual property rights protection quarters and from many 
foreign enterprises. 
  As everybody knows, since China started implementing the 
policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, it has 
steadily amplified and improved laws concerning the protection 
of registered trademarks with a view to bringing them, step by 
step, into line with international practices. Today, we have by 
and large caught up with the international level. The Chinese 
Government has taken a firm position and has implemented 
effective measures in protecting the exclusive right of 
trademarks registered by foreign companies. 
  In regard to protecting the right to the exclusive use of 
registered trademarks, the SAIC is unique in the world in that 
it is in charge of both the registration and protection of 
trademarks. This is an arrangement with distinctive Chinese 
characteristics. In recent years, many enterprises have applied 
for trademark registration in China. Seventy countries and 
regions had registered 59,466 trademarks in China as of the end 
of 1993; there have been sharp increases in the number of 
trademark registration applications year after year. In 
protecting foreign companies' right to the exclusive use of 
their trademarks, administrative departments for industry and 
commerce have devoted major efforts to investigations in the 
past few years and have uncovered many cases involving trademark 
violations. 
  On behalf of the SAIC, I would like to express our 
appreciation to our friends in press circles at home and abroad 
for their support of our work. It is our sincere wish to 
increase exchanges with friends in press circles at home and 
abroad. We hope that you will give wider coverage to the 
protection of registered trademarks in China. We are happy to 
assist you in your coverage. 
  [Announcer] Answering a question on what measures China has 
taken in protecting the right to the exclusive use of 
trademarks, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] I would like to answer this 
question in three parts. First, the amended trademark law 
increases the penalty for the infringement and counterfeiting of 
trademarks. In terms of a pecuniary penalty, the amended 
trademark law provides that a fine of not more than 50 percent 
of the illegal volume of business or not more than five times 
the illegal profit gained from the infringement can be imposed. 
In addition to that, supplementary provisions on punishing 
offenses concerning registered trademark violations adopted by 
the National People's Congress have increased the jail terms for 
offenses related to trademarks from three to seven years. 
  Second, in addition to the party whose rights have been 
infringed upon, one can lodge a charge concerning the 
infringement with administrative departments for industry and 
commerce, and these departments can also directly investigate 
trademark violations on the market. There are over 600,000 
personnel in administrative departments for industry and 
commerce across the country. We are entirely capable of doing a 
better job in this regard in the marketplace. 
  Third, one of the distinctive characteristic of China's 
trademark administration is the double-track system, which 
places equal emphasis on administrative management and judicial 
management. In other words, in addition to administrative 
departments for industry and commerce which are empowered to 
directly investigate and punish trademark counterfeiting and 
other violations, China's judicial organs -- courts, that is -- 
can also accept trademark cases. 
  [Announcer] Speaking of the importance attached to the 
implementation of the trademark law, Liu Minxue said: [Liu] As 
I just said, we investigate and uncover a large number of 
trademark violations every year, and we have so many personnel. 
These facts demonstrate the following two points: One is that 
China's legal system in regard to trademarks is being constantly 
improved. The situation is improving in that we have more and 
more rules to follow in dealing with all forms of trademark 
infringement and unethical competition in the marketplace. 
Because there are guidelines to follow on how to deal with 
violations, we have been able to uncover and handle more cases. 
  The other thing is that we have placed greater emphasis on 
this work. As you can see, the state takes the crackdown -- the 
crackdown on the counterfeiting infringement in particular -- 
very seriously. We have also cracked down hard to protect the 
interests of businesses and especially consumers. 
Administrative departments for industry and commerce are 
implementing work in this area on a priority basis. Besides, we 
amended and improved the trademark law and formulated relevant 
measures with an eye on bringing them into line with 
international practices. 
  [Announcer] Answering a question on what China will do to 
increase the people's awareness of trademarks, Liu Minxue said: 
  [Liu] We would like very much to raise the overall awareness 
of trademarks among the people, especially among business 
managers and traders. We have done a great deal of work in this 
regard. For example, we launch at least a couple of large-scale 
publicity campaigns on the trademark law each year. As for 
enterprises, we run study classes and sponsor activities and 
meetings on [word indistinct] and trademark policy so that 
enterprises know how to use the trademark law to protect 
themselves. The awareness of trademarks is improving. 
  [Announcer] Answering a question on whether China has 
special 
regulations on the protection of the right to the exclusive use 
of trademarks registered by foreign companies, Liu Minxue said: 
  [Liu] China is a member of the Paris Convention for the 
Protection of Industrial Property. We are firmly committed to 
the obligations provided in the Paris convention. There is an 
exception in procedure -- that is, when a foreigner or foreign 
enterprise applies for trademark registration or lodges a charge 
of infringement, it shall entrust it to a trademark agency 
designated by the SAIC or the trademark bureau [organization as 
heard] to act on its behalf in accordance with the provisions of 
the Chinese trademark law. 
  [Announcer] Answering a question on how China will handle 
the scramble for famous trademark registration, Bai Dahua said: 
  [Bai] We have a specific legal interpretation regarding the 
scramble for famous trademark registration. According to 
China's trademark law, whoever registers a trademark first owns 
the trademark. However, there is one exception regarding 
protection of famous trademarks. The second provision of the 
sixth article of the Paris Convention, which is designed to 
protect industrial property rights, stipulates that special 
measures should be taken to protect famous trademarks. This 
only applies to established, well-known trademarks. Only when 
another person or enterprise tries to register these famous 
trademarks can we call it a scramble for famous trademark 
registration. Generally, if this happens we will take measures 
to protect the famous trademarks in question according to the 
Paris Convention if the trademark owners present proof of 
registration issued by a competent administrative organ of the 
country where the trademarks were originally registered. In 
other words, we will deny the registration of trademarks 
requested by others. 
  [Announcer] Answering a question about enterprises violating 
the trademark law or infringing on others' trademark rights, Bai 
Dahua responded: 
  [Bai] In China, infringement of others' trademark rights is 
limited not just to Chinese enterprises infringing on other 
Chinese enterprises' trademark rights; some foreign enterprises 
have also infringed on Chinese enterprises' trademark rights. 
Of course, some Chinese enterprises have infringed on foreign 
enterprises' trademark rights. Liu explained this. According 
to the principle of (?fair) treatment stipulated in the Paris 
Convention, we handle such cases in a fair manner. Some 
infringements of trademark rights in China are attributable to 
foreign companies; there are many examples of this. Similarly, 
some countries have violated their own trademark laws to 
infringe upon the rights of Chinese trademarks registered in 
their countries. For instance, some countries have gone so far 
as to allow the use of the word China or Chinese as trademarks 
even though the trademark laws of the great majority of 
countries stipulate that the name, national flag, emblem, and 
flags and emblems of the armed forces of that country must not 
be used as trademarks. 
  [Announcer] Answering a question on how China handles 
foreign-related trademark cases, Bai Dahua said: 
  [Bai] Regarding the first part of the question, since the 
PRC Trademark Law was enforced, we have dealt with approximately 
130,000 cases involving infringement of trademark rights and 
counterfeit trademarks. Of these cases, about 3,000 involved 
foreign companies. Regarding fines and compensation, they are 
two separate categories. According to the law, if an enterprise 
or individual has infringed on others' trademark rights, which 
is a violation of the law, a court or industry and commerce 
administration department is authorized to act on its own to 
impose an administrative fine on the enterprise or individual. 
But reasonable compensation can be given according to the law 
only if the owners of the trademarks in question submit a 
compensation demand. Legislation and enforcement of a country's 
trademark laws develop step by step. In other words, legislation 
of trademark laws will continue to be improved, and the degree 
of enforcement of trademark laws will increase daily. Therefore, 
if foreign enterprises or individuals voice dissatisfaction over 
the way China protects exclusive trademark rights, that is 
normal. This will help us improve our protection of exclusive 
trademark rights. Of course, there have been cases involving 
opposite situations; some enterprises have shown great 
satisfaction over the way in which Chinese administrative organs 
or judicial authorities protect their exclusive trademark 
rights. For instance, the cases which include the silk banner 
awards and photos provide in the booklets everyone of you has, 
are examples that some enterprises have expressed satisfaction 
over the way we protect exclusive trademark rights. [video

<F P=106> [By XINHUA Reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474) and RENMIN RIBAO </F>
reporter Gong Wen (7895 7186)] 
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
Information Office today held a news conference for domestic and 
foreign reporters, at which Liu Minxue, director of the State 
Administration for Industry and Commerce, and Bai Dahua, deputy 
director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
and director of the State Patent Office, were invited to brief 
reporters on China's protection of the right to exclusive use of 
trademarks registered by foreigners in China and to answer 
reporters' questions. 
  Liu Minxue first briefed the Chinese and foreign reporters 
on 
China's trademark development. He said China has seen a sharp 
rise in the number of valid registered trademarks over the last 
decade. Registered trademarks topped 410,000 in China by the end 
of 1993. Among them were 59,466 foreign trademarks, representing 
a ten-fold increase over 1979. The sharp rise in the number of 
foreign trademarks in China demonstrates the full confidence 
that foreign businessmen have in China's protection of 
intellectual property rights. 
  Answering a reporter's question on the specific regulations 
and the steps that China has adopted and taken to protect the 
right to exclusive use of trademarks, Liu Minxue gave the 
following reply: First, the revised "Trademark Law" and its 
"Implementation Rules" impose a heavy fine for those who violate 
the Trademark Law, with the maximum fine as high as 50 percent 
of the illegal business turnover. The National People's 
Congress Standing Committee has also adopted the "Supplementary 
Provisions on Punishing the Crime of the Production and Sale of 
Fake and Shoddy Goods" and increased from three years to seven 
years the prison term for those who commit the crime of 
producing and selling fake and shoddy commodities. Second, to 
protect the right of exclusive use of trademarks, administrative 
management organs for industry and commerce, in addition to 
handling trademark violation cases reported by trademark owners, 
not only conduct market inspection on a regular basis but also 
take the initiative in investigating trademark violation cases. 
Third, both industry and commerce law enforcement departments 
and justice departments may investigate trademark violation and 
counterfeit trademark cases. People who feel their rights have 
been violated may report to administrative management organs for 
industry and commerce and may file charges against violators at 
people's courts. 
  Replying to a reporter's question on China's special 
stipulations on protecting the right of exclusive use of foreign 
trademarks, Liu Minxue said that as China is one of the member 
countries of the "Paris Convention on Protecting Industrial 
Property Rights," it resolutely fulfills obligations as 
stipulated in the "Paris Convention" and it has effectively 
implemented the principle of giving foreigners equal treatment 
as Chinese nationals in the area of trademark protection. China 
not only protects the registered trademarks of its nationals, it 
also gives equal treatment to foreigners who register trademarks 
in China; in short, China protects the right of exclusive use of 
trademarks according to law. But there is one thing that needs 
to be explained. According to China's "Trademark Law," 
foreigners or foreign enterprises should go through an agency 
designated by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce 
to handle foreign affairs when they apply for trademark 
registration or when they handle other trademark-related matters 
in China. 
  When queried by a reporter on the infringement of 
Microsoft's 
rights in Shenzhen, Bai Dahua said that relevant departments are 
now investigating this case and that Shenzhen's Industry and 
Commerce Management Bureau has meted out punishment regarding 
the trademark infringement issue. This case does not fall 
within the scope of the readjustment of the "Trademark Law" as 
it also touches on other issues in addition to trademark 
infringement. 
  Asked how the Chinese trademark organs handle the problem of 
"scrambling for trademark registration," Bai Dahua said as 
China's "Trademark Mark Law" sets the "first come, first serve" 
principle, China, therefore, excepting famous trademarks, does 
not give special protection to trademarks of a general nature. 
According to the "Paris Convention," special protection is given 
to famous trademarks that are approved by a trademark 
registration country or by a competent organ.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government has decided to build a national economic information 
network in a move to accelerate the establishment of a socialist 
market economy, according to a senior government official. 
  Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications, 
explains in a article in today's PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO] 
that the decision was also designed to make use of the 
widespread information on China's economy and narrow the gap 
between China and developed countries. 
  China's economic information network will consist of an 
information resources network and an information 
telecommunications network, Wu said. 
  The first network will cover data banks with various types 
of 
information and data application systems for end-users, he 
explained. 
  The second network will be an on-line operation of 
information resources and application systems via state-owned 
public telecommunications networks. 
  Wu said, "we shall develop new types of information 
application systems in the future, in line with the requirements 
of various economic sectors." 
  The rapid development of China's public telecommunications 
network over the past decade has paved the way for the 
construction of a national economic information network, he said. 
  Since 1985 the capacity of the telecommunications sector has 
been rising faster than China's economy as a whole, he said. 
  During the 1991-1992 period, China added telephone 
switchboards with a total of 6.83 million lines and built 
121,800 long-distance circuits. 
  China will have built a large-capacity, digital transmission 
network linking all provincial capitals and other major cities 
by the end of 1994, the minister said. 
  The network is projected to extend its coverage during the 
1996-2000 period to form an optical fiber-based new transmission 
network nationwide, he added. 
  The first stage of a high-speed data network linking 21 
provinces is expected to go into operation in July to provide 
special digital circuits to customers, he said. 
  Much progress has also been made in mobile 
telecommunications, he said. 
  For example, cellular telephone networks now cover all 
cities 
and counties in coastal areas in eastern and southern China. 
China currently has 700,000 cellular telephones and seven 
million pagers. 
  Minister Wu described the construction of a national 
economic 
information network as a task for all sectors of society. "Only 
through close co-operation between the telecommunications 
sector, the electronics industry and the information application 
sector can we make the construction of that network a complete 
success." 
  He said that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications 
will draw up plans for telecommunications development and speed 
up construction of large-capacity digital-transmission networks 
based on optical fiber cables, he said.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "China Gears Up To Strengthen Patent Rights"] </F>
  [Text] China should promptly fortify its protection of 
intellectual property rights to facilitate the construction of a 
market-oriented economy. 
  Addressing a meeting on the 10th anniversary of the 
implementation of China's Patent Law, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing 
said yesterday that the State Council will soon issue a special 
regulation for strengthening the law. 
  He noted that China's efforts in approving patent 
applications have reached international standards since the 
country acceeded to the international Patent Co-Operation Treaty 
(PCT) earlier this year. 
  Gao Lulin, director general of China's Patent Office, 
explained that being a standing-member country of the PCT could 
help China simply [as published] procedures for patent-rights 
applications at home and abroad for both Chinese and foreigners. 
  But Gao pointed out the country's current Patent Law should 
be further amended, as some sectors of intellectual property 
rights are still without legal protection. 
  For example, China will no longer rule out protecting 
intellectual property rights of new plant varieties, as it does 
in the current Patent Law, he added. 
  China is working to draw up a seed-patent statute to protect 
the intellectual property rights of scientists and technicians 
engaged in the research and development of new seed varieties. 
  "We are trying to provide a desirable legal environment for 
the country to soak up foreign investment and technology for 
setting up cooperative projects," he noted. 
  The Patent Law was approved by the National People's 
Congress 
in 1984. 
  The country accepted ony 14,000 patent applications in 1985, 
but last year--after 10 years of implementation of the law--it 
handled more than 77,000 applications. 
  By the end of February, China had handled a total of more 
than 370,000 patent applications. Of these, more than 320,000 
were from Chinese inventors, while the rest came from 66 foreign 
countries and regions. 
  China has also stepped up its efforts to punish those who 
violate the law. 
  By the end of last year, the country's courts had accepted 
and heard more than 1,900 cases involving the infringement of 
patent rights, according to official figures. More than 1,600 
of these cases have been resolved, according to Ren Jianxin, 
president of China's Supreme People's Court.

  [Text] Haikou, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China's private 
economy has geared up to enter a period of fast growth, 
according to a recent seminar held in this capital city of 
China's southernmost province of Hainan. 
  The seminar, about state policy and growing trends of 
China's 
private economy in the 1990s, was held on the basis of 
investigations conducted jointly by the Chinese Academy of 
Social Sciences and the State Administration for Industry and 
Commerce. 
  A sample survey report released at the conference indicates 
that the growth of China's private economy has begun to pick up 
speed since it was clearly put onto the track of the socialist 
market economy by the ruling Communist Party last year. 
  Figures released by the administration show that in 1989 
China had 90,000 private enterprises employing 1.85 million 
people. In 1992 some 2.32 million people were working in 
140,000 private enterprises. 
  In June last year, 2.94 million people were working in 
184,000 private enterprises, a number 31.4 percent higher than 
that for the same period the year before. 
  The report says that 1993 saw an overall expansion of 
private 
economy across the country, and the growth rate in many 
provinces exceeded 100 percent. 
  With regard to the economic power of such enterprises, the 
report says that by the end of June last year, China's 
privately-owned enterprises registered total assets of 45.29 
billion yuan, an increase of 225 percent over the same period of 
the previous year. 
  In this sense, the average registered capital of each 
enterprise rose from 126,000 yuan to 246,000 yuan in one year, 
an increase of 95 percent. 
  On the other hand, the operating scale of private 
enterprises 
has tended to grow, the report says. 
  By June 1993, 4,072 private enterprises owned assets valued 
at over one million yuan. In contrast, there were only 855 
enterprises that held more than one million yuan in assets each 
by the end of 1992. 
  As to the make-up of enterprises, by June 1993 China had 
41,549 privately-owned limited liability companies, an increase 
rate of 380 percent over June 1992. They were only 23 percent 
of China's total private enterprises but had 59 percent of the 
total registered capital in the private sector. 
  In addition, more and more private enterprises began to 
engage in high-tech sector, service trades, technological 
consulting and foreign trade. 
  Another satisfying phenomenon is that the quality of 
operators of China's private enterprises has risen, the report 
says. 
  In some of China's economically developed provinces, the 
private economy has begun to play a bigger role in local 
economic activities. Taking Guangdong as an example, 11 percent 
of the province's revenue in the first half of 1993 came from 
tax payments from private enterprises. 
  Along with their growing economic power, the report says, 
China's private enterprise owners are playing a more active part 
in the country's political affairs.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] Urban prices in China continued to rage out of 
control in March, with the cost of living in 35 large cities 
rising 24.5 percent over a year earlier, sources in Beijing told 
Eastern Express. 
  The March figure, which will be released by the State 
Statistical Bureau (SSB) next week, is slightly lower than 
February's but higher than January's, giving a first quarter 
average of 24.6 percent. 
  Prices in some cities -- including Chongqing, Beijing, 
Haikou 
and Guangzhou -- are expected to show rises of more than 30 
percent in March. Shanghai has already reported a figure of 38 
percent over the first three months of the year. 
  The national picture, to be revealed later in the month, 
looks even worse, SSB sources said. 
  The bureau expects the national cost of living to rise 
between 24 and 25 percent for March compared with 22.3 percent 
over the first two months of the year. 
  Although considered by Beijing to be less important to 
social 
stability than the urban figure, the national rate is used for 
planning and reflects Beijing's failure to harness the runaway 
economy since macroeconomic control measures were imposed last 
July. 
  Beijing's pledge to hold national inflation to within 10 
percent this year after a 13 percent rise in 1993 looks doubtful. 
  National retail prices, meanwhile, will show a rise to about 
22-23 percent, compared with 20 percent over the first two 
months, the SSB predicts. 
  SSB officials warned that inflationary pressure was likely 
to 
remain high through the second quarter of the year. 
  "We told the government that tighter administrative controls 
are crucial to containing this momentum until the economy begins 
to slow down," an SSB official said. 
  The figures will appear as seven national inspection teams 
sent out by the State Council on April 1 begin their 
double-pronged attack on inflation by cracking down on price 
gouging and chaotic fixed investment. 
  Beating inflation emerged as Beijing's priority after last 
month's meeting of the National People's Congress [NPC] when the 
official China News Service described price rises as "part of 
China's present-day social agony". 
  In the clearest signal of Beijing's concern, a vice-premier, 
Li Lanqing, told the NPC: "If prices cannot be controlled, 
popular feelings and stability will be affected and reform 
cannot be carried out." 
  Since then, city mayors have been regularly asked by Beijing 
to explain their cities' high inflation. 
  The Shanghai party secretary, Wu Bangguo, told an NPC 
meeting 
that he had been embarrassed by the Premier Li Peng, who was 
more informed about prices of consumer goods in the city than 
either he or its mayor, Huang Ju. 
  Plans to free prices on a range of goods in many cities this 
year -- from staple foods to bus fees -- have been put on hold 
since prices began to rise. 
  Inflation in China's leading cities was 19.6 percent last 
year, the highest rate since 1988, when panic buying of consumer 
goods forced Beijing to implement a credit squeeze that 
sidelined the economy for two years. 
  The run-up in the "hot summer of 1988" is also considered a 
factor that helped precipitate the student-led Tiananmen 
protests the following spring.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ren Kan: "Bank of China Preparing Big </F>
Bond Issue in Japan"] 
  [Text] The Bank of China, the country's major foreign 
exchange bank, is seeking to pool more capital from the 
international monetary market to support the country's economic 
growth. 
  The bank is preparing to issue 15 billion to 30 billion 
Japanese yen worth of bonds in Tokyo, said Huo Tuanjie, deputy 
general manager of the bank's foreign exchange department. 
  The money raised by the bond issue will be used to finance 
Chinese energy and transportation development, she said. 
  Huo said the Bank of China has been in contact with 
well-known Japanese securities companies and banks about 
underwriting the bonds. 
  She said the bank will decide whether to issue the bonds at 
fixed or floating rates according to market conditions. 
  "We will select the best time to enter the market," she 
said. 
"It will probably be done in the first half of this year." 
  The interest rate for bonds issued in Japan has remained 
quite low, which will reduce the bank's costs. The rate for 
one-year Libor (London inter-bank offered rate) bonds in Japan 
is about 2 percentage points lower than in the United States. 
And, Huo said, the rate is expected to bounce up in the second 
half of the year. 
  Although the low rate will save money for the bank, it will 
also bring some disadvantages. 
  Investors are usually reluctant to invest in low-rated bonds 
since the yields are less, so the bonds' issuer must rely on its 
good reputation with investors. 
  Huo said the Bank of China is quite experienced in the 
Japanese market, having issued bonds there 14 times in the past 
decade. 
  Japanese investors are familiar with the Bank of China and 
have been enthusiastic buyers of its bonds. 
  Japan has played an important role in the bank's long-term 
strategy for pooling capital internationally. 
  It was the first market the bank entered and served as a 
springboard for entering Europe and the United States. Earlier 
this year, the bank issued $500 million in Yankee bonds, its 
first flotation in the United States. 
  But Huo cautioned, "While making efforts to tap new markets, 
we should also pay great attention to strengthening our foothold 
in our traditional market." 
  Besides Japan, she said, the Bank of China will look for the 
proper time to go back to the European market. 
  So far, the bank has issued 21 batches of bonds in London, 
Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore and the United States with a 
combined face value of $4 billion. 
  Issuing bonds not only raises foreign capital, but promotes 
the reputation of the Bank of China. 
  "We are trying to make the Bank of China a globally-known 
name in financial circles," Huo said.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "Treasury Bond Sales Win Warm Reception"] </F>
  [Text] The 1994 treasury bonds have enjoyed a warm 
response from Chinese residents since they were first issued on 
April 1. 
  More than 17.73 billion yuan ($2.03 billion) worth of bonds 
had been sold by last Saturday, according to the People's Bank 
of China. 
  The sales included 8.13 billion yuan ($934.4 million) in 
two-year bonds and 9.6 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in three-year 
bonds. 
  This year, China is planning to issue 87 billion yuan ($10 
million) in two- and three-year bonds--twice as much as last 
year. 
  Bonds have sold better in large cities than in small- and 
medium- sized cities. They have also had a warmer welcome in 
urban areas than in rural areas, and in inland provinces than 
along the coast. 
  In Beijing alone, the sales volume for the first nine days 
amounted to nearly 2.9 billion yuan ($333.3 million). Shanghai 
also tallied up more than 2.5 billion yuan ($287.3 million) in 
sales. 
  But in some places, the issuance of treasury bonds has not 
been as successful due to competition from other high-yield 
investments. 
  Analysts said the receptivity to this year's treasury bonds 
is good news for the government, which has high expectations for 
the bonds. Starting this year, bonds are the government's sole 
method to offset the national deficit--estimated at 60 billion 
yuan ($6.9 billion) for this year. 
  Bond sales are attractive this year because of the financial 
reform that began last year. The unauthorized raising of 
capital has been stopped, which frees up more capital for bond 
sales. 
  The bonds' high interest rates also spark interest. This 
year's two-year bonds go for 1.3 percentage points higher than 
bank deposits for the same term. The three-year bonds are 1.72 
percentage points higher.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Lin Ying (2651 7751)] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 11 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In the 
past 10 years, investment by foreign businessmen has mainly 
concentrated on industries for processing imported materials, 
light industry, real estate, restaurants, and the food industry, 
in a bid to become profitable quickly. However, investment in 
such projects has gradually become saturated, while investment 
in many other projects which should be completed sooner is still 
lacking. Therefore, the authorities in China have recently 
guided foreign investment into infrastructure such as railways, 
highways, wharves, power plants, and telecommunications. This 
has provided new fields for foreign investment. 
  According to statistics, the total amount of construction 
funds needed in plans for the construction of projects in 
transportation and telecommunications on the mainland this year 
is over 100 billion yuan. More foreign funds will be used to 
make up for any shortage in the enormous amount, in addition to 
funds to be jointly raised by the central authorities and 
various localities. To attract foreign funds, departments in 
various localities have offered preferential terms, such as 
long-term cooperation, a guarantee to a 15 to 20 percent profit 
rate, and so on. 
  In transportation construction, agreements already reached 
or 
being negotiated on Sino-foreign investment cooperation projects 
include: The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank will 
invest $750 million in the construction of the railway from 
Beijing to Kowloon this year; Japan's Overseas Mutual Funds will 
also invest $2 billion in a number of railway construction 
projects this year; progress has been made in the negotiations 
between the two sides on Japan's Mitsui Production Corporation 
making an investment of $1.8 billion in the construction of an 
expressway from Fuzhou to Xiamen and an agreement is expected to 
be signed in the middle of this year; the Hong Kong New China 
Hong Kong Group has recently signed a contract with the Sichuan 
Expressway Corporation on investing 1.2 billion Hong Kong 
dollars in the construction of an expressway from Chengdu to 
Mianyang; Chongqing City has recently reached agreements with 
some international financial groups and Hong Kong businessmen on 
the construction of 11 highway projects involving a total 
investment exceeding $1 billion; a financial group formed by a 
corporation in a Southeast Asian country and the Hong Kong 
Chinese Banking Group will invest $700 million this year as 
shares in the construction of an expressway from Nanjing to 
Shanghai; the Hong Kong New World Development Corporation will 
cooperate with the Guangdong Enterprise this year to invest $1.5 
billion in the construction of the section in Guangdong Province 
of an expressway from Beijing to Guangzhou; the Hong Kong Chung 
Fu Company Limited and the China Fujian group will cooperate 
this year and invest $200 million in the construction of an 
expressway from Xiamen to Zhangzhou. 
  In the construction of ports and wharves, agreements being 
negotiated or already reached on Sino-foreign cooperation 
projects include: The Hong Kong International Container Wharf 
Company Limited has planned to invest several billion Hong Kong 
dollars this year in the comprehensive development projects of 
four ports in Shanghai, Yantian, Zhuhai, and Nanhai; the Hong 
Kong Yue King Hing Yip Group has recently signed an agreement on 
investing 500 million yuan in the construction of the 
first-phase of the Haicang Port project in Xiamen, including a 
20,000-ton container wharf and a 30,000-ton goods wharf and 
their necessary facilities; the U.S. Mei Wah Group has recently 
signed an agreement on investing 250 million yuan in the 
development of the Tieshan Port of Beihai City, Guangxi and the 
construction of a 50,000-ton wharf together with a warehouse and 
facilities. The Hong Kong Hutchison and Whampoa Group has 
recently signed another contract with Zhuhai on the construction 
of two 20,000-ton wharves. This is another major project 
following the cooperation between the two sides in the 
construction of the Jiuzhou Port container wharf. 
  In the field of energy and electricity, Sino-foreign 
cooperation springs up everywhere. The Hong Kong Hopewell Group 
and the mainland have started the construction of two large 
thermal power plants. The Cheung Kong and the Hutchison Whampoa 
groups have recently cooperated with Nanhai again in the 
construction of a 400 megawatt and a 170 megawatt generating 
unit. 
  In the field of telecommunications, the number of 
Sino-foreign cooperation projects is even bigger. On the 
mainland, 8 million additional telephone sets were installed 
last year and another 12 million additional telephone sets are 
planned to be installed this year. With the growing needs of 
economic development, the demand for telephones in various 
cities on the mainland will increase year after year and the 
potential in Sino-foreign cooperation is considerable. Since 
the beginning of this year, the Beijing Kaiqi Telecommunications 
Corporation has imported from the U.S. Motorola Corporation $125 
million's worth of digital telecommunications system equipment 
for the mobile telephone network covering the entire Beijing. 
Recently, Taiwan's International Standard Electronics Company 
Limited and the Fuzhou Postal and Telecommunications 
Administrative Bureau have signed a contract on investing $6.5 
million in providing hardware and software for 
telecommunications systems. Also, Japan's NEC group made a 
decision last month on setting up a plant in Wuhan to produce 
mobile telephones especially for mainland markets.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- China produced more 
than 34 million tons of onshore oil in the first quarter of this 
year, slightly higher than a year ago. 
  "This production makes up 24.7 percent of the projected 
total 
for the whole year," said an official from the China Oil and Gas 
Corporation, which is responsible for onshore oil exploration, 
development and production across China. 
  Oil production in the first quarter used to be lower than 
the 
following quarters because of the holidays and the commencement 
of construction of new oil wells, the official explained. 
Considering this, he added, this year's figure is "really 
better than expected." 
  He said that the stabilized production in the oil fields in 
eastern China and the increasing oil output in western China, 
were the "two contributing factors." 
  In eastern China, oil output was maintained at the level of 
the fourth quarter of last year in spite of even greater 
difficulties in extracting oil from mature fields, he said. 
  The methods of controlling water cut and confining oil 
deposits and the techniques of tertiary oil extraction have been 
used in Daqing and Shengli oil fields to avoid output 
fluctuation. Oil exploration was intensified at the same time, 
the official said. 
  He disclosed that oil production in western China, including 
the Tarim Basin, was up 13.2 percent from the same period last 
year. There also appeared improvement in crude transportation 
toward the eastern region, thanks to coordinating efforts. 
  China's onshore natural gas production in the first quarter 
was registered at 3.9 billion cubic meters, 25.4 percent of the 
planned total for this year. 
  Challenged by growing demand for oil because of rapid 
economic growth, China's oil industry has worked out the 
strategy of "stabilizing oil production in eastern China while 
developing western China." 
  More efforts were called for earlier this year to maintain 
oil output in mature fields at the level of 124 million tons 
each year in the three years to come. On this basis, oil output 
in western China will be markedly increased. 
  According to the China Oil and Gas Corporation, China 
onshore 
oil production is targeted at 140 million tons and that of 
natural gas 16 billion cubic meters this year. 
  As long as oil production keeps up the trend set by the 
first 
quarter, predicted an official, these targets are likely to be 
reached.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- In the first quarter 
of this year, China's no. 1 railway construction project, the 
Beijing-Kowloon (Jing-Jiu) line, used up an investment of 2.365 
billion yuan, with 163 km of tracks laid. 
  Sources from the office for construction of the Jing-Jiu 
railway said that by the end of last month, the project, which 
was started in 1992, has applied a total investment of 10.696 
billion yuan, with 626 km of tracks laid. 
  Statistics show that 76 percent of the total designed amount 
of earth and stone for the whole line's railbed has been put 
into place, while 62 percent of the bridges and 33 percent of 
the tunnels have been finished. 
  The 2,370 km-long Jing-Jiu line goes through nine provinces 
and municipalities from north to south. Originally, it was 
scheduled for completion in 1997. However, to help ease the 
present "jammed" conditions of the country's rail transport, the 
government decided early last year to shorten the construction 
term and finish the project by the end of 1995. 
  This year the Chinese Ministry of Railways plans to sink 
11.3 
billion yuan into the Jing-Jiu line, and 80-90 percent of the 
project will have been finished by the end of the year. 
  An official from the ministry said that if the present 
construction speed is maintained, the whole Jing-Jiu line will 
be able to start operation by the end of 1995.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The State 
Administration of Taxation (SAT) will launch an inspection on 
personal income taxation during the latter half of this year, in 
a clear gesture to tighten the crackdown on individual tax 
evasion and cheating. 
  "We will severely punish tax evaders and cheaters as well as 
those who threaten and do physical harm to tax collectors," 
pledged Li Yonggui, vice-director of the SAT. 
  "The present punishment, mainly through fines, has hardly 
worked. The serious tax violators must be brought to court and 
sentenced according to law," Li said. 
  China instituted a new law on individual income tax on 
January 1st this year. Under the new law, salaries or wages of 
Chinese citizens must be taxed after a deduction of 800 yuan. 
The deduction amount for foreigners in China is 4,000 yuan. 
But in both cases, the highest tax rate is 45 percent. 
  As the national economy booms and especially with the latest 
overhaul of the wage system of government staff, the ranks of 
taxpayers have swelled. 
  The state tax authorities today asked all government 
functionaries, starting from this month, to fulfill their duties 
by deducting the due tax from their staff's wages or salaries on 
behalf of the tax administration. 
  "High-placed officials with the party Central Committee, the 
State Council and some of the ministries have either paid taxes 
or have had taxes deducted by relevant departments," said Li. 
  Li disclosed that by the end of March, the country had 
collected 1.304 billion yuan in personal income tax, an increase 
of 470 million yuan, or up 56.2 percent over the same period of 
last year.

  [Text] Yesterday, Chen Jinhua, minister of the State 
Planning Commission, said that excessive price hikes had given 
rise to serious concern in the CPC central body and the State 
Council. Beijing must take controlling inflation as a top 
economic task for the next few months. The State Council 
recently adopted a series of measures for stabilizing prices. 
  Chen Jinhua pointed out at a recent national meeting of 
commodity price bureau chiefs in Wuhan that controlling the 
increase in retail prices in the cities is "a key factor which 
has a bearing on reform, development, and stability." Urban 
retail prices in China increased by 25.9 percent in February. 
  The national meeting of commodity price bureau chiefs was 
held from Tuesday to Friday in Wuhan. The meeting primarily 
considered the further implementation of various measures laid 
down by the State Council for adjusting and controlling prices 
and curbing the excessive price hikes in order to ensure the 
stability of the overall situation. 
  At the meeting, Chen Jinhua said: A prominent problem in 
current economic life is the further aggravation of inflation 
and the too rapid increase in commodity prices on the market. 
In January and February of this year, the monthly retail price 
index throughout the country increased by three percentage 
points, and this was rarely seen after the beginning of reform. 
In particular, the prices of the basic daily necessities, basic 
services, and basic production materials that had a close 
relationship with the people's livelihood and the national 
economy increased too much, and the price increase exceeded the 
degree that the people could endure. 
  Chen Jinhua demanded that commodity price organs at all 
levels resolutely implement the State Council's measures -- 
principally, to control the prices of grain, cooking oil, 
nonstaple foodstuffs, basic services, and major production 
materials, especially agricultural production materials and to 
persistently give publicity to the relevant policies, inspect 
the situation, handle and solve problems, and carry out 
rectification and correction. 
  He also stressed that the State Council had adopted a series 
of measures for stabilizing prices, including: 
  First, to strictly exercise "double control," that is, 
controlling the size of investment in fixed assets, which was 
increasing too quickly, and controlling the excessive expansion 
of consumption funds. 
  Second, to seriously guarantee agricultural production and 
increase effective supply. 
  Third, to strengthen the government's management and control 
over market prices. This includes the establishment of a risk 
fund for the prices of grain and nonstaple foodstuffs, and 
intensified supervision over the prices of 20 kinds of daily 
necessities and basic services that the people need in their 
daily lives. Prices of commodities and services should all be 
clearly marked, and nationwide price inspections should be 
carried out. 
  Fourth, to resolutely enact economic measures for 
restraining 
price increases and guaranteeing commodity supply on the market.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The central 
government has decided to shelve the plan for taxing gains from 
stock trading for at least two years, according to a senior 
Chinese tax official. 
  The move came a little more than three months after the 
enforcement of the revised tax laws on personal income, which 
stipulate that such gains should be taxed. 
  For quite some time, so rife were the rumors and 
speculations 
of a possible introduction of the tax that the stock market 
plummeted. 
  "The issue demands a whole set of principles and enforcement 
is rather complex," said vice-director of the State 
Administration of Taxation (SAT) Li Yonggui here today to the 
Beijing press. "Both the share-holding system and stock market 
are still in their infant stages. We need time to conduct 
research on how and when to introduce the tax. 
  "This year and the next, gains from stock transactions will 
not be taxed," assured Li. 
  Li said, however, whether or not to introduce the tax will 
depend on the research work and the real situation.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- China's exports 
increased by half a percentage point more than its imports 
during the first three months of this year, the National Customs 
Office revealed here today. 
  This is the first time for more than 25 months that exports 
have grown faster than imports. 
  But the adverse trade balance in this first quarter still 
stood at 480 million U.S. dollars, while the total trade volume 
of 39.5 billion U.S. dollars showed an increase of 18.4 percent 
over the same period last year. 
  The customs department figures showed that exports for the 
quarter were worth 19.11 billion U.S. dollars (up 18.7 percent 
over 1993's first quarter) and imports totalled 20.39 billion 
U.S. dollars (up 18.2 percent). 
  Significant was that the growth rate of exports in the first 
quarter of 1993 was 7.4 percent, so this quarter's exports 
growth rate was 11.3 percentage points greater. In contrast, 
imports in the first three months of 1993 went up by 25.4 
percent, while this year that increase was 7.2 percentage points 
less steep. 
  According to some experts here, this phenomenon indicated 
that China's export capacity has recovered, while the excessive 
demand for imports has been effectively controlled, and China's 
foreign trade is becoming more stable and balanced. 
  It was learned that in the first three months of the year, 
China's exports of such products as clothes, textile products, 
shoes, toys, radio recorders and plastic products have increased 
steadily. 
  Meanwhile, the growth in imports of goods such as steel, 
refined oil, automobiles, aircraft, ships and textile machinery 
has slowed down, in some cases even dropped. However, imports 
of metal processing machinery and telephone switchboards have 
abruptly increased.

  [Text] Beijing, April 9 (CNS) -- The Ministry of Labor 
recently put forward proposals for the restructuring of the 
labour system with the aim of setting up a basic framework in 
five years for a new labour system in conformity with the 
socialist market economy system. 
  The ministry has worked out a general proposal for labour 
reform to cover employment, salary distribution, social 
security, employment service and exploitation of vocational 
techniques. A spokesman for the ministry revealed that the 
reform of the labour system had entered a stage where 
comprehensive restructuring was in place. 
  First, autonomy of employment enjoyed by enterprises 
especially involving salary distribution had been further 
carried out. The practice of two-way choice in which both an 
employer and a job- seeker share equal opportunity to determine 
the employment and labour contract have gone into effect. 
Workers who have not yet been included in the labour contract 
practice will also be under the contract system by means of its 
implementation within a particular enterprise or in an entire 
area. According to the system, employers, enterprises and 
employees are entitled to the concluding, the cancelling and the 
terminating of an employment contract. 
  Second, supplementary reform related to labour restructuring 
has seen new development including formation of an initial 
network of 17,000 employment service agencies across the 
country. There are about eight million job-seekers successfully 
entering employment each year through these agencies. 
  Third, a breakthrough has been made in setting key problems 
including reform of the social insurance system. The ministry 
recently put forward unification of social insurance which means 
introduction of a unified insurance system for various 
enterprises and workers no matter the ownership of the 
enterprise and job position held by a particular worker. 
Unified premium, treatment and use of the insurance funds are 
involved in the social insurance reform. Layoffs are possible 
with the approval of the trade union when a particular 
enterprise is either on the verge of bankruptcy in which 
rectification is conducted according to law or facing difficult 
conditions in their running. The existence of different 
employment systems namely the fixed one and the contractual one 
will also see a breakthrough in settlement during this year.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Weimin: "Accolades and Alarms Over </F>
Farmer-Run Mines"] 
  [Text] In the 1970s, farmers needing coal were permitted 
to dig small pits beside large mines that had been monopolized 
by the State for decades. 
  Since 1978 these farmer-run township mines have dug 4 
billion 
tons of coal, and Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua praises them for 
playing an important role in easing the nation's energy shortage. 
  Continuous expansion has turned township mines into a mini- 
industry employing more than 2 million farmers. Their annual 
output has risen from 950,000 tons in 1978 to 472 million tons 
last year, equal to that of key State-governed mines. 
  With their help, China's annual production of coal has 
increased to 1.18 billion tons, compared with 618 million tons 
in 1978. 
  But their lack of comprehensive planning and environmental 
safeguards has created serious pollution and wasted resources. 
  As the mining sector has grown, so have the problems. 
  Latest statistics show that at least 3,700 people were 
killed 
in accidents in township mines last year, compared with 1,171 in 
1978. Since 1984, 40,000 people have died in mine accidents. 
  In their pursuit of profits, the township mines have shown 
little concern for the environment and have not made good use of 
resources. 
  At some places, experts say, for each ton of coal that is 
mined, 5 more tons of coal that is more difficult to recover are 
left behind. 
  To ensure that township mines develop in a healthy way, the 
Ministry of Coal Industry has proposed regulations and laws to 
administer them more closely. 
  Drafts of the legislation have been submitted to the central 
government for approval, Business Weekly was told last week. 
  Among other things, the drafts propose that a licensing 
system be adopted and suggest how to bring order to the mines. 
They also recommend procedures for reducing fatal accidents. 
  Late last month, the Ministry of Coal Industry organized a 
four- day conference on the measures that drew officials from 
the Ministry of Agriculture and leading government officials 
from 13 provinces and autonomous regions. 
  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, who participated, spoke highly of 
the meeting and said the State Council supports efforts to boost 
healthy development of township mining. 
  Only one similar conference has ever been organized and that 
was in 1987, when township coal mining was just gaining momentum. 
  Coal Industry Minister Wang Senhao said the ministry will 
beef up investment to renovate equipment in township mines. 
  Wang also urged small mines to unite and co-operate within 
the rules of a market economy. 
  The minister promised help from State scientific research 
institutes, training centres and technical service enterprises. 
  Wang said the ministry will make comprehensive plans for the 
industry's long-term development. For instance, a hundred 
counties with heavy concentrations of township mines will have 
priority in receiving financial help in the next seven years. 
  In the meantime, the ministry hopes that by 1996 a market- 
oriented legal system will be adopted to bring order to the 
industry.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- China's first labor 
law is now under formulation and is expected to be enacted this 
year. 
  Xue Zhaoyun, vice-chairwoman of the All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions (ACFTU), told a press conference here today that 
the draft labor law prepared by the Labor Ministry, the State 
Council's Legislative Affairs Bureau and ACFTU, has been 
approved by the State Council and has been submitted to the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation. 
  If the law is passed, it will be China's first labor law, 
designed to standardize labor relations in an "all-round 
manner," Xue said. 
  The union leader noted that "brand new" labor relations are 
emerging in China to meet the needs of building a socialist 
market economy. And the law is expected to effectively protect 
the legitimate rights and interests of both employees and 
employer.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- State Councillor Chen 
Junsheng said recently that the major tasks of agriculture this 
year are to stabilize the output of grain, increase the output 
of cotton and enrich the vegetable basket. 
  He called on officials at all levels to actively mobilize 
departments in charge of funds, materials and technology to 
provide the farmers with good service throughout the process of 
production to strive for a good harvest of grain and cotton. 
  Chen, who has special responsibilities for agriculture, made 
these remarks during a survey tour of the provinces of Hebei, 
Shandong and Henan from April 6 to 12. 
  Chen pointed out that the three provinces are China's major 
producers of grain, cotton and vegetables, adding that the grain 
output of the provinces accounts for one fifth of the national 
total, while that of cotton accounts for half of the national 
total. 
  He stressed that at present, it is necessary to fight 
against 
the serious drought in Hebei and Henan Provinces and to increase 
the cotton-growing acreage. Attention should also be paid to 
the use of seeds from the best strains and to field management, 
including prevention and control of plant diseases and 
elimination of pests. 
  While concentrating on the production of grain and cotton, 
Chen Junsheng said, it is also important to provide more for the 
vegetable basket. Efforts should be made to use stalks to raise 
more cattle and other herbivorous animals and to grow more 
vegetables to enrich the supply of non-staple food.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yonghong: "Ministry Calls For </F>
Immediate Action To Combat Drought"] 
  [Text] The Agricultural Ministry now believes it is 
critical that the government speed up efforts to fight North 
China's disastrous drought that is threatening spring sowing. 
  "Every possible means must be utilized to combat the 
persisting drought and minimize its damage," the ministry 
spokesman said yesterday. 
  The ministry has urged all local agricultural departments to 
mobilize any available manpower, materials and funds to 
reinforce the antidrought campaign. 
  "All agricultural departments in the drought-stricken areas 
must tap every resource and take effective measures, according 
to their local conditions, in order to overcome the disaster and 
win a bumper harvest both in summer and autumn this year," he 
added. 
  Beijing, suffering from a severe 16-month drought, has 
answered the call and decided to strengthen its irrigation drive. 
  The city has 2.7 million workers plus millions of machines 
and other materials fighting the dry spell. 
  And the central government recently allocated 1.5 million 
yuan ($172,000) to support Beijing's effort. 
  A ministerial report released yesterday said the protracted 
drought seriously jeopardizes spring ploughing in eight 
provinces and cities. 
  The shortage, which began last winter and became more severe 
this spring, has affected more than 4.7 million hectares of 
farms, mainly in North China. 
  The report said another 9.3 million hectares of farmland, 
almost one-tenth of the country's total, are under threat. 
  The affected provinces are having difficulty in sowing 
cotton 
and spring wheat, and winter wheat and rapeseed have already 
been damaged. 
  Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi have been hardest hit by 
the drought, while Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, and northern and 
western Henan Province are also affected, the spokesman said. 
  Beijing's water supply suffered a sharp drop in nearly all 
its reservoirs, drying up most of its rivers and pushing down 
the level of its underground water. 
  As a result, more than 133,000 hectares of its suburban 
farmland have been damaged. 
  Moreover, about 90,000 people and 11,000 heads of livestock 
in its suburban counties are faced with a serious water shortage. 
  And in Tianjin, most of the farmland is barren, with more 
than 115,300 hectares of wheat crop dried up and 280,000 
hectares of suburban farmland unsown.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government has taken a series of measures to increase its 
agricultural input in an effort to promote a sustained growth of 
farm production. 
  The central government has decided to add three billion yuan 
this year to its budget for capital construction, 650 million 
yuan of which will be put into farm production, accounting for 
21.7 percent of the total increase. 
  Also, loans offered by banks have risen by 19.8 billion yuan 
this year, 2.1 billion yuan destined for agriculture, accounting 
for 10.6 percent of the total added. 
  An analysis shows that the shrinkage of investment in 
agricultural capital construction is mainly due to the change of 
investment resources and the expansion of investment scale and 
scope. 
  To maintain a stable agricultural development, the central 
government has raised the budget and loans for farm production, 
12.9 percentage points more than last year. 
  In addition to the direct input into farming, forestry and 
water- conservancy works, the increased investment also covers 
the farm- support industries, including fertilizers, pesticides, 
plastic sheeting and farm machinery.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Cattle-Feed Revolution Beefs Up </F>
Production"] 
  [Text] New strategies in cattle-raising have helped China 
become one of the top beef-producing countries in the world, a 
leading agriculture official announced. 
  "By the end of last year, China was ranked the world's 
sixth-biggest country in beef output, compared with being in 
only 12th place in 1978," Vice-Minister of Agriculture Zhang 
Yanxi told a three-day national meeting on livestock development 
that ends today. 
  Last year, China produced a total of 2.3 million tons of 
beef, a 28.9 percent rise over the previous year, said Zhang. 
  The sustained growth in livestock production over the past 
decade has raised annual per capita meat consumption to 32.3 
kilograms, which is the world average. 
  Zhang attributed the success over the past 14 years 
primarily 
to a change in the type of cattle feed. Instead of using 
precious grain for feed, cattle breeders are using fermented 
plant stalks and other agricultural by-products. 
  Since 1992, 59 pilot rural counties have been given the 
backing of the central government to use the stalks to raise 
cattle. The farmers have been provided with urea and plastic 
sheets, which are used to make the fermented feed. 
  Now about 2 million farmers use this method, according to 
Zhang. 
  Although the demonstration counties represent only 2.7 
percent of the total rural counties in the country, beef 
production in those sites accounts for 15 percent of the 
country's output, Zhang said. 
  Some of the counties' beef products are exported to Eastern 
Europe, the Middle East, the Commonwealth of Independent States 
and other regions. 
  The biggest beef-producers include Shandong, Henan, Hebei, 
Anhui and Sichuan provinces. 
  At the meeting, authorized by the State Council, honours for 
outstanding achievements in the livestock industry were handed 
out to individuals and units in Shandong and Henan provinces, 
Fuyang Prefecture in Anhui Province, Zhoukou Prefecture in Henan 
Province and 10 other counties. 
  The utilization of plant stalks and agricultural by-products 
not only has helped boost the livestock industry but has also 
saved a large quantity of grain, which is usually used for feed. 
  China's success has garnered world-wide attention and 
praise, 
Zhang said. 
  "It is very significant at present to extend the technology 
and to develop the low-grain-consuming livestock industry, since 
the country's grain production in limited," Zhang noted. 
  In the past decade, beef production has increased 20 percent 
annually.

  [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese localities 
have this year increased input into agricultural sector to boost 
the grain and cotton production growth, according to the 
PEOPLE'S DAILY [RENMIN RIBAO] today. 
  In Southwest China's Yunnan Province, the total capital 
investment in farm production has jumped to more than 2.5 
billion yuan this year. 
  The provincial fiscal budget for agriculture has been 
increased at an average annual rate of 23.2 percent since 1988, 
the highest in the country's provinces and autonomous regions. 
Last year's total investment was over 2.38 billion yuan. 
  To achieve good economic returns, the province has also 
restructured its farm products in a bid to achieve a total grain 
output of 11.25 billion kilograms this year. 
  The total grain-growing land has thus been expanded to 2.46 
million hectares by the end of March. 
  Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has planned to put 
800 million yuan more in agriculture than last year while the 
total grain growing land is also expected to increase. 
  Over the past two years, the province has made efforts to 
improve 1.4 million ha of low-yield land and to reclaim nearly 
20,000 hectares of waste land. 
  In Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, land 
planted in cotton is expected to reach 740,000 ha, an increase 
of almost 140,000 ha over 1994. 
  The regional government has also framed a number of 
preferential policies to expand cotton growing land and has 
given priority to supplies needed by cotton growers.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Cotton Stays Under State Planning"] </F>
  [Text] The government has decided against opening cotton 
crops to market forces this year, the Ministry of Internal Trade 
said. 
  The ministry spokesman, Ding Junfa, said dwindling output 
forces the State to continue planning and managing all 
purchases, marketing and storage of cotton. 
  The statement refuted calls from some local sectors to open 
up the market. 
  Ding said the State will stick to a unified production and 
price policy this year and rural supply and marketing 
co-operatives will be the only organs allowed to purchase and 
market cotton. 
  In the past two years, cotton output has fallen dramatically 
because of poor weather, pests and plant diseases. 
  And government purchases from last fall's crop amounted to 
only two thirds of the total from the harvest in 1992, a recent 
report in the Farmers' Daily said. 
  The ministry is taking a series of measures to improve 
cotton 
purchases and marketing this year. 
  Major textile enterprises with good production and profit 
records will be provided with an adequate supply, while those 
involved in the speculation and profiteering of cotton will face 
penalties, Ding said. 
  And to make up for the cotton shortage, some textile plants 
are increasing the use of synthetic fibres and imported raw 
materials, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- China launched a green 
certificate training project today in an ambitious drive to 
educate millions of its farmers in applied technical theories 
and expertise in agriculture. 
  The project, set in motion after the approval of the State 
Council, is designed to incorporate scientific and technological 
advances with China's agricultural development. 
  "The implementation of the project is in line with 
establishing a socialist market system in rural China and 
promoting a high-yield, high-quality and high-efficiency 
agriculture," said Deputy Agriculture Minister Zhang Yanxi. 
  "It is an undertaking that will be beneficial to the country 
and the people, to our generation and future generations," he 
said at a press conference today. 
  The green certificate was referred to as a proof of a 
farmer's knowledge, expertise and other necessary qualifications 
for a certain technical job in agriculture. 
  It will normally take two years of successful completion of 
theoretical as well as practical study in a certain subject 
before a farmer can be awarded a green certificate, issued by 
the Agriculture Ministry. But for some specialties, such as 
plantation and husbandry, the study period will be longer. 
  China has a 430-million-strong rural labor force, out of a 
total of 900 million rural population. Farmers' poor education 
in science and technology is regarded as a major obstacle to the 
development of China's agricultural productivity. 
  The booming of the rural economy calls for a new generation 
of farmers, better equipped with scientific knowledge and 
technical expertise, thus necessitating vocational technical 
training for farmers who have already undergone secondary or 
high school studies. 
  Initial work for the farmers' green certificate training 
program began as early as 1990, with experimentation being 
carried out in 362 counties in 29 provinces and municipalities 
across China. 
  So far the number of trainees has totalled more than 
300,000, 
over 80,000 of whom have obtained green certificates, according 
to the Agriculture Ministry. 
  Under the project, about 2 million farmers will be trained 
to 
be qualified for the green certificates during the 1990-1995 
period. By 2000, an estimated 8 million to 10 million trainees 
are to become green certificate holders -- which means one for 
every 20 households in rural China. 
  The green certificate system covers sectors such as 
plantation, agricultural machinery, management of rural 
cooperative economy and rural environmental protection. 
  The green certificate holders will be in a better position 
for contracts and loans, technical instruction, agricultural 
information and necessary government support. 
  At present less than 40 percent of China's agricultural 
research results in agriculture can be applied and popularized 
in the vast countryside. The government has vowed to raise the 
ratio to 60 percent by the turn of this century. 
  This makes the green certificate system even more meaningful 
because those trained are expected to bridge the gap between 
researchers and millions of farmers, Zhang said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yonghong: "Project for Modernized </F>
Farming is Expanded"] 
  [Text] China's experimental Green Certificate Training 
Project will be extended nationwide in an ambitious drive to 
help millions of its farmers learn practical technical theories 
and expertise for agricultural production. 
  "Under the project, 8 million to 10 million farmers will be 
trained to be qualified Green-Certificate holders by 2000," said 
Deputy Agriculture Minister Zhang Yanxi at a press conference 
over the weekend that announced the programme's expansion. 
  The project's goal is to ensure that one in every 20 
households in rural China has a professional farmer with some 
scientific knowledge and technical expertise, becoming a 
backbone for local agricultural production and economic 
development. 
  The training project is significant for the entire country's 
agriculture advancement, said Zhang. The new corps of trained 
farmers will help the government to reach its goal of putting 60 
percent of agricultural research results into practical 
applications by the end of the century. Currently, less than 40 
percent of results get applied. 
  The Green Certificate is considered proof of a farmer's 
knowledge and expertise for a designated technical job in 
agriculture. 
  China initiated its training project experimentally in 1990. 
So far, it has involved 362 pilot counties in 28 provinces, 
municipalities and autonomous regions across China. 
  The vocational training has been given to more than 300,000 
farmers, of whom 80,000 have obtained certificates, Zhang said. 
  The training project covers such subjects as cultivation, 
animal husbandry and veterinary science, aquaculture, 
agricultural machinery, management of the rural cooperative 
economy and rural environmental protection. 
  As stipulated by the projects the certificate is issued by 
the Ministry of Agriculture to a farmer who has successfully 
completed theoretical study and practical training in a specific 
subject and who has demonstrated accomplishments in practical 
skills. 
  The training normally takes two years, but for some 
specialties-- such as cultivation and animal husbandry--the 
study period will be longer. 
  "The implementation of the Green Certificate project is not 
only necessary for the ongoing bid to promote high-yield, 
good-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, but it is 
imperative for the country's rural modernization drive," Zhang 
noted. 
  According to the project, the certificate holders will be in 
a better position to obtain contracts and loans, technical 
instruction, and other necessary government support. 
  As the country with the world's largest rural population of 
900 million, China has more than 430 million people engaged in 
its rural labour force. 
  However, two-thirds of these farmers are illiterate or 
poorly 
educated. Their low level of education in science and 
technology is regarded by the government as a major obstacle to 
the development of China's agricultural productivity and rural 
economic progress. 
  A new generation of farmers, with both high school and 
vocational education in scientific knowledge and technical 
expertise, is vital for rural economic growth

  [Text] Haikou, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Construction of a 
"state-farm" town was started in Haikou City, capital of Hainan 
Province, recently. 
  Designed by architects from Qinghua University, the town is 
expected to occupy 150 hectares with a building area of 2.6 
million square meters. 
  The town will include six main buildings and two sections: 
buildings for offices and conferences, trade, services, 
telecommunications and financial business as well as cultural, 
scientific and technological, and recreational facilities; and a 
residential section with gardens and a modern villa division. 
  With a total investment of 10 billion yuan, the project is 
expected to be completed in eight or ten years. 
  In the town, there is plenty of room for parking, and every 
household will have a parking space for cars. 
  The state farm sector in Hainan Province has more than 100 
medium-sized enterprises with more than one million people. 
  In the past few years, the sector has made great 
contributions to the opening up of Hainan Island. 
  Experts said the construction of the town is aimed at 
promoting the secondary and tertiary industries and will provide 
an opportunity for the sector to remold its development pattern.

  [Text] Haikou, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The employees of all 
enterprises and institutions in Hainan Province, China's largest 
special economic zone, are now covered by a unified social 
insurance system. 
  In 1991, the Hainan Provincial Government issued preliminary 
guidelines for retirement, job injury, unemployment and medical 
insurance coverage. 
  The regulations have now been popularized, spreading from 
state-owned enterprises and some collectively-owned enterprises 
to all kinds of enterprises and institutions. 
  The province has standardized insurance rates as a 
proportion 
of total salary figures. 
  By the end of 1993, 9,298 enterprises, including 777 
foreign-funded ones, had joined the insurance service system. 
  About 732,000 employees will benefit from the services. 
  In 1993, 189,964 retired employees in Hainan received 
pensions and 681 unemployed workers received relief funds from 
the service. 
  At the end of last year, the Hainan Provincial People's 
Congress approved three sets of insurance regulations concerning 
retirement, job injury and unemployment. 
  The regulations have extended their scope to government 
organs and self-employed businesses. 
  Sources said that the insurance service system in Hainan has 
taken the lead in the development of the service in China.

  [Text] The Fourth Plenary Session of the Yunnan Provincial 
CPC Discipline Inspection Commission wound up in Kunming 
yesterday afternoon. The closing session was presided over by 
Lang Dazhong, provincial party committee standing committee 
member and discipline inspection commission secretary. 
  The closing session adopted the "Resolution By the Fourth 
Plenary Session of the Yunnan Provincial CPC Discipline 
Inspection Commission." The "Resolution" fully affirmed the 
province's anticorruption struggle achievements scored since the 
Second Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Committee in August, 1993. 
  The "Resolution" emphatically stated: The year 1994 is 
crucial for Yunnan in implementing and carrying out the spirit 
of the 14th CPC National Congress, the spirit of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and also in 
building a socialist market economic structure. Therefore, we 
should firmly adhere to economic construction as the center; 
submit to the overall interests of CPC work; conscientiously 
implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Committee in light of actual local 
conditions and in accordance with arrangements made by the 
provincial party committee; profoundly, protractedly, and 
fruitfully push forward the province's ongoing anticorruption 
struggle on the basis of the existing achievements in this 
connection; and strive to persistently consolidate and carry on 
the ongoing anticorruption struggle with a view to attaining the 
three anticorruption goals put forward by the central 
authorities. To this end, we should mainly concentrate on the 
following two work aspects: 
  1. Conscientiously study and implement an important reccent 
anticorruption speech by Comrade Jiang Zemin and the spirit of 
the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Committee; correctly view and further the ongoing anticorruption 
struggle and orient it toward such overall interests as reform, 
development, and stability; 
  2. Work hard and strive to attain the three anticorruption 
goals put forward at the Third Plenary Session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Committee. To this end, leading cadres at 
all levels across the province should: Persistently take the 
lead in honestly discharging official duties and observing party 
and government discipline; strictly abide by the five 
regulations mapped out in 1993 by the central authorities for 
ensuring honest performance and discipline observance among 
cadres; conscientiously carry out self- examination and 
self-rectification in accordance with the five requirements laid 
down at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Discipline 
Inspection Committee; strengthen leadership over the ongoing 
anticorruption struggle; persistently and successfully 
investigate and handle each and every major and serious 
corruption case; and should make continued and earnest efforts 
to eradicate professional malpractices and improve social order. 
  The "Resolution" maintained: This year, the province's 
anticorruption struggle is bound to come across a host of new 
situations and problems. In view of this, we should make every 
possible effort to successfully accomplish each and every 
arduous task and overcome as many difficulties as possible. To 
this end, party committees, governments, and principal party and 
government leaders at all levels in the province, should: 
Firmly grasp the two key work aspects at the same time; take 
the ongoing anticorruption struggle as an indispensable 
component of the party and political power building work and a 
prerequisite for reform, development, and stability; place the 
anticorruption work high on the agenda; earnestly strengthen 
leadership over the ongoing anticorruption struggle; vigorously 
support discipline inspection and supervision organs in 
discharging their official duties; and should strive to 
successfully attain the three anti-corruption goals set by the 
central authorities.

  [Text] Kunming, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The DEHONG UNITY NEWS 
is read by five minority peoples who speak five different 
languages. 
  It is China's only journal that caters to such a diverse 
readership. 
  Founded on January 1, 1955, the quarto-format newspaper is 
run by the Dai and Jingpo nationalities autonomous prefecture in 
Dehong, southwest China's Yunnan Province. 
  The area is inhabited by 930,000 residents, of which 51 
percent are minorities of Dai, Jingpo, Lisu, Deang and Achang 
nationalities. 
  When the four-page union news was launched, it was published 
in Chinese, Dai, Jingpo and Lisu, with each language taking up 
one page. 
  The page in the Dai tongue, however, had to be handwritten 
because there was no print matrix for the language. Not until 
1956, when the first governor of the prefecture made the steel 
matrix for the Dai language, did the newspaper begin to publish 
the four language versions separately. 
  In 1989, this unique newspaper added one more version in 
Zaiwa, a branch of the Jingpo language. 
  Being the only newspaper to cater to such a diverse 
readership in China, the unity news has a circulation of around 
10,000. 
  "This is a small number. It plays its role, though," said Li 
Xiangqian, editor-in-chief. 
  He said that the paper symbolizes the unity of these 
minorities. 
  The paper devotes most space to local news. It also carries 
short articles and pictures as well as international news from 
the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY. 
  The newspaper has been used as a "textbook" by local primary 
schools and night schools. 
  For nearly four decades, the paper has also served as a 
cradle for the growth of minority writers and singers. 
  The publication caused quite a stir when its Dai and Jingpo 
versions made their way to neighboring Myanmar [Burma]. Some 
students of Zaiwa (the name of Jingpos living abroad) from 
Rangoon University even made trips to buy the paper. 
  Now published three times a week in Chinese, twice a week in 
Dai and Jingpo and weekly in Lisu and Zaiwa, the newspaper has 
drawn attention from scholars in the United States, Japan and 
other countries, who have written to the editors requesting 
copies of the newspapers for their research.

leading economic and commercial center, approved the 
establishment of 863 foreign-funded companies in the first 
quarter of 1994, according to the Municipal Commission of 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. 
  The approved companies involve 1.95 billion U.S. dollars of

of 
the total investment, will be spent in the city's transportation 
and telecommunications sectors. 
  New investors from seven countries including Israel, 
Nigeria, 
South Africa, Ireland and Venezuela also contracted to invest in 
shanghai, swelling the total number of investment source 
countries to 36 in the quarter, against 29 in the same period

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 14 (XINHUA) -- East China's Zhejiang 
Province plans to restrict its urban unemployment rate at below 
three percent this year by relying on market forces, according 
to an official of the provincial labor department. 
  He said that the provincial government plans to introduce a 
competitive labor market system province-wide over the next five 
years to pave the way for the creation of a market economy. 
  Now, more people have found jobs on various type of labor 
markets, in a change from getting job assignments from the 
government, he said. 
  Zhejiang, one of the most developed areas in China, 
currently 
has 70 labor markets, 500 job placement agencies, and 7,000 
labor service enterprises and workers' training centers. 
  In 1993 700,000 urban residents in Zhejiang found jobs 
through labor markets and nearly 60,000 residents were employed 
following vocational training, he said. 
  As a result, the urban unemployment rate went down to 2.6 
percent, he added. 
  The provincial authorities have decided to open a number of 
major labor markets in urban areas, and job-placement agencies 
in all counties and cities this year, he said. 
  In 1994 Zhejiang will also improve the social insurance 
system consisting primarily of old-age pensions and unemployment 
insurance, he said. 
  The premium will be shared by the state, the collectives and 
individuals, according to local officials. 
  Specifically, the mutual pension insurance system will be 
introduced in half of prefectures and cities, while unemployment 
insurance will be extended to all urban workers, he said.

  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 1 April, the provincial 
party committee and the provincial government cosponsored the 
family planning work conference. The conference urged the party 
committees and governments at various levels keep forging ahead, 
work arduously, ensure the fulfillment of various birth control 
tasks at the time of grasping the economic construction, realize 
all population control targets, and make contributions to 
promoting reform and opening up, economic development, and 
social stability. 
  Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
chaired the conference. At the conference, Li Bingliang, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee, relayed the 
guidelines of the national family planning forum. Gu Erxiong, 
vice governor of the provincial government, made specific 
opinions on further achieving the 1994 family planning work. Li 
Zhangshu, standing committee member and secretary general of the 
provincial party committee, read the provincial party committee 
and government's decision on honoring the 1993 "letters of 
responsibility for management of fixed population and birth 
control quotas" and on commending and awarding Boye County and 
criticizing and issuing yellow-card warnings to Xianxian County. 
The provincial party committee and government respectively 
signed letters of responsibility for management of fixed family 
planning quotas with various city and prefectural party 
committees. 
  The conference pointed out: At the time of vigorously 
promoting reform and opening up and accelerating the 
construction of the province into an economically powerful 
province, in the past year, the province persistently put the 
family planning work in an important position, expanded the 
dynamics of the work, and satisfactorily fulfilled the 
state-assigned population control plan. In the banner period for 
child births, the province better fulfilled the state-assigned 
population control plans for three consecutive years running. 
  In his speech, Cheng Weigao first affirmed the province's 
family planning work achievements. He said: The 1993 birth 
control targets were better fulfilled and the birth control 
rates were lower than the state-fixed targets. The grass-roots 
and basic work was further strengthened. The backward 
prefectures, cities, and counties conscientiously attended to 
the family planning work and changed their appearances. All 
levels were able to accurately accept investigations and 
criticisms. Through the investigations, the state discovered 
that some localities in our province made false reports. We 
earnestly accepted and accurately treated criticisms and 
actively adopted measures to firmly seek truth and punish false 
reports in an effort to turn criticisms into motivation. 
  Cheng Weigao pointed out: Birth control is extremely 
important. Particularly under the current circumstances where 
the managerial mechanism is not perfect, the vast rural areas' 
economic development level is not high, the quality of laborers 
is comparatively low, and the people have comparatively old 
ideas and lack the sense of legal system, it is more prominently 
important to strengthen the leadership of party committees and 
administrative management. We must never, in the slightest 
degree, be paralyzed or slackened. 
  He stressed: First, we should continue to carry out the 
system of responsibility for management of fixed population 
targets, persist in the method that top party and government 
leaders should assume sole responsibility for the management of 
birth control and personally engage in the work, strictly assess 
the implementation of the letters of responsibility, commend the 
good, criticize the bad, and sternly investigate and handle the 
activities that the birth rates are not well controlled due to 
leaders' negligence of duties. Second, we should be sure to 
strengthen the day-to-day work relating to family planning and 
the setup of the birth control system and unswervingly turn the 
focus of the family planning work from launching activities to 
regularizing and systemizing the family planning work so as to 
form systems, habits, and practice; to consolidate achievements; 
and realize targets. Third, in line with the building of 
well-to-do villages, we should vigorously grasp the grass-roots 
work, vigorously popularize advanced experiences, and 
particularly sum up and popularize the advanced experiences of 
the plain areas. Fourth, we should violently eliminate three 
long-standing problems, such as "falsehood, loopholes, and 
wantonness." Falsehood means false situation and false figures. 
We should exert great efforts to solve the problems in this 
regard. Loopholes mean that there are many loopholes, including 
earlier marriage and earlier births, management of floating 
population, and unlawful upbringing of children. We should 
firmly formulate measures to eliminate the problems in this 
regard. Wantonness means wantonly enforcing policies and 
wantonly assigning quotas, and abusing power for selfish gains. 
The problems in this regard should resolutely be ended. Fifth, 
we should strengthen the construction of the family planning 
workers contingents, strictly enforce various systems, and 
upgrade the management levels. Sixth, we should pay attention 
to studying the new conditions cropping up in the new situation. 
  Ye Liansong, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor of the provincial government, made a 
speech at the conference. [passage omitted] 
  Zhao Jinduo, standing committee member of the provincial 
party committee and secretary of the Shijiazhuang city party 
committee; and Zhou Xin, vice chairman of the provincial 
people's congress standing committee, attended the conference. 
  Present at the conference were secretaries of the city and 
prefectural party committees, mayors, prefectural commissioners, 
prefectural and city leaders in charge of family planning work, 
chairmen of the prefectural and city family planning committees, 
heads of the population survey teams, members of the family 
planning leading groups, party committee secretaries and family 
planning commission directors of the 20 key family planning 
management counties as defined in 1994.

  [Text] Tianjin's Laochengli, with a total area of 1.5 
square kilometers, will be thoroughly rebuilt into a new area 
characterized not only by a modern flavor but also the style of 
folk custom, and with the combination of financial, commercial, 
trade, and residential zones. The Nankai District Government 
and Anxin Group (Hong Kong) Corporation held a ceremony on the 
evening to 26 March to sign the contract on jointly rebuilding 
the old city proper of Nankai District. 
  Attending the ceremony were municipal leaders Luo Yuanpeng, 
Liu Wenfan, and Wang Dehui; veteran comrades Mao Changwu, Bai 
Hualing, and Hu Xiaohuai; and Xie Guoxiang, deputy director of 
the Tianjin Chinese Culture Promotion Association. 
  Wang Shukai, head of Nankai District, and Chen Xiaoqi, 
president of the Anxin Group (Hong Kong) Corporation, signed the 
contracts respectively. 
  Tianjin was formerly called "Laochengli." With a total area 
of 1.5 square kilometers and a total population of 110,000, and 
with east, south, west, and north roads around its borders, 
Laochengli is an area embracing relatively more dangerous and 
crude houses. After sensing the tremendous potentials and 
prospects of this area through survey and analysis, Anxin Group 
has decided to make investment in rebuilding this old city 
proper into a new area influential in north China and even in 
the whole country. 
  The pare-phase investment of Anxin Group is subject to 
unified designing and planning and is devoted to developing 25 
percent of the construction area covering 3.6 million square 
meters. Upon the completion of this project, 30 bank buildings 
will be set up in the northeast part (formally named Guanyinhao) 
to form a banking area. The northwest part of this area will be 
built into a commercial and trade zone, where the Tianjin 
Municipal World Trade Center will be included. The southwest 
part will be built into a hotel, commercial, and residential 
zone, including a five-star hotel, a large shopping center, and 
an indoor garden, the largest of its kind in China, filled with 
fresh flowers in all seasons under a glass ceiling, and 
furnished with a children's playground. The southeast part will 
be into a residential zone embracing high-, middle-, and 
low-class residences. In addition, an artificial lake and some 
sports installations will be built. At the crossroads of the 
old city proper, a drum-tower with the ancient Chinese 
architectural style will be restored and rebuilt, and a 
three-km-long internal ring road, with the old crossroads as its 
center, will be built. The former crossroads will be changed to 
the streets only for pedestrians, and along the streets, there 
will be Chinese local and special products shops, typical local 
dishes restaurants, theaters, shopping centers, and tourist 
service centers. 
  Mr. Chen Xiaoqi, president of Anxin Group (Hong Kong) 
Corporation, said: The rebuilding of this old city proper can 
be likened to a bone, which our corporation is gnawing on. That 
is, we will use our own mode to rebuild and build it, and the 
success in this project will create a new path for the 
rebuilding of Tianjin's old city proper and even the whole 
country. 
  It is learned that it will take five to seven years to 
complete the reconstruction.

  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Tianjin Municipality held a 
mobilization rally on carrying out the "222 project." Gao 
Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, pointed out 
in his speech: Grasping the "222 project" is one of the 
important moves of municipal economic work to be carried out 
this year, because it affects the overall situation of Tianjin's 
economic development, reform, development, and stability. It is 
necessary to proceed from Tianjin's industrial reality, 
concentrate efforts on grasping major enterprises and major 
products that affect the overall situation at all levels and 
rapidly turn them into key enterprises and competitive products 
in an effort to invigorate Tianjin's industry and promote a 
sustained, rapid, and sound development in the entire economy. 
  Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave 
an important speech at the rally. Li Huifen, member of the 
standing committee of the municipal party committee and vice 
mayor, attended and addressed the mobilization rally. Zheng 
Zhiying, member of the standing committee of the municipal party 
committee and secretary general, attended the rally. 
Responsible comrades of the municipal economic commission 
offered suggestions for carrying out the "222 project." The 
first light industrial bureau, Chinese medicinal herbs 
enterprise group, and the communications broadcast company 
introduced their ideas and measures for implementing the "222 
project." 
  In line with the plans defined at the second enlarged 
session 
of the sixth municipal party committee and the second session of 
the 12th municipal people's congress, and keeping in mind the 
work ideology of carrying out package reform with breakthroughs 
in key areas, the municipal industrial sector will implement the 
"222 project" this year. The main substances are: The 
municipal authorities will grasp two major items; the municipal 
economic commission will grasp 20 major products; and all 
districts, counties, and bureaus will grasp 200 major products. 
A good job in organizing efforts to implement the "222 
project," supporting the development of a batch of major 
products with high level, large scale, and good efficiency, 
realizing rapid development, and rapidly forming an atmosphere 
are of great significance in invigorating Tianjin's industry 
and promoting a rapid economic development in the municipality. 
  While touching on the targets which we must attain in 
carrying out the "222 project," Gao Dezhan pointed out: Through 
grasping the "222 project," we should attend to Tianjin's pillar 
industry and form a number of products which have great 
influence domestically and internationally. This is the 
orientation of Tianjin's industrial development. To grasp the 
"222 project," we must grasp the new and important economic 
growing point and invigorate the number of economic units in 
reserve. To grasp this project means to deepen and develop the 
work of ending deficits and increasing profits. Specifically, 
we should grasp major tax and profit delivering households and 
key financial revenue earning units because they are the 
priorities of the work of increasing profits. Grasping this 
project means to materialize the package reform with 
breakthroughs in key areas. We should turn these enterprises 
into examples of reform, management, and development, use 
typical examples to bring along the ordinary enterprises, and 
promote the whole municipality's industrial development. To 
grasp the essence of the "222 project" means that we must seize 
the priorities, turn them into competitive products, promote 
development, and revitalize Tianjin's industry. The hope of 
Tianjin's industry lies in whether we can successfully carry out 
this project. In order to grasp the "222 project" well, we must 
further improve the plans and implement measures; give special 
emphasis to some items and develop them step by step; 
concentrate energy on managing several major affairs, push key 
enterprises forward, dynamically grasp one group of products 
after another, and make Tianjin's industry enter the path of a 
well-rounded cycle. 
  Gao Dezhan stressed: The main objective of grasping the 
"222 project" should be manifested in two aspects. One is to 
raise economic efficiency, and the other is to intensify the 
development momentum so that enterprises have efficiency at 
present and development momentum in the future. By the end of 
1995, the automobile industry should form a capacity of 
producing 150,000 cars and create 2 billion yuan in profits and 
taxes by 1996. By the end of 1996, the steel pipe company 
should attain the designed production capacity and realize 1 
billion yuan in profits and taxes. The 20 varieties of key 
products developed by the municipality on a priority basis will 
involve 39 enterprises. This year we must realize 2.6 billion 
yuan in profits and taxes and break the record of 3 billion yuan 
by 1995. The 200 varieties of key products grasped by 
districts, counties, and bureaus should produce 3.3 billion yuan 
in profits and taxes this year and break the record of 4 billion 
yuan by 1995. In this way, by 1996, all enterprises that 
involve in the "222 project" will increase their profits and 
taxes by 100 percent over 1993 and reach 11 billion yuan in 
profits and taxes. It will be arduous to realize the 
aforementioned objectives and tasks. We must fulfill 
responsibility, mobilize the people deeply, fight to win or die, 
adopt practical and effective measures, and resolutely 
accomplish the "222 project." 
  Gao Dezhan urged: To successfully carry out the "222 
project," we must have new ideas and new methods and enter the 
path of regarding raising economic efficiency as the central 
task, relying on scientific and technological progress, and 
enhancing the quality of laborers. This work should be carried 
out throughout the main line of reform. It is necessary to 
regard reform as the motivation, cultivate the ideology of 
relying on reform to promote development, proceed from reality, 
and strive to successfully carry out the work in 10 aspects, 
such as deepening reform, expanding the degree of opening up, 
readjusting the structure, conducting technological 
transformation, strengthening management, developing products, 
building leading bodies, training staff and workers, building 
work shifts and groups, and building spiritual civilization. 
Enterprises across the municipality should attend to these 
tasks. Major enterprises should exert greater efforts to their 
work, seek more rapid progress, and achieve better results. It 
is necessary to persist in proceeding from reality, give 
different guidance to different cases, suit the remedy to the 
case, comprehensively manage enterprises, and grasp each and 
every enterprise until good results are achieved. 
  Gao Dezhan pointed out at the end of his speech: The key to 
grasping the "222 project" well is to make earnest efforts to do 
practical things. Enterprises should improve their internal 
skills and all departments should start up the green light. At 
present, all enterprises must make overall plans and 
arrangements, start to plan what items they should grasp and how 
to grasp as quickly as possible, and step up efforts to carry 
out the items, and must not remain in the stage of discussion. 
They must study practical methods and pay attention to actual 
results. All enterprise leading bodies, cadres, and workers 
must have a good mental attitude, further enhance spirit, 
immerse themselves in hard work, and be determined to fight well 
this battle to tackle the most difficult problems. All 
departments in charge of comprehensive work, pertinent 
departments, and administrative law enforcing departments should 
try by all possible means to do practical things for 
enterprises. The questions raised by enterprises are the key 
points for doing practical things. We should conscientiously 
implement the system of assuming responsibility over a certain 
work target, give strict evaluation, give awards and punishment, 
and implement this project firmly. In the course of carrying 
out the "222 project," we must discover and solve problems in a 
timely manner, hold coordination meetings regularly, and turn 
this practice into a system. As long as the whole municipality, 
from the higher to the lower level, reach an identical view, 
clarify the objectives, strengthen leadership, adopt effective 
measures, and make concerted efforts to grasp the "222 
project," Tianjin's industry will be revitalized, and will 
create brilliant achievements. 
  In the mobilization speech, Li Huifen touched on three 
issues: First, fully understand the importance and pressing need 
of successfully carrying out the "222 project"; second, adopt 
effective measures to accelerate the pace of implementing the 
"222 project"; and third, fulfill responsibility and render good 
service. [passage omitted] 
  Responsible comrades of all committees, offices, districts, 
counties, bureaus, and relevant departments attended the rally.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 13 (XINHUA) -- North China's largest 
port city of Tianjin witnessed a new surge of overseas capital 
inflow in the first quarter of this year. 
  In the three months, Tianjin approved the establishment of 
554 foreign-funded projects, involving a total investment of 1.4 
billion U.S. dollars, figures available today show. 
  The inflow of foreign funds has topped one billion U.S. 
dollars, representing an increase of 55.4 percent over the same 
period last year, an official from the municipal foreign trade 
and economic cooperation commission said. 
  The official attributed the increase mainly to the improved 
investment environment in the city, and to the efforts made to 
improve services and simplify approval procedures. 
  Over 70 big projects involving overseas investment were 
worked out and tracts of land were leased to foreign investors 
to develop in the city last year. 
  So far, the number of the foreign-funded projects whose 
total 
investment surpasses five million U.S. dollars each has reached 
38 this year, a hefty 52 percent rise over the same period last 
year. Among them, 27 topped 10 million U.S. dollars each. 
  Foreign investment in real estate also gained the ground 
last 
year, with 35 newly-approved foreign-funded real estate projects 
and 170 million U.S. dollars of agreed overseas funds. 
  The city also earned nearly 100 million U.S. dollars by 
leasing 9,900 sq m of land, the official said. 
  It signed contracts for 38 new projects to renovate and 
upgrade old industrial enterprises. The move made it possible 
for 300 million U.S. dollars of overseas capital to be used in 
this aspect. 
  The 1,220 operational foreign-funded firms in the city are 
reported to have completed 5.15 billion yuan in output value and 
5.27 billion yuan in turnover, and created 590 million yuan in 
profits and taxes in the first quarter. 
  Exports by these foreign-funded firms accounted for 27.9 
percent of the city's total. 
  In the first three months of this year 26 foreign-funded 
firms expanded their investment, and the amount of increased 
investment was more than 77 million U.S. dollars, including 32 
million U.S. dollars in foreign funds. 
  The city has newly added 400 projects this year to attract 
more foreign investment.

  [Text] Over the past few years, the number of cases of 
destroying, cutting, and stealing communication lines remained 
high in various localities of the province. Thus, some 
communication lines were seriously damaged, and serious economic 
losses were brought to the state. 
  The relevant data showed: From 1991 to 1993, 209 cases of 
these cases took place in the province, 2.959 million 
communication lines were cut, 87,000-meter-long electric wires 
and cables were stolen, and the direct economic losses reached 
1.146 million yuan. Particularly since the beginning of 1993, 
the number of cases of theft and clipping of urban telephone 
cables increased by a big margin. In the first quarter of 1993, 
18 cases of theft and clipping of urban telephone cables took 
place in Jiamusi city. A total of 2,157-meter-long electric 
cables of various kinds were stolen and more than 2,200 
telephone subscribers were forced to stop using telephones. 
This directly brought about 157,000 yuan of economic losses. 
In March 1993, 11 cases of stealing urban telephone cables and 
trunk lines successively occurred in Wuchang city. Thus, 21,700 
communications lines were cut and over 100,00 yuan in economic 
losses were generated. In addition to the many cases in 
Jiamusi, Shuangyashan, and Qiqihar, criminal offender Yang Zian 
committed a series of five such cases from 3 January to 4 
February this year at Yichun city airport, Wumahe, and goods 
yards; stole 880-meter-long urban telephone cables, cut 
12.2-meter-long communication lines, and caused over 30,000 yuan 
in economic losses. 
  Since last Autumn, the province has built optical fiber 
communication lines on a large scale. Simultaneously, some law 
offenders fixed their eyes on the optical fiber communication 
lines. They ran away after failing to sell the stolen optical 
fiber communication lines totaling several hundreds meters in 
length. All this has brought about gigantic losses to the state. 
  A few days ago, the provincial postal and telecommunications 
department conscientiously studied the situation in which 
increasingly more cases of stealing communication lines took 
place, particularly of theft of the state first- and 
second-grade trunk lines; worked out methods to solve these 
problems; and implemented measures to keep a lookout for key 
projects, such as optical fiber communication lines. 
Simultaneously, the department urged that all local postal and 
telecommunications departments should positively work in 
coordination with the security organs to deal strict blows to 
the criminal activities of damaging communications lines so as 
to ensure constant availability of communication lines.

  [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
Government today published regulations to speed up the official 
responses when other countries make allegations of dumping 
against Chinese exports. 
  The move comes at a time when more and more Chinese export 
items are being put under anti-dumping investigation and having 
anti- dumping taxes imposed on them. 
  A document signed by Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and 
economic cooperation (MOFTEC), says that when China's export 
commodities are accused abroad of dumping, China's chambers of 
commerce for imports and exports, or the association of 
enterprises with foreign investment, will be responsible for 
organizing the response to such allegations. 
  If entrusted by the defending party, they can retain 
competent foreign lawyers, well-informed about China, to answer 
the suits in the courts. 
  The new regulations, 24 articles long, are aimed at 
protecting the lawful rights of Chinese production and 
export-oriented enterprises, preserving the market for China's 
export commodities, and suitably answering cases brought in 
courts abroad accusing Chinese exports of dumping. 
  The regulations, stipulating in detail the procedures and 
methods to answer such lawsuits, demand that the departments 
concerned conduct better market investigations, and adopt 
necessary means to avoid the occurrence of foreign anti-dumping 
cases. 
  A MOFTEC official attributed the increase in anti-dumping 
suits against Chinese commodities to the retrenchment of trade 
protectionism in western countries and the discrimination 
against Chinese export commodities, and to the disorder in 
China's foreign trade in some areas or some enterprises. 
  Thus, the new regulations ask the enterprises to answer 
suits 
actively. Otherwise, all or part of their rights to apply for 
export quotas and permits will be taken away. 
  In addition, part or all of their rights to conduct foreign 
trade would be taken from them if circumstances of infringement 
are serious, and they may also be fined.

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China will 
work for a good implementation of the Uruguay-round trade 
accords, the head of the Chinese delegation told the GATT 
ministerial meeting here today. 
  Gu Yongjiang, also Chinese vice-minister of foreign trade 
and 
economic cooperation, was speaking to some 170 delegations 
meeting in the Moroccan city to sign the Uruguay-round trade 
accords, which were reached last December under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  The Uruguay round of talks "has not only made substantial 
achievements on market access, but also succeeded in 
strengthening and enlarging the multilateral principles guiding 
world trade," said Gu. 
  He said that "the Chinese government supports the creation 
of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO)," which will replace GATT on 
January 1, 1995, an event marking "the start of a new phase for 
the global multilateral trade system." 
  "A large number of developing countries, by taking free 
trade 
measures for the expansion of global trade, have made an 
important contribution" to the success of the Uruguay round of 
talks, Gu said. 
  However, their "interests have not been given appropriate 
consideration," he said. 
  "We share the concerns of the developing countries on a 
number of important issues such as trade and environment as well 
as the social aspects of trade," he said. 
  "The Chinese government hopes that developing countries will 
have more fair opportunities in the new trade system and that 
their interests, especially those of the least developed 
countries, will be embodied effectively in this system," he 
noted. 
  China will also seek to "create necessary conditions to 
resume as soon as possible its status of a GATT contracting 
member and to become a founding member of the WTO," said Gu. 
  He stressed that "China's complete integration into the 
world 
trade system will strengthen the universality of the WTO" and 
"will provide much more access for foreign products and services 
to the large market of China."

<F P=106> [By reporters Tan Fayu (6223 4099 3842) and Zhang Keqian </F>
(1728 0344 0578)] 
  [Text] Marrakech (Morocco), 13 Apr (XINHUA) -- Addressing 
a ministerial conference of the Uruguay round of trade talks 
held in Marrakech today, Chinese delegation Head Gu Yongjiang 
pointed out: "The Uruguay round constitutes multilateral trade 
talks on an unprecedented scale. It not only made promises on 
wide-ranging market accession, but amplified and improved a 
series of multilateral norms guiding world trade." A top 
priority task now facing us is to conscientiously implement the 
agreements reached during the Uruguay round. China is willing 
to make its own contributions. 
  Reviewing the Uruguay round of talks, he emphatically 
pointed 
out: The vast number of developing countries "took a 
comprehensive part in the talks, played a positive role, made 
important contributions, and adopted extensive measures for 
trade liberalization to expand international trade." The 
Chinese Government hopes that, under the new world trade system, 
the developing countries "will have more adequate and equal 
opportunities for participation, and their interests will be 
practically reflected on the basis of special and preferential 
treatment." 
  Touching on the issue of China's "reentry into GATT," Gu 
Yongjiang pointed out: China has conducted talks on its 
"reentry into GATT" for eight years. Meanwhile, to meet GATT's 
requirements and effectively fulfill its obligations, "China has 
continuously reformed its economic and trade systems, achieved 
success acknowledged worldwide, and provided rapidly increasing 
opportunities for foreign products and services to enter into 
its market." 
  Concerning the World Trade Organization [WTO] to be 
established soon, Gu Yongjiang pointed out: "The establishment 
of the WTO signals the progress of multilateral world trade to a 
new phase of development." He further pointed out: "The body 
should be a world trade organization worthy of its name; it 
should have more representatives from all over the world than 
GATT has." He continued: "Only by attracting countries and 
regions with different economic characteristics and different 
levels of economic development to participate in the body" can 
the WTO guarantee the "effective operation" of its established 
multilateral trade system and "maintain its long-term growth and 
vitality." 
  Finally, the head of the Chinese delegation emphatically 
pointed out: China has clearly and definitely requested 
becoming a founding member of the WTO. China's "reentry into 
GATT" and its becoming a member of the WTO "will be conducive to 
the establishment of a more open foreign trade system in China." 
He said: "With an economy that is enjoying vigorous 
development, an open market boasting a population of 1.2 
billion, and being ranked 11th in world trade, China as a 
founding member of the WTO will undoubtedly enhance the 
universality and importance of the organization; and undoubtedly 
make important contributions to the prosperity of the world 
economy and growth of world trade." 
  More than 40 delegation leaders took the floor at the 
conference yesterday afternoon and this morning. They all 
affirmed the results of the Uruguay round of talks, and hoped to 
further solve the problems existing in world trade and to 
improve the international trade system.

  [Text] Vienna, April 13 (XINHUA) -- China will support as 
ever international efforts in drug control, said a Chinese 
delegate at the 37th session of the UN Commission on Narcotic 
Drugs opened here today. 
  "The Chinese government will...devote serious attention to 
and intensify international cooperation in the field of 
narcotics control...and take an active part in every specified 
activity in the domain of international drug control and will 
make its own contribution in this regard," said Chen Shiqiu, 
head of the Chinese delegation. 
  In particular, China will "spare no effort to support the 
Golden Triangle sub-regional drug control cooperative activities 
and projects," he added. 
  Chen, who is also the Chinese representative in the 
Vienna-based UN and other international institutions, reported 
to the meeting on China's anti-drug achievements. 
  China has been placing special emphasis on the interdiction 
effort against transit drug smuggling in its southwestern border 
areas through comprehensive measures to strictly prohibit drug 
trafficking, cultivation and abuse, and intensified drug law 
enforcement, he noted. 
  In 1993, the Chinese drug law enforcement agencies handled 
26,191 cases, apprehended 40,834 suspects and seized 3,354 
kilograms of opium, 4,459 kilograms of heroin and 90 metric tons 
of essential chemicals and precursors destined for the Golden 
Triangle area for drug processing. 
  In addition, China had last year 50,000 persons/times 
treated 
in more than 200 drug detoxification centers and currently gives 
treatment to 15,000 drug addicts. 
  Chen said that the Chinese government has put all 22 
controlled chemicals under the export licensing system as 
requested by the 1988 UN convention designed to prevent 
diversion of pharmaceutical drugs into illicit channels. 
  The conference of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, which 
will conclude on April 22, is expected to review the work of the 
UN International Drug Control Program and International 
Narcotics Control Board. 
  It will in particular review the progress made by individual 
countries in implementing the drug control convention and a UN 
resolution on the issue approved by the 48th session of the UN 
General Assembly last year.

  [Text] Beijing, April 13 (XINHUA) -- Qian Qichen, China's 
vice-premier and foreign minister, said here today that the 
Chinese Government attaches great importance to its relations 
with South Asian countries and supports the stand of 
establishing the South Asian nuclear-free zone and the Indian 
Ocean peace zone. 
  Qian made the remarks when he held talks with Mustafizur 
Rahman, foreign minister of Bangladesh, here at the Diaoyutai 
State Guesthouse this afternoon. 
  During the talks, Qian and Rahman exchanged views on 
bilateral relations, regional and international issues. 
  Qian said that China pays close attention to its good 
neighborly relations with Bangladesh, and that the future for 
bilateral cooperation is excellent. 
  Qian expressed his hope that the nation-to-nation issues 
between South Asian countries will be solved through peaceful

regional economic cooperation so as to develop the potentially 
great market in the region.

Bangladesh-China relations, saying that such relations were 
established on the basis of mutual trust and cooperation. 
  He hoped that Bangladesh and China will build closer 
relations by joint efforts and further their economic and trade 
cooperation.

  [Text] Jinan, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Weihai, a port city in 
east China's Shandong Province and China's nearest city to the 
Republic of Korea (ROK), will have regular trade fair or 
discussions with the ROK. 
  This has been been approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade 
and economic cooperation recently. 
  So far this is the only officially ratified annual 
discussion 
of its kind in China. 
  In July last year, Weihai succeeded in holding the '93 
Sino-ROK economic and trade discussion. The first of subsequent 
discussions this year has been scheduled for in September. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation and 
the local government have pinned high hopes on this year's 
discussion, as 2,000 foreign businessmen, including 1,000 from 
the ROK, will be invited to the fair. The others will be from 
Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, Europe and the 
United States.

  [Text] Bonn, April 13 (XINHUA) -- U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali said here today that he supports in 
principle Germany's request for a permanent seat in a reformed 
UN Security Council. 
  He made the statement at a press conference at the end of 
his 
two-day visit, his third to Germany. 
  Under the UN Charter, the decision on expanding the 15-seat 
council has to be taken by the UN General Assembly and he is not 
responsible for the issue, said Butrus-Ghali. 
  But the UN chief promised to appoint a German as an under- 
secretary-general. 
  He said he welcomes any role Germany can play in the UN. 
  The Security Council has five permanent members and some 
countries, including Germany and Japan, have tried to obtain 
permanent seats in the body.

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 13 (XINHUA) -- The United 
States and the European Union agreed today to open government 
contracts to competitive bids, except those of 
telecommunications, U.S. and EU trade representatives said here 
today. 
  Under the accord, European enterprises will have the right 
to 
compete for public bids in 39 U.S. states while American 
manufacturers of heavy-electrical equipment will be able to 
increase sales to state-owned utilities in Europe. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and EU trade chief 
Leon Brittan made the announcement at a joint press conference 
in the city, where 120 ministers are meeting to sign the Uruguay 
round of trade accord reached last December under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). 
  Kantor said that the accord, to be signed Friday within the 
Uruguay round framework, will allow the two sides access to 
markets worth some 200 billion U.S. dollars. 
  But the public market of telecommunications in Europe, 
coveted by U.S. firms, still remains to be discussed here later. 
  Kantor and Brittan had met several times outside the 
ministerial meeting of GATT, which opened Tuesday in this 
Moroccan city and will last till Friday.
