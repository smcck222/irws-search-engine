<F P=106> [By Li Hong: "State Bid to Improve Builders, Architects"] </F>
  [Text] A plan to license architects and improve the 
supervision of building projects is being launched by the 
Ministry of Construction. 
  The plan is being started to improve the quality of 
construction in China, said a ministry official at the weekend. 
  And the licensing scheme has been tested successfully in 
Northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
  It is expected to be introduced nationwide soon, said the 
official. 
  The first examination for architects, an indispensable part 
of the licensing scheme, is planned for later this year, he 
added. 
  The trial in Liaoning has been done in line with 
international practice and includes the appraisal of an 
applicant's academic qualifications, professional training and 
achievements. 
  Only licensed architects are allowed to bid for contracts, 
the official said. 
  The move had come after years of chaos in the profession. 
Unqualified people were able to practise and architects' rights 
and responsibilities had long remained vague. 
  Designs used to be done by State-owned institutes instead of 
architects. 
  This lack of organization has crippled many architects' 
creativity and enthusiasm. And moves to improve standards have 
so far been very slow, said the official. 
  The new system, he said, aims to bring standards 
sufficiently 
high that they will be recognized in other countries and regions. 
  Several countries, including the United States, have yet to 
acknowledge Chinese architectural qualifications. 
  At the same time, the ministry is to expand its 
building-control system to all projects in China. 
  Supervisors will make sure projects' quality, progress and 
finances tally strictly with the contracts, the same official 
said. 
  Under the old planned economy there were frequent lows 
between owners and contractors over poor construction quality 
and delayed payments because there was no supervision of their 
contracts. 
  About 15 per cent of China's construction products are said 
to be substandard last year, while building firms were owed 20 
billion yuan ($2.3 billion), causing more and more distress for 
project owners and contractors, said the official. 
  The supervision system was first brought in to cover the 
Beijing Tianjin-Tangu Expressway and hydro-electric power 
stations in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the late 1980s. 
  Now, many construction projects, including the Guangzhou 
metro system, the new Beijing railway station and the gigantic 
Three Gorges Dam project, are endorsing it. 
  Ministry officials say they plan to bring the new system 
into 
housing projects as complaints have been rising. 
  The Shanghai-based Wen Hui Daily [WEN HUI BAO] reported last 
week that up to 60 per cent of the city's new homes leak.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Nepa Reveals $1.6m Pollution Fine Scheme"] </F>
  [Text] The National Environmental Protection Agency (Nepa) 
yesterday announced a $1.6 million plan to improve China's 
pollution charges system. 
  The two-year project involves a pollution study and aims to 
work out new charges for offenders, said Lu Xinyuan, deputy 
director of Nepa's supervision and development department. 
  It is being financed by a $1 million loan from the World 
Bank 
and 5 million yuan ($600,000) from central and provincial 
governments. 
  All enterprises are to be taxed for emitting sulphur dioxide 
before the end of the year and they will have to pay for 
discharging solid waste next year. 
  Lu said the measures would help curb the spread of acid rain 
which is caused by sulphur dioxide. 
  Acid rain damages crops, forests and buildings and costs 
China an estimated 16 billion yuan ($2 billion) a year. 
  It is currently spreading from Southwest to East China, the 
official said. 
  The country first adopted pollution charges in the late 70s. 
  And 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have 
levied charges on 113 pollutants. 
  More than 200,000 enterprises nationwide have paid a total 
of 
18 billion yuan ($2 billion) in the past 15 years. 
  Last year, they paid 2.7 billion yuan ($310 million) -- more 
than lO times the figure in the late 70s. 
  The charges have been used to subsidize the control of key 
polluted areas. 
  And they have covered 6 per cent of the country's total 
spending on the control of industrial pollution. 
  Studies into the uses of pollution charges in 24 large and 
medium-sized cities showed 796 million yuan ($139 million at the 
old exchange rate) had been levied on 3,901 enterprises in seven 
years. 
  This cash, plus government investment, funded the 
construction of more than 7,000 pollution-control projects 
nationwide. They were designed to treat 794 million tons of 
waste water and 199.1 billion cubic metres of waste gas a year.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Wu: "Needs Grow Down on the Farm"] </F>
  [Text] Despite the wider use of scientific products on 
Chinese farms, domestic supplies of agricultural production 
materials should generally meet demands this year, agricultural 
officials say. 
  Sources in the ministries of Agriculture and Internal Trade 
disclosed a string of figures on domestic demand this year for 
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and 
plastic film for farm use. 
  In 1994, farmers may need 125 million tons of chemical 
fertilizers, for which officials have fully prepared by stocking 
ample reserves. 
  But the officials predict that the prices of various 
fertilizers will climb marginally in the autumn, when most of 
the country's grain and cash crops are harvested and farmers are 
likely to be in a buying mood. 
  To prevent severe damage to crops by pests and insects, the 
domestic demand for pesticides will stand at around 210,000 tons 
this year. Of this, insecticides will account for 150,000 tons. 
  Animal husbandry is the major customer of the herbicide 
industry, which predicts demand of at least 30,000 tons. 
  Agricultural officials say that this year the supply of 
domestically made pesticides will still exceed demand, as it did 
last year. 
  But the supply of imported high quality pesticides -- which 
are highly effective, less poisonous to humans and more 
degradable once used -- will lag behind the strong domestic 
need, they added. 
  The demand for plastic film for all-season agricultural 
production, along with greenhouses, has increased steadily. 
This year demand for such film should remain at 520,000 tons, 
the same as in 1993. 
  The central government has vowed to give strong support to 
the domestic trade and the importers of agricultural production 
materials. 
  It intends to relieve farmers' anxiety about the supply, 
prices and quality of production materials. 
  The government will also allow more dealers to trade in 
fertilizers, a business traditionally monopolized by government. 
  Last year, gross domestic sales of agricultural production 
materials amounted to 69.3 billion yuan ($8 billion), down 4.09 
percent from 1992. 
  Farmers are encouraged by the government's support, and are 
determined to have a more productive year than 1993. 
  Last December, a traditionally sluggish time for 
agricultural 
production, sales of fertilizer, pesticide and plastic film all 
rose more than 50 per cent from the same period in 1992.

<F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Farm Loans Due To Grow Hefty 28 Percent This </F>
Year"] 
  [Text] The Agricultural Bank of China vows to help the 
government rack up a 4 per cent rise in loans earmarked for 
farming this year. 
  As China's leading financial arm for rural investment, the 
bank plans to lend more than 29 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) to 
farmers for their production this year, up 28 per cent from 1993. 
  Loans affecting farm production still receive top priority 
in 
lending policy decisions taken at the bank. However, the 
government-set schedule for separating commercial banking from 
policy banking will eventually make the bank's practices more 
commercial. Mandatory lending will be turned over to the 
soon-to-be-created Agricultural Development Bank. 
  The bank is responding to the government's call for ensuring 
that loans earmarked for agricultural production account for at 
least 10 per cent of the country's total bank credits in 1994, 
up 4 percent from last year. 
  To cope with the growing demand for capital from the 
countryside, the bank officials said, the bank's arranged loans 
this year also include 4 billion yuan ($460 million) in poverty 
alleviation loans and 2 billion yuan ($230 million) for 
comprehensive agricultural development. 
  Starting this year, the Agricultural Bank will also strongly 
back construction in the country's 500 centrally-controlled 
grain production centres and the 150 State-controlled high 
quality cotton-growing counties, bank officials said. 
  Ma Yongwei, president of the bank, predicted inflationary 
pressure in 1994 will exert greater pressure on farmers to cut 
production costs. 
  If inflation remains at last year's level, he said, it will 
stimulate a spiralling of agricultural prices as well as a 
higher demand for bank loans. 
  In addition, Ma added, the disparity between available 
capital and the demand for credit will widen this year, as the 
Agricultural Bank must shoulder a heavier burden in buying State 
treasury bonds and co-operated bonds. 
  Official figures show that during the first quarter of this 
year the bank lent nearly 20.1 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) to 
farmers for their production, two times more than in the same 
period of 1993. 
  The bank's major branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, 
Tianjin and Nanjing expanded their agricultural loans by 300 
million yuan ($34.5 million) to 500 million yuan ($57.5 million) 
each during the January-March period, a busy season in the 
agricultural calendar. 
  This was backed by a considerable increase in the bank's 
personal savings deposits, which jumped 23.8 billion yuan ($2.7 
billion) over a year ago.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Market Can Oil Wheels of Rusty Railways"] </F>
  [Text] To meet the demand for more and better railway 
cars, the country will rely on manufacturers to act as the 
locomotive pulling the highly-centralized rail system into 
market-oriented reforms, according to a senior government 
official. 
  Only the rigors of a market economy can help the industry 
out 
of its plight, Fu Zhihuan, Vice-Minister of Railways, said in 
Beijing recently. 
  Most railway manufacturing plants are still managed by the 
dictates of a planned economic system, under which the 
government sets production quotas, buys products at prices it 
sets, and controls investment. 
  So while the massive rail expansion now under way in China 
cries out for fast heavy-haul rolling stock, production plants 
are hamstrung by lack of capital and outdated techniques. 
  To raise both the capacity and quality of rail cars, a 
modern 
enterprise system must be phased in by the China National 
Railway Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry Corp (Loric), 
which runs 35 plants and four research institutes and employs 
270,000 people. 
  By 1995, Loric intends to update its operation contract 
system with the ministry to expand production. Later it will be 
authorized to become a share holding company and manage State 
property. 
  This in effect will make the 35 manufacturing and repair 
plants independent and responsible for State assets. 
  Simultaneously, profound reforms will take place in the 
railway planning, pricing, investment, financing and wage 
systems. 
  The ministry will continue cutting production quotas for 
vehicles so that in the near future all manufacturing orders 
will be through contracts. 
  The industry now is far from being independent. Indeed, 
mandatory orders still account for 85 percent of its production 
value. 
  The State will also relax its tight hold over prices of 
rolling stock so that in three to four years market forces will 
be the primary determinants of pricing. Prices for vehicle 
parts are expected to be freed this year, for passenger and 
freight cars, in 1995; and, for locomotives, 1997. 
  There remains a big gap between prices paid by the State and 
prices set by the market. For example, the market price for a 
Dongfeng-4 diesel locomotive is 4.8 million yuan ($552.000) but 
the ministry will pay only 3.1 million yuan ($356,000). 
  The system for deciding investments will also depart from 
arbitrary allocation by the State and rely more on market 
financing and self financing by enterprises. 
  Fu cautioned that the industry must prepare for domestic and 
foreign challenges as it advances into the highly-competitive 
market place. 
  Loric's decades-old monopoly over freight car production has 
become feeble, allowing a legion of competitors to squeeze into 
the manufacturing and repair businesses. 
  The ministry plans to spend $10 billion yuan ($1.15 billion) 
this year for new rail vehicles. 
  In 1994 Loric will arrange the production of about 800 
locomotives, 2,000 passenger cars and 32,500 freight cars. 
  About 80 per cent of the new locomotives will be for 
large-haul service on trunk lines, primarily the Dongfeng-4 
diesel and Shaoshan-4 electric models. 
  For passenger cars the focus will be on the Model 25, which 
accommodates more travellers at higher speed and with more 
comfort than the obsolete Model 22, still the backbone of 
passenger service. Production of the Model 22 will be phased out 
by next year. 
  Despite the shortage of capital and raw material, Loric last 
year built 670 diesel locomotives, 19 per cent more than in 
1992; 220 electric locomotives, 10 per cent more; 1,850 
passenger cars, 12 per cent more; and 29,000 freight cars, 34 
per cent more.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 16 (XINHUA) -- China will take 
measures to improve the management of the container industry. 
  According to a ceremony for the establishment of the China 
Container Industry Association held here Thursday [14 April], 
China can now turn out 250,000 standard containers a year, 
making it the biggest producer in this field. 
  But, sources said, sales of containers and technology for 
making the containers has fallen behind production, and the 
management of the container industry is inefficient. 
  The newly-established association aims to improve the 
management in the industry. 
  It will collect and transmit information about container 
production and sales, and new technology so as to promote fair 
competition, improve quality, and enhance cooperation in design, 
manufacture and quality control.

  [Text] Beijing, April 16 (XINHUA) -- China's home-made Y-7 
aircraft has captured nearly a quarter of its domestic air 
routes, according to figures released recently. 
  A survey conducted by an authorized aviation journal showed 
that China has now 1,161 domestic air routes, 278 of which use 
Y-7 planes. 
  Produced by the China Xian Aviation Industry Corporation, 
the 
Y-7 aircraft can load with more than 50 passengers or 5,000 kg 
cargo, with a maximum voyage of 1,200 km. 
  Figures also show that over 90 Y-7 aircrafts have been put 
into operation, accounting for 24 percent of the air fleet of 
China's domestic airlines. And 13 out of 21 domestic airlines 
have started using Y-7, accounting for 61.9 percent of their 
aircrafts. 
  The North China Airlines now uses Y-7 planes on 376 
scheduled 
flights every week along its 95 air routes. And the South China 
Airlines, the smallest user of Y-7, makes at least eight flights 
each week with the home-made aircraft. 
  According to the survey, the number of Y-7 flights each week 
has reached 870, transporting a total of about 35,000 passengers.

  [Text] Beijing, April 16 (XINHUA) -- China reported a 7.66 
percent rise in steel output in the first quarter of this year 
over the same period of 1993, reaching 22.95 million tons from 
January to March, according to the Ministry of Metallurgical 
Industry. 
  Figures disclosed by the ministry show that China produced 
20.29 million tons of rolled steel and 22.14 million tons of 
iron in the first three months of this year, an increase of 9.47 
percent and 11.3 percent, respectively. 
  Officials said that output increase was also accompanied by 
a 
rise in product quality. But the iron ore output, reported at 
48.7 million tons, fell below the ministry's production target, 
they said. 
  China produced 88.3 million tons of steel last year, making 
it the world's second biggest producer, behind Japan. The 
target of this year is 93 million tons. 
  It imported 2.3 million tons of rolled steel in the first 
two 
months of the year while the export reached 150,000 tons, a rise 
of 57 percent.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Pei Jianeng: "Output of Steel Rises by </F>
7.6 Percent in 1st Quarter"] 
  [Text] Steel output reached 22.95 million tons in the 
first quarter of this year, 7.66 percent more than the same 
period last year, it was revealed yesterday. 
  China produced 20.29 million tons of rolled steel and 22.14 
million tons of iron from January to March, increases of 9.47 
percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, according to figures 
from the Metallurgical Industry Ministry. 
  However, the output of iron ore, reported at 48.7 million 
tons, fell below the ministry's production target, officials 
said. 
  But the general increase in output was accompanied by a rise 
in product quality, the officials added. 
  The ratio of advanced continuous casting--a symbol of 
technical capacity in steel making--also rose, from last year's 
32.82 percent of steel output to 38.62 percent, in the first 
quarter of this year. 
  Manufacturers' profits and taxes also increased markedly 
during the first quarter, going up 16.7 percent over last year. 
  China produced 88.3 million tons of steel last year making 
it 
the world's second biggest producer, behind only Japan. 
  This year the target is 93 million tons and officials are 
optimistic about the chances of hitting the target. 
  In the first two months of the year, China imported 2.3 
million tons of rolled steel, 8.1 percent more than the same 
period last year. 
  Meanwhile, it exported 150,000 tons of rolled steel, an 
increase of 57 percent. 
  Although the government lifted the price ceilings of steel 
products at the beginning of this year, market prices have 
remained stable as supply and demand are roughly balanced, 
officials said. 
  It is expected that China's total demand for rolled steel 
will hit 100 million tons this year. 
  About 90 million tons will be supplied by domestic 
production 
and stockpiles. 
  Officials said China still needs to import about 1O million 
tons of rolled steel this year. 
  Last year it imported a record 30.26 million tons of rolled 
steel because of overheated investment in fixed assets. 
  Officials said a shortage of capital is still the biggest 
headache for domestic steel makers. 
  And the new tax burdens imposed on iron mines may cause most 
of them to lose money this year, officials said, adding that the 
transport bottleneck will also affect steel production, 
  One of China's major steel makers, the Beijing-based 
Shougang 
Group, produced 1.85 million tons of steel and 1.47 million tons 
of iron in the first quarter, respective increases of 29 and 
33.78 percent.

  [Text] Beijing, April 17 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Ministry 
of Posts and Telecommunications is to issue, on April 21, a set 
of four stamps featuring desert afforestation. 
  Designs and denomination of these stamps are: "the vast 
expanse of desert", 15 fen; "flowers in the desert", 20 fen; 
"forest of diversiform-leaved poplar", 40 fen; and "oasis in the 
desert", 50 fen. 
  Desertification is a serious environmental problem 
challenging the whole globe. China has vast areas of desert and 
is seriously affected by desertification. At present deserts 
constitute 15.9 percent of China's land area. 
  In recent years China has achieved notable results in 
harnessing desertification, with drought-enduring shrubs and 
trees, such as the diversiform-leaved poplar, planted to shelter 
farmland and stop moving dunes. 
  So far, some 6.7 million hectares of the country's deserts 
have been afforested, and 10 percent of the desertified land has 
been effectively harnessed. 
  The designer of the stamps is Meng Sihui from the Palace 
Museum.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Give away more 
market share, stock ownership and short-term profits in return 
for more technology, funds and efficiency -- these are the new 
measures taken by the local Guangzhou Government to promote 
foreign trade and utilization of overseas investment. 
  The measures have brought initial success. 
  Economic development in Guangzhou, capital of South China's 
Guangdong Province, has enjoyed a good start this year, as 
reflected by the economic figures of the first quarter. 
  This information was released today by the foreign trade and 
economic cooperation committee of Guangzhou city. 
  The new series of reforms in the tax system, foreign 
currency, banking and foreign trade introduced nationwide this 
year by the Chinese Government has allowed more margin for the 
development of Guangzhou, a city already boasting the most brisk 
and prosperous economic activities of the country. 
  During the first quarter this year, 699 contracts for 
foreign 
investment were signed and actually-utilized overseas capital 
totalled 489 million U.S. dollars, with a growth of 80.8 percent 
over the same period last year. 
  The city has earned 820 million U.S. dollars in exports 
during the first three months, up 23 percent over the same 
period in 1993. 
  This has been stimulated by the abolition of the dual 
exchange rates and the previous rules that foreign currency 
earned had to be turned over to the government. 
  To further expand exports, Guangzhou has set up three 
overseas enterprises and will establish commercial centers soon 
in New York, Sydney and Moscow. 
  According to Wang Deye, director of the Foreign Trade and 
Economic Cooperation Committee, Guangzhou has further relaxed 
limits on some high-tech enterprises and old enterprises in 
urgent need of technological renovation in absorbing foreign 
funds. 
  By the end of last month, projects involving overseas 
capital 
higher than five million U.S. dollars each had totalled 134, 
covering fields like industrial processing, transport, real 
estate, tourism and service industry. 
  The number of countries and regions that have directly 
opened 
enterprises in Guangzhou increased from 12 to 19 in the first 
quarter as against the same period of last year. 
  Investments in the city totalling more than 20 million U.S. 
dollars have come from each of the following: Hong Kong, 
Taiwan, Macao, Japan, Singapore, Britain and the United States. 
  Israel, Germany and Finland have also expressed intentions 
to 
invest or expand cooperation.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 17 (XINHUA) -- South China's 
Guangdong Province is now carrying out a publicity campaign for 
the "teachers' law". 
  The campaign, which aims at studying the law and promoting 
its implementation, started on April 15 and will last for a 
month. 
  China's teachers' law came into force on January 1 this 
year. 
  In recent years, Guangdong has adopted measures to 
consolidate its contingent of teachers and to raise their status 
and treatment. 
  The province has given 405 teachers the title of teachers 
with special classification, and since 1991 has awarded 14 
teachers the "outstanding teacher prize". 
  In the past eight years, Guangdong Province constructed 10 
million square meters of residential accommodation, for 110,000 
teachers' households. 
  It also allocated 30 million yuan as allowances to teachers 
at universities and colleges. 
  Since 1993, the provincial government allocated more than 50 
million yuan as subsidy for teachers working in 30 counties in 
mountain areas. 
  A government official said that 9.46 billion yuan was spent 
on education last year, 61.8 percent more than the previous year. 
  Dongguan city last year recruited more than 1,000 teachers 
from other places, and Foshan city invested more than 13 million 
yuan in a teacher-training program.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 18 (XINHUA) -- The city government 
of Guangzhou, capital of economically booming Guangdong 
Province, is calling on its citizens to show more concern for 
handicapped orphans, to observe 1994 as the International Year 
of the Family. 
  In the city's orphanages are living some 350 disabled 
children who were abandoned by their parents because they 
suffered from congenital or post-natal diseases, such as heart 
disease or mental or physical handicaps. 
  Aiming to give these children the chance to enjoy family 
happiness, various city government departments, including civil 
affairs administration, women's federation and children's 
welfare society, are working together for residents to adopt or 
give financial aid to these unfortunate kids. 
  The children can be expected to grow more healthily if they 
receive better family warmth, care, entertainment, medical care 
and education. 
  So far, more than 40 orphans have been adopted or are 
receiving help.

  [Text] Shenzhen cadres could lose their jobs if they fail 
to overcome bureaucratic delays which are hampering 
entrepreneurs. Mayor Li Youwei has warned cadres their jobs 
could be in jeopardy unless they transform their thought and 
eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy. His comments came after 
scathing criticism of the authorities by entrepreneurs. Mr Li 
also urged enterprises to exercise self-discipline and not to 
"take improper means" to get things done, apparently referring 
to giving bribes to officials. Mr Li was speaking at a 
symposium attended by heads of major enterprises and government 
officials in Shenzhen last week. 
  General Manager of the Shenzhen Nanhai Company Liao Hanbiao 
criticised the failure of the municipal Government to make good 
its promise to grant autonomous powers to enterprises. "Those 
powers which have been delegated or should be delegated to 
enterprises have been taken back," he said in a Shenzhen Special 
Zone Daily report. The newspaper quoted Mr Li as saying that 
government organs should listen to the aspirations of 
enterprises and help solve their problems. "Without 
enterprises, the existence of many government departments 
becomes unnecessary," he said. 
  Powers to have been delegated include the recruitment of 
cadres and workers, and approval of projects. "Some 
administrative departments have grasped the powers firmly in 
their hands and often interfere with the normal activities of 
enterprises," Mr Li said. 
  A spokesman for Dongbu Group pointed to the work-style of 
some officials, charging them with low efficiency and excessive 
control and interference. "(They) are creating problems for 
enterprises," the spokesman said. 
  Mr Li accused some departments of putting personal 
connections and emotions in doing business above rules and laws. 
He called on colleagues to report any malpractices or abuse of 
power. Any cadres who traded power for money should be 
criticised and re-educated, Mr Li said. "(Those who) failed to 
correct their thoughts and work- style should be removed from 
their posts." 
  Mr Li said the municipal Government would take effective 
measures to enliven the property and stock market, which has 
become sluggish in recent months. He said the Government would 
increase the number of flats for sale to people outside China, 
and reduce the cost of land and mortgages. 
  Mr Li said the local Government had told the central 
Government of its concern at the sluggish stock market and asked 
for more flexibility in dealing with problems. But he stressed 
that enterprises should "correct their thoughts" and should not 
merely count on the pooling of funds from the public. "They 
(enterprises) should make more efforts to enhance the efficiency 
of enterprises and be accountable to share-holders and 
investors," he said.

  [Text] It was learned from the provincial meeting of tax 
bureau directors, which was held a few day ago, that the new 
taxation system was operating well in Hainan and had smoothly 
converged with the province's preferential policy. In the 
course of implementing the new taxation system, the Hainan 
special zone's taxation policy remained unchanged. 
  After the convergence of the new taxation system and 
preferential policy in income tax, the province has continued to 
implement the enterprise income tax rate of 15 percent and the 
policy of giving enterprises various tax exemptions and 
reductions in time-limit terms. The specific contents are as 
follows: 1) Fifteen percent income tax will be collected from 
foreign-invested and domestically invested enterprises in Hainan 
(with the exception of state banks and insurance companies) on 
income from their operations and other sources, and they will 
exempted from local taxes. 2) Preferential considerations will 
be given to the income tax enterprises should pay in accordance 
with the professions they are in, the time limit of their 
operations, and the size of their investment. 3) Forty percent 
of the income tax which investors from outside the borders have 
paid for profits made in the province will be returned to them 
if they reinvest this portion to set up new enterprises or 
expand production in China and their operation last no less than 
five years. All such income tax will be returned to enterprises 
which reinvest the portion of profits in the province's 
infrastructure, agricultural development, export of products, 
and enterprises which are verified by the provincial government 
as advanced technology enterprises. Those which have operated 
less than five year and quit the province should give back the 
returned income tax mentioned above. 4) Foreign investors who 
do not set up any institutions in China will be exempted from 
advance income tax when it comes to their dividends, interest, 
rents, fees for use of franchises, and income from other 
resources they get from Hainan. 
  With regard to the turnover tax: 1) With the exception of 
tobacco, wine, sugar, and mineral oils on which the collection 
of value-added and consumer taxes in the production process is 
halved, no value-added and consumption taxes will be levied on 
goods produced and sold by enterprises on the island. 2) No 
consumption tax will be levied on taxable consumer goods which 
are directly exported by producing enterprises of the Hainan 
special zone or exported through foreign trade enterprises; a 
zero tax rate will be pursued in the direct export of the 
products on which value-added tax should be levied, and, as for 
the tax volume of imported goods, enterprises are entitled to 
apply with tax institutions for tax reimbursements according to 
state stipulations. As far as products which are free from 
value-added and consumption taxes in the production process and 
sold to foreign trade are concerned, after they are exported, 
the foreign trade enterprises should apply with tax institutions 
for tax reimbursements according to state stipulations. 3) No 
business tax will be collected from the business revenues of 
foreign banks and Sino-foreign joint-venture banks (insurance 
companies) set up in the Hainan Special Economic Zone within 
five years from the beginning of the operations. After their 
tax-exemption period expires, business taxes will be levied on 
them at a rate of 3 percent.

  [Text] The contract for sale of the Changsha City party 
committee office complex to the Changsha city branch of the Bank 
of Industry and Commerce of China was signed yesterday afternoon. 
  The Changsha City party committee office complex is situated 
in one of the busiest sections of May 1 Road, with superior 
geographical position and convenient transport facilities. The 
complex was built in the early 1960's, accommodating all the 
more than 10 departments of the Changsha city party committee. 
In view of the fact that the city party committee office 
complex had limited floor space and deficient facilities, the 
Changsha city authorities, based on a thorough feasibility 
study, decided to sell the property to the Changsha city branch 
of the Bank of Industry and Commerce of China, at the price of 
100 million yuan. In this connection, a new site will be sought 
to relocate city party committee offices. It is believed that 
this transaction will help promote the reform and opening up 
process and economic development of the city.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Korean Nuclear Issue Dominates Moscow-Seoul </F>
Talks"] 
  [Text] Moscow, April 16 (XINHUA) -- The nuclear issue on 
the Korean peninsula have dominated the Moscow-Seoul talks in 
the past three days here, diplomats said when analyzing the 
outcome of the visit by South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu. 
  Han, who arrived here on Wednesday, held talks with his 
Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the 
lower house of parliament, and Vladimir Shumeyko, head of the 
upper house. 
  According to the ITAR-TASS news agency, the two sides "have 
similar views on international issues and are ready to expand 
bilateral cooperation and interaction on the international 
scene, primarily in northeastern Asia." 
  It said Moscow and Seoul are "rather close" in their stands 
on nuclear non-proliferation on the Korean peninsula. 
  After his talks with han on Thursday, Kozyrev told reporters 
that Russia "cannot allow violation of the nuclear 
non-proliferation regime in any area and by any state." 
  Kozyrev also stressed that Russia is opposed to pressuring 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) by force on the 
nuclear issue. 
  South Korea supports Russia's proposal to convene an 
international conference on the security and non-nuclear status 
of the Korean peninsula. But Seoul emphasized that preferably 
the Korean nuclear issue should be resolved at the UN Security 
Council. 
  Russia said the proposed international conference should be 
held on a six-plus-two formula with participation of Russia, the 
United States, China, Japan, the DPRK, South Korea, the United 
Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Another topic in Han Sung-chu's Moscow talks was 
preparations 
for the forthcoming visit of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam 
to Russia in June. 
  At the Russian-South Korean summit meeting, the two sides 
are 
expected to sign a package of documents on cooperation in the 
economic and political spheres. 
  It will be Kim Yong-sam's first visit to Moscow. Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin visited Seoul in November 1992. 
  Leaving Moscow for home on Friday, Han expressed 
satisfaction 
with his three-day Moscow trip. For its part, the Russian side 
described his visit as successful, noting that relations between 
Moscow and Seoul are "on the rise."

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Vice-President Rong 
Yiren discussed the philosophy of commercial activities with a 
delegation of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry led by 
its vice- chairman Yasuhiko Ueyama here today. 
  Rong told the visitors that the guiding principle for 
Chinese 
enterprises stresses both enterprise benefits and social 
benefits. 
  Noting that China is in the process of building a socialist 
market economy, Rong said an important aspect of socialism is to 
constantly raise the people's living standards. 
  This calls on all the enterprises to consider not only their 
own interests but also social benefits and their commercial 
activities must be in accord with the interests of the state and 
the people, Rong said. 
  He also expressed the hope that Chinese and Japanese 
industrialists and businessmen will have more exchanges in 
enterprise culture. 
  Present at the meeting was Jing Shuping, president of the 
All- China Federation of Industry and Commerce. 
  The visitors, who arrived here yesterday, are on a five-day 
visit with the purpose of knowing about China's enterprise 
culture.

Yong-sam said here today: "During my recent visit to China, I 
held talks with President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng; we 
frankly and sincerely exchanged views on further developing 
bilateral relations and on issues of common concern. The talks 
were very beneficial." 
  Kim Yong-sam made these remarks while meeting at the

tremendous achievements. I believe China will score even 
greater achievements in its economic construction." 
  Wu Xueqian said: The establishment of diplomatic relations 
between China and Korea in August 1992 restored the long 
historical relationship between the two countries. President

  [Text] Tokyo, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition 
is back in action after a week of political turmoil sparked by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden decision to resign on 
April 8. 
  Although divided into two rival camps, the coalition 
parties, 
except for the new Sakigake Party [Harbinger], have finally 
buried the hatchet and agreed to work for the selection of a new 
prime minister and the formation of a new government. 
  If an accord can be reached within the alliance on major 
issues such as taxes, foreign policy and administration reform, 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), will become its single candidate for the premiership, 
political sources say. 
  But the possibility that former Deputy Prime Minister Michio 
Watanabe will become a dark horse and win the upcoming 
parliamentary election for premier cannot be ruled out. 
  Yesterday, Watanabe held a last-minute meeting with Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono, who has also 
announced his intention to run for premier. The two failed to 
reach an agreement on who the party's candidate should be, but 
agreed to meet again on Monday [18 April]. 
  Kono had asked Watanabe to give up his candidacy to avoid a 
major breakup of the main opposition party, but Watanabe 
rejected Kono's request. Their showdown may accelerate the 
disintegrating process within the LDP, which had dominated 
Japan's scandal-ridden politics for 38 years, until last August. 
  A new political map is also being drawn for the coalition. 
  Sakigake, a 15-member partner in the alliance that has been 
frustrated because Shinseito has led the bloc's decision-making, 
distanced itself from the others by declaring that it would not 
provide members in the next cabinet. 
  Sakigake leader Masayoshi Takemura is currently chief 
cabinet 
secretary, the top government spokesman. 
  Sakigake said, however, it will vote for the coalition's 
joint candidate for prime minister and support the government's 
position on pending issues such as the overdue 1994 state budget. 
  The Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist 
Party, both of which sided with Sakigake in opposing the 
Shinseito-led management, agreed to go ahead with selecting a 
candidate without sakigake. 
  Meanwhile, Shinseito, the coalition's core component, still 
considers Watanabe a possible partner. Watanabe's stand on key 
issues is close to that of Shinseito Secretary General Lehiro 
Ozawa. 
  The political vacuum has been keenly felt on the diplomatic 
front, with official visits by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak 
and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai postponed at their 
request. Hosokawa had planned a tour of Europe this month, but 
now will not go. 
  U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry also postponed a visit 
to Japan scheduled for April 19 to 21 following the accidental 
downing of two U.S. helicopters by American jets over northern 
Iraq.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe decided today to bolt the main opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and create a new one, a step that 
will probably spark another major split in the LDP. 
  Watanabe, a faction leader within the fractious LDP, told 
reporters, "I will give up my party membership as a matter of 
course." 
  Watanabe, also a former deputy prime minister, has vowed to 
run in the Diet (Parliament) premiership election which will 
select the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa, who 
abruptly announced his resignation on April 8. 
  On Friday, LDP President Yohei Kono met Watanabe and asked 
him not to leave the LDP, the largest single party in the Diet. 
  The LDP lost its parliamentary majority after 38 years of 
rule last summer in the wake of major defections led by Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata. Hata and former LDP Secretary General 
Ichiro Ozawa later formed Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), now 
one of the key components in the seven-party ruling coalition.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The main headaches for 
Beijingers these days are how to rein-in the influx of 
outsiders, and control dogs and the rising prices. 
  At a recent meeting of the municipal people's congress, 
participants raised some 300 queries, mostly on these three "hot 
issues". 
  Sources here said that the prices of daily necessities have 
recently risen at an unexpected rate in the capital. 
  Talking about prices, Mayor Li Qiyan said that freeing 
prices 
by no means implies giving up control. On the contrary, active 
and forceful steps must be taken to keep prices down, including 
economic, legal and necessary administrative measures. 
  He said that while efforts should be made to ensure the 
supply of farm and sideline products, such as grain, vegetables, 
meat, eggs and milk, emphasis has to be placed on distribution 
and circulation to ensure market supplies. 
  A reserve system for major sideline products and a market 
risk fund must be set up in order to steady the price of daily 
necessities whenever they go too high, he added. 
  Any change in the market price should be closely monitored 
by 
using a price analysis system, the mayor said, adding that 
regulations concerning profiteering must be established. 
  Meanwhile, with the deepening of the country's reform and 
opening to the outside world, more and more job hunters and 
business people from every part of the country, especially from 
the vast rural areas, are pouring in the capital city hoping to 
make their fortunes. 
  This causes a lot of problems in the aspects of public 
security, birth control and traffic that upset the local 
residents, who used to enjoy a peaceful life. 
  According to a senior justice official, there are nearly two 
million outsiders in Beijing now, forming some non-Beijinger 
ghettos in the districts, such as "Zhejiang village" and "Henan 
village". 
  The official said that a handful of these outsiders have 
turned to crime. 
  A survey conducted in 1993 shows that outsiders accounted 
for 
as high as 80 percent of the total criminal offenders in the 
city. 
  But, the official said, the outsiders on the whole play an 
important role in the capital's construction. 
  They are mainly engaged in the catering trade, repairs, 
garment making, baby-sitting and nursing, and cleaning, he said, 
adding that they have made great contributions to enlivening the 
capital's markets and making life more comfortable for the city 
dwellers. 
  Speaking of the control and management of outsiders, Deputy 
Mayor Meng Xuenong said that there is an urgent need to 
establish an effective registration system for outsiders. 
  The number must be put under strict control in terms of the 
city's capacity of administration and the demand of the labor 
market, he said. 
  A more unusual problem for residents of the capital is dogs. 
  Nowadays, more and more families tend to keep pets, dogs in 
particular. 
  However, the dogs also disturb the normal life of 
Beijingers, 
a local resident said, biting people and causing disputes. 
  Statistics show that dogs injured more than 30,000 people in 
the city last year. 
  A suggestion for solving this problem put forward by the 
deputies to the municipal peoples' congress is to register and 
immunize pet dogs. Fierce dogs should be banned completely, 
they said. 
  To ensure that Beijingers live and work better in a better 
environment, Deputy Mayor Zhang Baifa said the municipal 
government will put these problems on its agenda for this year's 
comprehensive urban management.

  [Excerpt] When visiting Daxing County to learn about the 
its work, Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party 
committee, pointed out that townships and villages where 
conditions permit in developed plain areas may operate grain 
fields on as large a scale as possible in order to raise labor 
productivity, improve the comparable efficiency of grain 
production, and further stimulate peasants' enthusiasm for 
growing grain. 
  Chen Xitong recently went to Daxing County to visit the 
Huangcun satellite city, Liuminying Village of Changziying 
Township, and Dongdian Village of Qingyundian Town. He asked in 
detail about their agricultural production, small industrial 
zones, township enterprises, village and town construction, 
greening of plain areas, and life of villagers. He also visited 
enterprises and villagers' homes to talk with cadres and the 
villagers. 
  Located in plain area, Daxing County has fairly developed 
township enterprises and better conditions for grain production. 
When the party branch secretaries of Liuminying and Dongdian 
Villages reported that they had achieved better economic 
efficiency with less labor input thanks to operation on as large 
a scale as possible, Chen Xitong said: In order not to dampen 
peasants' enthusiasm for grain production, the state should 
provide support from various fields, and the municipality as 
well as counties and townships should continue their great 
support. In addition to this, developed plain areas may operate 
grain fields on as large a scale as possible in a selective and 
orderly manner when conditions permit in order to achieve high 
output, high quality, and high efficiency through expanding the 
scale and then raise labor productivity, increase income, and 
stimulate peasants' enthusiasm for grain production. Meanwhile, 
the large number of laborers laid off may be transferred to the 
secondary and tertiary industries. He pointed out: In 
developing agriculture, we should also emphasize accounting and 
improvement of labor productivity like enterprises do to make 
sure that growing grain can also make money. On the premise 
that the collective economy is consolidated and developed, the 
methods can be diversified. The method of operation on as large 
a scale as possible may be developed in the form of collective 
farms. It may also be developed in such a way that grain field 
management is contracted out to grain growing experts or large 
grain growing households and regular workers are reduced to the 
minimum. During busy seasons, temporary workers may be used, 
who will leave after work is finished. The fewer workers we 
hire, the better the productivity and comparable efficiency of 
grain production will be. 
  At a joint venture in Liuminying Village, a metal structure 
plant, Chen Xitong asked about its production and talked 
cordially with workers. He said to Wang Yaoping, the county 
party secretary, and other comrades: Township enterprises 
should be greatly developed because they represent an extremely 
important way for rural areas to achieve prosperity. In rural 
areas, the number of people engaged in grain production should 
be small so that large numbers of peasants can be diverted from 
farmland to the secondary and tertiary industries. This is the 
way to make peasants affluent and lead a fairly comfortable 
life. As has been proven in practice, the better the township 
enterprises are developed in townships and villages, the faster 
their peasants will become affluent. In addition, the position 
of agriculture as the foundation will be safeguarded, and grain 
output increased. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Recently, Beijing Municipality sponsored a joint 
work conference on investigation and study. During the 
conference, the opinions adopted by the municipal party standing 
committee were relayed and the arrangements for the 
investigation and study work this year were adopted. Attending 
the joint conference were leading comrades from the municipal 
party committee, the municipal people's congress standing 
committee, the municipal people's government, and the municipal 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference committee; 
directors of the research offices of various districts and 
counties; and some specialists and scholars. Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the municipal party committee, was also on hand and 
spoke. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech Chen Xitong cited the issue of how to further 
enhance the investigation and study work. He said: According 
to the spirit of directives issued by the central authorities 
and Comrade Jiang Zemin, we extensively and deeply carried out 
investigation and study throughout the municipality last year, 
which strengthened the scientific nature of policy decisions 
made by the leadership at all levels and promoted the 
realization of surpassing the 1992 work in an overall way. 
Thus, the municipality as a whole made a good and initial start 
in energetically encouraging the practice of investigation and 
study. He extended cordial regard on behalf of the municipal 
people's government to all personnel who had industriously 
worked in this regard. 
  In his speech Chen Xitong put forward the following four 
opinions on the issue of how to further and successfully conduct 
the investigation and study work this year: 
  1. Efforts should be made to surpass the work done in 1993. 
Although we scored results in the work last year, we should not 
relax our efforts and slow down the work this year. By no means 
should we "chop and change" in the work. We should strive to 
surpass the work done in 1993 in the fields of scoring 
achievements in the investigation and study work, making the 
usage of investigation and study results, building investigation 
and study network, and training cadres through investigation and 
study. 
  2. Efforts should be made to uphold the principle of having 
leading cadres take the lead in the work. The key to making 
success in investigation and study lies on leading cadres and 
particularly on the first leading cadres of party and government 
organs. We must have leading cadres take the lead in the work, 
turn the practice in this regard into a routine, and uphold the 
practice by carrying forward it forever. He pointed out: 
Leading cadres should have the following two basic skills: 
First, they should be able to carry out investigation and 
study. Without investigation and study, these leading cadres 
will have no right to voice their opinions and to join in the 
making of policy decisions and will be unable to truly possess 
the power of leadership. Second, they should be good at doing 
the work related to the masses. Without doing the work related 
to the masses, it is impossible for them to unify the masses' 
understanding with the party's line, principles, and policies; 
to bring the masses' enthusiasm into play; and to unite as one 
in striving to realize the fixed targets. Without the two 
skills, it is difficult for them to be a competent leader. In 
training and appraising cadres, attention should be paid to the 
two skills. In view of many new and young comrades who have 
been promoted into leading posts and bodies during the 
term-shift election at the county level, they should even make 
efforts to master or study well the work of investigation and 
study and to know well the skills as soon as possible. 
  3. Efforts should be made to vigorously revise or formulate 
and implement investigation and study plans. Units concerned 
have initially put forward their plan in this regard and should 
implement their plan vigorously. They should first select 
correct subjects for their investigation and study because an 
incorrect subject will directly and adversely affect results in 
this regard. One of the major reasons for the poor results 
scored by some units in their investigation and study work last 
year was their incorrect subject. It is necessary to select the 
subject closely according to the implementation of the spirit of 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to 
the work guideline of the central authorities; to the municipal 
plan for becoming better-off; and to the adequate handling of 
relationship among reform, development, and stability. By 
firmly bearing the reality in their minds, units should select 
the subjects aiming at dealing with the problems in some fields 
and bringing along the work in some fields. Special attention 
should be paid to selecting the subjects aiming at resolving 
difficult, hot, and "knotty" problems. Various fronts, 
districts, and counties have reported their investigation and 
study subjects to the municipal authorities as of present. 
Therefore, all incorrect subjects may be readjusted. He 
stressed: After defining their subjects various departments, 
commissions, offices, and district-county party committees 
should hold earnest discussion; set up work division among 
leading personnel; assign tasks to personnel; and organize or 
carry out investigation and study rapidly. The municipal party 
committee grasped the investigation and study on four occasion 
last year and will persistently do the same this year. The 
conference represents the first drive in this regard of the 
year. Through several-year or many-year efforts, we should 
gradually turn investigation and study into a routine and a 
necessary procedure for leadership to make policy decisions. In 
doing the work, by no means should we rely on inspiration, petty 
trick, and empiricism. Policy decisions made by relying on such 
things are dangerous. 
  4. Efforts should be made to continuously create favorable 
environment and work conditions for investigation and study and 
attention should be paid to dealing with the practical problems 
encountered by the investigation and study organs at all levels. 
  Chen Xitong said: Investigation and study represent a 
complicated and arduous work. Comrades engaging in this work 
are very laborious. Leadership at all levels should show 
concern for their work and life. Based on the work done in 1993 
they should help the investigation and study organs deal with 
their practical problems cropping up in the fields of funds, 
post titles, duties, and investigation and study tours as well 
as better bring into play the enthusiasm of the personnel 
contingent. 
  Duan Bingren, member of the municipal party standing 
committee and secretary general of the municipal party 
committee, also attended and addressed the conference.

  [Text] Beijing April 17 (XINHUA) -- A series of campus-run 
hi- tech enterprises have sprung up in Beijing recently. 
  Statistics show that in 1993 the output value of the 
campus-run enterprises in Beijing hit 2.6 billion yuan (about 
330 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 2.3 times over 1992, 
with total profits of 400 million yuan, doubling 1992's figure. 
  In the 67 colleges and universities in Beijing, Beijing 
University, Qinghua University, the Beijing Polytechnical 
University and the Beijing University of Science and Engineering 
each report an annual output value exceeding 100 million yuan 
from their campus-run hi-tech enterprises. 
  The Beijing University Founder Group Corporation is in the 
lead, with an output value of 900 million yuan last year. 
  The corporation offers a series of new hi-tech electronic 
products to the market, such as the third generation of cordless 
phone and picturephones, according to an official from Beijing 
University. 
  He attributed the success of campus-run enterprises to 
advanced technologies, skilled personnel and some government 
preferential policies. 
  Moreover, a technological foundation is expected to be set 
up 
to help the development of technology on the campuses. 
  Experts said that the emergence of these enterprises can 
help 
accelerate the process of turning technological achievements 
into industries and promote economic development locally, as 
well as support education.

  [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 16 (XINHUA) -- The upgrading 
work of the Beijing-Zhengzhou railway electrification project is 
now in its crucial stage. 
  Most of the earth work of the project has been completed and 
the first electric line has been laid on this section of the 
Beijing- Guangzhou railway. 
  The upgrading project of the electrification section, which 
is about 283 km long, started in March 1993. It is expected to 
open for traffic by the end of 1995. 
  It is one of the ten key projects of China's railway 
construction during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period 
(1991-1995). All the electric wiring and major parts for the 
project were imported and full use is being made of new- and

<F P=106> [By Reporter Mao Jing (3029 0079): "The Aviation Industry </F>
of China and the Beijing Municipal Government Jointly Manage 
Beijing Aeronautical and Astronautical University"] 
  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 1 April at the Great Hall of 
the People, the Aviation Industry of China and the Beijing 
Municipal People's Government held a ceremony to sign the 
agreement on jointly managing Beijing Aeronautical and 
Astronautical University. Zhu Yuli, general manager of the 
aviation industry of China; and Li Qiyan, mayor of the 
municipality, signed the agreement. 
  Beijing Aeronautical and Astronautical University is a 
famous 
university in our country. Over the past 40 years or so since 
its founding, the university has cultivated more than 40,000 
skilled persons for our country's aeronautical and astronautical 
industries and some other economic spheres. This university has 
rich teaching forces, many branches of learning, 36 
undergraduate specialized courses, 60 master courses, 20 
doctorate courses, 3 academicians of Chinese Academy of 
Sciences, 82 teachers for the students engaged in the study of 
doctorate, and nearly 10,000 students. The joint management of 
this university between the Aviation Industry of China and the 
Beijing Municipal government is a result from the mutual 
cooperation to promote educational reform and development and is 
to create conditions for further bringing into play the 
university's advantages and potentials of cultivating 
high-layered and high- quality skilled persons, making 
high-scientific and high- technological research, participating 
in the "211" project, and developing itself into the first-grade 
university. 
  According to the agreement, the university should jointly be 
managed by the both sides. The university will still be 
administratively subordinate to the Aviation Industry of China 
and its investment system and outlay channels will not be 
changed. The university will continue to cultivate skilled 
persons to meet the needs of the aeronautical industry and 
undertake and also fulfill the tasks assigned by the aviation 
industry of China. The Beijing Municipal Government will 
support the university's reform and development, bring the 
university into line with the municipal plan for higher 
educational and scientific and technological development, and 
support the university to conduct educational reform on a trial 
basis. The municipal government will put the university's new 
area project and campus reconstruction project as well as some 
of its key projects, including the projects built with the funds 
invested and donated by foreign firms, including Ruina Group, 
into the list of the municipal key construction projects. The 
aviation industry of China will support the university to 
positively help the university upgrade its teachers' quality and 
cultivate urgently-needed higher- level skilled persons and to 
serve the municipality's scientific and technological progress, 
economic construction, and urban development. Through 
consultation, both sides will cooperatively organize the 
university leading group and jointly study and solve the key 
problems cropping up in the course of joint management. 
  Cheng Xitong extended greetings to the signing of the 
agreement. He said that going into real action is better than 
outlines. I hope that the agreement will not become a mere 
scrap of paper. He urged that we should actually fulfill the 
agreement, do solid work, and realize the agreement. [passage 
omitted] 
  Xie Guang, chairman of the scientific work committee under 
the Ministry of National Defense; and Zhang Xiaowen, vice 
chairman of the state education commission, made speeches at the 
ceremony. They expressed their support to the joint management 
of the university and believed that the university would make 
progress. 
  Present at the signing ceremony were leaders of state 
departments and commissions concerned and Beijing Municipality, 
including Lin Zongtang, Gan Ziyu, Zhu Lilan, Gao Zhenning, Xu 
Boling, Zhang Yanzhong, Li Zhijian, Tao Xiping, Hu Zhaoguang, 
Chen Dabai, and Fan Yuanmo.

  [Text] Hohhot, April 16 (XINHUA) -- The Inner Mongolia 
branch of China International Airlines has grown trees by way of 
aerial seeding on more than 700,000 ha of land in north China 
over the past more than a decade years. 
  North China has vast arid or semi-arid areas, with scarce 
vegetation and serious desertification. Forest cover in north 
China is lower than 10 percent. The development of the local 
economy has thus been seriously hampered. 
  Beginning in the late 1970s, the company was assigned to 
shoulder the task of planting trees in north China through 
aerial seeding. 
  As a result, the ecological environment, and production and 
living conditions of farmers and herdsmen in those areas 
selected for aerial seeding have shown marked improvement thanks 
to painstaking efforts in the past decade, local officials told 
XINHUA.

  [Text] On the afternoon of 4 April, the provincial party 
committee held a provincial meeting on democratic recommendation 
of excellent young cadres. At the meeting, principal leading 
cadres and veteran comrades in all fields of the province were 
urged to extensively recommend suitable persons for reserve 
cadres at the provincial and city (departmental) levels based on 
the demands of the province's economic construction and the 
building of leading bodies. Through democratic recommendation, 
the field of vision and the channels to appreciate the cadres' 
capabilities were expanded and a number of young cadres were 
discovered, thus providing organizational preparations for the 
readjustment of leading bodies at all levels and for the shift 
of terms of the provincial party committee and party committees 
of various cities next year. 
  Attending the meeting were leading comrades of the 
provincial 
party committee and other provincial-level leading bodies; some 
former veteran comrades of the provincial level; principal 
responsible comrades of various departments and commissions 
under the provincial party committee; secretaries of the leading 
party groups and party committees of various provincial-level 
units, the provincial higher people's court, the provincial 
people's procuratorate, various people's groups, and various 
central units stationed in Shenyang; chairmen of various 
democratic parties and industrial and commercial federations; 
secretaries of party committees of various cities; deputy 
secretaries in charge of organizational work and directors of 
organizational departments under various city party committees; 
cadres and personnel section heads of various provincial-level 
units, about 500 persons in total. 
  Wang Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the meeting. He said: This meeting is 
an important one held by the provincial party committee to adopt 
feasible measures to replace old cadres with new ones, to 
further perfect the structure of leading bodies, to make leading 
bodies more vigorous, to strengthen the construction of leading 
bodies, and to ensure and promote the development of economic 
construction and all other undertakings. The current democratic 
recommendation was conducted in the form of being mobilized by 
the provincial party committee in a unified manner, being 
arranged by various localities and departments, respectively, 
being recommended by oneself, and being concentratively 
estimated by the organizational department of the provincial 
party committee. 
  Yu Junbo, standing committee member and director of the 
organizational department of the provincial party committee, 
made specific explanations of the work of how to democratically 
recommend excellent young cadres. 
  Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
delivered an important speech at the meeting. 
  Gu Jinchi said: In the new historical period, we should 
carry out three projects: 1) Winning the hardest battle of again 
pushing the economy on the new stage; 2) establishing the 
socialist market economic structure; and 3) successfully 
building leading bodies at all levels. These three projects are 
closely connected with one another. Of them, the project of 
successfully building leading bodies constitutes an important 
guarantee for accomplishing the first two projects. In building 
leading bodies, an urgent and conspicuous task at the moment is 
to vigorously select and train young cadres. 
  On how to examine and evaluate young cadres, Gu Jinchi said: 
In evaluating young cadres, we should persist in seeing innate 
character, main trend, practical achievements, and development 
potential. In seeing the innate character, we should primarily 
see whether young cadres have a correct outlook on the world and 
on life, are wholeheartedly serving the people, and have a 
strong sense of dedication and responsibility for developing the 
socialist productive forces, for enhancing China's comprehensive 
strength, and for improving the people's living standards. By 
the main trend, we mean making an all-round, objective, and 
dialectical analysis of strong and weak points of young cadres 
and then having a good command of their major factors. By 
practical performances, we mean judging whether young cadres are 
working in a down-to-earth manner and quietly immersing 
themselves in hard work or are merely paying lip service and 
pursuing personal fame and gain, and whether young cadres are 
working hard for the present, giving consideration to the 
long-term interest, and laying solid foundation or are eager for 
quick success and instant benefit. At the moment, in evaluating 
the performances of young cadres, we should pay special 
attention to their style of work and see whether they are 
realistic and practical in work, whether they can find out the 
real situation, tell the truth, strive for practical results, 
and are as good as their words. By development, we mean the 
development potential of young cadres. Generally speaking, young 
cadres lack experience in leadership and are poor at handling 
complicated contradictions, but they have the potential for 
continued development as decided by the foundation of their 
quality. So long as we bravely promote those excellent young 
cadres with great potential to leading posts and let them work 
at their posts, they will be adapt to their work rapidly. 
  Gu Jinchi stressed: In the current democratic 
recommendation, we must emancipate the mind, broaden the field 
of vision, and seek suitable persons from an even wider scope. 
We should emphatically search talents from the first line of 
reform, opening up, and economic construction. We should select 
talents not only among leading organs but also grass-roots 
units, the county (city) and district leading posts in 
particular. We should select talents not only among large and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, institutions of higher 
learning, and scientific research institutes but also among the 
cadres emerging in all sorts of new economic organizations. We 
should select talents not only among our own localities, 
departments, and fronts but also positively recommend excellent 
talents of other localities and units, in particular the talents 
of the localities and units advanced in building two 
civilizations. 
  Gu Jinchi called on party committees at all levels to 
strengthen leadership, pay attention to selecting and training 
young cadres, and actually list this work as an item of their 
daily agenda.

  [Text] Recently, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial 
party committee, has pointed out that the organs directly under 
the provincial authorities should take the lead in valuing and 
supporting the construction of "project hope" and should 
understand and resolve, from the high plane of strategy, the 
problem concerning the schooling of dropouts in poverty-stricken 
areas, by having their eyes on the future and on the improvement 
of the quality of all nationalities. Gu Jinchi also took the 
lead in contributing 300 yuan to the project. 
  Recently, Xu Wencai, secretary general of the provincial 
party committee, called on the general office of the provincial 
party committee to take the lead in contributing money for 
promoting the building of "project hope" among the organs 
directly under the provincial authorities and even all over the 
province. A few days ago, Cui Wenxin, director of the general 
office of the provincial party committee, convened a meeting of 
cadres at or above the section level of the general office to 
conduct mobilization for this work. It was stressed at the 
meeting that the CPC Central Committee and the provincial party 
committee were attaching great importance on the "hope project" 
and on the efforts of resolving the problem concerning the 
schooling of the children who discontinued their studies in 
poverty-stricken areas. The meeting called on the vast numbers 
of party members, cadres, staff, and workers to voluntarily 
contribute money for building the "hope project." Through this 
activity, the spirit of selfless dedication and the spirit of 
happily helping others have been carried forward, the sense of 
being responsible for society has been enhanced among the vast 
numbers of party members, cadres, staff, and workers, and the 
office's building of spiritual civilization has been promoted. 
In as short as 10-odd days, a total of 50,174 yuan has been 
donated by 896 comrades of the general office and by some units. 
  Among the leaders taking the lead in contributing money were 
Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party committee; Wang 
Huaiyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Xu 
Wencai, standing committee member and secretary general of the 
provincial party committee; and Guo Feng, Dai Suli, Li Huang, Hu 
Yimin. Ge Xifan, Chen Yiguang, Liu Yiyun, Zhu Chuan, and Luo 
Dingfeng, veteran comrades of the province. 
  On 29 March, the general office of the provincial party 
committee presented the donated money to the Chaoyang city 
office in charge of project hope. The Chaoyang city party 
committee has decided to build a hope primary school in Shangzhi 
Village in Chaoyang County's Wanglungou Township, the hometown 
of Revolutionary Martyr Zhao Shangzhi.

  [Excerpts] The Second Session of the Eighth Gansu 
Provincial People's Congress was solemnly inaugurated in Lanzhou 
on the morning of 2 April. Presidium executive Chairman Lu 
Kejian declared the second session open at 0900 in the morning. 
  On behalf of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, 
provincial acting Governor Zhang Wule delivered at the congress

  [Text] This year Qinghai Province's distribution of 
treasury bonds has progressed smoothly. So far the province has 
distributed two-year treasury bonds worth 44 million yuan or so, 
completing some 60 percent of the assigned task, and three-year 
treasury bonds worth 61 million yuan or so, fulfilling more than 
one-third of the task. The province was assigned a quota 240 
million yuan worth of treasury bonds this year. 
  To ensure the smooth completion of the task, leaders from 
localities at all levels of the province have attached great 
importance to the task and gone down to various bond 
distributing units one after another to inspect the 
implementation of the various distribution measures taken and 
study and seek solutions to existing problems. While doing 
vigorous publicity work, the financial institutions and treasury 
bond intermediary organs of the financial departments, which 
were assigned the task of distributing bonds this year, have 
paid keen attention to offering better services in various 
aspects of bond distributions. In the course of bond 
distribution, all banks have done their best to set up more 
distributing outlets and appropriately extend their working 
hours. The Bank of China Qinghai Branch, which has well-operated 
grass- roots distributing outlets, and the intermediary organs 
of the financial departments at all levels dispatched personnel 
to go down to grass-roots units to do propaganda and 
mobilization work, organize registration of those who underwrite 
in advance, and carry out the sale of treasury bonds in a 
concentrated way to expand sales. As far as the business of 
exchanging old treasury bonds for new ones, which was introduced 
this year, all underwriting units have also taken various 
measures to simplify the buying and [words indistinct] 
procedures to make things convenient for people to buy the bonds. 
  In light of the recent distribution of treasury bonds in our 
province, a person in charge of a relevant department said: All 
underwriting units should do an active job of propaganda and 
mobilization work and offer better services. The province's 
task of distributing treasury bonds this year is expected to be 
completed at an early date.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by Yang Yuanhua (2799 0337 5478): "What </F>
Are NATO's Intentions in Launching Air Strikes?"] 
  [Text] On 10 and 11 April, two F-16 NATO aircraft twice 
bombed Serbian positions in Gorazde in eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to prevent Serbian armed forces from taking 
Gorazde, a UN-declared protected region, and to protect UN 
peacekeeping forces. This was the first time that NATO had 
bombed ground forces since its establishment 45 years ago and 
the first time NATO attacked one side in the Bosnian conflict. 
They destroyed several tanks in Bosnia- Herzegovina's Serbian 
ground forces and bombarded a command center. 
  NATO's attacks show that it has taken off the mask of 
"neutrality," siding with one side and taking military action 
and armed threats against the other. This has cast a shadow 
over the prospects for a political resolution -- which all sides 
are working for -- has worsened and complicated the Bosnian 
situation, and has drawn the serious concern of the 
international community. 
  Judging from the military viewpoint, the military effect of 
the two air strikes were insignificant, but their political 
impact is huge. The fact that NATO took military action against 
Serbian armed forces for the first time shows that it has in 
reality abandoned the neutral position -- a position which it 
had tried its best to retain in the Bosnian conflict -- and it 
has become more deeply involved in the conflict. NATO has 
attempted to use this to show its strength and force the Serbs 
to submit. U.S. President Clinton said: "We will launch air 
strikes again if we are requested to authorize UN troops to give 
'effective air support' in accordance with UN resolutions." The 
NATO air strikes were launched in the name of the United Nations 
without prior discussion at the Security Council. They were a 
precedent ushered in by NATO to expand its power to launch air 
strikes under the name of the United Nations and will harm the 
prestige of the United Nations. NATO's action reflects the 
United States' changed policy toward Russia and compels Russia 
to choose between NATO and defending its traditional ally. The 
air strikes in fact have encouraged Bosnian Muslims to ask for a 
higher price in the resolution of Bosnian conflict, have aroused 
the Serbs' dissatisfaction and feelings of resistance, and have 
further aggravated the Bosnian situation. Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
Serbian military headquarters published a bulletin saying that 
NATO's air strikes represented "brazen aggression" and that it 
has decided to break off all contacts with the UN peacekeeping 
forces in former Yugoslavia. 
  What the prospects will be in the wake of the air strikes 
are 
a disturbing question of concern to the international community. 
On 11 April, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said that the U.S. 
administration opposes unilateral interference -- sending U.S. 
ground troops -- but does not rule out the possibility of 
launching air strikes. Some people in the West are worried that 
the Serbs will retaliate, rendering all the previous efforts of 
the UN peacekeeping forces futile. NATO officials are generally 
adopting a wait-and-see approach. Russian President Yeltsin 
favors the resolution of all problems in strict accordance with 
UN resolutions. Yeltsin said that, during a telephone 
conversation with Clinton, Clinton could not answer his question 
on whether the UN secretary general had agreed to the air 
strikes. Although the Serbs have not made a clear military 
response to this action, their 10 April bulletin said that they 
would use every means at their disposal to exercise the right of 
self defense. 
  The Bosnian situation has once again entered a delicate, 
complicated, and intensified stage. All sides are adopt an 
attitude of restraint to avoid escalating the war and are 
seeking a political resolution. This is precisely the goal that 
the international community generally is looking forward to.

<F P=106> [Article by Gu Ping (0657 1627): "Air Strikes Are </F>
Detrimental to the Peace Process"] 
  [Text] The situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina has become the 
focus of attention once again. On the evening of 10 April and 
the afternoon of 11 April, as demanded by Yasushi Akashi, UN 
special envoy to former Yugoslavia, U.S. fighter planes carried 
out air strikes against Serbian military positions around 
Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. These were the first NATO air 
strikes against Serbian ground military targets since the 
outbreak of the war in Bosnia- Herzegovina two years ago, and 
they were important NATO military operations. 
  Gorazde was one of the six Muslim "protection zones" 
declared 
by the UN Security Council last year. The UN peace-keeping 
force maintains that it has the right to protect these zones so 
that "they will not come under armed attack by any side." This 
time NATO carried out air strikes against Serbian positions on 
these grounds. 
  After the air strikes, the Bosnian Serbs accused the UN 
peacekeeping force of "opposing the Serbs," announced the 
suspension of all their contacts with the UN peacekeepers, and 
canceled their prescheduled meeting with the U.S. special 
envoys. People fear that this NATO move will affect the UN 
peacekeeping force's neutral position in the Bosnian war and 
produce an unfavorable impact on the UN role in mediating the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. 
  Russian President Yeltsin has criticized the United States, 
saying that it had no right to unilaterally decide on the air 
strikes and that this should have been submitted to the Security 
Council for discussion. U.S. President Clinton has said that 
U.S. planes would carry out air strikes again if necessary. The 
dissensions between the United States and Russia on the Bosnia- 
Herzegovina issue have worsened further. People have noted 
that, over the last two months, due to Russian mediation, NATO 
delayed the plan on bombing Sarajevo, and the Serbs opened the 
Tuzla airport. So Russia's right to speak on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue had grown markedly stronger. 
Evidently, NATO's current air strikes possibly have more 
political than military significance. These air strikes seemed 
to send out a dual signal: One is that "bombardment" will be 
used to bring about talks and force the Serbs to make 
concessions on the territorial issue; the other suggests to 
Russia that the United States and NATO are keeping the 
initiative in the Bosnian situation. 
  After the outbreak of the Sarajevo crisis in February, a new 
trend appeared in the peace talks on the Bosnian issue and some 
hope for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina glimmered in people's 
minds. In this situation, NATO's current "bombardment" is 
unlikely to bring about peace; instead, they will possibly 
affect the peace process. In addition, various foreign powers 
are coming onto the stage from behind the scenes on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. On the one hand, this will help 
encourage the conflicting parties to participate in the peace 
talks; on the other, as their dissensions and contradictions 
become apparent, Bosnia-Herzegovina's peace process may become 
more complicated.

<F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>
  [Text] A government source quoting intelligence report 
said that a group of renegade Mainland Chinese soldiers murdered 
24 Taiwan tourists who died in a mysterious boat fire in 
Mainland China last month. 
  The source told REUTER a number of People's Liberation Army 
soldiers, armed with flame-throwers, robbed and burned to death 
the tourists and eight Mainland Chinese crew of the boat on 
Chientao [Qiandao] Lake in the Province of Chekiang [Zhejiang] 
on 31 March. 
  Mainland Chinese authorities found out about the murders the 
next day but decided to cover them up and ordered the loot to be 
returned because the impact of the incident could be 
far-reaching, the source claimed, quoting intelligence which has 
been described as authoritative. 
  The deaths of the tourists under mysterious circumstances 
have strained uneasy relations between Taiwan and Mainland 
China. Relatives of the victims have accused Mainland China of 
covering up what they alleged to be mass murder. Mainland China 
acknowledged last week that the blaze might have been caused by 
saboteurs. It pledged that the culprits would be severely 
punished.

<F P=106> ["Reshaping Anhui's Image: Anhui Governor Fu Xishou's </F>
interview with XINHUA reporter Ding Jianming" (0002 1017 6900); 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] "Reshaping Anhui's image so as to present its new 
appearance to the world." During an interview with this 
reporter, Fu Xishou, deputy to the Eighth National People's 
Congress and governor of Anhui, frankly said that Anhui is 
determined to realize this goal in the near future. 
  Fu Xishou said: "In the past, we Anhui people were unwilling 
to shake off the label of being poor. The reason behind this is 
that if they remain poor they would get help. In fact, nothing 
was gained by assuming this posture. Moreover, it caused the 
cadres in some areas to fail to concentrate on economic 
development. This posture not only showed that Anhui people 
lacked fighting will but also adversely affected their image. 
To change this image and Anhui's appearance, we must depend on 
ourselves, seize opportunities, and work hard in a down-to-earth 
way." 
  Fu Xishou told the reporter: In the past two years, the 
people of the province have emancipated their minds, changed 
their old concepts, and strove to catch up with other areas. 
The provincial party committee and the provincial government 
promptly put forward the "one line, two points" strategy aimed 
at developing the Wanjiang basin, responding to the call for 
developing Pudong, concentrating on developing the economic belt 
along the Chang Jiang, and accelerating the development of Hefei 
and Huangshan Cities. The implementation of this strategy has 
stimulated economic development throughout the province. Last 
year, Anhui's economic growth rate broke all previous records. 
Its gross domestic product totaled 94 billion yuan, up 22 
percent over 1992; its total industrial output value amounted to 
140 billion yuan, including 10 billion yuan from the output 
value of town and village enterprises. All sectors of the rural 
economy developed, with total agricultural output value 
amounting to 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent, 
ranking fifth in the country in terms of growth. Exports in 
1993 totaled $960 million yuan, up 16 percent. Last year Anhui 
approved 1,040 foreign-funded enterprises, with a contract 
volume exceeding $700 million, which is the sum total of foreign 
investment in the past nine years. Household appliances and 
other processing industries, which used to be Anhui's weak 
points, have gradually become its strong points. 
  The governor, who graduated from Qinghua University in the 
1950's, understood very well how these achievements were made in 
1993: "We cannot say that our current economic strength is very 
great. There is a wide gap if we compare our economy with that 
of other developed provinces. We must not lower our vigilance. 
We must continue to work hard." 
  Fu Xishou said: To enable Anhui's economy to develop in a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy way, it is necessary to carry out 
the following two tasks. First, it is necessary to accelerate 
the construction of basic industries and infrastructural 
facilities, both of which will become Anhui's advantages. 
Second, town and village enterprises and state-owned 
enterprises should do a good job in importing technologies and 
carrying out technical transformation. Infrastructural 
facilities and basic industries are the mainstays supporting 
Anhui's economic development, and importation of technologies 
and technical transformation are like "wings" that can stimulate 
Anhui's economic development. 
  Fu Xishou said: This year is a crucial year in building a 
socialist market economic structure. Anhui must accomplish the 
following tasks: First, accelerating the development of a 
market economy in rural areas and striving to increase farmers' 
income; second, maintaining healthy and rapid industrial growth, 
while focusing on structural readjustment and efficiency; third, 
accelerating changing the operating mechanisms of state-owned 
enterprises and finding an effective way of establishing modern 
enterprises; and fourth, opening up to the outside world in all 
directions and domains and developing an open economy.

<F P=106> [By Philippe Massonnet] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (AFP)--China's economy slowed 
slightly in the first quarter of the year but prices soared, 
making the government's goal of keeping growth and inflation 
below 10 percent this year hard to achieve. 
  Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 12.7 percent in the 
first quarter to 862 billion yuan (99 billion dollars), against 
14.1 percent in the same period last year, and 13.4 percent for 
the whole of 1993, according to the state bureau of statistics. 
  The slowing of the economy is mainly due to weaker 
industrial 
growth and more reasonable levels of fixed capital investment, 
explained bureau spokesman Ye Zhen. 
  Industrial production rose by 16 percent, compared to 25 
percent in the first quarter of 1993, while output in heavy 
industry grew by 15.3 percent and light industry by 16.8 percent. 
  Fixed capital investment -- largely responsible for last 
year's overheating of the economy which was controlled by 
austerity measures -- grew by 36.2 percent, or at half the speed 
of the same period last year. 
  "Generally speaking, there was a drop in the number of local 
projects," said Ye. 
  "Economic growth has indeed slowed slightly, but it is still 
running well above the eight or nine percent planned for this 
year, making the government's task practically impossible," said 
a western diplomat who specialises in economics. That opinion 
is shared by most Chinese experts, who reckon on 12 percent 
growth for the year. 
  "Most worrying is the authorities' inability to control 
inflation, which is continuing to rise," added the diplomat. 
  In other comments, Ye said, "the main problem is the price 
increase," referring to the 20-percent rise in prices across the 
country compared with just eight percent during the 1993 first 
quarter. 
  In the 35 largest cities, inflation measured an average 24.6 
percent, with Haikou in Hainan province in the south of the 
country, posting the worst result of 34.1 percent. Prices in 
Beijing rose by 24.1 percent, while Shanghai, China's most 
populous city, reported inflation of 23.3 percent. 
  Retail sales rose by 25.2 percent, two to three points less 
than in the first quarter of last year. 
  "We can control the price rises if the local governments 
implement the measures of the State Council," said Ye, adding 
that the income of individuals after inflation still rose by 9.3 
percent for city dwellers in the first quarter, and by 13.1 
percent for peasants. 
  The government's other major problem is the unhealthy 
condition of state enterprises, which only increased production 
by 2.2 percent. Of these, 49.6 percent have lost money since 
the beginning of the year, said Ye. Only one third of state 
firms were in the same situation in the same period last year. 
  Some saw production decrease because of bad management, 
while 
others were hit by fiscal reforms which favour enterprises which 
perform well, added the spokesman. 
  But he vowed the government would press on with its 
liberalisation of the economy. "This year will be the year of 
reforms," he said.

"Smooth Progress Made in First 100 Days of the Year of Reform -- 
Interview With Feng Bing, Deputy Secretary-General of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economic System"] 
  [Text] Beijing 9 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--The year 1994, a "year 
of reform" to Chinese officials, is a crucial one in which the 
reform of the market economic structure will be conducted in a 
comprehensive way. In the 100 days from 1 January to 10 April 
1994, how have things been going with the various reform 
measures newly presented? What are the social effects? Facing 
these questions, Feng Bing, deputy secretary-general of the 
State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System answered: 
"Generally, the implementing of various reform measures has 
been very smooth, and the assessment from top to grass roots is 
very high." 
  Feng Bing indicated that over the past 100 days, reform in 
the macroeconomic regulation and control system has been 
conducted, including finance, taxation, banking, foreign 
exchange, foreign trade, and planned investment. 
<H5>  Tax and Fiscal Reform Is in Period of Fine Tuning </H5>
  He said measures for tax and fiscal reform are basically in 
operating normally and in a period of fine tuning. From the 
angle of effects, internal financial revenue in the first 
quarter markedly increased. Taking January and February for 
example, internal financial revenue was 50.7 billion yuan, up by 
32.1 percent over the same period last year; financial 
expenditures were 49.15 billion yuan, up by 29.1 percent. 
Income was 1.55 billion yuan higher than expenditures. 
Conditions for the issuance of 12.92 billion yuan of national 
bonds were sound, and people were vying for their purchase. 
  In the course of reform, the phenomenon by which some 
localities and enterprises arbitrarily raised prices by taking 
advantage of taxation reform surfaced for a time. Aiming at 
this phenomenon, the State Planning Commission and Taxation 
Administration jointly published the "Circular on Banning Price 
Rises By Taking Advantage of Tax Reform," with the State 
Council's approval, while augmenting propaganda about and 
explanation of the new tax system and removing some people's 
misunderstanding of taxing price subsidies, thus enabling a 
prompt solution to the problem. 
<H5>  Sound Condition in Foreign Exchange Reform </H5>
  The main contents of reform in the banking structure this 
year are, namely, augmenting central bank's functions, and 
implementing separation of banking of a policy nature from 
commercial banking. Work in this arena is actively under way. 
As Feng Bing disclosed, at present the central bank is fast 
recovering banknotes from circulation, with 90 percent of the 
banknotes issued before the spring festival recovered, and the 
condition of monetary operation is sound. 
  Foreign exchange and foreign trade restructuring with the 
merger of the two-track exchange rates and implementation of the 
system of foreign exchange settlement and selling of foreign 
exchange as the main contents were originally a cause of anxiety 
because of many uncertain factors and greater risk. However, in 
the 100 days since the new structure was implemented, progress 
has been smooth, and conditions are better than expected. The 
only trouble came in foreign exchange coupons; because of 
insufficient consideration of the issue, some stores allowed a 
price hike of goods to be purchased with foreign exchange 
coupons exclusively. This resulted in a run on foreign exchange 
coupons and panic buying with them. Later, responsive measures 
were adopted, and the problem was promptly pacified. The market 
exchange rate has all along been kept at the comparatively 
rational level of 8.7 yuan against the dollar. Feng Bing 
believes that in view of the import-export situation and the 
revenue and expenditures in foreign exchange, it is entirely 
possible to stabilize the exchange rate at the present level 
through regulation of the foreign exchange market. 
  The planned investment structure is under reform according 
to 
the original plan. The "change from fund allotment to loans" is 
being converted to the "change from loans to investment." The 
train of thought of plural investment bodies has already been 
set, with major foundation work completed. However, it will 
take some time to shape the system. 
  Reform of the modern enterprise system has not yet spread on 
a wide scale as of today, and is still in an experimental phase, 
with 100 enterprises carefully selected for the experiment. The 
chief hurdles to enterprise transition to the modern enterprise 
system are, first, excessive social burdens; second, excessive 
overstaffing; and third, heavy debt burdens. Feng Bing believes 
the solution to those problems primarily calls for the 
enterprises' own efforts; however, support and help from 
governments at all levels are also indispensable.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Two United States Navy 
transport ships carrying Patriot missile batteries arrived in 
the southeastern port of Pusan in South Korea Monday [18 April]. 
  The first shipment contains six Patriot missile batteries, 
with a total of 48 launchers, the South Korean news agency 
YONHAP said. 
  Normally, a Patriot battalion has three to six batteries, 
with eight launchers each. Each launcher carries four missiles. 
  These missile launchers are expected to be deployed at 
military bases in South Korea by April 29, YONHAP quoted 
military sources as saying. 
  The 13,000-ton "Comet" and 16,460-ton "Meteor" left the U.S. 
Navy base in Oakland on March 23. Earlier reports said a total 
of 192 Patriots would be sent to South Korea. 
  The patriot anti-missile missiles are a more advanced 
version 
than those used in 1991 Gulf war, according to the sources. 
  The missiles will considerably reinforce the air defense 
capability in South Korea, a ministry official said, adding that 
"it is the most effective defense system against possible air 
attack." 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered the patriots to 
South 
Korea to boost its defense capabilities during a growing 
confrontation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(DPRK) over Pyongyang's nuclear issue. 
  The DPRK strongly opposes the deployment of Patriot missiles 
in South Korea, saying the missiles are designed for offensive 
purposes. 
  Two weeks ago, some 1,000 students staged a demonstration 
here to protest against the deployment of the U.S. weapons. 
  Patriot missiles, which were requested by U.S. commander in 
South Korea Gary Luck, gained fame during the Gulf war for 
intercepting Iraqi Scud missiles.

  [Text] After a three-day session, the conference sponsored 
by the provincial radio and television broadcasting department 
with the participation of directors of the radio and television 
broadcasting bureaus and stations of various prefectures and 
cities concluded in Harbin on the afternoon of 14 April. During 
the conference, the spirit of the national work conference on 
propaganda and ideology was relayed; the experiences gained in 
implementing the tasks adopted at the provincial work conference 
on radio and television broadcasting were summarized and 
exchanged; and the issues of how to have the radio and 
television departments reinforce their vitality in the course of 
establishing the systems of socialist market economy as well as 
successfully conduct propaganda activities and develop radio and 
television broadcasting undertakings were emphatically discussed. 
  During the conference, the participating comrades contended 
that the provincial work conference sponsored in November 1993 
on radio and television broadcasting was a grand gathering of 
unprecedented size in the province's history of radio and 
television broadcasting development. The spirit of the 
provincial work conference in this regard has begun to promote 
or is promoting the development of radio and television 
broadcasting undertakings in the province. Although only six 
months have been over after the provincial work conference in 
this regard, the work to implement the spirit of the work 
conference has won initial success and a favorable and 
encouraging trend in the work has taken shape. The leading 
bodies of party committees and governments at the 
prefecture-city level have generally listened to the report 
given by the radio and television broadcasting department and 
formulated actually feasible measures for stabilizing the 
broadcasting organs at the county level, consolidating the rural 
broadcasting network, and carrying out propaganda management. 
Some units have also made great and important moves. For 
example, the Suifenhe city party committee and people's 
government summarized in a timely manner their experience and 
lessons gained in this regard; restored the operation of some 
city radio and television broadcasting organs that had been once 
revoked according to their local reality; and enhanced the 
systematic management over the radio and television broadcasting 
front. Such acts conducted by them have evoked strong 
repercussion among the radio and television broadcasting 
departments throughout the province. 
  It was emphatically pointed out at the conference that radio 
and television broadcasting departments at all levels are facing 
a severe test. They should not only do a good job in being the 
mouthpiece of the party, government, and the people, but also 
steadily deepen their self improvement. This requires them to 
always regard as a guiding principle the socialist theory of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping with regard to building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and to do a good job in guiding public 
opinions and setting people's minds at rest. In conducting the 
propaganda work, they should consciously uphold the principle of 
applying the scientific theories to arming the people; applying 
correct public opinions to guiding the people; adopting lofty 
spirit to educate the people; and using the outstanding works to 
encourage the people. They should truly achieve in being really 
helpful and refraining from adding turmoil to society, playing 
the main melody and refraining from creating noise, paying 
attention to social benefits and refraining from forgetting the 
righteousness while seeing the interest, observing the 
propaganda discipline and refraining from going their own way, 
presenting concrete facts and refraining from being pretended, 
and vigorously grasping implementation and refraining from 
indulging in formalism. They should also make contributions to 
realizing political stability, social peace, and economic 
development in the province. 
  It was pointed out at the conference that radio and 
television broadcasting departments are facing so many 
difficulties of which, the prominent one is the strained 
situation in funds. They should continuously seek more support 
and investments from the state on one hand and concentrate their 
efforts on tapping internal potential on the other hand by 
deepening their self improvement and upgrading the quality of 
personnel's contingent and propaganda work so as to truly 
provide for the people rich, colorful, and healthy nourishments 
for the mind, which can encourage the people to make progress. 
  At the conference responsible comrades from the provincial 
radio and television broadcasting department and the radio and 
television broadcasting bureaus of various prefectures, cities, 
and fronts voiced their opinions on their future work of 
carrying out propaganda management, developing broadcasting 
undertakings, conducting technical management, and of building 
spiritual civilization.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 (XINHUA) -- A senior Chinese 
Government official said here today that discussions at the just

  [Text] New York, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
State Councillor Song Jian today praised Sino-U.S. cooperation 
in science and technology and hoped for closer ties in the 
political and economic fields. 
  Song, also minister in charge of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, said that there had been problems in 
developing the cooperation in science and technology, but they 
had all been solved with concerted efforts by scientists of the 
two countries. 
  He expressed confidence that Chinese and U.S. political and 
business leaders could do the same in case of difficulties. 
  Song made these remarks here tonight during a reception 
given 
by Zhang Weichao, China's consul-general in New York, in honor 
of Song for his visit to New York city. 
  Earlier this week, Song attended the Sixth Session of the 
Sino- U.S. Joint Working Committee on Cooperation of Science and 
Technology held in Washington. 
  U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher met with Song and his delegation on April 12. 
  In his speech tonight, Song also expressed his hope that the 
momentum seen in cooperation of science and technology between 
the two countries would be maintained and that the fields of 
cooperation further expanded. 
  "China imports more than 100 billion U.S. dollars worth of 
commodities each year from foreign countries," he said, "and we 
hope our American friends from the scientific, technological and 
business circles will seize this opportunity to engage more 
actively in economic, trade, scientific and technological 
cooperation with China." 
  Also attending the reception were more than 100 leaders from 
science and business circles in New York.

  [Text] Washington, April 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton reaffirmed today that the United States "maintain 
absolutely firm support" of the United Nations' policy on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Clinton told reporters at the White House that since the 
U.N. 
has taken a more vigorous approach, asked NATO to provide close 
air support and created the safe zone around Sarajevo, 
"substantial progress has been made." 
  "We've had relative peace in the Sarajevo area," he added, 
"we've had the agreement between the Croats and the Muslims 
which is holding." 
  Clinton conceded that there were "some friction as a result 
of the last round of very modest airstrikes as a result of the 
shelling of Gorazde." 
  Under U.N. and NATO direction, U.S. warplanes carried out 
air 
strikes against Serbian positions near the besieged Muslim 
enclave of Gorazde on Monday [11 April] and Tuesday. 
  Clinton claimed that "we can't have our U.N. personnel there 
vulnerable to shelling and to attack with no one there to defend 
them." 
  But, the President said, "the United States has no interest 
in having NATO become involved in this war and trying to gain 
advantage for one side over the other." 
  "Our position is to be firm but not provocation and not 
trying to change the military balance," he stressed. 
  Clinton called upon all the parties to get back to the 
negotiations, saying that is "the most important thing."

  [Text] Washington, April 17 (XINHUA) -- President Bill 
Clinton said today that the United States opposes lifting the 
U.N.-authorized sanctions against the Serbs for the time being, 
as suggested by some European countries. 
  While stressing a diplomatic solution to the Bosnian crisis, 
Clinton reiterated that Washington remains committed to its role 
in NATO under the United Nations. 
  Clinton, having communications on Bosnia with British Prime 
Minister John Major and Russian President Boris Yeltsin earlier 
today, did not rule out further NATO air strikes on Serbs around 
Gorazde. 
  "It depends on the U.N. commander on the ground," he said. 
  The U.S. "is still a very important part of the NATO 
alliance 
and we are committed to doing whatever we're asked to do," 
Clinton said. 
  The situation around Gorazde, one of the six Bosnian Muslim 
"safe areas" designated by the U.N., remains confusing. 
  There were reports that Serb tanks were retreating and 
fighting subsided in the Muslim enclave encircled by the Serbs. 
  Meanwhile, Charles Redman, the U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, 
told NBC's "Meet the Press" program that Gorazde was under the 
military and tactical control of the Serbs. 
  U.S. airplanes under NATO launched two air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions during the past two weeks. 
  In retaliation, the Serbs held more than 100 U.N. soldiers 
as 
hostages. 
  One British jet fighter was shot down Saturday over Gorazde. 
  However, Clinton said, negotiations between the U.N. and the 
Bosnian Serbs had "some progress," such as the Serb agreement to 
release 16 Canadian soldiers.

  [Text] Washington, April 15 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton today promises to move as quickly as possible to do a 
thorough and complete investigation on the helicopter incident 
that occurred in Iraq. 
  Clinton told reporters at the White House that he met for an 
hour and a half this morning with his national security advisors 
about a variety of issues including the incident. 
  The President described as "the terrible tragedy" the 
incident in which two U.S. helicopters were shot down by two 
U.S. warplanes in Northern Iraq yesterday. 
  "We are going to stay on top of this, work through it, and 
make a full report to the American people," Clinton said. 
  Clinton also said he telephoned British Prime Minister John 
Major and French President Francois Mitterrand to extend his 
condolences for the losses of their citizens in the incident. 
  There were 26 persons killed in this incident. They were 15 
U.S. personnel, three Turkish officers, one French officer, two 
British officers and five Kurdish people. 
  Asked whether the U.S. should continue the peacekeeping 
mission in Northern Iraq, Clinton said that "I very definitely 
think so." 
  He considered the mission as "very successful" and "very 
important," adding that "I believe it should continue." 
  Defense Secretary William Perry told a news briefing today 
that an investigative board will work hard to get to the bottom 
of what happened. 
  "We want to take the measures necessary to ensure that a 
tragedy such as this does not occur again," Perry said.

  [Text] Singapore, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. 
President George Bush expressed here today his objection to the 
Clinton administration's policy of linking human rights issues 
to the most- favored-nation trade status. 
  China should not be bullied and isolated, he said, adding 
that no one could insult China without harming the interests of 
the United States and the whole world. 
  Bush, U.S. president from 1989 to 1993, made the comments 
when addressing Citibank customers, prominent government 
officials, diplomats, and leading businessmen and bankers. 
  He arrived in Singapore on Thursday on a two-day visit to 
the 
country as part of Citibank's Asian Leadership Series, which was 
launched in 1992 in celebration of Citibank's 90th anniversary 
in Asia. 
  Bush also clashed with President Bill Clinton in opinion 
over 
the case of Michael Pater Fay, an American teenager, who has 
been found guilty for vandalism here last month and sentenced to 
imprisonment and six strokes of caning. 
  Clinton had expressed his objection to the caning sentence, 
describing it as too "severe." He had reportedly sent a 
personal letter to Singapore President Ong Teng Cheong, pleading 
for clemency. 
  Bush said that when one was in someone else's country, he 
must follow the law of that country. 
  A country could not establish a set of laws for its 
citizens, 
but another set of laws for Americans, and another one more for 
people from other countries, he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Visiting former U.S. 
President George Bush today called on the Clinton administration 
to maintain good relations with China. 
  Bush said Washington should not suspend the 
most-favored-nation status to China. 
  Bush made the statement when meeting with South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam in the presidential house. 
  Turning to the Korean peninsula, Bush said the situation was 
not as tense as he thought when he was in his own country. 
  Kim, on his part, accused certain "irresponsible" people of 
exaggerating the situation on the Korean peninsula. 
  Bush arrived here earlier today to attend the 43rd Annual 
Conference of the Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA), 
scheduled for April 18-20.

  [Text] Moscow, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Leaders of the 12 
member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) 
today ended their one-day summit here after signing a package of 
documents on political, economic and military cooperation. 
  Russian President Boris Yeltsin told reporters at a joint 
press conference at the end of the summit that the CIS leaders 
adopted a statement on the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict and 
Russia agreed to send its peace-keeping troops there to join the 
U.N. observers. 
  Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze believed that the 
statement covered several important points, including an urgent 
appeal to the U.N. Security Council to start a peace-keeping 
operation in Abkhazia, a breakaway autonomous republic of 
Georgia. 
  Asked why Ukraine chose to join the CIS' economic union as 
an 
associate member, its President Leonid Kravchuk replied: "the 
question is whether integration is to be accomplished on equal 
or unequal terms." 
  The Ukrainian leader pointed out that the unification of the 
Belarus and Russian monetary systems signifies deeper 
integration than the Euro-Asian Union proposed by Kazakh 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev. 
  Kazakh Vice-President Yerik Ansanbayev disclosed that "a 
comprehensive program for the formation of the Euro-Asian Union 
will be submitted by Kazakhstan at the next CIS summit." 
  Moldovan President Mircea Snegur believed that ordinary CIS 
citizens will receive plenty of economic benefits as a result of 
the Moscow summit. 
  Yeltsin also announced at the press conference that the next 
CIS summit meeting will be held on December 9.

  [Text] Moscow, April 15 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin and his Ukrainian counterpart Leonid Kravchuk agreed 
here today to divide the disputed Black Sea Fleet, according to 
the ITAR- TASS NEWS AGENCY. 
  Immediately after the one-day summit meeting of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States held in Moscow on Friday [15 
April], the two presidents signed an agreement on splitting the 
fleet in a stage-by- stage way. 
  Under the accord, the Russian Black Sea Fleet and the 
Ukrainian Navy, which is to get up 15-20 percent of the fleet's 
ships, will be based separately. 
  It was specified that the details of the fleet division will 
be elaborated in 10 days, the news agency said. 
  Moscow and Kiev have been involved in the dispute over the 
fleet with over 380 warships since the disintegration of the 
Soviet Union in December 1991.

  [Excerpt] Beijing, April 17 (AFP) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said Monday the murder of 32 people, including 24 Taiwan 
tourists, on a pleasure boat in eastern China last month was a 
"heinous" crime that would be severely punished. "This is a 
heinous criminal offence and we will seriously punish those 
criminals in accordance with criminal procedures," Li told 
reporters. 
  The Chinese authorities admitted for the first time Sunday 
that the March 31 fire on the boat on Qiandao Lake in the 
eastern province of Zhejiang was a case of "murder, robbery and 
arson." Three suspects have been arrested in the case, which 
provoked an outcry in Taiwan amid repeated accusations of foul 
play and seriously damaged relations between the mainland and 
the Nationalist island. The outcome of the fire has caused 
considerable embarrassment to Beijing after Chinese officials 
and the media had previously insisted it was purely accidental. 
  "What really happened with regards the Qiandao Lake incident 
has already been found out and the criminals in that case have 
already been detained," Li said prior to his departure for a 
tour of Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and 
Mongolia. "I would like to take this opportunity to express my 
condolences over the death of the compatriots from both Taiwan 
and the mainland, and would also like to express my sympathy to 
the families of the victims," he said. 
  Relatives of the victims had accused Beijing of trying to 
hide the true cause of the the fire, and Taiwan launched a 
series of boycotts in protest, including the suspension of 
cultural and educational exchanges, sightseeing tours to China 
and the reappraisal of investment policies on the mainland. On 
Saturday, a source in Taipei had said the killings and robberies 
were carried out by a group of Chinese soldiers disguised as 
civilians. [passage omitted: history of PRC-Taiwan relations]

  [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng left 
Beijing this morning for official visits to Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan, as well as Mongolia. 
Before his departure, Li Peng met with Chinese and foreign 
reporters in the Great Hall of the People. 
  Li Peng said: The five countries are China's friendly 
neighbors. Since China established diplomatic relations with the 
Central Asian states, bilateral relations in all spheres have 
developed considerably. China and Mongolia have a long history 
of friendly relations and cooperation. The leaders of the five 
countries have visited China, and we have establied a 
relationship of mutual trust among us. This is my return visit 
to the five countries I have just mentioned. Li Peng said he

work of the State Council. 
  In response to a question on the "Qiandao" incident, Premier 
Li Peng said that the Qiandao case has been cracked and the 
murderers have been arrested. This is a heinous criminal 
offence and we will seriously handle this case in accordance 
with judicial procedures. "I would like to take this opportunity 
to express my profound condolences over the deaths of the 
compatriots from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and also 
express my deep sympathy with the families of the victims." 
  Li Peng also answered a number of other questions raised by 
Chinese and foreign reporters concerning the relations between 
China and the four Central Asian countries, as well as Mongolia. 
  Accompanying Li on the visit are his wife Zhu Lin; Ismail 
Amat, state councillor and minister in charge of the State 
Nationalities Affairs Commission; Qi Huaiyuan, director of the

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (AFP) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng 
left here Monday for a tour of Central Asian states, firmly 
denying that the trip would pose any threat to Sino-Russian 
ties. The tour, taking in the former Soviet republics of 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan as well as 
Mongolia, will be Li's first foreign trip since heart problems 
in April last year removed him from the political scene for some 
six months. 
  "I don't think there is any negative impact for Sino-Russian 
relations," Li told reporters at the Great Hall of the People 
prior to his departure. "China is ready to maintain good 
relations with Central Asian republics and Mongolia, and at the 
same time we also hope to see the maintenance of good relations 
between these countries and Russia," he said. 
  However, diplomats here say that China, in its bid to to set 
itself up as the major power in Asia, is keen to counter Russian 
influence in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). 
Beijing is also anxious to ensure that political instability in 
some CIS states does not spill over into neighbouring Xinjiang, 
China's predominantly Muslim province in the far northwest. 
  "The purpose of my visit is to enhance mutual understanding, 
promote cooperation and strengthen friendship," Li said, laying 
special emphasis on the mutual importance of strengthening 
economic links. "It is true that at present these countries are 
encountering economic difficulties, but I think that these 
difficulties are temporary and that they will be overcome," he 
said. 
  Diplomats point out that China's economic boom has given 
Beijing the chance to boost its influence in Central Asia at the 
expense of cash-strapped Moscow. 
  The highlight of Li's trip to Mongolia will be the signing 
of 
a new friendship and cooperation treaty to replace the one 
signed in 1960, when China was essentially a Russian puppet. "I 
hope that through my visit the two sides will further promote 
and extend trade and economic cooperation," Li said, adding that 
that more than 1,000 kilometer (600-mile) Sino-Mongolian 
frontier should become a "border of friendship." 
  During Li's absence, Vice-Premier in charge of the economy 
Zhu Rongji will take the role of acting premier.

  [Text] Tashkent, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng said today that his visit to Uzbekistan will serve to 
"further the mutual understanding, friendship and mutually 
beneficial cooperation in all fields" between China and 
Uzbekistan. 
  Li expressed the belief in a written statement released here 
this afternoon upon his arrival for a three-day official visit 
to Uzbekistan, the first leg of his five-Asian-nation tour. The 
tour will also take him to Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan 
and Mongolia. 
  Li said he was delighted to start his tour of Central Asia 
from the ancient city of Tashkent. 
  The people of China and Uzbekistan have a traditional 
friendship, which dates back to the times of the "silk-road", Li 
said. 
  He recalled that Uzbek President Islam Karimov's visit to 
China in 1992 "opened a new chapter" in bilateral friendly 
relations, and gave a strong momentum to an in-depth and overall 
growth of such ties. 
  China attaches importance to its relations with Uzbekistan, 
respects the choice of its people, and sincerely hopes for a 
lasting, stable and friendly relationship with the country based 
on the five principles of peaceful coexistence, he said. 
  During the visit, Li will hold talks with Uzbek leaders on 
bilateral relations and regional and international issues of 
mutual concern.

  [Text] Tehran, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Director General of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans Blix arrived 
here today for talks with senior Iranian officials on the issue 
of nuclear power plants in the country. 
  During the two-day visit, Blix is expected to discuss 
cooperation between the IAEA and Iran's Atomic Energy 
Organization. 
  While in Tehran, the IAEA head will hold talks with First 
Vice- President Hasan Habibi and other senior Iranian officials. 
  According to earlier official reports, Iran has started the 
construction of the nuclear power plant in the southern province 
of Bushehr with the assistance of Russian experts. 
  Iran also said that the construction of another nuclear 
power 
plant with the help of Chinese experts had also started in 
southwestern Iran. 
  However, both China and Russia denied the reports. A Chinese 
official said that the contract has not yet come into effect 
because of Iran's economic problem. 
  A Russian diplomat said that cooperation between Russia and 
Iran in building the nuclear power plant is still on the stage 
of negotiations. 
  But, an Iranian source said that an agreement was reached 
with Russia months ago on the construction of the first phase of 
the nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.

<F P=106> [XINHUA Commentator: "A Grand Blueprint for China's </F>
Sustained Development"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 15 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Council 
recently approved "China's Agenda 21," representing a practical 
step that China has taken to implement the resolutions of the 
United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development and 
a major event in China's efforts toward sustainable development. 
In a sense, the "Agenda" sketches for China a blueprint for 
development in the 21st century. 
  China is a developing nation with nearly a 1.2 billion 
population. China's foremost goal and task at present is to 
develop the economy and shake off poverty and backwardness. 
Like many developing countries, China faces global 
environmental problems such as climatic changes, ozone layer 
depletion, and reduced species diversity. In developing the 
economy, it also needs to address the problem of environmental 
pollution, ecological destruction, and devastation of natural 
resources. Due to low productivity levels, in the past China 
opted for economic development on a grand scale, seeking to 
realize high levels of growth through massive investment in 
industries with high levels of energy consumption and pollution. 
This led to the depletion of natural resources, the worsening of 
environmental pollution, and ecological destruction. As China's 
economy has now entered a stage of high-speed development, 
greater pressure will surely be brought to bear on our natural 
resources and environment if we continue to stick to an outdated 
development pattern and only emphasize quantitative growth to 
the neglect of qualitative improvements to the economy. If we 
fail to change our direction, we will be forced to pay a greater 
price; China's modernization process will be delayed; and the 
foundation of the existence and development of the Chinese 
nation will even be undermined. 
  Sustainable development is a great cause that has not yet 
been taken up in the course of human history. 
  Sustainable development in China is an important component 
of 
global sustainable development. The only way for China to 
ensure sustainable and high-speed development is to opt for a 
development path that will not only promote the economy but also 
protect the environment. The idea behind the formulation of 
"China's Agenda 21" is to promote sustainable development in 
China. 
  For human beings at the close of this century and the next, 
the issues of population, natural resources, and the environment 
will be common themes. As a developing country, China is 
entrusted with an important mission. The scope of the rational 
use of resources and environmental protection is no longer 
limited to the prevention of environmental pollution and to the 
restoration of the ecological system, but is being extended to 
a greater range of economic development and social progress. 
This marks a great leap in the cognitive level of human beings. 
It is precisely because of such a cognitive leap that we are 
presented with a new opportunity for development. It is 
necessary to realize high economic efficiency and to conserve 
natural resources and to lower energy consumption through 
setting a rational industrial setup, standardizing the types and 
scales of industrial enterprises, formulating and implementing 
correct industrial policies, accelerating the pace of 
readjusting industrial structure and technological 
transformation, and popularizing non-polluting production 
technologies and adopting non- polluting production methods. It 
is also necessary to continue experimenting with ecological 
farming projects; to greatly popularize non-polluting 
technologies for farming production; to rationally develop, 
utilize, and protect farmland; to enhance the capability to 
combat natural disasters; to gradually build an 
intensive-farming industry; and to help establish a rational 
structure for city planning. 
  The birth of "China's Agenda 21" marks a good beginning for 
China's sustainable development. Now, the most important task 
for us is to advance the comprehensive implementation of 
"China's Agenda 21" in a down-to-earth manner. 
  The Chinese people have made tremendous contributions to 
human civilization. The Chinese people, by adhering to the 
policy of reform and opening up, are now advancing step by step 
along the path of sustainable development. We will surely have 
a bright future. China will surely make new contributions to the 
global environment and development.

  [Text] Xian, April 15 (XINHUA) -- The First International 
Wool Textiles Conference of China opened today in Xian, capital 
of north- west China's Shaanxi Province. 
  The three-day conference, sponsored by China Textile Trade 
Association, is being attended by 295 representatives from 13 
countries and regions. 
  The conference will cover the study of the developing trend 
of the industry and materials, theoretical study of the 
structures of wool and other animals' fabric and manufacturing 
technologies of wool. 
  Representatives of 18 well-known companies from abroad will 
lecture on technologies of advanced wool textile equipment. 
  Wool textile industries have been set up throughout China, 
which has 35,000 mechanical looms and 3.3 million wool spindles. 
  China's wool textile industry has been developing rapidly 
since 1979, when China initiated its opening-up policy. During 
1981 and 1992, the number of wool spindles in China increased 
more than two fold, 5.5 times the number of 1980. The number is 
still growing, at the rate of 225,000 annually. 
  In 1992, the country produced 338 million meters of woolen 
goods. 
  At the same time, China's output of sheep's wool, rabbit fur 
and yak fur have all become the greatest in the world in recent 
years. China now accounts for 50 percent of the world's total 
output of sheep's wool, 90 percent of rabbit fur and about 85 
percent of yak fur. 
  Even so, China still needs to import large amounts of wool 
every year. 
  China is keen on exchanges and cooperation with other 
countries in the world, officials of the China textile trade 
association said. 
  Officials from the International Wool Secretariat, Australia 
and New Zealand are attending the conference.

  [Text] Washington, April 18 (XINHUA) -- United States 
President Bill Clinton today reiterated the U.S. support for 
lifting the U.N.- sanctioned arms embargo against Bosnia, but 
said Washington cannot do so unilaterally. 
  Describing the situation as "grim and uncertain" in Gorazde, 
a "safe area" for Bosnian Muslims that was on the verge of 
falling into Serb control, Clinton said chances for lifting the 
embargo appeared greater for the time being. 
  The Europeans and Russia in the past have opposed ending the 
embargo but now "their soldiers on the ground are in danger," 
Clinton said. 
  He disputed suggestions by some congressional leaders that 
the U.S. unilaterally lift the embargo, which was seen as 
denying the Muslims the chances of defending themselves while 
failing to stop the arms flow to the Serbs and Croats. 
  "First of all, there are substantial questions about whether 
under international law we can do it," he said.

  [Text] Washington, April 16 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President 
Clinton today outlined several new steps to fight the nation's 
plaguing crime. 
  In his weekly radio address, Clinton said the government 
will 
encourage weapons frisks in gang-infested public housing to 
prevent crime if tenants agree. 
  "We'll encourage more weapons frisks of suspicious persons, 
and we'll ask associations to put clauses in their leases 
allowing searches when crime conditions make it necessary," he 
said. 
  He said residents will be empowered to organize tenant 
patrols to ride elevators and to look after the public spaces in 
high-rise public housing units. 
  Clinton also announced a federal allocation of some 30 
million dollars to crack down on the growing crime wave in 
public housing, to help residents to "take back their homes." 
  He said the government will provide more programs such as 
midnight basketball leagues "to help our young people say no to 
gangs and guns and drugs."

  [Text] Tashkent, April 18 (XINHUA) -- President Islam 
Karimov hosted a grand banquet here this evening to welcome 
Chinese Premier Li Peng, who arrived earlier today for a 
three-day official visit. 
  Proposing a toast, Karimov said that the friendship between 
the peoples of China and Uzbekistan can be traced to centuries 
ago, when the "silk-road linked them together." 
  "There is every reason to revitalize this road today, when 
conditions are ripe for developing full-scale bilateral friendly 
cooperation," he said. 
  Premier Li Peng's visit marks the beginning of a new era in 
the relations between Uzbekistan and China, he said. 
  As many Chinese entrepreneurs are tavelling with Premier Li 
Peng, this provides a good opportunity for expanding bilateral 
trade and economic cooperation, he noted. 
  The direct links now existing between the businesses and 
localities of the two countries will undoubtedly bear fruits of 
cooperation, he said. 
  Karimov spoke highly of China's reform and opening, saying 
Uzbekistan is following closely with what is happening in China 
and expects China to push ahead along the path, so as to make 
greater contributions to mankind. 
  Li Peng, in his reply, said the warm reception accorded 
himself and his entourage reflects the profound friendly 
feelings the people of Uzbekistan hold towards their Chinese 
counterparts. 
  He noted that the traditional friendship between the two 
peoples entered a new stage after Uzbekistan became independent 
and has been consolidated and furthered since then. 
  As China is concentrating on its modernization drive, it 
needs a good international environment and follows an 
independent foreign policy of peace, Li said. 
  "We are ready to develop ties with all countries on the 
basis 
of the five principles of peaceful coexistence," he said. "In 
particular, we attach importance to developing good-neighborly 
relations of friendship and cooperation with the neighboring 
nations." 
  Li said he expected to have indepth discussions with 
President Karimov and other leaders of Uzbekistan on bilateral 
ties, regional and international issues. 
  Also, he expressed the conviction that this visit would 
serve 
to enhance the mutual understanding and cooperation in all 
fields between the two countries. 
  He agreed with Karimov that the silk-road should be 
revitalized, saying China would work towards that.

<F P=106> [Newsletter by reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Hu </F>
Xiaoguang (5170 2556 0342): "Tashkent Joyfully Welcomes an 
Honored Guest"] 
  [Text] Tashkent, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- After a long flight of 
6 and half hours, the special plane taken by State Council 
Premier Li Peng and his party from Beijing slowly touched down 
at Tashkent Airport at 1400 sharp local time today. 
  The sun shone brightly and a gentle breeze could be felt in 
the Tashkent afternoon. An Uzbek Foreign Ministry official told 
reporters that today's welcoming ceremony was the most solemn 
held in Uzbekistan since it declared independence. A guard of 
honor comprising the airborne force, air force, tank force, and 
army units was used for the first time as was the newly 
inaugurated airport terminal for reception of foreign guests. 
It shows that Uzbek leaders attach very great importance to the 
further development of Sino-Uzbek relations as well as Li Peng's 
visit. 
  Uzbek President Karimov looked particularly happy today. He 
led the acting chairman of the Supreme Soviet, prime minister, 
various ministers, and ranking officials to greet Premier Li 
Peng and his party at the airport. 
  This was the second time Karimov and Li Peng were to meet 
each other. The two leaders held friendly talks in March 1992 
when President Karimov paid a state visit to China. Premier Li 
Peng's current visit marks the first visit by a high-level 
Chinese leader to Uzbekistan since it declared independence. 
  The city of Tashkent carried out renovation of its main 
streets especially to welcome Premier Li Peng's visit. When Li 
Peng and his party's motorcade drove through the level, clean, 
and tidy streets, pedestrians on both sides waved their hands to 
greet the visitors. Uzbek and Chinese national flags and various 
colorful flags fluttered in the wind on some main streets. 
Large signs with Chinese characters reading "Welcome Premier Li 
Peng's Visit to Uzbekistan," "Friendship, Peace, and Friendly 
Relations Between Uzbekistan and China,"...met the eyes of 
honored Chinese guests at the intersections. All this added an 
atmosphere of warmth and friendliness to this famous ancient 
city in central Asia, and made visitors from Beijing feel warm 
and comfortable. 
  Tashkent's news media attached great importance to Premier 
Li 
Peng's visit. Today's KHAIK SUZI [renmin yanlun bao 0086 3046 
6056 6158 1032], an official newspaper of the Uzbek Government, 
carried a front-page headline in Chinese characters: 
"Respectable Chinese Premier Li Peng, We Warmly Welcome Your 
Visit to Uzbekistan!" It noted in a published news item: Uzbek 
leaders are convinced that Premier Li Peng's current visit will 
further promote the development of mutually beneficial 
Sino-Uzbek relations on an equal footing. 
  In the past week, Tashkent's newspapers and TV stations have 
carried extensive reports on China's situation -- the ancient 
culture and beautiful scenery of the Chinese nation, the modern 
look of Shanghai and other industrial cities, rapid economic 
development enjoyed by special zones, and so forth. Chief 
editor (Alihanov) of the Uzbek State TV Station said to 
reporters: "We expect more Sino- Uzbek joint ventures will be 
established after Premier Li Peng's visit. It is advantageous 
to the two countries." 
  Premier Li Peng's visit has become an important topic of 
conversation between citizens on Tashkent's streets which are 
permeated with a jubilant atmosphere. The people are looking 
forward to continuous development of friendly Sino-Uzbek 
contacts which go back to ancient times. They hope the ancient 
silk road blazed by their forefathers will glow with new 
splendor.

  [Text] Moscow, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin today confirmed his government's 
determination to continue the economic reforms underway in the 
country. 
  Speaking at the opening session of the annual meeting of the 
board of directors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) in Russia's second-largest city of St. 
Petersburg. Chernomyrdin stressed that the continuation of 
reforms remains at the center of Russia's economic policy. 
  The EBRD meeting, which will discuss how it will further its 
financial cooperation with Russia, is expected to play a big 
role in the bank's further contacts with Russia. 
  After the first two months of this year, the inflation rate 
fell below 10 percent in the country, the Russian government 
head said in his speech. "As long as the planned budget 
expenses are not exceeded, inflation will fall to seven or eight 
percent a month by the end of the year," he added. 
  "We are now going through the crisis' very lowest point," 
Chernomyrdin stated. "Russians have stepped right up to the 
line." 
  "However, such a change will occur only if investment 
increases," he stressed. 
  The Russian premier appealed to the EBRD's management, the 
official delegation members and businessmen from G7 nations who 
hold shares in the bank to be active on the Russian market. 
  "I see today's forum as weighty evidence that our 
international partners' worry over the fate of economic reforms 
in Russia is being replaced by other moods and other 
expectations," he said. 
  After Chernomyrdin's speech, the participants discussed the 
results of the bank's activity in the past two years and of the 
top priorities for the next two years.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Japan's ruling coalition 
today moved closer to an agreement on the future government 
policy and a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, a senior coalition official said. 
  At two rounds of talks, the coalition executives confirmed 
that the ruling parties will stick to a policy accord reached 
before the formation of Hosokawa's cabinet last August, said 
Social Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan 
-- SDPJ] Secretary General Wataro Kubo. 
  They also shared the view that an early Diet (parliament) 
approval of the overdue fiscal 1994 budget is the top priority 
for the next government and that the new administration should 
formulate a budget for fiscal 1995 featuring speedy improvement 
in lifestyle, Kubo told a press conference. 
  He said the representatives from the ruling parties ironed 
out differences on such key issues as political reform, economic 
reform mainly through deregulation, Japan-U.S. relations and 
administrative reform and decentralization. 
  They, however, failed to agree on two issues of immediate 
concern -- Tokyo's stance toward the nuclear issue on the Korean 
Peninsula and tax system reform. 
  If an accord is reached among them, the coalition parties 
will nominate Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as their single 
candidate for the premiership to succeed Hosokawa, who abruptly 
decided on April 8 to resign over dubious financial matters and 
a Diet business deadlock.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Veteran politician 
Michio Watanabe said today he needs more time to decide whether 
to leave the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to 
run in an upcoming parliamentary election for the prime 
ministership following the resignation of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on April 8. 
  Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and former foreign 
minister, was apparently having second thoughts about his 
defection plan now because his bid for the top government post 
seems unlikely to succeed, KYODO NEWS SERVICE reported. 
  He decided on Sunday [17 April] to quit the LDP in an 
attempt 
to seek ties with the ruling coalition parties to achieve his 
goal of succeeding Hosokawa. Watanabe had been expected to make 
a formal announcement on his defection plan today. 
  Watanabe held a 65-minute meeting with LDP President Yohei 
Kono today and told him he will consult with his faction members 
on the matter, KYODO said. They may hold another round of talks 
on Tuesday. 
  KYODO said an LDP official quoted Watanabe as telling kono, 
"I understand your feelings, so please give me a little more 
time to think about it." 
  The 70-year-old LDP veteran cited major differences between 
him and the ruling coalition over security issues as one of the 
main reasons for him to reconsider his plan to quit the LDP, 
still the largest single party in the Japanese Diet (parliament). 
  Kono appealed to Watanabe to stay in the LDP, saying, 
"unless 
the coalition decides to revamp its combination of political 
forces and accept you, your defection will be of no use," 
according to KYODO.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) "will never take any military 
actions first" as its weapons are defensive, said an editorial 
carried by the official newspaper NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The DPRK's peace-loving position and policy are "generally 
recognized by the international community," said the editorial, 
affirming that the fundamental mission of the DPRK armed forces 
is to "defend state sovereignty and security" and is totally "of 
a defensive nature." 
  The U.S. charge that the DPRK would first launch military 
actions is an insult to the DPRK's peace-loving policies and 
also an attempt to slander the defensive nature of the DPRK's 
armed forces, said the editorial. 
  It said that the U.S. charge was aimed at justifying its own 
military adventures. 
  Criticizing the U.S. and South Korea for having been 
gradually increasing military threats to the DPRK, the editorial 
said that the DPRK people and army would not bow to any powers 
and are now closely following U.S. military moves. 
  On Monday, two U.S. Navy transport ships carrying six 
Patriot 
missile batteries arrived in the southeastern port of Pusan in 
South Korea and the missiles are expected to be deployed at 
military bases in South Korea by April 29. 
  The DPRK has strongly opposed the deployment of Patriot 
missiles in South Korea, saying that the missiles are to be used 
for offensive purposes. 
  A row erupted earlier this month between the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK over the inspection of 
the latter's nuclear sites. 
  The Vienna-based IAEA claimed that Pyongyang rejected full 
inspection while the DPRK said that it had met the IAEA's 
demands.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (XINHUA) -- The International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) began routine safety checks at 
nuclear power facilities in South Korea Monday [18 April]. 
  Two IAEA inspectors, Bodadilla Muchino of Mexico and I. 
Acquah of Ghana, arrived here Sunday for a week-long inspection 
of nuclear reactors as well as nuclear processing facilities. 
  They started their official duties by examining documents 
and 
records on management and storage of nuclear fuel and comparing 
them with on-the-spot field studies. 
  The inspectors will change the batteries and film of 
surveillance equipment and seal some areas where necessary. 
Storage of used nuclear fuel will also come under investigation. 
  The IAEA conducts routine inspections every two months of 
the 
heavy-water reactor at wolsung and every four months of the 
other eight light-water reactors, according to official sources. 
  At present, nine nuclear power stations are operating in 
South Korea.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin today expressed the hope that China and Australia 
would cooperate and take up the challenges of the 21st century. 
  Meeting with visiting Australian Governor-General Bill 
Hayden 
at the state guesthouse here this afternoon, Jiang said since 
the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1972, bilateral 
relations have developed in an all-round way. 
  As two big influential countries in the Asian and Pacific 
region, the Chinese president said, China and Australia are 
shouldering important responsibilities for safeguarding regional 
security and stability and promoting regional economic 
cooperation and prosperity. 
  "We should set our eyes on the whole world and the 21st 
century, not just on the two countries," he stressed. 
  He said the future of the world is bright, as countries with 
different social systems can live in peace and harmony as long 
as they handle state-to-state relations on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful co-existence. 
  He said that the bilateral trade and economic cooperation 
between China and Australia hold out broad prospects. 
  Last year, he said, the volume of trade between the two 
countries hit an all-time high and Australia is one of the 
countries with the largest share of investment in China. 
  Hayden expressed his appreciation of the remarkable 
achievements that China has made in the economic field. He said 
these achievements have brought about benefits to the ordinary 
Chinese people. 
  Hayden said that over the past few years, Australia-China 
relations had grown smoothly and high-ranking officials of the 
two countries exchanged visits frequently. 
  The development of bilateral friendly ties and cooperation 
conforms to the interests of the two countries, he said. 
  Prior to their talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming 
ceremony for Hayden and Mrs. Hayden and their party in front of 
the Great Hall of the People. 
  Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of China's National People's 
Congress Standing Committee, was present on the occasion. 
  Jiang gave a banquet this evening in honor of Hayden and his 
wife and their party. Present was Chinese Vice-Premier and 
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen . 
  Hayden arrived here this morning for a state visit to China 
at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin.

  [Text] Chengdu, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, a top 
Chinese leader, has emphasized the importance of unswervingly 
implementing measures to expand reforms and soberly solve 
various specific problems. 
  During April 13-18, Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee 
of the National People's Congress, China's legislature, 
inspected a number of major state-owned enterprises and 
township-run factories in south-west China's Sichuan Province. 
  Qiao asked local officials to firmly implement various 
reform 
measures taken since the last quarter of 1993, by seizing 
current domestic and international opportunities favorable to 
China's economic construction and following Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
  "Everyone has noticed that these reform measures have played 
a significant role and reported initial successes," said Qiao, 
who is also a standing committee member of the Political Bureau 
of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. 
  The leader also noted that problems are bound to crop up 
when 
profound reforms are being carried out in a vast country such as 
China. 
  "We must be calm and sober-minded when encountering 
problems," he said. 
  Qiao Shi also stressed the need to strengthen the Communist 
Party's leadership in the course of implementing reform measures. 
  He urged party and government officials at all levels to 
guard against corruption, work in the interests of the people, 
improve their style of work, go to grass-roots units, show 
concern about people's work and livelihood and lead the people 
in overcoming difficulties. 
  Speaking of enterprise restructuring, particularly major 
state-owned companies, Qiao said that all enterprises must get 
in gear with the market, invigorate their operational set-up, 
improve their product quality and economic returns, and enhance 
their competitiveness. 
  It was imperative to continue strengthening the leadership 
over the farming sector and rural work and take practical 
measures to solve problems that have cropped up in agricultural 
development, he said. 
  Moreover, effective measures must be taken to increase 
farmers' incomes and ensure an increase in production of grain, 
cotton and cooking oil, he added. 
  He expressed the belief that China's rural areas will become 
increasingly prosperous by expanding production of township-run 
factories and speeding up construction of small cities and towns. 
  Speaking of surplus labor in rural areas, he said that 
Sichuan should solve this problem by providing labor services to 
other areas, expanding production of rural factories and 
accelerating infrastructure construction in a variety of forms, 
such as mobilizing farmers to build roads and water conservancy 
facilities. 
  While visiting the Sichuan provincial museum and a number of 
other cultural facilities, Qiao said that in China's 
modernization drive, it was necessary to draw on what is good in 
foreign cultures and carry forward outstanding Chinese national 
culture.

<F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>
  [Text] Leading dissident Bao Tong has been transferred to 
a hospital for treatment, but friends and relatives are losing 
hope for an early release. An informed source said the family 
of Bao, the principal secretary of ousted party chief Zhao 
Ziyang, had petitioned the Ministry of Public Security and the 
Justice Ministry for permission to see his doctors. 
  The source said, although he was admitted to hospital in 
Beijing last month, it was not an indication that the senior 
member of the Communist Party's liberal faction would be granted 
"parole for medical treatment". 
  The news came despite hints by Chinese officials that in 
return for unconditional Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status from 
Washington, Beijing might grant "medical bail" to a number of 
dissidents in April and May. 
  A source close to the family said Bao, the former political 
secretary of the Politburo who is serving the second half of his 
seven-year jail term for alleged offences, including "leaking 
state secrets", had recently undergone treatment for a serious 
thyroid gland complaint. "Six tiny tumours have been detected 
in his thyroid glands by doctors in the downtown hospital to 
which he was transferred from Qincheng Prison," the source said. 
"The doctors told Bao the tumours do not appear to be malignant 
but a further period of observation is warranted. No plans for 
surgical removal of the tumours have been made." 
  The source said it was unlikely Bao would be moved back to 
Qincheng, which is in the outskirts of Beijing, in the near 
future. It is understood, however, that relatives had expressed 
dissatisfaction about the "inadequate medical attention" Bao was 
given. They feared that since a few tumours had shown signs of 
fusion, the abnormal growths might be a symptom of cancer. 
  Moreover, according to a relative, Bao's face was swollen 
and 
he could no longer speak clearly because of problems with his 
vocal cords. He added that immediately before he was taken into 
hospital, Bao was in severe pain suffering from inflammation of 
shoulder joints. The relative added that, while medical 
facilities food, and general living conditions were slightly 
better in the hospital than in Qincheng, Bao's overall physical 
condition continued to deteriorate. 
  Sources in the dissident community in Beijing said, in view 
of China's confidence in securing MFN, it was unlikely the 
authorities would grant medical bail to high-profile prisoners 
of conscience including Bao. Meanwhile, the authorities have 
stepped up surveillance of dissidents suspected of organising 
protest activities in the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre in June. For example, relatives said 
Liu Nianchun, a labour activist who organised a petition for 
improvement in workers' rights in the spring, had been under 
virtual house arrest since last month.

  [Text] Beijing, April 19 (AFP) -- China's best known 
dissident Wei Jingsheng has been placed under police 
surveillance in a hotel in the Beijing suburbs, his family said 
Tuesday. "Police told my father that Wei Jingsheng was in a 
medium-class hotel in the suburbs," said Wei Ling, his younger 
sister told AFP. But they did not give the name of the hotel, 
she added. 
  A security ministry official contacted by telephone refused 
comment. 
  Wei was detained on April 1 on suspicion of having 
"committed 
new crimes" but his family has not been told if new charges have 
been brought against him. Last week a foreign ministry 
spokesman said Wei was a "criminal" and that his case had 
nothing to do with human rights. 
  Wei, 43, was freed on parole last September after serving 14 
years in jail for his role as a leader of the Democracy Wall 
movement in 1978-79. Since then he has given several interviews 
to the foreign press in which he said he planned to continue his 
fight for democracy in China. 
  Wei's secretary Tong Yi, has also been detained by the 
authorities, but Wei's family is without news of her.

<F P=106> [By Chieh Ming (2212 2494): "Beijing's `Extraordinary 9 </F>
March Political Case'"] 
  [Text] On the night of 7 March, the Ministry of Public 
Security received a report: Four incendiary devices had been 
found in a large basket of apples at Beijing's Fengtai Sports 
Center; at the same time, two smoking incendiary bombs were 
found at a work site near the Military Museum of the Chinese 
People's Revolution. The Beijing Municipal Government duty 
office also received an anonymous telephone call, saying that an 
explosive package had been found under a bridge on Nansanhuan 
Road and that it would explode soon. When public security 
personnel and People's Armed Police arrived at the scene, they 
found nothing. The calls were hoaxes. That evening, the Beijing 
Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Beijing Municipal 
Government received 12 telephone calls and dispatched over 80 
people on various occasions to no avail. Later that night, two 
People's Armed Police on duty at the International Conference 
Center were wounded by a sniper. 
  In the early morning of 9 March, with the help of a police 
dog, the 2d detachment of the Beijing People's Armed Police 
found a time bomb made with 30 kg of TNT in a ditch beside the 
highway to the airport. The bomb was set to explode at 0500. 
In the meantime, public security personnel also found a time 
bomb in a wooden box on a slope near the Beijing-Guangzhou 
railway in Fengtai, and the ignition time was also set at 0500. 
  According to the Ministry of Public Security, the two cases 
on the night of 7 March and in the early morning of 9 March were 
carried out by the same underground organization. Anonymous 
telephone calls on the night of 7 March were also made by them. 
The incendiary bombs were home-made and the advanced way the 
chemicals were made up showed that they were made by persons 
with specialist knowledge in this field. The time bombs were 
smuggled into the country from outside the borders. It can be 
basically ascertained that this was a case connected with or 
controlled by a hostile organization overseas. The time bombs 
probably came from Japan or Taiwan. This is the most serious 
case of violent destruction found in recent years and has been 
called the "extraordinary 9 March political case." Public 
Security Minister Tao Siju has personally taken charge as the 
leader of the special group responsible for examining the case. 
  In another development in early March, a time bomb was also 
found near Putian City's Dongzhen reservoir in Fujian Province. 
Affected by damp, the bomb did not explode at the prescribed 
time. According to the Fujian Provincial Public Security 
Department, if the bomb had exploded, the political effects 
would have been greater than the explosion itself. 
  On the early morning of 8 March, a time bomb was found in 
soap box at an artillery base near Changsha, Hunan Province. 
The bomb was later detonated by servicemen stationed there. 
  According to a relevant source, the aforesaid time bomb 
incidents are similar in terms of timing and the type of bomb. 
Therefore, the possibility that they were carried out by a 
hostile organization with branches in many parts of the country 
cannot be ruled out.

  [Text] The Fourth National Working Meeting on Cracking 
Illegal Textile Transit-Trade Activities, jointly sponsored by 
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the 
General Administration of Customs, and the State Administration 
for the Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, was opened 
in Guangzhou today. Over the past year our government 
departments have adopted a series of measures to stop illegal 
textile transit-trade activities. Since 1990 our country has 
punished 14 domestic export enterprises and manufacturers, 
suspended trade contacts with three foreign enterprises, and 
closed the office of a foreign enterprise in China. 
  The meeting participants published a bulletin on punishing 
four enterprises including Shengyang's (Dongmao) Industrial 
Company, and others which engaged in illegal textile 
transit-trade activities. The meeting will also study and solve 
several specific problems occurring in the course of cracking 
illegal transit-trade activities, such as exports of textile 
products without the country of origin noted, export permits for 
textile products, appeals lodged by relevant export enterprises, 
controversial places of origin, and falsification of place of 
origin. This year the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, General Administration of Customs, and the State 
Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities will form a leading group responsible for cracking 
illegal textile transit-trade activities. They will continue to 
carry out a nationwide investigation and formulate specific 
measures and methods. 
  On behalf of Guangdong Province, Vice Governor Lu Ruihua 
addressed the meeting. He said: Guangdong has never supported, 
concealed, or covered up illegal textile transit-trade 
activities. It will make checks at all levels in terms of orders 
of goods, agents, and exports to put an end to illegal smuggling 
of textile goods. 
  Shi Guangsheng, vice minister of the Ministry of Foreign 
Trade and Economic Cooperation, attended today's meeting and 
spoke.

<F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Hua (7115 5478) and XINHUA </F>
reporter Jin Xiaoming (6855 1420 2494)] 
  [Text] Chengdu, 17 Apr (XINHUA) -- The eighth annual 
meeting of the Chinese Workers' Ideological and Political Work 
Society was held in Sichuan's Deyang city today. All 
representatives to the meeting reached a consensus that 
enterprises' ideological and political work should be 
subordinated to and serve the whole party's overall work, which 
is guided by the principle of "seizing the opportunity, 
deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability." 
  Attending the five-day annual meeting were representatives 
of 
30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities as well as 
relevant ministries and commissions. Also attending were more 
than 100 representatives from enterprises. They will study and 
exchange ideas, practices, and experiences concerning how to 
further strengthen and improve enterprises' ideological and 
political work under the new situation of building a socialist 
market economy. They will also amend the society's charter and 
elect directors for the new term to form a new leading organ. 
  Xu Weicheng, deputy executive head of the Propaganda 
Department, presided over today's meeting. 
  Yuan Baohua, chairman of the Chinese Workers' Ideological 
and 
Political Work Society, gave a report at the meeting. He said: 
Exploring new ways to promote enterprises' ideological and 
political work is of very important significance in ensuring the 
smooth progress of enterprises' reform and the coordinated 
construction of material and spiritual civilizations. 
  Yuan Baohua continued: As far as enterprises' ideological 
and political work is concerned, the current situation provides 
both opportunity and challenge. During the course of carrying 
out this year's reform, which is wide in scope and great in 
difficulty, some unexpected problems and some confused thinking 
might crop up. It is imperative for us to knuckle down to our 
ideological and political work, with a clear objective in mind. 
The publication of Volume Three of the Selected Works of 
Deng Xiaoping has provided us with most effective weapons 
for carrying out this task. 
  Yuan Baohua emphatically said: The primary objective of this 
year's work is to ensure that enterprises will carry out the 
tasks of arming the whole party with the theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to 
follow the mass line, carry out enterprises' democratic 
management, carry forward a hard working spirit, and combat 
negative and corruptive phenomena. Meanwhile, in the light of 
workers' ideological realities, we should try to find new ways 
to carry out this work under the new situation. To carry out our 
work in the new period, it is necessary to pay attention to 
spiritual civilization construction by fostering a correct 
outlook on life and sense of value among workers. Meanwhile, 
during the course in which state-owned enterprises are 
establishing and improving their leadership and making it 
consistent with the modern enterprise system, the party, 
government, and trade unions should focus on improving 
production and management and try to knuckle down to our 
ideological and political work in all aspects. 
  While talking about the ideological and political work in 
our 
drive to change enterprises' management mechanisms, Chen 
Qingtai, vice minister of the State Economic and Trade 
Commission, said: The drive to change the management mechanism 
requires us to use ideological and political work to stir 
workers' enthusiasm in participating in reform and to correctly 
handle the relationship between the concept of invigorating 
enterprises and that of straightening out their internal 
management, between the concept of workers becoming the master 
of the country and that of becoming good workers, between the 
concept of some people becoming prosperous first and that of 
achieving common prosperity, as well as between the concept of 
increasing labor productivity and that of increasing workers' 
incomes. He urged that enterprises' ideological and political 
work should be applied to the whole process of production and 
management. Self-education in various forms should be conducted 
among workers. In addition, ideological and political work 
should be institutionalized. 
  In his speech, Xue Zhaoyun, vice chairman of the All-China 
Federation of Trade Unions, said: The All-China Federation of 
Trade Unions should concentrate on routine mass ideological and 
political work. At present, we should focus on two things: 
First, it is necessary to help workers enhance their 
understanding and adaptability to reform policies and methods. 
Second, we should solve contradictions in a timely fashion and 
help workers adjust various personal relations on the basis of 
mutual concern, understanding, and respect.

<F P=106> [Commentator's Article: "It Behooves One To Help Another"] </F>
  [Text] On 28 March, this newspaper carried a newsletter 
entitled "The Affection and Tears of a Foster Mother of Korean 
Minority," and a commentary entitled "Everyone Comes To Give 
Some Love," attracting attention and strong responses from the 
broad masses of readers. On the Harbin-Beijing No. 18 express 
train, in the Harbin Railway Bureau, in the Heilongjiang Grain 
Bureau, in Shenzhen, by the south China coast...people are 
trying to show they care by donating money. Before this, on 22 
March, this newspaper carried an article entitled "Live Like 
`Father'" reporting on Xiang Shixin and his wife in Shenyang, 
who, though earning a moderate income, financially supported a 
youth in school who was neither a relative nor an old friend, 
also causing strong responses from readers. Similar stories 
have often been carried by newspapers recently, making people 
feel that a warm current of love and offering is flowing in the 
vast motherland, spreading to millions of households, and 
encouraging billions of people. In the 1990's, the fine social 
habit of "one helping another" is still striking deep roots in 
the Chinese soil. 
  In the big family on our motherland, no matter where you 
live, what you do, or what ethnic group you belong to, everyone 
is the builder of the socialist undertaking, and has common 
interests, ideals, undertakings, and pursuits. When people are 
as close as brothers, love one another, and help one another, we 
will increase the nation's cohesive force and form a strong 
integrating force for invigorating the Chinese nation. In 
society, there is always a group of people who are comparatively 
poor or very poor, who are leading a comparatively difficult or 
very difficult life, and who sometimes even slip into a very 
dangerous situation and badly need the help of other people. 
"One helping another" is required by our socialist system, as 
well as a duty to be performed by every person who has a sense 
of social responsibility and a sense of righteousness. A 
majority of people in society are doing so. However, in a 
certain period, some people were influenced by mammonism and 
thoughts of extreme individualism, so they turned a blind eye to 
other people's difficulties, and turned a deaf ear to other 
people's call for help. When a hooligan insulted a woman, they 
stood aside to watch....When a child fell into the water and 
shouted for help, a man first demanded money....The terrible 
indifference and the extreme selfishness made them throw away 
the minimum social responsibility and morals needed for being a 
man. People of various social quarters expressed righteous 
indignation and condemnation on this situation and strongly 
hoped to change it. 
  Indeed, as we diligently build the socialist market economy 
system, it has become an urgent and important duty for us to 
vigorously strengthen spiritual civilization construction in the 
whole society. If this problem is not solved properly, it will 
certainly affect social stability and hinder the smooth process 
of reform, opening up, and modernization construction. 
Spiritual civilization rests mainly on construction. Like 
material civilization construction, spiritual civilization 
construction must also begin from doing concrete things one 
after another, solidly and persistently. The deeds of PLA 
soldier Xu Honggan, the deeds of the Korean lady Bai Yulan, and 
the deeds of many other advanced figures tell us that, amid 
socialist spiritual civilization construction, the heroic and 
moving deeds by the broad masses show the truly commendable 
spirit of dedication, as well as historical initiatives. 
  In our Chinese nation's history of civilization of several 
thousand years, respect for the elderly and care for the young, 
rescuing people in danger and helping the poor, taking up the 
cudgels for a just cause, and laying down one's life for a just 
cause, are the traditional virtues praised by the people. In 
the 70-year history of our party leading the people to engage in 
revolution and construction, care for others, taking pleasure in 
helping others, considering others first, sacrificing oneself 
for public interest, and "eight sides coming to the aid of one 
side when it has trouble" are outstanding habits which have won 
hearts and minds. In the new historical period, if we can 
develop our nation's traditional virtues, uphold our party's 
outstanding work style, borrow helpful experiences from foreign 
countries, explore behavioral and moral norms which have the 
features of the day, and combine all these organically into one, 
then we can create a world- renowned socialist spiritual 
civilization with Chinese characteristics. 
  When we reflect on the reports of these moving stories, we 
find that mass media have played an important role. So long as 
we can give full play to the characteristics and strong points 
of public opinion work, encourage healthy trends, and criticize 
evil tendencies, we can increase the number of people who like 
to give and help, and we can decrease the number of those who 
are extremely selfish and care only about themselves, so that 
social atmosphere will continue to improve. Journalists have 
great room to maneuver in the area of guiding people with the 
correct public opinion and molding people with lofty spirit. 
This newspaper wishes to join hands and walk side by side with 
brother units, to continue to work hard.

<F P=106> [By staff reporters Lo Ping (5012 0393) and Li Tzu-ching </F>
(7812 5261 0079)] 
  [Text] People with breadth of vision at home and abroad 
have always held that the National People's Congress [NPC] is 
merely a rubber stamp of the CPC, and does not represent popular 
will. The CPC does not like to listen to such criticism and has 
always denied this, saying that this is Chinese-style socialist 
democracy, which is more democratic than Western parliaments. 
Is the NPC system democratic, or is it a rubber stamp of the 
CPC? Let the Second Session of the Eighth NPC held by the CPC 
not long ago answer the question. 
<H5>  Qiao Shi Urges Deputies To Hold Deliberations According to </H5>
the Agenda Arranged by the Congress 
  Prior to the convocation of the congress, Qiao Shi summoned 
the chiefs of all the delegations, set forth the tasks, urged 
them to hold deliberations according to the agenda arranged by 
the congress, and told them to not go too far or make unexpected 
proposals. 
  In light of CPC general practice, interim party groups are 
established for holding national-level meetings, which form 
small groups, branches, and provisional party committees 
composed of party-member deputies. On the day before the 
opening of the congress, a preparatory meeting of party members 
is held and they are requested to carry out the orders from the 
top. 
  The presidium published in the press is merely a form shown 
to the public. It is the central group of the congress which 
commands, leads, and exercises control over the congress. 
Through the interim party committees and basic level party 
organizations (branches and groups) of the delegations, the 
central group firmly exercises control over operation of the 
congress. 
<H5>  Motions Deviating From the Congress Agenda </H5>
  The central group is most worried about the proposals and 
motions presented by the deputies which deviate from the 
congress agenda. Prior to the current congress, a number of 
bills and proposals deviating from the congress agenda were 
submitted. During the session, the deputies again made bills, 
proposals, and joint speeches, which deviated from the congress 
agenda: 
<H5>  Deputies Strongly Demand That Officials Make Public Their </H5>
Property 
  Deputies from Shanghai, Tianjin, Shandong, Jiangsu, and 
Zhejiang strongly demanded that members of the CPC Central 
Committee's Political Bureau, state councillors, NPC vice 
chairmen and CPPCC vice chairmen who are party members, and 
ministers of various committees and ministries give an account 
of their economic status, as well as the political, economic, 
and working conditions of their dependents and relatives so that 
they can be placed under NPC supervision and can win popular 
trust. 
  When deputies from the Shandong and Jiangsu delegations 
planned to submit such a joint motion to the congress for 
examination, the central group and the party committees of some 
delegations held that the motion "overstepped the bounds." 
<H5>  Qinghai Blames Central Leadership for Damaging Its Own </H5>
Reputation 
  A deputy from Qinghai pointed out that the central 
leadership 
called for support for the poor provinces to end their 
backwardness, but no funds have been allocated and a request for 
enjoying the preferential policies similar to the coastal areas 
was not even approved. As a result, local leaders and masses 
said: The central leadership is saying one thing but doing 
another, thus damaging its own reputation. 
<H5>  Ningxia Deputies Complain About the New Tax System </H5>
  The deputies from Ningxia had a different view on the State 
Council's tax reform and revenue-sharing system: To narrow the 
gap between regions and assist the development of the backward, 
poor, and remote regions, a different tax system should be 
formulated in light of the economy, output value, and base 
figures of each province, municipality, and autonomous region. 
<H5>  Deputies From Beijing and Hebei Say Streamlined Cadres </H5>
Incompetent 
  Deputies from Beijing and Hebei pointed out: Party and 
government organs have not taken due action in the work of 
streamlining cadres. Some of the streamlined cadres have sought 
employment in economic entities, financial organizations, or 
large joint venture. When they cannot not make a gain or the 
conditions are inferior to their former units, they resume their 
former positions and some even get a promotion. Last year, the 
number of cadres streamlined was less than 10 percent of the set 
target. The motion submitted by the Beijing delegation said: 
As streamlining constitutes an important measure of reform, it 
should become a regular work and the set target must be met on 
schedule. 
<H5>  Triads Running Wild in Shanxi </H5>
  A Shanxi deputy urged the NPC Standing Committee's survey 
team to probe into the activities of triads in Shanxi. The 
deputy pointed out: The provincial government and the 
procuratorial and judicial organs always try to shift their 
responsibility by saying that the "problems are thorny" and 
"most of them constitute a problem among the people." The 
deputy said: The problem lies in the government leaders. When 
the question was raised by the deputy, the delegation party 
committee called for seeking unity of thinking and not raising 
the issue. But some deputies asked the party committee: What 
is the motive behind that? 
<H5>  Inner Mongolia Requests the Preferential Policies of a </H5>
Special Economic Zone 
  A deputy from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region submitted 
a motion asking the central leadership to ratify Inner 
Mongolia's request to enjoy preferential policies similar to the 
Hainan Special Economic Zone [SEZ] so that they can open the 
door to the Republic of Mongolia and Russia. Some deputies 
proposed that leaders of the autonomous region and prefecture 
governments should be composed of the local nationals. 
<H5>  Hainan Wants To Set Up Red Light Districts </H5>
  A Hainan deputy asked whether the government could make 
legislation, allowing Haikou and Sanya to set up red light 
districts, which would enable the two cities to become more like 
a capitalist society, enhance social order, and increase revenue. 
<H5>  Shandong Urges Separation of Party Leadership From </H5>
Government Administration 
  A Shandong deputy said: The people's congresses are the 
highest organs of state power. But they have actually become 
subsidiaries of the party committees and governments. This does 
not conform to the PRC Constitution. Party organizations should 
not meddle in government work. The functions of the party 
should be separated from those of the government and the party 
committee secretary and deputy secretaries must not concurrently 
take up the offices of government and the people's congress. 
<H5>  Hubei Wants To Embody the Authority and Dignity of the </H5>
"People's Congress" 
  A Hubei deputy said: To embody the authority and dignity of 
the people's congress, it is necessary to first establish the 
status and functions of the people's congress. The functions 
and powers of the people's deputies should be defined so that 
they are representative. The proportion of nonparty figures and 
mass representatives should account for over 35 percent, and 
gradually increase to over 55 percent, which can fully represent 
the people of all strata. Deputies from Hubei plan to jointly 
submit a motion with the Hunan deputies: To fully embody the 
authority and representativeness of the people's congress, we 
propose that the proportion of nonparty figures and mass 
representatives be set at over 35 percent, which will be raised 
to over 45 percent at the 14th NPC. 
<H5>  Anhui Deputies Want Veto Power and the Right To Remove </H5>
Officials 
  In light of the powers authorized by the constitution on 
people's deputies, a deputy from Anhui pointed out that people's 
deputies have the right to address the people's congress on 
examining and removing incompetent officials and even ministers, 
the premier, and the president. The standing committees of the 
people's congresses have the right to veto the decisions, 
policies, and personnel arrangements of the governments at all 
levels. However, the people's congresses at all levels are 
actually under the control of the relevant party committees. 
<H5>  Deputies From Three Northeast Provinces Demand War </H5>
Compensation From Japan 
  A total of 120 deputies from Liaoning, Jilin, and 
Heilongjiang submitted a joint motion: The Japanese authorities 
must openly apologize for the aggressive war launched against 
China and compensate for the losses incurred on the Chinese 
people. It is said that Hubei deputies also submitted a similar 
motion, demanding that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
apologize to the Chinese people during his visit to China. 
<H5>  Qiao Shi's "Three-Point Instruction" </H5>
  In the face of these motions, Qiao Shi made a three-point 
instruction at a meeting of chiefs of the delegations held on 13 
March: 
  First, the interim party committees and central groups of 
all 
delegations should offer guidance in light of the main theme of 
the NPC and CPPCC sessions and correct the deviations. 
  Second, regarding practices which exceed the limits during 
the session, persuade as much as possible and give full play to 
the key role of the central groups. 
  Third, the main theme should be stressed and unity of 
thinking and views should be sought at the party committee and 
central group meetings. Measures must be adopted to avoid 
unnecessary motions and bills, which might affect the session. 
  At the meeting, Li Ruihuan said: When someone has gone too 
far, you should step out and stress the main theme of the 
congress at all times. The party committees and central groups 
of all delegations must have their delegation well in hand and 
try to stop the bills and motions that overstep the bounds. 
  Qiao Shi summoned the chiefs of the delegations to a meeting 
on 16 March, where he urged them to keep to the main theme at 
the final stage of the session and to not let the problems which 
deviate from the main course affect the achievements attained at 
the session. Qiao Shi emphasized: Full play should be given to 
the role of the core of all delegations. 
  Obviously, the bills and motions submitted by the deputies 
to 
the congress reflect popular will to a certain extent. It is 
the public opinion taken from the lower to the top levels. 
Instead of accepting such public opinion, the CPC attacked the 
practice and tried by every means to strangle these "unexpected 
motions." Can this be interpreted as democracy? Conversely, 
they imposed their theme to the congress and to the people at 
the basic levels. Is this what they call Chinese-style 
socialist democracy? 
  At the NPC session, Qiao Shi gave a vivid lesson to the 
deputies, enabling them to clearly see through the so-called 
Chinese-style socialist democracy.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 18 (XINHUA) -- China's foreign 
exchange reserves in the central bank have increased since the 
beginning of this year, a top Chinese bank official said here 
today. 
  Zhu Xiaohua, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China 
and director of the State General Administration of Exchange 
Control, said that in general, the supply of foreign exchange 
has exceeded the demand. 
  At a ceremony to mark the opening of China's foreign 
exchange 
center in Shanghai, Zhu said that last year, the contracted 
foreign investment in the country amounted to 25 billion U.S. 
dollars, of which most would be transferred to China this year 
or next year. 
  He revealed that from April 1, the foreign exchange in the 
special account in the people bank of China reached about 40 
million U.S. dollars. 
  He said that once the demand for foreign exchange is higher 
than the supply, the foreign exchange in the special account of 
China's central bank will be used to make up the deficiency. 
  On the cause of the drastic increase of the foreign exchange 
reserve, he mentioned three factors: increase of in-float 
overseas capital, export value and income of tourist services.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- In the first three 
months of this year, China's economy has grown at a rate of 9 to 
10 percent. 
  Ye Zhen, spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau, giving 
this figure today, said that basically the economy had reached 
the expected goal of the government's macro control efforts. 
  Ye said at a press conference that in the first quarter the 
gross domestic product was 862 billion yuan, up 12.7 percent, in 
terms of constant prices, on the same period last year. 
  But the proportion of agriculture was usually fairly low in 
the first quarter, while that of industry was comparatively 
high. If this seasonal factor is taken into consideration, the 
present growth rate of the economy should be 9 to 10 percent. 
  He said that the comprehensive appraisal of the country's 
economy has shifted from the juncture of "red light" and "yellow 
light" to the present juncture of "yellow light" and "green 
light" -- meaning that the economy has cooled down to a proper 
condition. 
  The speeds of production, construction and sales, which had 
been increasing too fast, have begun to fall to some extent. 
  In the first quarter, the industrial increased value is 533 
billion yuan, an increase of 16 percent over the same period 
last year, with light industry increasing faster than heavy 
industry. Energy production increased steadily, and the coastal 
areas increased faster than inland areas. 
  Due to the slowing down of industrial production, the 
strained conditions of energy and raw materials supplies, as 
well as the "bottle-necks" in transport, have been alleviated to 
different degrees, Ye said. 
  He said that state-owned enterprises completed investments 
of 
81.5 billion yuan in fixed assets in the first quarter, up 36.2 
percent over the same period last year, but it is 34.5 percent 
lower than the growth rate of the same period last year. 
  By the end of March, the total volume of retail sales of 
social consumption goods was 352.2 billion yuan, up 25.2 percent 
on the same period last year. With the factor of price rises 
considered, the actual increase was 4.2 percent. 
  He said that in the present market, about 90 percent of the 
goods were enjoying balanced supply and demand, except some 
agricultural produce and by-products which are in short-supply. 
  With the country's economic development and the processing 
of 
wage reform in administrative departments and institutions, the 
income and living conditions of urban and rural residents have 
been constantly improved. 
  In the first quarter, the per capita monthly income for 
urban 
residents increased 35.5 percent over the same period last year, 
while the cash income of rural residents increased 31.1 percent. 
With the factor of price increases considered, the actual rises 
were 9.3 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively. 
  Ye said that at the moment there was no centralized, 
large-scale "hot spot" for consumption. As a result, many 
residents have been using their spare money to buy stocks, bonds 
or simply put it in the bank.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- The figures released 
today by the State Statistical Bureau show that China's economy 
continued to operate successfully in the first quarter of this 
year, with the country's GDP reaching 862 billion yuan. This 
represents an increase of 12.7 percent over the same period last 
year calculated in accordance with comparable prices. However, 
if adjustments for seasonal factors in the first quarter caused 
by the low ratio of agriculture and the high ratio of industry 
are made, and if the growth rate is converted into an annual 
rate, the current economic growth rate is between 9 and 10 
percent, the range sought after through the exercise of 
macroeconomic regulation and control. 
  According to an authoritative analysis and appraisal, while 
maintaining an appropriate growth rate, China's economy is 
approaching the target sought after through macroeconomic 
regulation and control. The economic operation indicator [ping 
fen zhi 6097 0433 0237] has shifted from the border line between 
the "green and yellow lights" at the end of 1992 to the border 
line between the "yellow and green lights" at present. Judging 
from the internal structure of the economy, production, 
construction, and marketing, which have been growing at an 
excessive rate, have slowed down somewhat. 
  The statistical data reveal that in industrial production, 
the added value of industry in the first quarter was 533 billion 
yuan, up 16 percent over the same period last year. Heavy 
industry increased 15.3 percent, and light industry rose by 16.8 
percent. Coastal areas in the east maintained their lead in 
growth rates. Because of the fall in industrial production, the 
strained situation in the supply of energy and raw and 
semifinished materials and in transportation was alleviated to 
varying degrees. In fixed asset investment, state-owned units 
invested 81.5 billion yuan in the first quarter, up 36.2 percent 
over the same period last year, but the growth rate is 34.5 
percentage points lower than the same period last year. Judging 
from the investment pattern: first, the growth of localized 
investment items has slightly declined, while centralized items 
maintained a quicker growth rate; second, transportation, 
postal, and telecommunications projects were strengthened; and 
third, as a result of efforts to streamline the real estate 
industry, the chaotic situation in which development zones, 
high-class villas, and vacation villages were recklessly 
undertaken has been checked. 
  According to the statistics, as a whole, market sales in the 
first quarter remained stable but declined slightly. The total 
sales of consumer goods amounted to 352.2 billion yuan, up 25.2 
percent over the same period last year -- or an actual increase 
of 4.2 percent after allowing for price rises, a growth rate 
lower than the average rate of a normal year by 3 to 4 percent 
points. At present, except for a few agricultural and sideline 
products whose supply is slightly short of demand, about 90 
percent of the other commodities remain in a condition in which 
supply and demand are basically balanced or supply surpasses 
demand. At the same time, along with the development of the 
rural and urban economy and the increase in the wages of the 
workers of administrative departments and institutions, the 
income and living conditions of the urban and rural population 
have improved. In the first quarter of this year, the average 
amount of per-capita income that city dwellers used for living 
expenses increased 35.5 percent over the same period last year 
and the average net cash income of the rural population rose by 
31.1 percent, an actual increase of 9.3 percent and 13.1 
percent, respectively, after allowing for price rises. 
  The operation of the economy shows that the reform of 
finance, taxation, banking, and foreign trade which the state 
introduced from the beginning of this year has advanced smoothly 
and that the economy is basically normal. Export growth has 
accelerated; the exchange rates have remained basically stable; 
there has been an increase in the balance of the nation's spot 
exchange; and more money has been withdrawn from circulation. 
In the first quarter of this year, loans granted by banks to 
support industrial and agricultural production and key state 
construction projects amounted to 35.1 billion yuan. New bank 
deposits totaled 207.2 billion yuan, of which 186.3 billion yuan 
are savings deposits by urban and rural residents. The currency 
issued prior to the Spring Festival was totally recovered from 
circulation by the end of March. Revenue income increased 
steadily, and expenditures were basically normal. In the first 
quarter, revenues rose by 21.4 percent, while expenditures 
increased 23.8 percent.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Jie: "Official Pledge on Currency for Foreign </F>
Ventures"] 
  [Text] A senior financial official yesterday assured 
overseas-funded ventures they will get enough hard currency 
under the new China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS). 
  For supply is outstripping demand on the country's foreign 
exchange swap market, said Zhu Xiaohua, vice-governor of the 
central People's Bank of China as he opened the centre from 
which the new system operates in Shanghai. 
  The country set up the national inter-bank exchange system 
early this month. But the swap market has been retained for now, 
so foreign-funded ventures can buy and sell hard currencies. 
  Zhu said the new system, a major part of China's foreign 
exchange reform, was intended to bring the yuan considerably 
closer to being a freely convertible currency. And it had got 
off to a smooth start. 
  However, he said, officials will work harder to improve the 
market's management and maintain a stable exchange rate. 
  Nearly 200 domestic and overseas financial institutions have 
become members of the system and the number keeps increasing, 
said reliable sources at CFETS. 
  The new centre is located on the Bund in Shanghai, the 
city's 
financial heart, and it provides services for inter-bank trading 
and the settlement of hard currencies. 
  The ultimate aim is for the new system to replace the 
country's five-year-old swap market, said Zhu. 
  And all domestic enterprises have been asked to do all their 
foreign exchange deals through authorized banks. 
  Zhu firmly dispelled concerns over the supply of foreign 
exchange for overseas-funded ventures, adding that the foreign 
exchange surplus will go into a special account at the central 
bank, which has grown to $40 million since the start of the 
month. 
  "The money will be put into the swap market if needed to 
keep 
the balance (between supply and demand)," he said. 
  Zhu said the surplus came mainly from the increased flow of 
capital particularly to the coast. 
  He said foreign banks might be allowed to sell foreign 
exchange after the market is properly bedded in. 
  However, their business range will depend on the country's 
regulations on foreign financial institutions, he added.

"Smooth Progress Made in First 100 Days of the Year of Reform -- 
Interview With Feng Bing, Deputy Secretary-General of the State 
Commission for Restructuring the Economic System"] 
  [Text] Beijing 9 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--The year 1994, a "year 
of reform" to Chinese officials, is a crucial one in which the 
reform of the market economic structure will be conducted in a 
comprehensive way. In the 100 days from 1 January to 10 April 
1994, how have things been going with the various reform 
measures newly presented? What are the social effects? Facing 
these questions, Feng Bing, deputy secretary-general of the 
State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System answered: 
"Generally, the implementing of various reform measures has 
been very smooth, and the assessment from top to grass roots is 
very high." 
  Feng Bing indicated that over the past 100 days, reform in 
the macroeconomic regulation and control system has been 
conducted, including finance, taxation, banking, foreign 
exchange, foreign trade, and planned investment. 
<H5>  Tax and Fiscal Reform Is in Period of Fine Tuning </H5>
  He said measures for tax and fiscal reform are basically in 
operating normally and in a period of fine tuning. From the 
angle of effects, internal financial revenue in the first 
quarter markedly increased. Taking January and February for 
example, internal financial revenue was 50.7 billion yuan, up by 
32.1 percent over the same period last year; financial 
expenditures were 49.15 billion yuan, up by 29.1 percent. 
Income was 1.55 billion yuan higher than expenditures. 
Conditions for the issuance of 12.92 billion yuan of national 
bonds were sound, and people were vying for their purchase. 
  In the course of reform, the phenomenon by which some 
localities and enterprises arbitrarily raised prices by taking 
advantage of taxation reform surfaced for a time. Aiming at 
this phenomenon, the State Planning Commission and Taxation 
Administration jointly published the "Circular on Banning Price 
Rises By Taking Advantage of Tax Reform," with the State 
Council's approval, while augmenting propaganda about and 
explanation of the new tax system and removing some people's 
misunderstanding of taxing price subsidies, thus enabling a 
prompt solution to the problem. 
<H5>  Sound Condition in Foreign Exchange Reform </H5>
  The main contents of reform in the banking structure this 
year are, namely, augmenting central bank's functions, and 
implementing separation of banking of a policy nature from 
commercial banking. Work in this arena is actively under way. 
As Feng Bing disclosed, at present the central bank is fast 
recovering banknotes from circulation, with 90 percent of the 
banknotes issued before the spring festival recovered, and the 
condition of monetary operation is sound. 
  Foreign exchange and foreign trade restructuring with the 
merger of the two-track exchange rates and implementation of the 
system of foreign exchange settlement and selling of foreign 
exchange as the main contents were originally a cause of anxiety 
because of many uncertain factors and greater risk. However, in 
the 100 days since the new structure was implemented, progress 
has been smooth, and conditions are better than expected. The 
only trouble came in foreign exchange coupons; because of 
insufficient consideration of the issue, some stores allowed a 
price hike of goods to be purchased with foreign exchange 
coupons exclusively. This resulted in a run on foreign exchange 
coupons and panic buying with them. Later, responsive measures 
were adopted, and the problem was promptly pacified. The market 
exchange rate has all along been kept at the comparatively 
rational level of 8.7 yuan against the dollar. Feng Bing 
believes that in view of the import-export situation and the 
revenue and expenditures in foreign exchange, it is entirely 
possible to stabilize the exchange rate at the present level 
through regulation of the foreign exchange market. 
  The planned investment structure is under reform according 
to 
the original plan. The "change from fund allotment to loans" is 
being converted to the "change from loans to investment." The 
train of thought of plural investment bodies has already been 
set, with major foundation work completed. However, it will 
take some time to shape the system. 
  Reform of the modern enterprise system has not yet spread on 
a wide scale as of today, and is still in an experimental phase, 
with 100 enterprises carefully selected for the experiment. The 
chief hurdles to enterprise transition to the modern enterprise 
system are, first, excessive social burdens; second, excessive 
overstaffing; and third, heavy debt burdens. Feng Bing believes 
the solution to those problems primarily calls for the 
enterprises' own efforts; however, support and help from 
governments at all levels are also indispensable. 
  Consumer Prices on the High Side Calls For Attention 
  The deputy secretary-general believes the smooth going of 
various reforms is based on stability, especially economic 
stability, namely being free of vicious inflation. 
  He said the price rise range in China in March was 30 
percent. The price level was on the high side, which calls for 
our attention. He denied that the price rise was related to 
reform in the macroeconomic regulation and control system, 
especially tax reform. He said that the general level of tax 
burden has remained unchanged and would not push prices up. It 
might lead to some readjustment in individual enterprises, but 
the effect on the general price level is insignificant. He 
stressed that inflation did not result from reform; on the 
contrary, reform of the macroeconomic regulation and control 
system is the most effective means to reduce inflation. 
  Feng Bing attributed the price rise to two major causes, 
first, expansion in the scope of investment in fixed assets. 
Last year, the general input was 110 billion yuan, up by 50 
percent from the previous year; this year, the input was 130 
billion yuan, up by 20 percent from last year. Too many 
projects broke ground last year; because they were behind 
schedule, they helped in expanding the investment in fixed 
assets this year; consequently, they became the direct cause for 
increased issuance of banknotes. And second was the expansion 
in consumption funds, which also resulted in pushing up prices. 
  Besides, the general price level has remained high; this 
condition is connected with the aftermath of price reform and 
price readjustments as well as price rises in farm produce. 
However, he believed that all this did not pose an absolute 
threat to consumer prices, because the aftermath of price 
readjustment almost ended by the end of last year. In addition, 
there was a good harvest in grain last year, with a 
comparatively ample supply of such farm and sideline produce as 
meat and eggs. 
  Based on the aforesaid facts, Feng Bing said that so long as 
a good job is done in resolving the excessive scope of 
investment in fixed assets and the expansion in consumption 
funds, in addition to maintaining steady growth in agricultural 
production and adopting measures to promptly ease social 
psychological pressures, vicious inflation will be avoided. 
  At the same time, if China can insure the down-to-earth 
implementation of reform measures in the course of operation 
without distortion, the prospects of various reforms in China 
will be very bright.

<F P=106> [By Geoffrey Crothall in Beijing] </F>
  [Text] Nearly half of all China's state-run enterprises 
lost money in the first quarter of this year, according to 
official figures released yesterday. A new accounting system 
adopted by the State Statistical Bureau to "more accurately 
reflect hidden losses" showed that 49.6 percent of the firms 
were operating in the red, with total losses in the first three 
months reaching 15.7 billion yuan (HK$13.94 billion). 
  The number of loss-making enterprises last year under the 
old 
accounting system was 33 percent. But the new tax system had 
resulted in many of the previously profitable enterprises now 
showing losses, said State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen. 
  Industrial production from the state sector only rose by 2.2 
percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last 
year, while overall industrial production increased by 16 
percent to 533 billion yuan. The poor economic performance of 
the state sector had led to a significant decline in profits and 
a dramatic increase in debt defaults, Mr Ye said. 
  Analysts said the new figures showed just how badly the 
state 
sector was suffering during the Government's attempts to 
institute market orientated reforms. A Western economic analyst 
said: "State run enterprises are clearly failing to keep up 
with the pace of economic reform. I think the Government will 
now be forced to slow down those reforms until the enterprises 
are better equipped to deal with the situation. "The 
fundamental problem remains the lack of any real social security 
system to take care of laid off workers and, until that is put 
in place, very little can be achieved." 
  Despite the dramatic slowdown of growth in the state sector, 
the economy as a whole continued to maintain the double digit 
growth of the previous two years. The gross domestic product 
for the first three months reached 862 billion yuan, a 12.7 
percent increase over the same period last year. 
  Mr Ye pointed out, however, that once seasonal factors such 
as the relatively high proportion industrial production to 
agricultural production were taken into account, actual growth 
could have already slowed down to the Government's target of 
about nine to 10 percent. 
  Inflation, however, remains a major headache for the 
Government, and Mr Ye said controlling price rises would be the 
primary responsibility for officials at all levels this year. 
The national retail price index rose by 20.1 percent in the 
first quarter, compared with the same period last year, while 
prices in the 35 major towns and cities increased by 24.6 
percent. 
  The highest level of inflation was recorded in Haikou the 
capital of Hainan Island, where prices shot up by 34 percent in 
the first quarter. Nanjing and Urumqi also recorded inflation 
of above 30 percent, while prices in Beijing and Shanghai 
increased by 24.1 percent and 23.3 percent respectively. 
  Urban inflation was primarily driven by rapid increases in 
the prices of daily necessities and as such local governments 
would conduct regular checks on the prices of food and services 
to en sure that inflation was kept at a tolerable level, Mr Ye 
said. 
  He was quick to point out, however, that both urban and 
rural 
incomes were increasing at a faster rate than inflation. The 
average monthly income of urban residents increased by 35.5 
percent in the first quarter, or 9.3 percent when inflation was 
taken into account, while rural income shot up by 31.1 percent 
in the first three months an increase of 13.1 percent in real 
terms. 
  This was the first time in three years that increases in 
rural income had outpaced urban income in real terms but Mr Ye 
said regional disparities in the level of income continued to 
increase. "Because of high price rises in the cities, 
particularly increases in food prices, a few low income 
households have been unable to make ends meet and are 
experiencing difficulties in their lives," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by XINHUA reporters Chen Yun (7115 5366), Tian </F>
Shubin (3944 5289 2430), and Zhang Juncheng (1728 0193 2052): 
"Profits and Losses as Viewed from Another Angle"] 
  [Excerpts] Beijing, 9 Mar (XINHUA) -- It seems that we 
will develop a fixed way of thinking about an economic problem 
if we keep discussing it for a long period of time. However, if 
we analyze the problem dialectically, it is not hard for us to 
discover that nothing is immutable. If we view a fact from 
another angle, we usually can come up with a new idea. 
  The new changes faced by deficit-incurring enterprises in 
China during the course of implementing "Regulations on 
Transforming the Operational Mechanisms of State-Owned 
Industrial Enterprises" are the best example of this truth. 
<H5>  Changes Among Those Which Usually Did Not Change -- Drastic </H5>
Decrease in the Losses Caused by Policies and Macro-Control 
  State-owned enterprises operating with losses have been a 
longstanding, difficult problem for the whole country. Meetings 
have been held and measures taken to deal with the problem every 
year for the last 10 years. However, the problem remains; it 
even became worse at one time. For instance, according to 
statistics compiled under new rules after the implementation of 
"General Rules for Enterprise Finance" and "Rules for Enterprise 
Accounting" in July 1993, the enterprises covered by the state 
budget which operated with losses in 1993 totalled 11,453 in 
number, 2,488 more than in 1992. They accounted for 31.8 
percent of the total, up 7.3 percentage points from the previous 
year; and the total amount of losses was 31.91 billion yuan, 7.2 
percent or 2.13 billion yuan more than 1992. 
  However, what has not changed is the fact that roughly one 
third of the enterprises incurred losses, and what has greatly 
changed is the cause of loss. While some enterprises have 
alleviated their deficit problem, other enterprises incur more 
serious losses. According to a 1991 survey conducted by Lu Dong, 
president of the China Industrial Economy Society, of 50 
deficit-incurring enterprises in Beijing, Shenyang and Tianjin, 
19.4 percent incurred losses due to policies, 47.8 percent were 
the result of macro-control, and 32.8 percent suffered losses 
due to poor enterprise management. According to a 1993 survey 
conducted by the technology and economy institute of the State 
Planning Commission and the former production management bureau 
of the State Economic and Trade Commission, of 2,586 
deficit-incurring enterprises in Shanghai, Shandong, Jilin and 
five other provinces and municipalities, only about 9 percent 
operated with losses due to policy or macro-control reasons, 
while 81.7 percent were the result of poor enterprise management. 
  Statistical figures by category show that China's central 
industries maintained a trend toward decreased losses in 1993, 
with a total annual decrease of 5.85 billion yuan in losses. 
The losses incurred by coal, petroleum and tobacco industries 
decreased by 17 percent, 54.4 percent, and 66.2 percent, 
respectively. While their losses were due to policy factors, 
the decrease in losses was mainly because the state readjusted 
prices in favor of them, reduced their tax burden, and let them 
retain more profits. The losses incurred by local industries 
showed a rising tendency in 1993. The local industrial 
enterprises which incurred losses in 1993 accounted for 31.5 
percent of the total, up 7.4 percentage points. Their total 
loss was 19.03 billion yuan, up 72.2 percent or 7.98 billion 
yuan from 1992. The increase in losses was due to local 
industries -- mostly textile, light, chemical, and 
machine-building industries -- being in a period of structural 
readjustment and change, subject to more uncertain factors. 
[passage omitted] 
  Geographically speaking, the ratio of deficit-incurring 
enterprises slightly decreased in Shandong and Tibet, while it 
increased to a varying degree in other provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities during the 1985-1992 period. In 
1993, however, of China's 35 provinces, autonomous regions, 
municipalities, and cities with provincial-level economic 
decision-making authority (excluding Tibet), the ratio of 
deficit-incurring enterprises decreased in Beijing, Dalian, 
Fujian, Xiamen, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, and Yunnan. 
  Another good trend is worth mentioning. Over the last two 
years, state-owned enterprises have shown a tendency toward 
increased profits. The profits earned in 1992 by the 
enterprises covered in the state budget increased by 32.1 
percent as compared with the previous year, and their profit 
from a 100-yuan sale increased by 14.1 percent, from 2.06 yuan 
to 2.35 yuan. In 1993, they maintained the tendency toward 
increased profits. This is inspiring. [passage omitted] 
  During our coverage, the plant directors and managers of 
many 
large and medium state-owned enterprises told the reporters: 
The diversified, changeable market demand contains 
opportunities for the revival of deficit-incurring enterprises. 
Large and medium state-owned enterprises have several decades 
of development experience and enjoy the advantages of 
specialized personnel, technology, and skilled workers, which 
village and town enterprises do not enjoy. In order to seize the 
opportunity, it is necessary to apply the new concepts of the 
market economy and assume a new vision of development and change 
in treating the advantages and disadvantages of state-owned 
enterprises. It is necessary to make changes to deal with the 
changing situation and to develop new supports for enterprises.

  [Text] Hefei, April 16 (XINHUA) -- An initial survey of a 
large-scale Sino-U.S. joint investigation of the impact of 
environment and occupations on people's health was recently 
concluded in East China's Anhui Province. 
  It has produced a large body of data for experts to process 
and analyze. 
  The survey was sponsored by the International Research 
Center 
of Environmental Epidemiology, an institution jointly founded by 
Anhui Medical Sciences University and the U.S. Harvard 
University. 
  The four-month initial survey began last August 1 among 
almost 60,000 residents near Anqing City. 
  Each survey form contained more than 2,300 items of 
information. It focused on two subjects: natural history of 
respiratory system diseases and the relations between pesticide 
pollution and disease. 
  Regular follow-up surveys will be carried out among the same 
group of people in the next 15 years and will occupy generations 
of experts to research and find solutions to problems.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jinwu (7115 6855 2976)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 April (XINHUA) -- China's Patent Law 
has traveled an extraordinary journey over past 10 years since 
its promulgation on 12 March 1984. Thanks to the hard work of 
the last 10 years, China has established a legal system for 
safeguarding the normal operation of the patent system, 
including patent authorization procedures, patent agencies, law 
enforcement and judicial systems, patent information services 
and automation systems, patent work administration, as well as 
propaganda, training, and research concerning patent work. Such 
a legal system has been continuously developed and gradually 
improved during the course of actual practice. 
  At today's discussion meeting marking the 10th anniversary 
of 
the Patent Law, Gao Lulin, director of the China Patent Office, 
said: Since the promulgation of the Patent Law, patent 
application cases have fairly increased over the years. There 
were only 14,000 patent application cases in 1985. But the 
number reached to more than 77,000 cases in 1993, an increase of 
more than 4 times over 1985. As of the end of February 1994, the 
China Patent Office has received more than 370,000 patent 
application cases, including 320,000 cases from Chinese 
applicants and 50,000 cases from foreign applicants. 
  Gao Lulin said: The promulgation and implementation of our 
Patent Law not only has created a favorable environment for the 
transfer of foreign countries' advanced technologies to China, 
but also facilitated our scientific research institutes and 
institutions of higher learning introducing their inventions to 
enterprises and to rural areas. As a result, the promotion of 
new technologies has been accelerated. Under the protection of 
the Patent Law, some of our inventions have been introduced 
successfully on the international market. Some foreign 
manufacturers have been licensed to use our patented inventions. 
For example, the Quming Company in Xian has consecutively 
established cooperative ties with French and Canadian 
counterparts by adopting their technologies and in return 
allowing them to become a partner of the joint venture. Three 
famous foreign companies, including DEC and IBM, have been 
licensed to use the "five strokes" Chinese-character computer 
input technology invented by Wang Yongmin. 
  Gao Lulin continued: The revised Patent Law has enhanced 
China's patent protection standards, which is now basically on a 
par with international standards. By setting high protection 
standards, China has become a member of the Patent Cooperation 
Treaty. Such a move has facilitated the ability of Chinese 
people to apply for patent rights in foreign countries and vice 
versa. It also means that China's patent authorization 
procedures and relevant administrative work have reached 
internationally recognized standards. Law enforcement and 
judicial work, which integrates the trials of people's courts 
with the management of patent administrations, have effectively 
protected the legal rights and interests of the owners and 
relevant parties regarding patent rights. Patent agencies and 
patent information service organizations have provided a large 
amount of service to the society. In addition, they have 
continuously developed during the course of actual practice. A 
national patent administration system, which is composed of the 
China Patent Office as well as patent administrative organs

  [Text] Tianjin, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Foreign investment 
totalling more than 10 billion U.S. dollars flowed last year 
into the area around Bohai Bay in eastern and northern China. 
  This area includes Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong and Shanxi 
Provinces and two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, where there are 
rich natural resources, good transport networks and sound 
industrial foundations. It has become the third most 
sought-after zone for foreign investors, behind the Zhujiang 
Delta in south China and the Chang Jiang River Delta in east 
China. 
  According to figures from the Tianjin-based information 
center for the area around Bohai Bay, more than 10,000 
foreign-funded enterprises were approved to be set up in the 
area last year. 
  At present, investors from Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
Singapore and Taiwan take this area as their first choice and 
some transnational corporations and international financial 
groups are also most interested in this area. 
  The Motorola Corp. of the United States will invest 200 
million U.S. dollars to build a mobile telecommunication 
equipment factory in Tianjin; the AST Company and the United 
Tech Corp. of the United States have also decided to increase 
their investment in Tianjin.

<F P=106> [By Quinton Chan] </F>
  [Text] At least four villagers are still being detained by 
the Guangdong Public Security Bureau (PSB) after a mass peasant 
protest ended in violence last weekend. Residents in Gangbei 
village said they had yet to be notified when the men would be 
released. They were arrested during the anti-corruption riot in 
which police fired more than 10 rounds of tear-gas. The men's 
families say the four are being held in the PSB office in 
Zengcheng, and that they have been seriously beaten and barred 
from seeing visitors. 
  The village, which is about 70 kilometres from Guangzhou, 
has 
returned to normal although undercover PSB officers are still 
stationed in the area and passing vehicles are checked. 
However, residents say the peace is superficial. PSB officers 
have systematically summoned villagers for questioning. Most 
residents are staying indoors, not daring to go out. "I am very 
scared," a villager said. 
  Officials in Shitan county, where the village is located, 
are 
investigating the case. "The county government is checking the 
account by the village committee and the result will be 
announced later. If any official is involved in corruption, we 
will handle it according to the law," an official notice in the 
village states. 
  The riot among the 3,000-strong crowd broke out over 
inadequate compensation for farms taken for urban development. 
Residents also accused village representatives of corruption, 
of taking compensation assigned to the area but not passing it 
on. They claim it dates back to the economic reforms which 
started in the early 1980s. "There are more than 200 hectares 
of farmland in the village, but since the start of economic 
reform, more than two- thirds of it has been taken by the 
government for urban development. "The government sells it to 
foreign investors, mainly Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen, 
but we have yet to receive any compensation," said villager Shan 
Fu. 
  Villagers' incomes have been sharply cut because of the land 
takeover. "Even worse, we still have to pay the agriculture tax 
of 500 yuan [about HK$444] every year," he said. The angry 
villager pointed to new Spanish-style houses: "The officials 
have taken our compensation and built these houses for 
themselves. It is very corrupt here." 
  The mounting discontent flared when villagers learned that 
only 800,000 yuan was left in the village's public account. 
"There should be millions of profit from the land sale. Where 
has the rest of the money gone?" angry villagers asked. The 
entire community gathered in the main street, waving banners 
bearing the words "anti-corruption". 
  Shortly afterwards dozens of PSB officers arrived and fired 
tear-gas to curb the protest. "It was just like a war, I was 
really scared. Tear-gas was everywhere," one eye witness said. 
  Shan Yuexin, whose son Sin Sanguang was arrested during the 
riots, said he was caught only because several Hong Kong 
reporters were in his restaurant when the protest broke out. 
"They pulled my son out of the restaurant and beat him up with 
a police stick, they were so cruel," he said. "They said my son 
had hidden Hong Kong reporters, but it was a fact the 
journalists were interviewing villagers in our restaurant." 
  There were three Hong Kong reporters in the establishment 
when the disturbance started, and it was reported the crowd 
prevented the police arresting the journalists. "I went to the 
PSB office but they didn't allow me to visit my son. I was told 
that he was beaten again," Mr Shan said. Another three young 
villagers, two of whom were brothers, were also detained. The 
brothers' mother burst into tears when she spoke to the Sunday 
Morning Post "I don't like to talk anymore, I am very scared. I 
am afraid they [the PSB] will give my sons trouble again," she 
said. 
  Village representatives deny the allegations. "We have 
invested the money in some enterprises and villagers can get 
their money back after they make a profit," said one, but who 
refused to give his name. Meanwhile, the peasants have been 
scraping together the little spare cash they have to help win 
the release of the four still detained, even though their 
families have not been notified of the conditions for their 
release. 
  In a bid to appease the angry villagers, the authorities 
also 
announced that every villager would get 200 yuan compensation 
for their loss of farmland. But residents said the amount was 
far from enough and added they were considering taking their 
case to the Guangdong provincial government. "It isn't even 
enough for us to live for a month," one said. 
  Newspapers and Guangzhou Television have reported the case 
without mentioning the riots, saying there was only some 
discontent among villagers. 
  Locals set up an anti-corruption movement last year after 
complaining of official graft concerning land compensation. 
This latest outburst over land and corruption is the fourth 
this month in Guangdong. A farmer of Baigang village, in 
Huiyang county, was shot in the leg on April I after scores of 
angry villagers clashed with PSB officers over land 
compensation. Three days later 200 Xinhua villagers protested 
to Huiyang county officials over the amount of compensation 
being offered to farmers. They also accused village 
representatives of corruption. And residents of Xiaqinwei 
village, in Danshui city, also complained of corruption among 
their village representatives. 
  But this may not be the end of the story. A Guangdong 
People's Congress delegate, Wang Zhutian, said he was worried 
such outbursts would continue if no settlement was made. He 
said the disturbances were mainly due to the misunderstanding 
between peasants and the government over land resumptions. Mr 
Wang added some corruption might be involved and the government 
should attack any malpractice. 
  An official in Guangdong Land Department, who refused to be 
named, said all land in the mainland was state-owned, and 
peasants only had the right of use. "When we sell the land to 
foreign investors we have to spend a lot of money on basic 
facilities in the area like road links, water and electricity 
supply," he said. "That is the reason for the big difference 
between the sale price of the land and the compensation to 
villagers." He said the provincial government was highly 
concerned about the cases, and was discussing ways of finding a 
solution.

  [Text] Shenzhen, 18 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The Radio 
and Television Bureau, the Public Security Bureau, and the State 
Security Bureau of Shenzhen City today held a news briefing on 
the management of satellite television program reception. As of 
today, Shenzhen City will rectify [zheng dun 2419 7319] ground 
reception equipment for television broadcasts, and no 
institution or individual is allowed to receive satellite 
television programs from outside the mainland without approval. 
  Responsible officials announced at the press briefing that, 
as of today, Shenzhen City had begun to strictly implement the 
"Regulations on the Management of Ground Reception Equipment for 
Satellite Television Broadcasts" and would rectify satellite 
television reception equipment. Units which are allowed to 
install such reception equipment must go through application and 
approval procedures with the radio and television department of 
the city government. Some units and individuals have ignored 
repeated orders and instructions from the state and have 
installed satellite television reception equipment without 
approval to receive programs broadcast from outside the 
mainland, and they did this under the pretext of the exceptions 
in the special economic zone. The officials demanded that units 
and individuals immediately stop producing, selling, importing, 
installing, and using satellite television reception facilities 
and warned that those units and individuals resisting and 
obstructing the authorities management according to the law will 
be seriously dealt with according to the relevant regulations

  [Excerpts] On 4 April in the regional people's government 
auditorium, the regional party committee and people's government 
jointly held a regional anti-corruption work conference to relay 
and implement the spirit of the third plenary session of the 
Central Discipline Inspection Committee and a recent 
anti-corruption work conference convened by the State Council, 
and to study and arrange for this year's anti-corruption work. 
  The conference was attended by regional party and government 
leaders, including Zhao Fulin [regional party committee 
secretary], Cheng Kejie [regional people's government chairman], 
Liu Mingzu [regional people's congress standing committee 
chairman], Ding Tingmo, Chen Huiguang [regional Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference committee chairman], Pei 
Guikang, Li Enchao, Yuan Zhengzhong, Ma Qingsheng, Yang Jichang, 
Huang Baoyao, Zhang Dunhao, Lu Bin, and He Xianglin. 
  Liu Mingzu, regional party committee deputy secretary, 
presided over the conference at which regional party committee 
Secretary Zhao Fulin, Cheng Kejie, regional party committee 
deputy secretary and people's government chairman, and Yuan 
Zhengzhong, regional party committee standing committee member 
and people's government vice chairman, spoke. 
  Secretary Zhao Fulin stated in his speech: Since the CPC 
Central Committee and the State Council made important 
arrangements for the on-going anti-corruption struggle in 1993, 
party committees and governments across the region have made 
unreserved efforts to fulfill the three anti-corruption tasks 
laid down by the CPC Central Committee, employed practical and 
feasible measures, and carried out work in a down-to-earth 
manner. Thanks to concerted efforts on the part of the broad 
masses of cadres and people, the region's anti- corruption 
struggle has scored some initial results. Those areas and units 
that have energetically carried out the on-going anti-corruption 
struggle have already achieved gratifying results in the 
first-stage struggle, thereby dealing a telling blow to all 
types of negative and corrupt phenomena across the region and 
basically fulfilling the first-stage tasks set by the central 
authorities and regional party committee. 
  Speaking of this year's anti-corruption struggle, Secretary 
Zhao Fulin noted: In order to effectively carry on the 
anti-corruption struggle this year, we should make redoubled 
efforts to ensure that all leading cadres at the provincial 
department section or county level across the region will 
honestly perform official duties and strictly observe party and 
government discipline. To this end, all provincial department 
sections and counties across the region should call meetings 
before the end of May to carry out self-examination and 
self-rectification among cadres in a democratic manner. 
Discipline inspection, supervision, and judicial organs at all 
levels across the region should also concentrate on 
investigating and handling major and serious cases, make 
continued efforts to vigorously investigate and handle law- and 
discipline-violation cases involving party, government, 
judicial, administrative, law enforcement, and economic 
management departments and cadres; make continued efforts to 
crack corruption cases involving leading cadres, law-enforcement 
and discipline-enforcement personnel, as well as legal persons, 
including embezzlement and bribery cases, cases in which cadres 
seek private gains by abusing power, and cases in which cadres 
seek unlawful privileges and gains by abusing law- and 
discipline-enforcement powers; conscientiously investigate and 
handle law-violation and discipline-violation cases concerning 
key projects construction, land lease, real estate development, 
and foreign economic and trade activities; make continued 
efforts to crack down on those malpractices that have caused 
strong resentment among the masses; and resolutely put an end to 
indiscriminate and unreasonable charges and fees. 
  Secretary Zhao Fulin also urged continued efforts to lighten 
burden on the part of peasants, disengage party and government 
organs from their own economic entities, resolutely ban party 
and government organs from doing business and running 
enterprises, and focus on the following seven aspects of work: 
  1. Continually conduct democratic activities within party 
and government organs at all levels. 
  2. Strengthen mass supervision and mobilize the masses to 
participate in the on-going anti-corruption struggle. 
  3. Continually increase transparency of party and government 
work, ensure mass supervision over party and government work, 
and carry out democratic appraisal of leaders. 
  4. Continually implement an organizational supervision 
system. 
  5. The discipline inspection and supervision organs at all 
levels across the region should step up supervision and 
examination and conscientiously implement a series of important 
policy decisions made by the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council to this end. 
  6. The people's congresses and their standing committees at 
all levels across the region should strengthen supervision over 
law- enforcement organs. 
  7. Vigorously push ahead with party style and clean 
government building. 
  Chairman Cheng Kejie stated in his speech: The year 1994 
is a crucial year for deepening reforms aimed at building a 
socialist market economic structure and speeding up economic 
development. Reform, development, and stability should promote 
and complement one another. Successfully combating corruption 
and building a clean government constitute an important 
guarantee of social stability. The leading cadres at all levels 
across the region should firmly adhere to such overall interests 
as grasping each and every excellent opportunity, deepening 
reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, maintaining 
stability, correctly handling relations between reform, 
development, and stability, never slackening efforts in 
furthering the on-going anti-corrruption struggle, making the 
on-going anti-corruption struggle more fruitful, and striving to 
bring about sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth across 
the region. 
  Chairman Cheng Kejie called in his speech for 
conscientiously 
carrying out the following five types of work: 
  1. Properly handle problems cropping up in the course of 
reforms. 
  2. Monitor and supervise market prices and improve market 
order. 
  3. Guarantee sufficient vegetables and non-staple food 
supplies. 
  4. Make sound livelihood arrangements for the masses and 
help people in disaster-stricken areas overcome difficulties. 
  5. Vigorously step up comprehensive social order management 
and provide reform, opening up, and economic construction with a 
sound social environment. [passage omitted] 
  In his speech, Vice Governor Yuan Zhengzhong called on party 
and government organs and leaders at all levels across the 
region to conscientiously implement and carry out regulations 
promulgated by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
of banning party and government organs from running enterprises 
and urged party and government leaders to make every possible 
endeavor to have all party and government organs across the 
region disengaged from their own economic entities before the 
end of June of this year. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Nanning, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's 
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has built various kinds of 
markets in the past few years, which have stimulated regional 
economic development. 
  As a commodity economy is taking the place of the planned 
economy, the construction of markets becomes inevitable and 
urgent. 
  By the end of 1993, the region had set up 2,593 consumer 
goods markets and 37 production material markets. 
  As to the financial reform, 50 bonds, stock, foreign 
currencies and insurance markets, and 198 securities 
organizations had been created by 1993. 
  Since trading in land and housing has become profitable, the 
real estate markets have grown fast. 
  Many labor and talents exchange and introduction markets, 
technology markets and information markets were also established 
in the region. 
  These markets have not only stimulated the economy but also 
brought convenience to local people.

  [Text] At the Tibet Autonomous Regional Conference on 
Propaganda and Ideological Work that opened on 18 April, Chen 
Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional CPC committee, stressed: 
Tibet's propaganda and ideological front must take Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics as its guide, and conscientiously uphold the 
party's basic line of one central task and two basic points in 
order to promote socialist modernization in Tibet. Meanwhile, 
we must safeguard political stability in Tibet, safeguard the 
unification of the motherland, and fight splittist forces in and 
outside of national borders. 
  Leaders of the regional CPC Committee who attended the 
regional Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work on 18 
April were Guo Jinlong, Basang, Danzim, Yang Chuantang, Lieque, 
and Puqung. 
  Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the regional CPC 
Committee, presided over the conference. He said that the 
guiding ideology and main tasks of this session are as follows: 
With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as the guide, implement in an all-around 
manner guidelines of the national conference on propaganda and 
ideology; analyze the current situation on the propaganda and 
ideological front in Tibet; and, in line with the one 
fundamental principle and four tasks as well as the actual 
conditions in Tibet, study and work out the main tasks regarding 
propaganda and ideological work in 1994 and thereafter. 
  Gyaincain Norbu said: It is hoped that this meeting will 
enable party leadership at all levels and comrades on the 
propaganda and ideological front to have a better understanding 
of the overall situation, unify their thinking, pluck up their 
spirits, and do solid work to open up a new situation in 
propaganda and ideological work in Tibet. It is essential to 
heighten our awareness of the importance of giving equal 
emphasis to both spiritual civilization and material progress, 
and the importance of ideological and propaganda work in 
guaranteeing the success of our cause; and to do a better job in 
mobilizing and inspiring the vast number of party members and 
the masses to constantly advance reform, opening up, and the 
modernization drive. 
  Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional CPC committee, 
delivered an important speech at the meeting on the region's 
propaganda and ideological work in the days to come. His speech 
focused on four points: 1. Gain a clear understanding of the 
situation and make persistent efforts in successfully executing 
propaganda and ideological work in Tibet with a clear head; 2. 
The basic tasks on the propaganda and ideological front; 3. 
Strengthen the ranks of propaganda and ideological cadres; and 
4. Party and government leading organs must display greater 
interest in propaganda and ideological work, and show greater 
care and support for cadres of propaganda and ideological 
departments. 
  First of all, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan analyzed the situation in 
China and in Tibet. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, China's economy has been growing and its 
political situation has become more and more stable since the 
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. As 
reform and opening up deepen, the political situation in Tibet, 
as elsewhere in China, has become increasingly stable and its 
economy is undergoing heartening changes. In economic terms, 
1993 was the best year ever in Tibet. With the generous support 
of the central government and other provinces and 
municipalities, Tibet's economic prospects have never been 
brighter or broader. Tibet's economy will undergo more profound 
and dynamic changes by the turn of the century. 
  Speaking of the basic tasks on the propaganda and 
ideological front in Tibet, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan said: As an 
important front in administering state affairs and ensuring 
national security, and as the mouthpiece of the party and state, 
propaganda work must adhere to the party's theory, line, and 
policies; in doing propaganda and ideological work, we must 
adherence to principle and address specific issues. We should 
dare to address -- not evade or get round to -- the principal 
contradictions. Propaganda and ideological work must also be 
oriented toward the broad masses of people in and outside the 
party, be effective in arousing the people's consciousness, 
reflect the fundamental interests of the people, and guide the 
masses to advance along the correct path. Propaganda and 
ideological departments must provide correct guidance through 
the media and remove all sorts of erroneous guidance for public 
opinion so the broad masses of people will have a common 
understanding and work enthusiastically toward our common goal. 
  Comrade Chen Kuiyuan pointed out: In implementing socialist 
modernization in Tibet, it is essential that -- in addition to 
the party and government who are leading the masses to 
concentrate on implementing the policy of reform and opening up 
and invigorating the economy -- propaganda and ideological 
departments vigorously promote Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics so people inside 
and outside the party and throughout the region will be able to 
better arm themselves with his theory. Propaganda and 
ideological departments must also conscientiously publicize 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's noted writings and statements on 
correctly handling issues related to nationalities. Only by 
acquiring a fuller understanding of the dissertations by Deng 
Xiaoping on this subject will we be able to correctly 
differentiate right from wrong on many issues concerning Tibet 
and to find the correct path to speed up development. 
  Chen Kuiyuan said: A major obstacle to socialist economic 
construction and the implementation of profound reforms in Tibet 
is leftist ideas and outmoded ways of thinking. By leftist 
ideas we mean sticking to an economic mode that is outdated, 
runs counter to the conditions in China, and stands in the way 
of the development of productive forces. After living and 
working for many years under this mode, we have got used to it 
and find it quite hard to free ourselves from its influence. 
Emancipation of the mind requires hard work over a long period 
of time. This is particularly true of Tibet, which is 
economically backward, has a closed market, and where contacts 
and exchanges with the outside world are few and far between. 
Emancipation of the mind therefore requires even greater 
efforts in Tibet. Only by studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics will 
we be able to solve this problem, conscientiously adhere to the 
policy of reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote 
economic development. 
  Chen Kuiyuan said: One salient feature of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics is the idea of paying attention to fostering 
both material progress and cultural and ideological progress, 
and maintaining social and political stability. In other words, 
political stability, economic development, material progress, 
and cultural and ideological progress are all essential 
requirements for building socialism. Only by attaching equal 
importance to both and being careful not to emphasize one and 
neglect the other can we live up to the requirements of Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the party's basic line. Our primary task is 
to build a modern socialist Tibet. Propaganda and ideological 
work must serve this main theme today and for quite some time to 
come. 
  After having fully affirmed the achievements scored by the 
propaganda and ideological front in the whole region, Chen 
Kuiyuan stressed: The contingent of propaganda and ideological 
personnel must further improve themselves. The contingent of 
propaganda personnel must be one that has indisputable political 
qualifications, perfect mastery of ideology, and very high 
combat effectiveness. Only when this contingent of ours is very 
steadfast can we successfully accomplish the historical mission 
we have undertaken. The contingent of propaganda personnel must 
pay close attention to its problems, must be good at giving full 
play to its strong points and at overcoming its shortcomings, 
must continuously enhance its level so as to enable the army of 
our propaganda personnel to stand in the forefront of the times, 
and must be good at guiding the masses to triumphantly advance 
along the course charted by the party. If we want to make this 
contingent of ours truly become the mouthpiece of the party and 
state as well as an important front army for the party to 
maintain contact with and educate the masses, we must be good at 
using the theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to eliminate leftist influence over us and 
leftist patterns of thought. Meanwhile, we must be good at 
using patriotism to refute splittism, and must continuously 
strengthen the building of the contingent of propaganda and 
ideological personnel ideologically and organizationally to make 
the contingent more steadfast in ideology, purer in 
organization, and more combat effective. We must improve the 
level of propaganda to meet the needs of the new situation; we 
must justly and forcefully propagandize unity among 
nationalities, the need for all fraternal nationalities to stick 
together and to depend on each other for survival, and the 
goodwill of mutual support; and we absolutely must not allow the 
speeches and activities aimed at sowing discord among 
nationalities, splitting the motherland, and disrupting its 
unification to spread unchecked. Disrupting unity among 
nationalities is equivalent to disrupting the unification of the 
motherland, and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the 
broad masses of the people in Tibet. We must resolutely crack 
down on the speeches and activities that disrupt unity among 
nationalities and the unification of the motherland; there is no 
room whatsoever for us to be vague on this matter. 
  Chen Kuiyuan called on party committees and governments in 
the whole region to show more concern for and give more support 
to the work of the propaganda and ideological front as well as 
the cadres, staff, and workers on the front, and to eliminate 
the phenomenon of taking a tough stand on one link while being 
softhearted on the other. He called on the principal leading 
cadres at all levels, in particular, to personally guide and 
constantly concern themselves with the propaganda work and to 
help propaganda departments solve difficulties actually 
confronted. He said: The propaganda work is a task that has a 
bearing on the overall situation. It constitutes an important, 
integral part of the party's strategic objective. Therefore, 
leading cadres at all levels must attach importance to and 
directly support the propaganda work. Only thus can we 
guarantee that we can do a better job in carrying out the 
propaganda work. 
  At the conference, Deputy Secretary Danzim of the Tibet 
Autonomous Regional Party Committee relayed the guidelines of 
the national work conference on propaganda and ideology. The 
conference held in the afternoon of 18 April relayed the 
speeches delivered by Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and Ding 
Guangen at the national work conference on propaganda and 
ideology. Among the leaders attending the regional work 
conference on propaganda and ideology were Puqung, Luosang 
Danzeng, and Zhou Wenbi. Secretaries and administrative 
commissioners in charge of propaganda work at prefectures and 
cities across the region; directors of the propaganda 
departments under prefectural and city party committees; 
chairmen of federations of literary and art circles at relevant 
prefectures and cities; secretaries of all county party 
committees in charge of propaganda and ideological work and 
directors of the propaganda departments under all county party 
committees; and persons in charge of the autonomous regional 
propaganda and ideological department, various regional-level 
bureaus, departments, commissions, and offices, and universities 
and colleges attended the conference.

<F P=106> [Report by station reporter (Xiao Yunhua); from the "News" </F>
program] 
  [Text] On the afternoon of 16 April, autonomous regional 
party and government leaders Gyaincain Norbu, Guo Jinlong, Yang 
Chuantang, and Yang Song arrived at the Lhasa Air Force command 
post. They called on Air Force officers and men in Tibet, and 
were accorded a warm welcome by the latter. 
  In a conference room, (Zhang Guanying), political commissar 
of the command post, briefed the autonomous regional leaders on 
the development of Air Force units in Tibet, their relations 
with local governments and the people, and their support for 
local construction. (Zhang Guanying) said: 
  [Begin (Zhang) recording] Respected chairman Gyaincain, 
respected secretary Guo, respected vice chairmen Yang, and 
respected secretary general Li, leaders and comrades, on the eve 
of the 1 May Labor Day, leading comrades of the autonomous 
regional party committee and government have managed to find the 
time to come and inspect the work of Air Force units in Tibet, 
and to visit us. This fully shows the deep concern of the 
autonomous regional party committee and government and the 
people of all nationalities in Tibet for Air Force units. It 
fully shows the close friendship between the armymen and people, 
and between the Tibetan Nationality and the Han Nationality. It 
also fully shows the two inseparable things pointed out by 
General Secretary Jiang during his inspection tour of Tibet 
[sentence as heard]. The leaders' visit here today is very 
inspiring and enlightening for us; we are very pleased. On this 
occasion, please allow me to speak on behalf of the party 
committee, headquarters, and more than 3,000 officers and men of 
the Air Force units in Tibet, to extend our warm welcome to the 
autonomous regional party and government leaders and to express 
our heartfelt thanks to them and the people of all nationalities 
in Tibet for their profound concern. [end recording] 
  Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional 
party committee and chairman of the autonomous region, said 
after hearing political commissar (Zhang Guanying's) briefing: 
  [Begin Gyaincain recording] Political Commissar Zhang, 
leaders of the Air Force command post, [word indistinct] and 
comrades, on the eve of the 1 May International Labor Day, 
deputy secretary Guo Jinlong of the autonomous regional party 
committee; vice chairman Yang Chuantang; secretary-general of 
the autonomous regional party committee (Li Liguo); vice 
chairman Yang Song, and myself are making this special trip to 
call on the officers and men of the air force command post. At 
the same time, we are here to thank you on behalf of the 
autonomous region's party committee, government, and more than 2 
million people. As Political Commissar Zhang has just 
mentioned, I think that in the three decades and more since the 
establishment of the Lhasa air force command post, the officers 
and men have indeed fully adhered to Comrade Xiaoping's thought 
on army building in the new period, and to General Secretary 
Jiang's 20-character instruction -- the PLA must be qualified 
politically and competent militarily, and it must have a fine 
workstyle, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of 
adequate logistical support. During these three decades and 
more, the air force command post has also been among the few top 
PLA units here which have excelled in the joint army-people 
campaign to build spiritual civilization, in army building, in 
logistical self-sufficiency of non-staple food and [word 
indistinct], and in implementation of the party's policies 
concerning nationalities and religions. The party and 
government are always (satisfied). [end recording] 
  Then, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu, accompanied by leaders of 
the 
Lhasa air force command post, visited the (Ganbala) radar 
station, called on the officers and men there, and inquired 
about their work, study, and everyday life. 
  Gyaincain zealously wrote an inscription for the radar 
station: Work hard, make selfless dedication, and keep the 
(Ganbala) spirit eternal.

men of the Air Force's radar station at (Ganbala) on 16 April 
and heard briefings given by station instructor (Cao Hong.) 
They were very excited when they learned that officers and men 
at the station have been working hard with unselfish dedication 
in a restricted forest area 5,374 meters above sea level for the 
past 29 years, have safely guided over 220,000 flights by 
various types of aircraft, and thus have been awarded the 
"(Ganbala) Model Radar Company" by the Air Force Party 
Committee. Gyaincain Norbu said: The spirit of (Ganbala) means 
the spirit of sacrifice and dedication. It is not only that the 
forces should carry forward the (Ganbala) spirit, but also Tibet 
itself. We should vigorously publicize this spirit and develop 
Tibet well. Later, Comrade Gyaincain Norbu and others visited 
the honors room and watched training demonstrations by the 
officers and men. They also inspected the dorms, kitchens, and 
vegetable gardens one after another.

<F P=106> [Report by Wu Hao (0124 4110)] </F>
  [Text] Lhasa, 18 Mar (XINHUA) -- The Tibetan Autonomous 
Regional People's Congress Standing Committee recently adopted 
"Procedures for Implementing the Law of People's Republic of 
China on Compulsory Education." With this, Tibet has embarked 
on the road of administering education according to law. 
  Tibet has made great strides in elementary education since 
its peaceful liberation. The school-age children's enrollment 
or attendance rate at the end of 1993 was 63.2 percent as 
against 2 percent before liberation; the illiteracy rate among 
young and middle-aged people dropped from 95 to 44 percent. 
Tibet has 3,111 primary schools with a combined enrollment of 
213,777 and 71 regular secondary schools with an enrollment of 
25,365. As primary education develops, an educational 
contingent composed mainly of Tibetan teachers has come into 
being and is growing continually. The number of teachers and 
other employees in Tibet's primary and secondary schools has 
risen to 12,869. Some cities and towns have, for the most part, 
attained the goal of universalizing primary education. 
  Tibet, which was backward to start with and was late in 
starting to develop education, still lags behinds other 
provinces and regions. To speed up educational development in 
Tibet, the recently adopted "procedures for implementing the law 
on compulsory education" sets forth the task of implementing 
nine-year compulsory education in stages in a well-planned 
manner. The "procedures" set the requirements, steps, and 
measures for implementing compulsory education in Tibet and 
provide guidelines regarding school age, school systems, 
funding, teachers' qualifications, administration, evaluation, 
and administrative and legal liabilities, thus making it 
possible for Tibet's educational undertakings to develop under 
legal protection. 
  Following the adoption of "procedures for implementing the 
law on compulsory education" by the regional people's congress, 
the regional people's government and educational administrative 
departments have also stepped up efforts in formulating rules 
and regulations for exercising macroadministration of education. 
A number of supplementary rules and regulations, including 
suggestions for implementing compulsory education in Tibet, 
regulations on decentralized administration in regard to primary 
education, regulations on the system of objective-based 
management for school years, and standards for schools of all 
categories at all levels will soon be promulgated for 
implementation.

<F P=106> ["Regional Procuratorial Organs Make New Progress in </F>
Fighting Corruption in the New Year"] 
  [Text] Tibet's procuratorial organs have made new progress 
in safeguarding political and social stability as well as in 
protecting and removing obstacles to reform, opening up to the 
outside world, and economic construction in the new year. 
  Last year, Tibet's procuratorial organs earnestly 
implemented 
the central authorities' guidelines on fighting corruption and 
concentrated on handling economic crimes such as embezzlement 
and bribery. The chief procurator personally organized and 
directed his personnel. He also participated in handling major 
and important cases. Anticorruption departments introduced a 
system of responsibility for the handling of cases and adopted 
flexible means for investigating economic crimes. To find clues 
for use in cases, procuratorial organs held press conferences, 
established boxes or telephones for people to offer information 
about crimes, and adopted various means to publicize laws. The 
procuratorial organs focused on handling criminal cases 
involving the working personnel of party and government organs, 
judicial organs, law-enforcement administrative departments, and 
economic administrative departments. According to statistics, in 
1993 the region's procuratorial organs received 408 clues on 
economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery and handled 77 
cases involving 83 people. Of these cases, 40 were major cases 
involving 42 people. Seven major criminal cases involved nine 
county and departmental-level cadres. The handling of these 
cases helped recover 4 million yuan for the state. In the 
process, a number offenders guilty of embezzlement and bribery 
were punished. This has heightened the prestige of the 
procuratorial organs in the minds of the people of all 
nationalities in Tibet. 
  The year 1994 is crucial for Tibet's reform, which has 
entered the period of package advancement and breakthroughs in 
key areas. To better serve reform, opening up to the outside 
world, and economic construction, the people's procuratorial 
organs, as always, will further concentrate on cracking down on 
economic crimes. A leader of the regional people's 
procuratorate said: This year, the region's procuratorial 
organs will continue to give priority to punishing people guilty 
of embezzlement and bribery, and will earnestly implement the 
principle of "handling cases strictly in accordance with law." 
Strictly enforcing laws is a precondition for cracking down on 
economic crimes. We must rectify the phenomenon characterized 
by failure to abide by the law and lax law enforcement, must 
deal accurate and relentless blows at criminals, and must ensure 
that procuratorial organs seriously carry out their functions. 
  At the same time, the leader stated: Efforts should be made 
in making new breakthroughs in handling major cases. All cases 
involving leading cadres at and above county and 
departmental-levels must be investigated and handled. Anyone 
who is involved in a crime must be thoroughly investigated. 
  He concluded: We must strengthen leadership over 
investigation and handling of major and important cases. The 
chief procurators must personally organize and direct his 
personnel, and personally participate in handling cases. We 
should learn from good experience in handling economic crimes, 
and supervise and provide better guidance to procuratorial 
organs at all levels. In 1994 we will achieve new victories in 
fighting corruption.

  [Text] Urumqi, 19 April (XINHUA) -- The Karamay oilfield in 
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has increased 
its crude oil production at an annual rate of 300,000 tons (2.1 
million barrels) since China opened to the outside world in 1979. 
  An oilfield official said that Karamay, in the northwestern 
part of the Jungar basin, pumped 7.6 million tons of oil in 1993 
and it has been rated as China's fourth-largest oil producer for 
four successive years. 
  Reform and opening up have made it possible for the oilfield 
to put an end to its stagnant production in the 1970s, he said. 
  Since 1979 Karamay has imported oil drilling and pumping 
equipment, computers, instruments, meters and 
ethylene-production technology from Belgium, Britain, France, 
Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, the official said. 
  Since 1980 it has co-operated with the General Geophysical 
Company of France, which has sent three seismic teams to make 
geophysical surveys in the Jungar basin. 
  Under a contract, technicians from a U.S. company have 
provided technical services to the oilfield, the official said. 
  To date, Karamay has used 800 million U.S. dollars in 
foreign 
funds to import technology and equipment, he said. These funds 
include loans from the World Bank and a Japanese bank.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Jin Yan (7246 1484)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 1 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Yunnan 
Province has achieved remarkable results in banning drug abuse 
and rehabilitating drug addicts. The total number of drug 
addicts in Yunnan dropped from 57,000 in 1990 to 40,000 last 
year. 
  Data provided by departments of the Ministry of Public 
Security show that Yunnan Province, which is near drug sources 
across the border, is one of the areas where drug abuse is most 
serious in China. In recent years, while carrying out 
well-planned investigation and sternly cracking down on drug 
criminals, Yunnan Province has done solid work to strengthen the 
banning of drug abuse and the rehabilitation of drug addicts. 
Growth in the number of new drug addicts has been curbed, and 
has dropped from 10,000 new drug addicts each year before 1990, 
to about 2,000 each year in the past three years. The 
percentage of new drug addicts among the total number of drug 
addicts has also dropped from about one-sixth in the past, to 
about one-twentieth at present. 
  Through experiments in banning drug abuse and rehabilitating 
drug addicts over the past 10 years, Yunnan Province has 
gradually formed an effective system for rehabilitating drug 
addicts which tallies with local conditions. Since 1990, Yunnan 
has helped over 20,000 drug addicts to rehabilitate themselves 
each year and has summed up and spread successful experience in 
preventing them from becoming drug addicts again. The rate of 
success in rehabilitating drug addicts is about 10 percent. 
  Over the past two years, governments at various levels in 
Yunnan Province have allocated more than 16 million yuan for 
building 28 permanent centers for rehabilitating drug addicts by 
compulsory means. The "Rules for Running Centers for 
Rehabilitating Drug Addicts by Compulsory Means in Yunnan 
Province" have also come into force.

  [Text] Beijing, 16 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--In recent 
years river channels inside and outside Beijing have suffered 
from human-made destruction and serious pollution. Therefore, 
some experts have time and again warned relevant departments and 
citizens that because there is a serious shortage of water 
resources and pollution is getting worse, many river channels on 
the outskirts of Beijing have silted up. 
  The River and Lake Management Section of the Beijing 
Municipal Water Resources Bureau revealed that former Beijing 
Mayor Chen Xitong personally inspected the Erdao channel in 
Jintailu last year. This channel was called a "present-day 
dragon beard ditch" [meaning the channel was full of residue]. 
He immediately instructed the relevant department to improve 
the situation. In a week the dregs were cleared but the channel 
stilted up again the following week. It was learned that the 
river water passing through this channel was for the Beijing No. 
1 Thermal Power Station to generate electricity. The silt in the 
channel caused by pollution threatened the normal operation of 
the power station. Once, the relevant department dredged up 
some tree branches, foam plastics, bicycles, three-wheeled 
carts, dead pigs, and dead dogs from a silted-up section of the 
channel. 
  Pollution similar to this is not rare in Beijing. Some 
experts said that apart from industrial pollution, the most 
threatening is human-made pollution. Most of the 175-km long 
river channels on the Beijing outskirts are clean in the upper 
portions, green in the middle, and black in the lower reaches. 
Protecting water resources, which are seriously in short 
supply, has become an urgent task for Beijing.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- An "electronics town" 
will rise in the northeastern part of Beijing, where most of the 
city's electronics industries are now located, in five years, 
official sources here said today. 
  The town will aim at upgrading old industries and old 
enterprises, the sources said. 
  In the locality, there are now 17 large and medium-sized 
state- owned enterprises, two large joint electronics ventures 
and several scientific institutes, employing a total 44,000 
people. 
  A survey of ten major electronics enterprises in the 
locality 
shows that they lost 313,000 yuan in 1992, while in 1988 they 
made profits totalling 29.84 million yuan. 
  According to a plan approved in March this year, enterprises 
in the locality will be transformed into joint ventures, 
shareholding companies and conglomerates, to help improve their 
management and market performance. 
  Besides electronics development and manufacture, the town 
will also house trading, banking, real estate, information and 
other industries. 
  According to the sources, the city government will extend 
special policies to support the new town. For example, the part 
of taxes from enterprises within the town that goes to the city 
coffers will be refunded to them as encouragement for technical 
upgrading. 
  By the year 2000, the authorities expect, the town will 
reach 
10 billion yuan in industrial sales and five billion yuan in 
trade and services a year.

  [Text] The Baotou-Lanzhou double-track rail laying project, 
a key project of the Ministry of Railways in the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan period, started construction a few days ago. 
  The Baotou-Lanzhou railway line is a key railway line 
linking 
northeast China with north China. The Baotou-Lanzhou 
single-track railway lines cannot meet the spiralling 
transportation needs resulting from the development of the 
national economy, and it is extremely urgent that the railway 
lines are expanded and rebuilt into double-track ones. 
According to the preliminary designs, the construction on the 
Baotou-Shiguai section begins first and will be built in stages. 
The first-phase project will be completed by the end of the 
Eighth Five-Year Plan period. Upon the completion of the 
first-phase project, the transportation capacity can increase to 
six pairs of passenger trains and its annual goods 
transportation volume will reach 28 million tonnes. Upon the 
completion of the entire double-track railway line project, the 
passenger train transportation capacity will add to eight pairs 
and the annual goods transportation volume will surpass 40 
million tonnes. The trains on these lines are drawn by 
internal-combustion engines so the driving equipment is 
automatically blocked.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Zhaocheng (1728 0340 2052): "Inner </F>
Mongolia Holds Meeting of Cadres of Regional-Level Organs at or 
Above Department and Bureau Levels"] 
  [Excerpts] On the afternoon of 1 April, the region held a 
meeting of cadres of regional-level organs at or above the 
department and bureau levels to relay the guidelines of the "two 
national sessions," the central rural work conference, and the 
national family planning work forum; and also set forth, 
according to the region's realities, specific opinions on 
implementing the guidelines. 
  Wang Qun, secretary of the regional party committee, chaired 
and addressed the meeting. Wu Liji, chairman of the regional 
government, made a report on relaying these guidelines. Present 
at the meeting were Wang Zhan, Wuyunqimuge, leaders of several 
regional-level leading bodies, and the veteran comrades who have 
been working in the region for a long period of time. 
  Comrade Wang Qun pointed out in his speech: Comrade Wu 
Liji's report on relaying the guidelines of the "two national 
sessions," the central rural work conference, and the national 
family planning work forum, as well as his opinions on the 
next-step work made according to the region's realities, are of 
extreme importance, are major issues relating to the overall 
situation, and are related to not only the current situation 
characterized by stability and unity, but also the region's 
long-term development; and embody the central 20-character 
policy of "grasping favorable opportunities, deepening reform, 
expanding the scale of opening up, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability." 
  Comrade Wang Qun said: The state has paid full attention to 
Inner Mongolia's development. We have reported to the central 
authorities on the economic development strategies of Inner 
Mongolia and our region's plan and projects. The state 
completely agreed to it. This embodies the central authorities' 
concern over and assistance to Inner Mongolia and the border 
areas inhabited by minority nationalities in northwest China. 
We may see that the state has shifted the focus of the economic 
development strategy on the western areas. Inner Mongolia has 
very good prospects for development. The reserve strength for 
our development is heartening. 
  Comrade Wang Qun emphatically pointed out after analyzing 
and 
introducing the current international situation: The central 
policy on reform, development, and stability stands for the 
strong aspirations and basic interests of the people of various 
nationalities. All of our work should be submitted to and serve 
this policy. We should unswervingly achieve the work in various 
aspects but never do things that are not conducive to the 
overall situation. Our region has this tradition and this kind 
of foundation and conditions. The current situation is very 
good. However, there are still many problems. The main factors 
affecting unity and stability are problems concerning prices of 
goods; wages; small, poor, and money-losing enterprises; 
enterprises whose production is completely or partially 
suspended; corruption; and social order. These are the problems 
that the broad masses of the cadres and the masses are concerned 
with. The party committees, governments, and leading cadres at 
various levels should pay high attention to and conscientiously 
solve these problems so as to make the people satisfied. We 
must understand that the problems we come across are ones 
cropping up in the course of advancement and development. For 
instance, we should try every possible means to solve the 
problems concerning wages. However, we should clearly 
understand the problems relating to our understanding. Some 
localities are unable to issue, according to schedule, 
sufficient amounts of wages. This is not caused by our economic 
situation but by various factors such as excessively increasing 
expenses and providing for a excessively large number of people. 
These problems are ones essentially cropping up in the course 
of reform and development. Through collective study, the 
regional party committee maintained that the wages can be issued 
if efforts are made to carry out the wage reform. We are 
confident of this. We are also going to extensively solicit 
opinions on this issue. I hope that all of you, including 
veteran comrades and democratic party comrades, will make 
opinions. By so doing will we be able to seek unity of thinking 
and work with one heart and soul to make development. In his 
speech, Comrade Wang Qun set forth his new ideas, methods, and 
specific opinions on enterprises' deficits, goods prices, 
opposition to corruption, and overall improvement of social 
order. He stressed that we should use new ideas and methods to 
solve the problems cropping up in the course of development and 
use the methods of expanding the dynamics of reform and opening 
up to solve these problems instead of adopting a wait-and-see 
attitude or blaming everyone and everything but ourselves. 
  He finally stressed the necessity to strengthen the 
leadership of the party, to seek unity of thinking, to be 
inspired with enthusiasm, to work with one heart and soul, to 
overcome difficulties, to ensure the smooth fulfillment of all 
tasks, and to ensure to make new achievements in reform, 
development, and stability. [passage omitted] 
  Present at the meeting were principal responsible comrades 
of 
all departments and units directly under the regional-level 
organs; the principal leading cadres of leagues, cities, 
departments, and bureaus who were participating in the 
theoretical study and discussion classes at the regional party 
school; and the students participating in the classes for the 
advanced studies of the cadres at league, city, department, and 
bureau levels.

  [Text] Provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang 
yesterday joined the Lanzhou City delegation and the Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Prefecture delegation in discussing pressing issues 
concerning the broad masses of people as well as ways and means 
of properly handling relations between reform, development, and 
stability. 
  After listening to speeches made by Guo Xianzhang, Tang 
Shenjun, and other Lanzhou delegates, Secretary Yan Haiwang 
said: Lanzhou is at once the only hinterland city of Gansu that 
is open to the outside world and is the capital of Gansu 
Province. Lanzhou's development has undoubtedly had an 
important bearing on the province's overall development. Thus, 
Lanzhou should make every possible endeavor to tap latent 
potential, develop local superiority, deepen reforms, further 
economic exploitation, and step up infrastructure construction, 
especially infrastructure facilities concerning the livelihood 
of the broad masses of the people, guarantee sufficient 
vegetables and grain supply on the market, and properly tackle 
other pressing issues as well. 
  After listening to speeches made by the Ningxia Hui 
Autonomous Prefecture delegates, Secretary Yan Haiwang stated: 
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture should strive to develop 
local commercial and circulation superiority, press ahead with 
economic growth in every way, and successfully build projects to 
assist poverty-stricken areas. Economic development and 
nationality solidarity are two crucial issues concerning the 
development of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, which 
should make redoubled efforts to enhance nationality solidarity, 
develop educational undertakings, and push ahead with economic 
growth. 
  Finally, Secretary Yan Haiwang emphatically called on the 
whole province to unit as one, work hard, brace up, make 
down-to-earth efforts, and push Gansu's economic growth to a new 
stage.

  [Text] Xining, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Large-scale highway 
construction has benefitted economic development in China's 
land-locked Qinghai Province. 
  Located on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in northwest China, 
Qinghai has 85 percent of its land at over 3,000 m above the sea 
level. In the past the local economy was greatly retarded by 
its backward transportation facilities. 
  With the help of the state, the province has worked out a 
development strategy based on the construction of more highways. 
  In recent years it has built and improved several trunk 
highway lines, including those from Xining to Zhangye, Qinghai 
to Xinjiang, Liuyuan to Golmud, Qinghai to Tibet and Wutongling 
to Henan county. 
  More than one billion yuan has been invested in highway 
construction to add over 2,000 km of road in the province since 
1985. 
  Between 1991 and 1993 the province built or improved over 
1,000 km of highways, and 21 big and medium-sized bridges. 
  Now, some 97 percent of the townships in Qinghai have access 
to highway transportation. 
  The total length of highways in the province is now 16,732 
km. 
  The highways help the province in commodity exchange, by 
carrying local products such as potash fertilizer, salt, 
asbestos, oil, ferrosilicon, meat, wool and leather to the 
outside, and bring in grain, vegetable, fruit and machinery.

  [Text] A contract-signing ceremony marking the network 
hookup of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' Cable 
Television Station and the Xinjiang Cable Station was held at 
the Xinjiang Television Station yesterday. 
  In accordance with the guiding spirit of the 12th order 
issued by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television that each 
region should have only one cable television network so as to 
avoid unnecessary investment, the two stations decided to 
cooperate in a new venture to promote cable television 
undertaking in Urumqi area. 
  The Xinjiang Cable Station was built in early 1993. It uses 
American technology and equipment which has a MMDS [preceding 
abbreviation in English; expansion unknown] multichannel 
microwave transmission system, with 22 channels. After one year 
of operation, the station now broadcasts its programs in Uygur, 
Chinese, and Kazak languages. It has more than 50,000 
subscribers. 
  The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps' Cable 
Television Station was built in 1992. It uses a high-quality 
450-M cable transmission system, with 47 channels. 
  The hookup provides Urumqi area with an air-and-underground 
transmission system, which helps improve both the content and 
quality of the programs. 
  Sha Ming, vice chairman of the autonomous regional committee 
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and 
director of the Department of Radio and Television under the 
autonomous regional government, spoke at the meeting. He said: 
Cable television stations are a component part of television 
undertaking, whose equipment is expensive to purchase and 
maintain. It is a new and effective way for the two stations to 
hookup their networks to avoid network overlapping and reduce 
cost. He expressed his hope that the two stations will work 
hard together to improve the cable television network in Urumqi 
area.

  [Text] A satellite television station operated by leaders 
of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] will begin 
broadcasting on 1 July. DPP national assembly member Hsu 
Pei-lung, general manager of the National Satellite Station, 
said programs to be broadcast through VHS channels for the 
fourth TV channel are yet to be released by the government this 
summer. The station was founded by DPP legislator Chang 
Chun-hung. Hsu said during the first stage the National 
Satellite Station will broadcast three to six hours per day. 
These programs will alternate in one of three languages, 
Mandarin, the Taiwanese dialect, or English. Hsu said the 
station will provide a clear alternative to the three other 
local TV stations with a different variety of programs. He did 
not elaborate. 
  The news came before the Government Information Office 
accepted the application for start of the fourth TV station in 
Taiwan.

  [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- The U.S.-based TRW Space 
and Electronics Group Monday [18 April] was awarded a contract 
to build the ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first satellite for scientific 
research and communications scheduled to be launched at the end 
of 1997. 
  The contract was signed by Hu Ching-Piao, vice chairman of 
the National Science Council (NSC) and Bruce Gerding, vice 
president of the civil and international systems division of TRW 
Space and Electronics Group. 
  The ROCSAT-1, carrying a price tag of NT$ [New Taiwan 
dollars] 1.6 billion (U.S.$59.26 million), is the first of a 
series of planned procurements for the development of Taiwan's 
space system capabilities, Hu said. 
  The NSC and TRW also agreed that the contract will become 
void if TRW fails to acquire an export license from the U.S. 
Government within 60 days, Hu said. 
  As technology acquisition is a predominant factor in 
international procurements, Hu said, a technology assistance 
agreement (TAA) is integral to the ROCSAT-1 contract. TAA's are 
necessary for the export of high technologies from the U.S. 
  Officials of the Redondo Beach, California-based TRW said 
they are confident they will receive the TAA in three to five 
weeks. 
  Once the TAA is secured, the NSC's national space program 
office will send 24 engineers to TRW to participate in the 
design, development, manufacture and testing of the satellite, a 
space program official said. 
  The NSC began the ROCSAT-1 procurement project in December 
1993. Four foreign companies, including France's Matra Marconi 
-- a group comprising French and Israeli aircraft industries -- 
Germany's Dornier, France's Alcatel, and TRW submitted bid 
proposals. 
  Under a NT$13.6 billion (U.S.$509 million) space program, 
Taiwan plans to have three satellites in orbit by 2006. 
  TRW, a leading space/defense contractor to the U.S. 
Government, has developed and launched 175 spacecraft and more 
than 500 scientific payload instruments in the past 35 years, 
according to TRW officials.

  [Text] Taipei, April 16 (CNA) -- Taiwan's crude steel 
production lagged behind South Korea's in 1993, the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Saturday [16 
April]. 
  However, Taiwan's steel consumption topped that of South 
Korea, CEPD officials noted. 
  The officials said South Korea was the world's sixth largest 
crude steel producer in 1993, with an output of more than 33 
million tons. Taiwan ranked 15th with 12 million tons, they 
said. 
  Both countries completed the establishment of state-run 
steel 
mills in the mid-1970s, they pointed out. 
  In terms of per capita crude steel consumption, Taiwan 
consumed an average of 916 kilograms in 1993, compared to South 
Korea's 643 kilograms, they said. 
  Moreover, they pointed out, South Korea exported 50 percent 
of its crude steel output, while the ratio in Taiwan was below 
10 percent. 
  They attributed Taiwan's strong demand for crude steel to 
the 
ongoing six-year national development plan.

<F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>
  [Text] The impact of the mainland's Chientao [Qiandao] 
Lake incident on cross-strait ties has continued to grow. 
According to a survey, more than 80 percent of Taiwan's people 
are dissatisfied with the Chinese Communists' ways of handling 
the case. However, nearly 40 percent of Taiwan's people believe 
that Taiwan Government and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] 
have failed in their performances. Most people advocate 
boycotts against the Chinese Communists. Because of this 
incident, people have considerably changed their attitude toward 
the "Taiwan independence" issue that has been sensitive all 
along. Please listen to a (Kang Yu-feng) report: 
  [Begin (Kang) recording] The mainland's Chientao Lake boat 
tragedy has posed major variables on the development of 
cross-strait ties. 
  The Gallup Poll Company conducted a survey of Taiwan's 
people 
who graded performances of the Chinese Communists, Taiwan 
Government, and the SEF in handling the case. The highest and 
lowest marks were 100 and zero, respectively, and 60 is the 
passing mark. The results showed that 83.9 percent of the 
people failed the Chinese Communists, including 56.6 percent 
giving them a zero mark; that 38.6 percent and 34.7 percent of 
the people failed Taiwan Government and the SEF respectively; 
and that 74.2 percent believed the Chinese Communists are 
hostile toward Taiwan. Consequently, to express our 
dissatisfaction toward the Chinese Communists, quite a high 
proportion of the people have advocated boycotts, including a 
total stop to sightseeing, visiting relatives, investing, and 
trading on the mainland, and cutting off contacts and talks 
between the SEF and the Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. 
  Taiwan University Political Science Department Professor Li 
Ya- ling specially urged the Chinese Communists to be alert to 
such reactions of Taiwan's people. 
  [Li] I personally believe the mainland's Chientao Lake 
incident was mishandled by the mainland bureaucrats. It was not 
in accordance with the government policy. Our survey will be a 
very good warning to the mainland. The handling of the 
cross-strait ties does not merely depend on high-level policies. 
Their bureaucrats' personalities can have very grave impact. 
  [(Kang]) According to the current survey, because of this 
incident, 27 percent, an unprecedentedly high proportion, of 
people -- in comparison to past years -- have favored the Taiwan 
independence issue that has been sensitive all along. 
  The National Chengchi University Political Science 
Department 
Professor Li Kuo-chung said if the Chinese Communists cannot 
properly handle the Chientao Lake incident, the cross-strait 
ties will gradually drift farther apart. 
  [Li Kuo-chung] Any single incident may [words indistinct] or 
influence cross-strait ties or even have an impact on Taiwan's 
people on their identifying with Taiwan's destiny; namely, 
Taiwan's independence. It is very probable that because of a 
single incident, such as the Chientao Lake incident, the 
proportion of Taiwan's people identifying with Taiwan's 
independence will rise remarkably. If the Chinese Communists 
cannot properly handle this incident, I believe the cross-strait 
ties may gradually drift farther apart. 
  [(Kang]) According to the survey, most Taiwan people thought 
that in the near future, the current conditions of cross-strait 
ties will remain unchanged. However, everyone is very unsure 
about the long-term future of the cross-strait ties. This is a 
point that really warrants our attention. 
  This is (Kang Yu-feng) reporting from Taipei. [end

  [Text] The Governor, Chris Patten, yesterday urged China 
to move rapidly to dispel public anxiety caused by the 12-year 
prison sentence imposed on reporter Xi Yang for "stealing state 
secrets". "I hope that Chinese officials understand why there is 
so much worry, not just about the way the case has been handled 
but about the sentence, for example, which has been handed down, 
which seems to most people in Hong Kong and beyond, I think, as 
wholly disproportionate to what we learn of the charges against 
the journalist in question," Patten said. 
  The British ambassador to Beijing, Sir Robin McLaren, 
arrived 
in Hong Kong yesterday for discussions with Patten about the 
jailed journalist, a Ming Pao reporter. Sir Robin said the 
British embassy would ask for more explicit information about 
Xi's case through diplomatic channels. 
  The Governor seemed pessimistic about how much help he could 
offer because Xi was a Chinese citizen. "There is one point, 
which you know, which distinguishes Xi Yang's case from that of 
one or two other journalists in the past," he said. "Xi Yang is 
a local (Hong Kong) resident and works for a Hong Kong newspaper 
but is a Chinese citizen, so there is a limit to what we are 
able to do under the normal international rules and regulations 
in pursuing his case. 
  "There are limits to what the British government can do. 
  "So, I very much hope the Chinese authorities will spell out 
very clearly what the rules and regulations which journalists, 
not least the journalists of Hong Kong newspapers, have to 
follow when they are covering events in China. 
  "These have been a very worrying few days and I hope, I hope 
from the bottom of my heart, that Chinese officials will move 
rapidly to remove people's anxieties because those anxieties are 
very, very real and very, very profound." 
  The chairman of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong 
Kong 
(FCC), Philip Bowring, yesterday expressed concern over Xi's 
case. He said the "secrets" for which Xi was jailed were 
"entirely unexceptional, being the normal stuff of discussion in 
market economies." "Even were Xi technically in breach of some 
ill-defined law, the sentence is excessive by any criteria. 
  "It is a reminder of politically motivated punishments 
handed 
out during previous periods such as the Cultural Revolution," he 
said. "The harsh sentence appears intended as a warning to the 
Hong Kong press not to report news or events in China other than 
that which has been approved or announced in official media. 
  "This has, we believe, already influenced reporting in Hong 
Kong on China and we fear self-censorship will spread to 
coverage of Hong Kong itself." 
  He said Xi's sentence would deter mainland Chinese from 
talking to foreign or Hong Kong reporters "even on mundane 
investment and economic matters which have no political 
significance". "This makes foreign correspondents doubly 
concerned for the safety of Chinese with whom they are in 
contact," he said. "Such penalties are designed not merely to 
choke off dissident news sources, but discourage ordinary 
Chinese, be they officials, factory managers or academics, from 
answering questions for information and basic data." 
  The FCC predicted a negative impact on local companies who 
analysed mainland companies listed in Hong Kong stock exchanges. 
"If journalists cannot report basic, timely information without 
fear of arbitrary use of draconian state secrecy laws, it is 
hard to imagine how, for example, managers and accountants can 
produce accurate reports and accounts for listed Chinese 
companies," Bowring said. 
  The Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL) 
has collected more than 20,000 signatures from the Hong Kong 
public on a petition protesting against Xi's sentence. The 
response from Beijing advisers on Hong Kong affairs has not been 
enthusiastic. Since the launch of the signature campaign last 
Wednesday [13 April], only two advisers, Vincent Cheng and Lee 
Kai-ming, have signed the petition. The Democratic Alliance for 
Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), which has 10 members who are also 
advisers for Beijing, said it would not participate in any other 
local activities protesting against Xi's treatment.

  [Text] About 1,200 demonstrators took to the streets 
yesterday to call for the immediate release of jailed Hong Kong 
journalist Xi Yang and protest against China tampering with the 
freedom of the press. 
  The protesters gathered at Chater Garden where they sang in 
support of press freedom in Hong Kong and chanted slogans 
backing Xi, whose appeal to the 12-year jail term was rejected 
on Friday. 
  In Beijing, Xi's father, Xi Linsheng expressed distress at 
the court's decision and asked that his son be placed in a jail 
close to the Chinese capital. 
  Speaking at his Beijing home, Mr Xi broke down in tears when 
he was asked about the future of his family. 
  He said he never had wild hopes about the appeal. "But I 
still feel distressed . . . It is a heavy blow (to me)," he 
said. 
  ''I try to calm down and not make my heart problem worse. 
  "I'll give my best efforts to help him (Xi Yang) to regain 
his freedom," Mr Xi said. 
  Yesterday's rally was organised by the "Operation for Saving 
Ming Pao Reporter, Xi Yang", a group representing more than 120 
organisations. 
  The marchers included legislators, journalists, 
pro-democracy 
activists, social workers and students. 
  They walked to the Xinhua (New China News Agency) office at 
Happy Valley, escorted by 185 police. 
  Chinese officials watched from the building as the crowd 
arrived at about 5 pm. 
  The police initially allowed the petitioners to sit only on 
the pavement outside the Queen Elizabeth Stadium and did not 
allow the protesters' truck, fitted with loudspeakers, to stop 
in the east- bound lane of Queen's Road East, opposite the 
Xinhua building. 
  After a short negotiation, the police sealed off two of the 
three east-bound lanes. 
  United Democrat legislator Szeto Wah said if a country did 
not have press freedom and an independent judiciary, everyone 
would be "walking towards a dark hell". 
  He also criticised the Chinese Government for saying no one 
should interfere with another nation's sovereignty and demanded 
the release of Xi. 
  He said sovereignty did not belong to a government which 
turned a deaf ear to the people. 
  Mr Szeto said "today's Xi Yang was tomorrow's Hong Kong 
people". 
  "We have to fight to the end for the release of Xi Yang, for 
freedom of press and for an independent judiciary in China," he 
said. 
  Daisy Li Yuet-wah, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists' 
Association, said Xi had become a scapegoat for the Chinese 
Government to give a warning to the already-fragile press 
freedom in Hong Kong. 
  Noting that journalists were prepared to face more pressure 
as 1997 approached, Ms Li said: "But we never expected that we 
would need to contend with the Chinese Government for the next 
12 years because of one Hong Kong reporter." 
  Dissident Lau Shan-ching, who was jailed in China for 10 
years for "counter-revolutionary activities", recalled his 
experience of being secretly arrested and tried in China. 
  He said he was questioned every night and the interrogators 
always tried to lead or force him to admit crimes he had never 
committed. 
  Mr Lau said he was given a so-called "open trial" but his 
parents were not allowed to attend. 
  "It was like a theatre where the Government arranges some 
people to come to the court room just to show that it was an 
open trial," he said. 
  Yesterday's rally ended at about 6 pm. 
  A candlelight vigil will be held on Saturday outside the 
Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. 
  Meanwhile, pro-China legislator Tam Yiu-chung yesterday 
responded with reservation to a proposal by United Democrat 
Yeung Sum that the Legislative Council should debate the Xi case. 
  Mr Tam said the incident was a matter for China's judiciary 
and there was a limit to what local legislators could do. 
  Mr Tam said: "If we are to have a motion related to the 
press freedom of Hong Kong in the future, fine. But there will 
be not much to debate on the Xi Yang case." 
  A delegate to the National People's Congress, Lee Lin-sang, 
said the Xi Yang case was closed and there was no need for the 
congress Standing Committee to set up a special committee to 
look into the issue. 
  Mr Lee reiterated that the case was an individual one with 
nothing to do with press freedom in Hong Kong.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Two Thousand Residents Take to the </F>
Streets Demanding That China Release Xi Yang"] 
  [Text] A "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang" organized by 123 
groups staged a demonstration yesterday. About 2,000 residents 
started from Chater Garden and marched to the Hong Kong Branch 
of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to lodge a protest and urge the 
Chinese authorities to release MING PAO reporter Xi Yang. This 
was the largest protest since the sentencing of Xi Yang. 
  The demonstrators first held a brief gathering in Chater 
Garden and set off at 1530. About 2,000 demonstrators, holding 
a dozen or so streamers and a large number of placards, chanted 
slogans like "Release Xi Yang," "Release Tian Ye," "Defend Press 
Freedom," and "Oppose Black Box Operations" along the way. With 
representatives of organizations and legislative councillors 
holding a large black steamer at the front of the procession, 
they set off from Chater Garden and marched to the Hong Kong 
Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY in Happy Valley through 
Queensway, Hennessy Road, and Percival Street. 
  The demonstrators included MING PAO staff members and 
workers, people from other press agencies, three-tier 
councillors, mass organization members, and residents. Along 
the way they chanted slogans and sang songs, including "We Shall 
Overcome" and "Unity," while at the same time distributing 
leaflets and asking onlookers to join. While they were 
marching, a large number of pedestrians stopped to watch and 
people in residential buildings stuck their heads out to look. 
Some pedestrians joined the demonstration to express their 
support. 
  The police made special traffic arrangements along the way 
so 
that the demonstrators could pass through. 
  The demonstrators sat down on the opposite side of the 
XINHUA 
NEWS AGENCY on Queen's Road East, where they held a gathering, 
during which four speakers spoke. Subsequently, a member of the 
joint action read out a statement. 
  In the statement, the "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang" 
demanded that the Chinese authorities immediately rescind all 
the charges against Xi Yang and Tian Ye and release them; it 
should announce all the details of the case and affix the 
responsibility for this; it should revise the relevant law and 
practice freedom of the press. 
  In her speech at the gathering, Li Yuet-wah, chairman of the 
Hong Kong Journalists' Association, said: As the 1997 power 
transfer is approaching, Hong Kong reporters will face heavier 
pressure and this is something to be expected, but unexpectedly, 
these reporters will have to carry out 12 years of combat for Xi 
Yang's sake. 
  She continued: The Xi Yang case has sounded the alarm for 
the prospects of Hong Kong's press freedom, but as long as Hong 
Kong residents and reporters work with one heart and one mind, 
there will still be hope for Hong Kong's press freedom. 
  MING PAO employees' representative Lam Man-chong said: The 
Xi Yang case is not an unfortunate matter for Xi Yang alone, nor 
is it only a concern of MING PAO employees, it is an important 
matter of how to maintain Hong Kong people's free lifestyle. 
  Legislative Councillor Szeto Wah and Lau Shan-ching, a pro- 
democracy activist who had been jailed for 10 years by China, 
also said at the gathering that China's secret trial of Xi Yang 
violated Chinese law, was unfair to Xi Yang, and affected Hong 
Kong's press freedom. 
  After the reading of the statement, more than a dozen mass 
representatives marched to gate of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY amid 
slogans and songs, and stuck the statement and a streamer on the 
gate. The gathering ended at 1800 and the 2,000 demonstrators 
peacefully dispersed. 
  Yeung Ying-wai, assistant police commander of the Wanchai 
District, indicated that the police had sent about 180 policemen 
to the scene to help open a route for the demonstrators, adding 
that the demonstration proceeded in good order. 
  The "Joint Action To Rescue Xi Yang" will hold a candle-lit 
night party in the Clock Tower square in Tsim Sha Tsui this 
coming Saturday for Xi Yang's release.

<F P=106> [By political editor Chip Tsao and Wing Kay Po] </F>
  [Text] Two of Hong Kong's main political parties, the 
United Democrats and Meeting Point, will merge into a new party 
named the Democratic Party in October. The move was announced 
by the leader of the United Democrats, Martin Lee, and the 
chairman of Meeting Point, Anthony Cheung. The new party will 
take up 17 directly- elected seats out of 18 in the Legislative 
Council and will become the party with the most seats. 
  In a move that unites the democratic forces of Hong Kong and 
appears to be a setback to China's united front tactic, Lee 
appealed to other democrats to join the new party. Lee hailed 
the merger as a historic milestone in Hong Kong's democratic 
development and warned China that the new party would be "too 
big" for China to "handle". "This is the time for Hong Kong 
people who want a bright future for Hong Kong to stand 
together," he said. "The new party will not be intimidated by 
threats from Beijing, (and) will take a stand on principles, 
including human rights, the rule of law and democracy." 
  Cheung said he would still convey the anxiety and concern of 
the Hong Kong people to China as a Hong Kong affairs adviser 
after the new party was launched. "I did not tell Beijing 
(about the impending merger) when they invited me to become a 
Hong Kong affairs adviser," Cheung said. "If the Chinese 
government hopes these Hong Kong affairs advisers appointed will 
channel Hong Kong people's opinions, then I do not see any 
reasons why my status as a Hong Kong affairs adviser will be 
affected by this move and why the Chinese government should 
dislike the new party." 
  Lee said that the intensity of the pressure coming from 
China 
was the reason why the two parties had decided to merge. "Those 
who often read newspapers will be left in no doubt that our 
pressure has been increasing and our room has been decreasing," 
Lee said. "Just listen to what the Chinese have been saying in 
recent years and look at things like the Xi Yang case." 
  Both leaders said that they had common ground on several 
issues and that they would bury the minor differences between 
the two sides to work for an open and democratic government for 
Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. They said they would 
work closely together in the elections. 
  Since the two parties will not formally merge until October, 
they will still field separate candidates to contest the 
district board elections to be held in September. Lee said he 
hoped that the new Democratic Party would win at least 14 seats 
in the 1995 Legislative Council election. Details of the merger 
will be discussed at a general meeting on May 15. 
  Federick Fung Kin-kee, chairman of the Association for 
Democracy and People's Livelihood, said his party would 
certainly consider joining the new Democratic Party as an option. 
  Selina Chow, of the Liberals, said she was not surprised by 
the move and this would not affect the Liberal Party's political 
course. "In the past they have been voting together and they 
have been politically very close. 
  "It is a natural development," Chow said. James Tien, 
another Liberal member, was less optimistic and said his party 
would have to reconsider its strategy in this year's district 
board elections. 
  "It is obvious now that the two parties will be fielding 
only 
one candidate in each district. 
  "This will give us a difficult time," Tien said. 
  Tsang Yok-shing, chairman of the pro-Chinese Democratic 
Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), said the new 
party "would not help to dilute the anti-communist image of the 
United Democrats".

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung, So Lai-Fun, and Fung Wai-Kong] </F>
  [Text] China made it clear last night that the merger of 
the United Democrats of Hong Kong and Meeting Point would not 
change its belief that core members of the United Democrats were 
subversive. Only hours after the two key liberal factions 
announced they would form the Democratic Party in October, 
mainland officials said that if the move was aimed at "mending 
the fence between China and core United Democrats members", the 
attempt was futile. The alliance, however, puts China in an 
awkward predicament because it has consistently frozen out the 
United Democrats while wooing other liberal factions to the 
cause of planning post-1997 Hong Kong. 
  Meeting Point chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung, who was 
enlisted by Beijing in the latest batch of Hong Kong affairs 
advisers, stood staunchly behind the merger yesterday, clasping 
hands with Martin Lee Chuming and Szeto Wah, the two United 
Democrats most distrusted by China. 
  Announcing the formation of the party, a move which 
apparently took Chinese officials by surprise, Mr Lee said the 
need for a strong and united liberal coalition was becoming more 
pressing as 1997 approached. "This is a time when we must not 
be intimidated by threats from Beijing. We must take a stand on 
principle, take a stand on human rights, the rule of law and the 
development of democracy," Mr Lee said. "We represent a very 
wide section of the community and if China tries to isolate us, 
China's really trying to isolate the people of Hong Kong," he 
said, noting that the new party would comprise at least 17 
legislators. 
  In its manifesto, read out by Mr Cheung, the new party 
declares that it supports Hong Kong's return to Chinese 
sovereignty in 1997 as an autonomous and capitalist Special 
Administrative Region of China. "We care for China, and, as 
part of the Chinese citizenry, we have the rights and 
obligations to participate in and comment on the affairs of 
China," the manifesto said. 
  Mr Lee said that although Meeting Point as a party and 
individuals in the United Democrats were members of the Hong 
Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in 
China, the group branded as subversive in the months after the 
Tiananmen Square massacre, the new party would not be joining it. 
  The plan, however, did not sway China's attitude towards the 
United Democrats, who were also leaders of the Alliance. "The 
behaviour of these people is self-contradictory," a Chinese 
official said. "They are, on one hand, saying there should be 
dialogue with us. But on the other hand, they said they have to 
overthrow the present government," he said repeating an 
allegation which Mr Lee and Mr Szeto had denied. 
  While stressing that they were surprised about the merger 
plan the officials said they needed to study the plan. 
"Although there has been some gossip about the merger for some 
time, it (the announcement) is news to me. We knew nothing 
about it," one official said. Another official in charge of 
Hong Kong affairs said he needed more information, such as the 
background of the merger and the party's future plan and 
platform. "There will not be room for dialogue if they do not 
abandon their stance towards China," he said. 
  Mr Lee described the merger which had been planned since 
January, as "a milestone in the history of the Hong Kong 
democratic movement". "From various policies and remarks from 
Beijing, including the recent Xi Yang incident, we find that the 
room for manoeuvring is getting smaller," Mr Lee said. "When we 
look ahead, particularly towards 1997, both the Meeting Point 
and the United Democrats feel there is a necessity for us to 
stand together." 
  The new party would not give up pursuing dialogue with China 
-- an objective that he said the United Democrats had failed to 
achieve. He dismissed the idea that the new party was intending 
to gain any advantage in seeking communication with Beijing by 
the incorporation of Mr Cheung. "Whatever we do, the ball still 
remains in the Chinese court," Mr Lee said. 
  Mr Cheung said he would be pleased to explain to China about 
the new party, and he would play a role in pursuing in this 
direction. He denied that the merger was aimed at countering the 
growing pro- China forces in the upcoming three-tier elections. 
"We do not intend to be confrontational to anybody. We believe 
that the public can exercise their free will to choose suitable 
representatives," he said. 
  Both he and Mr Lee pledged to welcome other democrats, 
whether they belonged to other parties or not, to join them. 
"Our doors are open and all those who share the same beliefs 
are welcome in the party," Mr Lee said. The party would 
approach a number of people to participate in formulating its 
structure and platform. Mr Cheung said the new party would not 
threaten the survival of other small democratic parties, such as 
the Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood. But he 
pointed out that it would be up to individual groups to assess 
their situation. 
  Extraordinary general meetings will be held separately on 
May 
15 to gauge members' view on the move and the timetable for 
dissolving existing parties. Both will continue to function 
until then and their legislators will hold joint meetings to 
streamline their differences on policies and their work in 
Legco. They will step up co-operation in the coming District 
Board elections though it was still undecided whether their 
candidates in the next elections would stand under the new name. 
  The parties have not always agreed and there were cases in 
which they voted differently. These included votes on the 
approval of the Chek Lap Kok airport site preparation contract, 
the Container Terminal No 9 project and China's Most Favoured 
Nation status. Mr Lee said past differences should be shelved 
and past decisions respected.

  [Text] Macao, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva arrived here today for a four-day 
official visit following his week-long visit to China's mainland 
from April 10 to 16. 
  The prime minister's entourage includes over 60 leading 
Portuguese businessmen. 
  On his arrival, Silva said that he has brought good news to 
Macao, which has become a symbol of the friendship between the 
two peoples of China and Portugal. 
  He said that during his visit to China's mainland, from the 
very beginning to the end, Macao was a very important topic in 
the talks he had with senior Chinese leaders. 
  The Portuguese Government has made great efforts to 
safeguard 
the prosperity and interest of Macao, so has the Chinese 
Government, he said. 
  The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, signed between the 
governments of China and Portugal in 1987, has been implemented 
conscientiously by the two sides through dialog and friendly 
cooperation, said the Portugese leader, stressing that such 
understanding is the most powerful guarantee of Macao's progress 
and development in the future. 
  During his stay in Macao, Silva will meet with Guo Dongpo, 
director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao Branch, preside over the 
opening ceremony of the Macao friendship bridge and visit the 
international airport site and other key projects here.

    [Editorial report] Lisbon RDP Antena 1 Radio Network in 
Portuguese at 1732 GMT on 17 April carries a 28-minute recording 
of an interview with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco Silva 
conducted in Macao earlier in the day by Teledifusao de Macao 
[TDM]. The interviewers are TDM's Mario Rui de Castro, Fatima 
Cid, and by an unidentified local journalist. 
  Asked to comment on criticism levelled at him by the weekly 
EXPRESSO and by the secretary of the Portuguese Episcopal 
Conference for not speaking about human rights during his visit 
to China, Cavaco Silva says: "Portugal, in terms of human 
rights, has the same stance as the remaining 11 European Union 
[EU] countries. There is no difference. In 1992 I had the 
opportunity to speak with the Chinese prime minister about this 
matter. And I did so once again in Beijing. It was very clear 
that Portugal has a different position, interpretation, emphasis 
-- as the Chinese say -- when it comes to human rights. I 
believe this matter should not be discussed in public because if 
it is, it will not be effective, therefore those who made such 
statements in Portugal regarding my visit did so through 
ignorance because they were not at the meeting and they do not 
know what I told the Chinese leaders." 
  In connection with this question, the prime minister goes 
on: 
"I would like to add that it was I, myself, personally, who in 
the last few days, almost in the last few hours, negotiated with 
the Chinese authorities the possibility of the church of Macao 
maintaining relations with religious organizations outside 
Macao. With a view to preserving, obviously, relations between 
the church of Macao and the Vatican." 
  The prime minister is then questioned about the matter of 
the 
nationality of the people of Macao. He says: "Those with 
Portuguese passports are Portuguese now and in the future. 
Portugal will not withdraw anyone's nationality. However I 
knew that there was some concern regarding the implementation of 
the Chinese nationality law in the future here in Macao and 
therefore I broached this subject with the Chinese authorities. 
The answer I was given by the Chinese leaders was that they do 
not intend to impose Chinese nationality on Macanese people of 
Portuguese descent." 
  When asked about the future of civil servants in Macao, 
Cavaco Silva says: "It is essential for Macao that its special 
characteristics and identity remain after 1999, that Macao's 
character goes beyond the end of the Portuguese administration. 
An important contribution to this can be made from those 
working in the public sector. Therefore I believe it is in 
Macao's interest, and I stress in Macao's interest, that the 
current civil servants remain so after 1999 and nothing should 
be done against this principle. It would be a terrible mistake 
for Macao and even for Portugal if we were to create the 
conditions for all the civil servants to leave Macao." 
  Later in the interview, Cavaco Silva speaks of the changes 
in 
China, saying: "I have noticed a significant change in China 
regarding the economy. I believe it is difficult to describe 
what is happening in China today. I said yesterday and I say it 
again, the whole country looks like a construction site, with a 
thirst for economic development and growth which I believe does 
not exist anywhere else in the world. It would be a mistake for 
Portugal and for the EU to ignore one of the largest world 
markets in the very near future." 
  He is then asked for his opinion on whether the British are 
defending the interests of Hong Kong in their dealings with 
China. Cavaco Silva replies: "I think it is not up to the 
Portuguese prime minister to comment on the Hong Kong transition 
process. I answer for the Macao transition process." 
  Returning to the subject of the Chinese economy, he says: 
"It appears to me that there is virtually total flexibility and 
economic openness. The Chinese authorities say this is the 
appropriate way to eliminate the poverty which still exists in 
China. I was amazed. It is difficult to imagine before coming 
here what is happening in the Chinese economy. I believe that 
China will be an economic power in the 21st century if the 
current rate of development is maintained. No one in the world 
will be able to ignore China. I have been saying for a long 
time that it would be a mistake for the western world, the EU, 
the United States to ignore a country with 1.2 billion people 
and which is fundamental for world stability and peace." 
  Asked to confirm that he advocates openness by the EU to 
China, Cavaco says that "all economic restrictions have 
disappeared, all financial restrictions. There are no 
restrictions on visits by prime ministers, so it does not make 
sense to maintain restrictions on visits by heads of state. I 
would describe this as hypocrisy by Europe, so let us put an end 
to it and let us fully normalize relations between the EU and 
China." 
  Cavaco Silva goes on to confirm that the Chinese authorities 
expressed the wish to have President Soares visit China. Later 
he confirms that the Chinese have acknowledged the importance of 
a Portuguese cultural presence, of the Portuguese language, in 
Macao. He adds that it was important for more Portuguese to 
speak Chinese, and he regrets the fact that so few people speak 
Portuguese in Macao. "I would like the inter-penetration of 
cultures to be more visible with regard to language -- with 
Chinese speaking Portuguese and Portuguese speaking Chinese." 
  Questioned about the Portuguese Government's commitment to 
joint ventures between Macao, Portugal, and China, Cavaco Silva 
says that although the government backs these, "the Portuguese 
Government cannot be too much of an umbrella for Portuguese 
businessmen. We want them to have initiative and innovation, 
and to take risks. But in this case we have decided to provide 
special help. In May another business delegation will visit 
China, Macao, and Guangzhou. Obviously, these will be private 
initiatives. The Portuguese Government is not going to lead 
businessmen by the hand -- they will have to act and show their 
ability. You have to struggle here -- it has not all been done, 
things have to be built. I hope they will not give up easily. 
It would be a mistake if, after the political welcome which was 
reflected onto the economic side, our businessmen do not insist 
on being present here in Macao, Guangzhou, Zhejiang, Shanghai, 
and Beijing." 
  He continues: "I have great confidence in the future, that 
is why I brought to Macao a message of confidence in the future, 
and this is what I asked the Chinese authorities to support. 
The message from Beijing to Macao was clearly one of confidence 
in the future." 
  Cavaco Silva then speaks of TAP-Air Portugal's plan to 
integrate Air Macao: "The government will help, things are 
going well. I cannot give details but I can say that the 
negotiations saw some progress in Beijing." When asked if Air 
Macao would have Portuguese investment, he says that "the signs 
point to that, but first we need to have the airport. I have 
not seen the airport so I don't want to talk about this yet." 
He goes on to say that he believes that the airport would be 
positive for Portugal because "it is the missing link to the 
outside world for Macao. Macao will gain autonomy and a special 
link with Europe and Portugal. That is why I said here in China 
that we want and offer Portugal as a platform for China's, and 
in particular Macao's, penetration in the EU." 
  Asked about the Portuguese economy, Cavaco Silva expresses 
his belief that a recovery is under way; he is confident that 
the inflation rate will stand at 5 percent, between 5 and 6 
percent. 
  The prime minister goes on to reiterate that Macao should 
come under the government's jurisdiction. "I think that more 
than ever the question of Macao is a foreign policy issue and as 
1999 draws near the foreign policy aspect tends to surface. It 
is more a question of negotiating with China about the future of 
Macao and about the Portuguese presence in Macao, than a 
question of resolving administrative matters." 
  In conclusion, he leaves a message for the Portuguese and 
Chinese who live in Macao. "My message is one of confidence in 
the future. I believe there are reasons -- especially after the 
talks in Beijing with the Chinese authorities and after 
observing the evolution in the implementation of the Joint 
Declaration during the last seven years -- I believe that are 
reasons to think that Macao will continue to enjoy stability, 
which is important, will continue to enjoy a strong economic 
growth, and will continue to enjoy progress."

  [Text] Macao, April 18 (XINHUA) -- The Portuguese 
Government is determined to make all-out efforts to guarantee 
the stability in Macao and the interests of local people. 
  The assurance was made by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal 
Cavaco Silva, who is here on a four-day visit, at a special 
meeting of the Macao Legislative Council here today. 
  "We expect that Macao can maintain social stability and 
development during the period from now on to the end of this 
century. We also expect the transfer of power in 1999 will be 
carried out in an atmosphere of stability and confidence," 
Cavaco Silva said. 
  He said that during his visit to Beijing before coming here, 
he had exchanged views with Chinese leaders, who showed deep 
concern with all things about macao and all matters relating to 
preparation for Macao's future. 
  Both China and Portugal have sensed the necessity to 
continue 
dialog and cooperation between them, the prime minister added. 
  He also praised Macao's speedy economic development since 
1987, under the environment of social stability, good public 
order and the facts that local residents' interests were 
guaranteed, he said. 
  "We are paving the way, in the light of the Sino-Portuguese 
Joint Declaration, for the smooth transfer of power in Macao at 
the end of this century. We are determined to do so in the next 
few years, for the purpose of guaranteeing greater social, 
economic and cultural development in Macao," the prime minister 
said at the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch" on interview with PRC Foreign Minister </F>
and Vice Premier Qian Qichen by unidentified TA KUNG PAO 
reporters in Beijing on 15 April 1993: "Qian Qichen Interviewed 
by Our Staff Reporters and Answers Their Questions"] 
  [Text] Beijing 15 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Hong Kong 
Issue 
  [TA KUNG PAO] Hong Kong residents are very concerned about 
the question of how Hong Kong's prosperity and stability can be 
ensured in the three years or so left before 1997. How will the 
Chinese Government urge the British side to implement its 
commitments made to Hong Kong as stipulated in the Joint 
Declaration? 
  [Qian] The "Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Question 
of Hong Kong" was an agreement signed by the heads of the two 
governments, and the British Government is obliged to strictly 
observe it; otherwise, it will lose its reputation for good 
faith in the world. The Chinese side is accelerating various 
preparations for restoring its sovereignty over Hong Kong. We 
will adhere to the principle of "one country, two systems," 
implement the Basic Law in accordance with the various 
principles stipulated in the "Sino- British Joint Declaration," 
and rely on the joint efforts of the broad Hong Kong 
compatriots. In this way, a stable transition and the long-term 
stability and prosperity of Hong Kong will certainly be insured. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] The Sino-British talks over the arrangements 
for the 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong have broken down. The 
British side's three-tier framework in Hong Kong will be 
terminated on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese side is starting to 
"build a new kitchen." Can we take it that a smooth hand over 
of government has become impossible? Will a stable transition 
be maintained? 
  [Qian] "To build a new kitchen" refers to the fact that a 
direct transition is impossible for the three-tier framework 
produced through the 1994/1995 elections unilaterally pushed by 
the British Hong Kong Government; inevitably, the special 
administrative region [SAR] will preside over elections for a 
new framework. The future elections will be conducted according 
to the Basic Law, with arrangements made by proceeding from the 
actual conditions in Hong Kong. To my mind, with the concerted 
efforts and cooperation in solidarity of the broad Hong Kong 
compatriots, we can be sure of a stable transition in Hong Kong. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] The British side has stated that should there 
be no cooperation in Hong Kong's constitutional system, the 
arrangements for the 1994/1995 elections, economic cooperation, 
and other aspects as was hoped for before. What attitude will 
the Chinese Government take regarding cooperation with the 
British side? 
  [Qian] We welcome the British side's expression of its hope 
for cooperation. If that can be achieved, Hong Kong residents 
will benefit. The key lies in the practical actions of the 
British side. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] Britain is playing the "international card" on 
the issue of Hong Kong. Some foreign forces covet Hong Kong, 
too. How should China handle the international relations of Hong 
Kong from now on? 
  [Qian] The issue of Hong Kong is a matter between the 
Chinese and British governments before 1 July 1997; after that 
date, it is entirely China's internal affair, and no other 
countries have any right to intervene whatsoever. Hong Kong, as 
a special administrative region of China, may develop economic 
and cultural exchanges and ties with foreign countries. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] Director Qian talked about restoring the 
integrated sovereignty of Hong Kong at a meeting of the 
Preliminary Work Committee [of the Preparatory Committee] of the 
Hong Kong SAR. How should we see this integrated sovereignty? 
  [Qian] In history, the British colonialists have always done 
their utmost to prolong the influence of their colonial rule 
when they withdraw. Since Hong Kong entered the second half of 
the transitional period, some of the words and actions of the 
British side show the unwillingness of some people in the 
British Government to withdraw from Hong Kong and that they have 
always wanted to create trouble. Deng Xiaoping has long 
foreseen this and he explicitly indicated that the issue of 
sovereignty is beyond discussion. China will recover Hong Kong 
in its entirety in 1997. To my understanding, the Hong Kong in 
its entirety referred to here is not just a geographical 
concept, but, more importantly, the concept of complete 
sovereignty. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] In his 1994 "Government Work Report," Premier 
Li Peng expressed the hope that the Preliminary Work Committee 
[PWC] of the Hong Kong SAR would unite Hong Kong compatriots of 
all walks of life on the most extensive scale. Nevertheless, 
there is just a communications office of the PWC with several 
staff in Hong Kong today. Could you please tell us, Director 
Qian, how will the PWC further unfold its work in Hong Kong from 
now on? 
  [Qian] In doing a good job of the work of the PWC, a very 
important point is to bring forward democracy, pool the wisdom 
of the masses, give play to the sense of responsibility and 
being the masters of the broad Hong Kong compatriots, and pool 
the wisdom and efforts of every one to make preparations for 
building the Hong Kong SAR. Presently, an increasing greater 
number of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong are 
concerned about the work of the PWC; they have offered many 
sound opinions or suggestions to the PWC through various 
channels from Hong Kong or by coming straight to Beijing. 
  The great responsibility of making preparations for the 
Chinese Government to recover the sovereignty of Hong Kong rest 
with the broad Hong Kong residents, but not just the scores of 
the PWC members or its secretariat or communications office in 
Hong Kong. The way of work of the PWC will further be improved. 
For example, some ad hoc groups are ready to call meetings in 
Hong Kong, while absorbing some professionals in Hong Kong to 
participate in special topic studies. The PWC will unfold 
consulting activities in Hong Kong to directly hear the opinions 
of various circles in Hong Kong. I believe that, with the 
concern and support of the broad Hong Kong compatriots, the PWC 
will live up to people's expectations in its work. 
<H5>  The Taiwan Issue </H5>
  [TA KUNG PAO] The Taiwan authorities want to expand 
"international space" and have unfolded "vacation diplomacy" not 
long ago. Presently, dialogue between Taiwan and Mainland China 
is stalled at a technical level, and there has been 
insignificant progress. What will the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs do to make the world see clearly that Taiwan is an 
inseparable part of China and will inevitably advance toward 
reunification with the China mainland? 
  [Qian] Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, 
which is universally acknowledged in the world community. The 
reunification of Taiwan and Mainland China is the wish of the 
Chinese people in their entirety, including the Taiwanese 
people, and is an irreversible historical trend. The Chinese 
Government has always adhered to the position of safeguarding 
the one-China principle, while resolutely opposing "two China's" 
or "one China, one Taiwan," a position that has won the respect 
and understanding of the overwhelming majority of countries in 
the world. Taiwan has economic ties with various places in the 
world and space for its activities; we do not contradict it in 
that arena. What we oppose is that the Taiwan authorities are 
sparing no efforts to create "two China's" and expand their 
so-called diplomatic "international space," and behavior which 
jeopardizes the motherland's reunification runs counter to the 
trend and is unpopular. 
<H5>  World Issues </H5>
  [TA KUNG PAO] The U.S. Clinton administration believes that 
there are other aspects of its cooperative relations with China 
aside from trade and the human rights issue. What is the 
Chinese Government considering to push forward its relations 
with the United States and to reduce trouble? 
  [Qian] China and the United States, as two powers in the 
world, bear a great responsibility in safeguarding peace and 
stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and the world, promoting 
global economic growth, and improving the environment of 
mankind. There are extensive common interests between China and 
the United States, as well as differences on some issues. 
These are objective facts. In handling those issues, the two 
sides should base themselves on the future and the world's 
overall situation. They should learn to establish relations of 
mutual benefit and mutual respect with countries with different 
social systems and ideologies, while refraining from focusing 
attention on disputed issues. In this way, trouble can be 
reduced and continuous progress made in Sino-U.S. relations. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] During the Cold War period, Europe was the 
focus of contention between the superpowers, and China supported 
the unification of Western Europe. Now, changes have taken 
place in East and West European relations and turmoil has 
surfaced in the Balkans. Will Foreign Minister Qian analyze the 
changes in the European situation under the international 
backdrop? 
  [Qian] The changes in the European situation have been the 
greatest with the end of the Cold War. However, Europe has not 
entered a period of peaceful development as expected. Many 
countries of the former USSR and East Europe have met 
difficulties in their economic conversion, and the political 
situation there is comparatively turbulent. Regional conflict 
has occurred in the former Yugoslavia, and has evolved into a 
hot war. Western Europe is suffering from economic recession, 
with unemployment rates remaining high. Some progress has been 
made in the unification of Europe, along with quite a few new 
problems. In short, the relatively stable post-war European 
situation has broken down, but a new pattern has not finally 
taken shape. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] Viewing the growing influence of Vladimir 
Zhirinovskiy, the Russian ultra-nationalist, the election of a 
right-wing alliance in Italy, and the expansion of German 
xenophobia, Europe seems to be beginning an adverse trend of 
discord. What is China's attitude toward this? How should one 
forecast and deal with this adverse trend? 
  [Qian] Various forces in post-Cold War Europe have 
disintegrated and are under reorganization, with some new 
political ideological trends and forces surfacing; that is a 
reflection of a complicated European political situation and 
people's resentment against reality. Only by building a new 
international political and economic order based on peaceful 
coexistence and doing away with the practice of hegemonism and 
power politics, will it be possible to do a good job of 
resolving the issue of peace and development while maintaining a 
stable situation. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] When Japanese Prime Minister Hosakawa visited 
China last month, the two countries established an understanding 
of striving to build bilateral relations characterized by 
"facing the future." A report said that the two countries were 
augmenting a Beijing-Tokyo axis which would help resist pressure 
from Washington. How will China deal with Sino-Japanese 
relations and their development from now on? 
  [Qian] Japan is an important neighbor of China, and the 
development of Sino-Japanese relations is a matter of course, 
but this does not aim at a third country, nor will it affect 
relationships with third countries. Basically, there is no axis 
relationship to speak of. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] Asians hope for a nuclear-free Korean 
peninsula, but actual conditions show that it will be 
comparatively difficult to remove such worries. With patience, 
do you think that this issue can be effectively resolved? 
  [Qian] To realize a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, and 
safeguard peace and stability on the peninsula as well as 
Northeast Asia falls in line with the basic interests of the 
northern and southern parts of the peninsula and the common 
aspiration of the countries in this region. Viewing progress in 
the past year, through dialogue and negotiations between all 
sides directly involved, progress has been made in efforts to 
resolve the Korean nuclear issue. True, some difficulties have 
surfaced today, but if all of the sides involved continue 
dialogue and talks within the original framework with a 
realistic and flexible attitude and patience, the issue will be 
resolved. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] Some national issues in Central Asia have 
roused universal concern in the world. Regarding this, with 
what attitude will China deal with its relations with those 
countries? 
  [Qian] Since the disintegration of the USSR, China has 
established direct ties with various countries in Central Asia. 
We are for developing good neighborly, friendly relations 
characterized by equality and mutual benefit with these 
countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence. We hope to see stability and economic growth in 
this region, with people working and living in contentment and 
peace, and all nationalities inhabiting this region coexisting 
in peace and harmony. As for their internal affairs, we have 
never intervened. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] South Africa will hold a general election 
soon; it is most likely that Mandela will be elected. What are 
China's predictions and preparations for the possibility of the 
emergence of the first black government in South Africa? When 
will the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between the 
two countries be placed on the agenda? 
  [Qian] Despite many difficulties and ups and downs, it is an 
irreversible trend that a general election will be held in South 
Africa with the emergence of a government of national unity. 
This signifies the end of racist rule in South Africa and the 
birth of a new South Africa of equality between all races. Like 
the rest of the world community, China expresses its heartfelt 
congratulations to the historic victory of the South African 
people. China has all along supported the South African people 
in their just struggle against apartheid, and it is only logical 
for China to develop friendly, cooperative relations with the 
new South Africa in a comprehensive way. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] Asia is a region which is enjoying the fastest 
economic growth. Countries like India and Vietnam have recently 
adopted a policy of opening up and reform and are actively 
absorbing foreign funds. How will China handle relations with 
these countries in cooperation and economic competition? 
  [Qian] Vietnam has scored results in pushing a policy of 
reform and opening up, India is exerting efforts in economic 
reform and development, and the economies of many developing 
countries in Asia have taken on a sound momentum of development. 
China is sincerely happy for them. The economic growth of 
developing countries in Asia has provided greater chances for 
cooperation between us. Of course, in international cooperation 
there is inevitably competition. So long as such competition is 
based on equality and mutual benefit, it will be helpful to 
promoting mutual cooperation and common development. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] A recent report said that pirates were 
plundering China's coastal waters, and some vessels outside the 
borders were victimized. Is this true? Could you please say 
something about it? 
  [Qian] Coastal areas are the gates of China's reform and 
opening up and bases of economic development, and maritime 
security is of the utmost importance to China. In recent years, 
maritime security conditions have worsened and the activities of 
international smuggling gangs are rampant in China's coastal 
areas, thus causing maritime criminal activities such as piracy; 
consequently, Chinese fishermen and vessels have been seriously 
victimized, as were vessels from other countries. The Chinese 
Government has conducted serious investigations of maritime 
incidents. On separate occasions last year, China negotiated 
with Japan and Russia on maritime security. With the joint 
efforts of all related departments, maritime security conditions 
have improved notably. Since mid-July last year, no more 
incidents endangering security have taken place in China's 
coastal areas. 
<H5>  China's Diplomacy </H5>
  [TA KUNG PAO] China's accomplishments in foreign affairs in 
recent years have been unanimously acknowledged in the world. 
Since the beginning of 1994, China's diplomatic arena has been 
increasingly active, with heads of governments from many 
countries in Asia, America, and Europe visiting China one after 
the other; China is playing an increasingly important role in 
world affairs. In its assessment of the outside world, China's 
diplomacy is as tough as it is soft. Could you please summarize 
China's successes in foreign affairs? What new concepts and 
designs does China have for the next step in foreign affairs? 
  [Qian] The continuous elevation of China's position in the 
world is attributable to two points: First, China enjoys 
political stability in its internal affairs and sustained, 
vigorous economic growth; and second, the success of China's 
pursuit of a peaceful foreign policy characterized by 
independence and taking the initiative in our own hands. In 
handling world issues, China adheres to principles, while being 
flexible and practical. Equality and mutual respect are pursued 
when China handles relations with other countries, while always 
observing the five principles of peaceful coexistence. China 
will promote world peace and development as always and will make 
its own contributions to building a just, rational, political 
and economic new world order. 
  [TA KUNG PAO] "The 21st century will be the Asian century," 
"the 21st century belongs to China." This is already an 
established saying in the world. How will China face the 21st 
Century in foreign affairs? 
  [Qian] In another five years or so, mankind will enter the 
21st century. We do not believe that the 21st century belongs 
to any region or country. Two world wars have taken place in 
the 20th century, and the Cold War lasted for almost half a 
century. China hopes that there will not be cold wars or hot 
wars in the 21st Century and that it will become a new century 
of peace and development. Nuclear weapons surfaced in the 20th 
Century: mankind is capable of manufacturing nuclear weapons and 
should be able to totally destroy them. China hopes that the 
21st century will become a new century free of nuclear weapons. 
The Chinese people are willing to welcome a new century of 
peace, stability, development and prosperity and to work hard 
together with the people of all countries.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Renfang (6392 0088 2455)] </F>
  [Text] Newark, 16 Apr (XINHUA) -- Song Jian, Chinese state 
councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and 
Technology Commission, met with Chinese scientists and 
technicians in the United States at the Marriott Hotel, Newark, 
New Jersey State, on 16 April. He briefed them on the progress 
of China's high-technology industry. 
  Addressing representatives from the Chinese Engineers 
Society 
of America [CESA] and the American Association of Chinese 
Scientists and Technicians [AACST], Song Jian said: In 
comparison to world standards, China's high-technology industry 
is still relatively backward. However, since China carried out 
reform and opening up, its high-technology industry has 
developed very rapidly. At present, China has established 52 
new and high-technology zones with 50,000 personnel working in 
more than 40,000 high-technology companies and enterprises. 
Therefore, overseas scholars are able to find partners for 
joint-ventures [he zuo dui xiang 0678 0155 1417 6272] in fields 
including agriculture, electric power, law, biomedicine, and 
intellectual property rights. 
  Song Jian arrived in New York on 14 April after attending 
the 
sixth session of the Sino-U.S. Science and Technology 
Cooperation Joint Committee in Washington. Hosting the 
reception for Song Jian today were the CESA and AACST which are 
two relatively large Chinese scientific and technological 
organizations in the United States. Their respective members 
mainly consist of scholars who came from both sides of the 
Taiwan Strait. 
  Attending the meeting were famous scientists Pan Wenyuan, 
Deng Wenzhong, and Wang Shaoguang, and Chinese Consul General in 
New York Zhang Weichao. At the end, Song Jian became the AACST 
honorary adviser upon request. 
  According to Zhang Ping, official of the Chinese Consulate 
General in New York, Song Jian also met with representatives 
from the New York Securities Stock Exchange Commission, the 
Morgan Company, and the Meilin [5019 2651] Company this morning. 
They discussed issues on integrating financial investments and 
new technology industry, and chances and formats of entering 
China's markets.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Five more members of 
the House of Representatives bolted the main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) today, bringing to 11 the number of LDP 
legislators who have quit the party in four days. 
  Meanwhile, three lower chamber members of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP), one of the seven 
ruling coalition partners, said they have left the party. 
  The five LDP defectors said they quit the single largest 
party to launch a new parliamentary group in an effort to 
reorganize the political structure in Japan. They are Koji 
Kakizawa, Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Taku Yamamoto and Shizuo 
Sato. 
  "We decided to quit to accelerate the current development by 
our action," Kakizawa told a press conference in Tokyo. 
  Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, also left the 
party today, saying he will join Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), the coalition's core party led by Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata. 
  Five other LDP Dietmen who defected the party Friday [15 
April] formed a new party today called the New Party Mirai 
(Future). 
  The three JNP members, Fumihiko Igarashi, Sakihito Ozawa and 
Akio Nakajima, handed their letters of resignation to Hosokawa, 
who is the JNP leader. 
  The three, who gained parliamentary seats for the first time 
in the 1993 general election, have expressed dissatisfaction 
with Hosokawa's approach to Shinseito. They told reporters that 
they feel an affinity with the New Party Sakigake (Harbinger), 
the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, 
the three coalition partners that abhor Shinseito co-leader 
Ichiro Ozawa.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Information from the 
State Statistics Bureau (SSB) showed that China's reforms in the 
fields of fiscal system, finance and foreign trade were 
proceeding smoothly in the first quarter of this year. 
  According to figures from the Customs Department, the 
country's export volume reached 19.1 billion U.S. dollars in 
the first quarter, up 18.7 percent on the same period last year. 
  The figure turned out to be 20.4 billion U.S. dollars for 
the import sector, which saw a rise of 18.2 percent. 
  Ye Zhen, spokesman for the SSB, told a press conference here 
today that China also enjoyed an increase in its foreign 
exchange reserve, and the market exchange rate remained stable. 
  According to him, the government's financial revenue (debt 
receipt was not included) was raised by 21.4 percent in the 
first three months, while financial expenditure (debt servicing 
was not included) registered a 23.8 percent growth. 
  Loans for working capital and fixed assets made up much of 
the 35.1 billion yuan-bank loans newly granted during the period. 
  At the same time, bank savings were raised to about 207.2 
billion yuan. 
  To sum up the whole situation of China's economy, Ye said 
that the main stem of the macro-economy was good, but prominent 
difficulties and problems still exist. 
  The prices in the country's urban and countryside markets 
remained on the rise. The retail sales prices jumped by 21 
percent over the same period last year. Prices of life 
necessities witnessed the highest rates of increase. 
  But Ye also said that as the government stipulated policies 
to restrict price rises, price soaring has obviously been slowed 
down since March. 
  In other aspects, production of the state industry was only 
increased by 2.2 percent. The state-owned enterprises were 
making less profits, more enterprises suffered from losses, many 
others were in arrears with loans or goods payments. 
  Ye noted that China's macro-economic control is at a 
critical 
period, adding that the economic growth rate was moderate, but 
tight control was still necessary for the rate of price rises. 
  He concluded that reforms in the next period should put 
equal 
emphasis on stabilizing prices and boosting economic growth.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Beijing's 
self-employed business operators turned over 280 million yuan in 
taxes in 1993, an increase of 90 percent over 1990, according to 
the Beijing Taxation Bureau. 
  The number of these operators was 224,000, an increase of 
68.4 percent over 1990. 
  Furthermore, an official from the bureau said, cases of tax 
evasion have declined drastically. 
  He attributed all this to improved tax regulations as well 
as 
the heightened awareness of the importance of paying taxes on 
the part of the public. 
  Statistics show that the income tax paid by individuals has 
increased by 58.2 percent since 1990 and hit 123 million yuan in 
1993. 
  The official said the main part of the individual income tax 
comes from highly paid Chinese employees of foreign-funded 
ventures. 
  The number of private enterprises increased to about 4,000 
in 
1993 from only eight in 1988, while the tax they turned over 
increased from about 100,000 yuan to 130 million yuan. 
  He admitted that tax returns from people in entertainment 
circles, contractors of construction enterprises and commodity 
brokers are far from satisfactory.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 18 (CNS) -- Swindling cases in 
foreign exchange swapping are now on the rise in Guangdong 
Province, arousing the concern of the local police. Statistics 
show that the provincial authorities have investigated 20 such 
cases involving over RMB [Renminbi] 100 million. 
  Swindlers included ethnic Chinese of foreign nationalities, 
Hong Kong businessmen, Mainland peasants and some elements of 
unknown identity. Some offenders under the pretext of being 
foreign businessmen usually take advantage of weakness shown by 
some enterprises which rush to make use of foreign exchange or 
to get foreign exchange swapped at a lower price. They win the 
confidence of entity and thereby commit fraud. 
  Traders say that offenders often draw bad cheques which in 
one case in Shaoguan last August amounted to RMB 4.94 million. 
Another illegal practice was employed in a case involving RMB 
10.75 million worth of money orders which were deliberately 
changed in an illegal way. Increasingly fraud cases committed 
in the process of swapping foreign exchange are attributed to 
several reasons. First, demand for foreign exchange has been 
great in recent years because of a sharp growth in the import of 
material, leading to a brisk foreign exchange swap market. Some 
profit-minded persons want to reap benefits from such a boom, 
resulting in swindling. 
  Second, awareness is weak in preventing business entities 
falling prey to such fraud, offering swindlers a good chance to 
capitalize on the carelessness shown by entities. A case of 
this kind involved the loss of RMB 15 million. 
  Third, the green light has been given to criminals by 
financial departments. Some banks act from self-interest and in 
violation of relevant regulations by easily giving out vast sums 
of cash without observing restrictions on the withdrawal of cash. 
  The Guangdong police hold that with further opening to the 
outside world, such swindling cases will increase and new tricks 
appear. The police have called for serious attention to be 
given by the various entities especially financial departments 
to prevent such crime and strengthen the awareness of 
prevention. Reporting to the police should be made immediately 
when fraud takes place.

  [Text] Guiyang, 19 April (XINHUA) -- China plans to carry 
out large-scale exploitation of the rich coal resources in 
southwest China's Guizhou Province in order to make it a stable 
energy supplier for the whole of south China and to relieve the 
pressure for transporting coal from north to south. 
  This is regarded as a major strategic readjustment of the 
country's energy supply distribution. 
  Coal still plays an important role in providing energy for 
China's heavy and chemical industries nationwide. 
  But almost three-quarters of the country's coal are produced 
by provinces and regions in northern China and the country has 
to ship large quantities of coal to the prosperous south and 
east China every year to meet its huge demand for energy. 
  This has seriously strained the country's transport 
capacity, 
while work in some factories in south and east China continues 
to be held up for lack of energy. 
  Large-scale exploitation of the rich coal resources in 
Guizhou seems to be the most realistic and effective way out, 
experts said. 
  Proven coal reserves in Guizhou, the well-known "sea of coal 
in southern China", hold the fifth position in the country, 
exceeding those of all the other provinces in southern China 
added together. 
  Improved transport facilities in Guizhou, especially the 
completion of several railway arteries linking the province with 
neighboring regions, has guaranteed smooth flow of coal. 
  Application of advanced technology in coal mining and 
comprehensive utilization of coal resources have promised even 
brighter prospects for this rising star. 
  For example, the anthracite with ash content lower than 10 
percent, in which Guizhou is extremely rich, used to be regarded 
as inappropriate for industrial use in China. 
  But new technology has proved that it not only can be used 
to 
generate electricity but also is an ideal fuel for the chemical 
industry. 
  Guizhou's coal enjoys another advantage: It causes less 
pollution to the environment because of low sulphur content. 
  Exploitation of coal resources in Guizhou will not only 
greatly alleviate shortage of coal supplies in southern China, 
thus reducing pressures on transport, but also lay a firm 
foundation for the take-off of Guizhou's economy. 
  China listed Guizhou as one of the major coal production 
centers since the 1960s and has earmarked altogether 3.2 billion 
yuan to the construction of modern mines during the past three 
decades. 
  Expansion and renovation of some small or medium-sized mines 
started during recent years, aiming to improve the coal 
production capacity of the province to 60 million tons by the 
year 2,000. 
  But inspecting officials from the State Planning Commission 
and the Ministry of Coal Industry hold the opinion that its 
developing strategy is still too conservative and the province's 
great potential has far from been fully tapped. 
  At present, the Guizhou provincial government is actively 
drawing up a blueprint with central government departments and 
hopes that both domestic and overseas investors will join in the 
exploitation of its rich resources.

the State Council, the Administration Committee of the Capital 
International Airport was set up here today. 
  The ceremony to mark the inauguration of the committee and

  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A task force of the 
ruling Kuomintang [KMT] Friday [15 April] completed a draft 
proposal on amendments to the Constitution, [word indistinct] 
the lay for several key changes in Taiwan's future political 
operations. 
  As expected, the task force has recommended that 
presidential 
elections be carried out by popular vote rather than by the vote 
of the National Assembly, as has been done in the past. It also 
recommended that the immunity from prosecution that legislators 
enjoy in speaking during legislative sessions be cut back. 
  The draft proposals were reached after 52 rounds of 
discussions among ranking party officials and legal scholars. 
  The KMT will formally introduce the changes at the coming 
session of the National Assembly after they are approved by the 
party's policy-making Central Standing Committee at a special 
meeting Monday. 
  Other key changes the ruling party will propose include 
electing a speaker and vice speaker at the National Assembly, 
extending the tenure of legislators from three years to four, 
adjusting the premier's right to co-sign laws promulgated and 
mandates issued by the president, and changing the official name 
of the "Shanpao" people to "aborigines."

<F P=106> [by Correspondent Li Zhigao] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Mrs. Elsie Tu, 
senior British national and now newly-appointed Hong Kong 
adviser to China, said her first priority concern is the 
peaceful transition of Hong Kong in 1997. 
  "I really believe most Hong Kong people, probably 90 percent 
at least, want 1997 to go through peacefully," said the 
81-year-old woman, who has served in the Urban Council for 31 
years and is concurrently member of the Legislative Council. 
  In a recent interview with XINHUA, Elsie Tu said, "Hong Kong 
people work very hard to build up the economy. If we have 
political disturbance, political instability, it will certainly 
and eventually affect the economy." 
  "In case it (political disturbance) affected economy, people 
would move business out of Hong Kong and people lose jobs. 
That's what the people are worried about," she added. 
  She said that she received both written and oral 
congratulations from local residents after she was appointed 
Hong Kong affairs adviser to the Chinese side earlier this month. 
  "Because the talks between China and Britain broke down, I 
think it's necessary for us to make some kind of bridges with 
China to have cooperation so as to understand each other's 
viewpoints," she said. 
  "If the government can't do it, let's the people do it. Then 
it's the people's idea not the government's idea," she said, 
adding "that's better than the views of Mr. Patten." 
  "One or two of the press said to me 'whether or not you 
compromise your position and make you support China'. I said, 
'Have you ever seen me compromise?'" 
  "It's not intended to be a honor (to be appointed as the 
adviser). It's responsibility," she said, adding "since the two 
governments cannot agree, it's up to us, the citizens, to try to 
find some ways of helping make the transition smooth," she said. 
  Mrs. Elsie Tu has lived in Hong Kong for 43 years since she 
came to Hong Kong in 1951. She has served as the supervisor and 
teacher of a local school, Mu Kuang English school, which she 
and her Chinese husband set up in 1954. "I understand the 
grassroots better than I understand the business," she said. 
  Her familiarility with fellow residents has been 
strengthened 
since she became a member of the Urban Council in 1963. For 31 
years, she has spent most of her time, at least twice a week, 
interviewing people, usually middle-and-low-pay workers. 
  "The only rest I get is Sunday evening when I go with my 
husband for dinner and that's my holiday," she smiled. 
  "Probably, apart from very well off people who don't need 
any 
help, I had probably some contacts with most families in Hong 
Kong," she said. 
  "That is the foundation that people trust me because I don't 
talk politics to them, I only talk about how to improve social 
conditions," she said. 
  Mrs. Tu is expected to go to Beijing to receive the adviser 
appointment next month. "As an adviser, I would like to explain 
China's attitude towards Hong Kong and Hong Kong's feelings to 
China," she said.

  [Text] United Nations, April 19 (XINHUA) -- China said 
today that international arms transfers should help ensure 
self-defense and not undermine peace and security. 
  Arms transfers should neither be used as pretext for 
interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states, 
affirmed Chinese Ambassador Hou Zhitong when addressing the UN 
Disarmament Commission. 
  The key to solving the problem of unrestricted arms 
transfers 
lay in the political will of a few countries which have the most 
advanced defense industries and most arms exports, he noted. 
  The international community should call on certain countries 
to stop their exports of large quantities of arms to other 
states for ulterior motives, stressed Hou. 
  He called on the world community to take immediate steps 
forcefully against the illicit arms transfers. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador also clarified his 
country's positions on some other issues concerning disarmament. 
  China supported efforts to conclude negotiations on the 
Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty by 1996, he said. The 
negotiations began earlier this year at the conference on 
disarmament in Geneva. 
  Hou reiterated that his country had undertaken not to 
threaten the use of, or to use, nuclear arms against 
non-nuclear-weapon state and it had also called on other 
nuclear-weapon states to do the same. 
  Hou expressed China's support to many developing countries 
in 
their demand that non-proliferation should not hinder 
international technological cooperation, much less be used as an 
excuse for blocking their acquisition and development of science 
and technology.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs and the 
UN peace-keeping forces today agreed on a temporary cease-fire 
in Gorazde, an eastern Bosnian town under intense gunfire over 
the past few days. 
  Bosnian Serb "parliament speaker" Momcilo Krajisnik and 
civil 
affairs chief of the UN forces in Bosnia Victor Andreev [names 
as received] signed a memorandum to the effect late today, which 
provides for a cease-fire around Gorazde and the deployment of 
some 100 UN Protection troops there. 
  Under the memorandum, "the Serb side agrees, as long as it 
is 
not being attacked, to cease fire immediately" within an area 
three kilometers away from downtown Gorazde on the left bank of 
the Drina river. 
  The UN protection forces will deploy in the truce area some 
100 soldiers, 41 medical personnel, 20 armored cars and 29 
non-military vehicles. 
  The UN forces and staff of other international groups will 
be 
able to carry out normal humanitarian aid in the area but any 
activities to be conducted out of the area must obtain advance 
Serb permission. 
  The temporary accord will remain effective until a permanent 
one is reached. 
  Earlier today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin urged the 
Serbs to put down their weapons while UN Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus- Ghali asked for the expansion of NATO air strikes 
on Serbs and the U.S. threatened to bomb Serb territory. 
  The U.S., reportedly ready to issue another ultimatum to 
Bosnian Serbs, warned that it would launch a preemptive and 
extensive air strike on Serb territory if Serbs continue their 
attacks or threaten the safety of any UN peace-keeping soldier. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington tonight that 
he would soon announce further pressure and operation plans 
against the Serbs. 
  NATO launched two air strikes on Serb positions around 
Gorazde last week to press for cease-fire, but the Serbs, 
undeterred by the bombings, retaliated furiously and entered the 
besieged town over the weekend.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Fighting Continues in Gorazde"] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said in Pale, Serb's stronghold in Bosnia, 
Tuesday [19 April] that Serbs "really want Gorazde to become a 
demilitarized region," blaming the fighting on a UN failure to 
disarm Muslim government troops. 
  At a press conference, Karadzic said the Serb attack was not 
aimed at taking the entire town, but just the south bank of the 
Drina river, "which has always belonged to us." The river 
divides Gorazde. 
  But reports reaching here said that Serbian forces shelled 
UN 
buildings in Gorazde Tuesday, showing no signs of honoring 
pledges to stop their attack on Gorazde, a Muslim enclave 
suffering one of the worst assaults in Bosnia's two-year war. 
  UN officials lost contact with aid workers and military 
observers in Gorazde late in the day when their building was hit 
by shells. 
  In Washington, President Bill Clinton met with his national 
security advisers to examine military and diplomatic options for 
dealing with the Serb defiance. 
  In Moscow, the Russian government, angered at the Serbs' 
broken promise to halt their attack on Gorazde, also announced 
it was shelving its longstanding bid to get UN sanctions against 
the Serbs lifted. 
  The developments were seen as a major break between Moscow 
and the Serbs, fellow Slavs with whom it shares historical and 
religious ties. 
  "The conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina is on the verge of 
dangerous escalation despite the energetic diplomatic efforts of 
Russia taken in conjunction with the United Nations and other 
members of the international community," President Boris Yeltsin 
said in a statement issued by his office Tuesday night. 
  "The Bosnian Serb leadership must fulfill its promises given 
to Russia, stop the attacks and pull back from the town of 
Gorazde," he said. 
  The Serbs attacked Gorazde just a day after Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said they had promised to halt their 
offensive. His assurances led NATO to cancel plans for new air 
strikes against the Serbs. 
  Russia has 1,300 soldiers serving in the UN force in former 
Yugoslavia and is eager to avoid direct confrontations with the 
Serbs. It sent 200 more paratroopers to the war-torn region on 
Tuesday to replace other Russian peacekeepers. 
  Serbs' SRNA News Agency reported Muslim-Serb fighting near 
Brcko, which is the narrow point of a corridor linking Bosnian 
Serb territories in the northwest and northeast. State radio in 
neighboring Croatia also said Serbs were reinforcing their 
forces near Brcko. 
  According to another report, on Sarajevo's southern fringe, 
as many as 150 Serb soldiers brushed aside 30 French 
peacekeepers at the Lukavica barracks and took back 18 
anti-aircraft guns they had surrended under a NATO threat of air 
strikes two months ago. 
  NATO officials responded cautiously Tuesday to a request 
from 
UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for broader authority 
to call in air power to protect the six UN-designated "safe 
areas" like Gorazde.

<F P=106> [Article by Zi Jian (4793 0494): "Sound of Air Raids in </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina `Safe Zones'"] 
  [Text] Two U.S. F-16 fighter planes dropped three bombs on 
the Serb armed forces at Gorazde, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, at 1620 
GMT on 10 April. This was the first time NATO had carried out 
air strikes against this region since the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
civil war broke out two years ago. 
  According to the U.S Pentagon, the air strikes were 
conducted 
at the request of 12 UN military observers stationed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Not long before this, these military 
observers submitted a request to Yasushi Akashi, UN special 
envoy to the former Yugoslavia, expressing the hope that 
protection would be provided for Gorazde so that it would not 
suffer from the Serbs' armed attacks. Yasushi Akashi 
immediately approved their request and gave the order to provide 
"strict air assistance." In addition, General Ross, commander 
of UN troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, disclosed that he had warned 
Serb military officers on three occasions not to continue their 
advance toward or shelling of Gorazde, but subsequently, a Serb 
tank opened fire on Gorazde, so Ross requested air strikes in 
the region. 
  Gorazde is an important city in Bosnia-Herzegovina and is 
also a place full of bloody clashes and dangers. It was an 
enclave of Bosnia-Herzegovina Muslims. In 1993, the UN Security 
Council declared Gorazde, Sarajevo, Bihac, Tuzla, Srebrenica, 
and Zepa to be six "safe zones," but these "safe zones" are not 
safe. 
  In the last two weeks, Gorazde has become even "hotter" 
because of Serb attacks against the city. Reports say that the 
Serb armed forces are advancing toward the city from the south 
and the north, while carrying out armed attacks. During this 
period, almost 100 people in the city have died in these 
attacks, and more than 400 have been wounded; many UN personnel 
in the city also are threatened, including relief personnel, 
military observers, and ground navigators for the air strikes. 
  The air strikes in the "safe zones" have temporarily stopped 
the shelling of Gorazde. At that time, UN Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, U.S. President Clinton, and the German 
Government commented on the air strikes. Butrus-Ghali's 
spokesman in Geneva said that Butrus-Ghali "did not hesitate at 
all" on the question of using air strength to protect Gorazde, 
nor did he hesitate on carrying out air strikes again to protect 
those UN "safe zones." Analysts pointed out that this indicated 
the secretary general's determination to protect these unsafe 
"safe zones." Outside the White House, Clinton said: "What we 
want to do is promote talks." The German Government hoped that 
in the course of promoting talks, air strikes would force the 
Serbs to withdraw their troops. 
  Since the promulgation of the "ultimatum" in early February 
and the downing of Serb planes, the current air strikes were 
another major military move by NATO. After the promulgation of 
the "ultimatum," the Bosnia-Herzegovina capital city of Sarajevo 
-- one of the "safe zones" -- remained comparatively calm. In 
its current air strikes, NATO possibly intended to expand the 
"Sarajevo formula," but the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war is long 
drawn-out, all sorts of conflicts are cropping up, and some 
regions are full of mountains and forests. The three bombs may 
have calmed the situation in Gorazde, but the path to peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina still remains long and tortuous.

  [Text] Washington, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The United States 
supports UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's proposal to 
broaden NATO authority to use air power in Bosnia and will press 
for stiffer sanctions on Serbia, U.S. officials said. 
  The new military and diplomatic initiatives will be 
presented 
to NATO allies for discussion this week in Brussels, the 
ASSOCIATED PRESS quoted a senior administration official as 
saying. 
  The decision was made after two sessions of meeting between 
President Bill Clinton and his foreign policy team, but no 
further details were released yet on the latest U.S. Bosnia 
policy. 
  Washington would also continue consulting with Russia and 
the 
United Nations on Bosnia, the official said. 
  Earlier today, when appearing on the MTV, Clinton said he 
welcomed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's statement urging the 
Bosnian Serbs to honor their cease-fire pledges but saw the 
Russian suggestion for an international conference on the crisis 
as premature though it "deserves serious consideration." 
  Without further elaboration, Clinton said he will announce a 
new U.S. policy on Bosnia very soon. 
  At the Pentagon, Spokesman Dennis Boxx said Clinton and his 
national security advisors discussed both military and 
non-military options on Bosnia. 
  Clinton's Special Envoy Charles Redman has returned from 
Bosnia to join the consultations in Washington. 
  Secretary of State Warren Christopher talked twice on Monday 
with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd over the phone and 
would call French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe today, State 
Department Spokesman Michael McCurry said.

  [Text] Paris, April 19 (XINHUA) -- French and Russian 
foreign ministers today reached a consensus in a telephone 
conversation on promoting diplomatic process and coordinating 
mediation efforts in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that French Foreign 
Minister Alain Juppe and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev 
discussed the situation in Gorazde, eastern part of Bosnia. 
  Juppe urged Russia and the United States to consult with the 
European Union and the United Nations as soon as possible so 
that a common position on Bosnia will be worked out and the 
peace talks be resumed. 
  He said Kozyrev was positive toward a French proposal on 
renewed diplomatic efforts and its draft resolution to be 
presented to UN Security Council. 
  The French draft calls for an immediate ceasefire in 
Gorazde, 
a withdrawal of Serb forces from the region and a deployment of 
UN peacekeeping forces there. 
  The draft reportedly received the support of 11 countries at 
the EU foreign ministerial meeting in Luxembourg on Monday. 
  Official sources in Paris said that as both the Russian 
contact with the Serbs and the U.S. contact with the Muslims 
failed to end the fighting in Gorazde, only a united mediation 
effort could bring all the Bosnian warring factions back to the 
negotiating table. 
  The spokesman quoted Kozyrev as saying that Russia will 
continue to persuade the Serbs to accept the demand of the 
international community.

<F P=106> ["Roundup": "Arafat's Talks in Moscow"] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Palestinian 
President Yasir 'Arafat held a series of talks with Russian 
leaders here on Tuesday [19 April], focusing on the Middle East 
situation, the Palestinian-Israeli settlement and bilateral 
relations. 
  His talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev, State Duma (the lower house of the 
parliament) speaker Ivan Rybkin and Interior Minister Viktor 
Yerin resulted in signing of an agreement on furthering 
bilateral political, economic and cultural cooperation. 
'Arafat, also chairman of the executive committee of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), arrived in Moscow on 
Monday evening for a two-day working visit to Russia. 
  During the meeting with the PLO leader, Yeltsin stressed 
that 
"comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East remains a 
Russian strategic priority in the region vitally important for 
Russia," the ITAR-TASS News Agency said. 
  The Russian president told 'Arafat that he is satisfied with 
the on-going Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to overcome 
confrontation and build a solid peace infrastructure despite all 
difficulties. 
  He reaffirmed Moscow's firm intention as a co-sponsor of the 
Mideast peace process to render comprehensive assistance to 
further progress at Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
  'Arafat praised Russia's contribution to the Mideast peace 
process and achievement of positive results in the Arab-Israeli 
dialogue. 
  Russia's diplomatic efforts has played a considerable role 
in 
settling difficulties aroused from the Hebron tragedy in 
February and in implementing measures to consolidate Palestinian 
security in occupied lands contained in the UN Security 
Council's Resolution 904, 'Arafat said. 
  He also thanked Russia for its readiness to help 
Palestinians 
in the establishing of self-rule administration in the Gaza 
Strip and Jericho area, the ITAR-TASS said. 
  At a news conference following the talks, Russian Foreign 
Minister Kozyrev said the Moscow talks is the continuation of 
the Russian-Palestinian dialogue which has been for several 
years and Moscow is "determined to eliminate all obstacles on 
the way towards comprehensive settlement" in the Middle East. 
  He also told reporters that he had assured the PLO leader of 
Russia's support to the PLO course against extremists and said 
the Palestinian and Russian leaders keep a constant contact via 
Yeltsin's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk and regular exchange 
of notes. 
  'Arafat described his Moscow trip as "the most important 
one." he and Kozyrev discussed ways to overcome obstacles in 
fulfillment of the Palestinian-Israeli peace accord on Gaza 
Strip and Jericho. 
  The PLO leader reminded that Israeli troops' withdrawal from 
Gaza Strip and Jericho expired on April 13 but nothing has been 
changed. He warned that the only alternative to peace is anarchy 
and "Balkanization" of the region. 
  'Arafat is scheduled to leave Moscow on Wednesday after 
meeting with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.

Consulate Statement Regrets Action That Stifles and Threatens

  [Excerpts] The U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong issued a 
statement yesterday, commenting on Xi Yang for the first time. 
The statement said that Xi merely used customary and reasonable 
professional means to gather news, but the sentence given to him 
was far out of proportion to the acts he allegedly committed.

  In response to the U.S. Consulate statement, Cheng Yiu-tong, 
a deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC], said that each 
country has its own judicial system, which brooks no "indiscreet 
remarks" from other countries. Similarly, if Beijing had made 
similar remarks about the U.S. judicial system, it would 
probably lead to "great disorder under heaven." 
  Cheng said that the statement would complicate the matter 
rather than help Xi Yang, because Beijing may further tighten 
its policies in this regard. Moreover, the United States has 
politicized the issue. He asked: The United States also has a 
record of arresting Soviet spies -- why haven't they made this 
public? [passage omitted]

  [Text] New York, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Sino-U.S. trade has 
made satisfying progress despite of conflicts, Wu Yi, visiting 
Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation 
(MOFTEC) said here today. 
  Presenting a key-note speech at the Asia Society this 
morning, Wu noted that trade between China and the United States 
increased by 20 percent annually. 
  Despite the troubles and conflicts in the process of 
Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, the general trend has 
been developing and going forward, she added. 
  According to the minister, the two way trade between China 
and the United States valued at 27.65 billion U.S. dollars, 
increasing 11-folds over 1979 and the U.S. by far was the 
largest investor in China with committed investment of 11 
billion dollars in over 10,000 projects. 
  "It is worth noting that about 50 of the fortune 500 
companies have made investment in China and their investment 
tend to be large in size and have higher level of technology 
content," Wu said at the China-U.S. trade and investment seminar. 
  On the most favored nations (MFN) status, a topic concerned 
by all, Wu stressed that there was no problem on the part of 
China, but the U.S. annual review on China's MFN status had 
added considerable uncertainty to the business communities in 
the two countries. 
  While praising more and more Americans of vision who were in 
favor of de-coupling human rights with MFN, Wu expressed her 
hope that reason would prevail so that this issue could be 
solved once and for all. 
  "If otherwise the basis for Sino-U.S. trade and economic 
relations were ruined, both sides would suffer, the biggest 
loser would not be China, but rather U.S. business community and 
the vast U.S. consumers," she emphasized. 
  Economies of the two countries were very complementary to 
each other, Wu said, adding that to develop trade and economic 
relationships between the two countries was not only in the 
fundamental interest of the two nations, but also beneficial to 
the prosperity and stability of the Asia-Pacific region and 
throughout the world. 
  Ye Qing, vice chairman of China's State Planning Commission 
and Jiao Sufen, director general of the Department of Foreign 
Investment of MOFTEC, also made speeches on business 
opportunities in China. 
  About 300 people, most of whom are businessmen from U.S. big 
companies, attended the seminar.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhao Renfang (6392 0088 2455)] </F>
  [Text] New York, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, Chinese 
minister of foreign economic relations and trade cooperation, 
said today [19 April] that Sino-U.S. trade can be described as 
"proceeding with friction" because trade between the two 
countries has been growing at an annual rate of 20 percent 
despite the frictions and contradictions in Sino-U.S. trade. 
  Wu Yi made the statement at the "Symposium on Sino-U.S. 
Trade 
and Investment" sponsored by the Asia Association here. She 
said: Bilateral Sino-U.S. trade has been developing very 
quickly. The volume of trade between the two countries has 
grown more than 10 times, reaching $27.65 billion in 1993 from 
$2.4 billion in 1979. There are now 12,000 U.S. enterprises in 
China. Of the $11 billion the United States agreed to invest in 
China, $5.2 billion has actually been invested in China and used 
by China. The United States has become the largest investor in 
China. 
  Commenting on China's most-favored-nation status, Wu Yi 
emphatically pointed out that the yearly discussion of this 
issue has created an enormous sense of instability for Sino-U.S. 
economic relations and trade. She said associating trade with 
issues having nothing to do with trade is "extremely unwise" 
[fei chang bu ming zhi 7236 1603 0008 2494 2535] and "lacks 
strategic foresight." 
  Wu Yi urged the U.S. Government to act pragmatically, weigh 
the advantages and disadvantages, do away with artificial 
barriers, and properly resolve this problem so that Sino-U.S. 
economic relations and trade can proceed steadily and in a 
healthy manner. 
  Wu Yi attended the symposium in New York after attending a 
meeting of the Eighth Sino-U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and 
Trade in Washington. Over 300 representatives from U.S. 
business circles attended today's symposium. Taking the floor 
at the symposium, Ye Qing, vice minister in charge of the 
Chinese State Planning Commission, and Jiao Sufen, director of

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (AFP)--China said Wednesday [20 
April] it hoped former US President Richard Nixon, whose 
historic 1972 visit here paved the way for the restoration of 
Sino-US ties, would recover soon from a severe stroke. "Nixon 
is an old friend of the Chinese people. He has made positive 
contributions to the development of Sino-US relations," a 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said. "We hope Mr. Nixon will 
recover soon," she said. 
  The 81-year-old former president was rushed back into 
intensive care in a New York hospital as his condition 
deteriorated late Tuesday after suffering a stroke that left him 
partially paralysed. "There are potentially poor outcomes. His 
prognosis is guarded," Dr. Fred Plum told reporters at the 
hospital. 
  Nixon's 1972 visit, during which he met with late chairman 
Mao Zedong, opened the door to the establishment of full Sino-US 
diplomatic relations seven years later. Washington had 
previously refused to recognise the communist regime which came 
to power here in 1949, instead maintaining ties with the 
Nationalist government that had fled to Taiwan after losing the 
civil war on the mainland. Nixon has since maintained close 
contacts with China, visiting the country several times.

  [Text] Vancouver, Canada, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice 
Premier Zou Jiahua today called on Canadian businessmen and 
financiers to take a long view into the future, seize the 
opportunity and move swiftly to invest in China through fair 
competition. 
  Zou made the call at a luncheon given jointly by Canadian 
Asia-Pacific Foundation and Canada-China Business Council here 
in his honor. 
  The vice premier, who arrived here on Monday for a 10-day 
official visit, said Sino-Canadian economic and technological 
cooperation is presented with a new opportunity. 
  He said the two countries should open new areas for 
cooperation apart from the traditional ones. 
  Canada is strong in transportation, telecommunications, 
energy, electricity, mining, agriculture and forestry, and these 
are exactly the priority areas for development in China, he told 
about 250 Canadian businessmen and government officials. 
  Zou said the Chinese government always attaches great 
importance to its relations with Canada and believes that 
stronger Sino-Canadian ties will work in the fundamental 
interests of both peoples and contribute to peace, stability and 
economic prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at 
large. 
  He said China's door is sure to open even wider and an 
all-directional pattern of openness linking the coast with the 
hinterland across China is taking shape. 
  The Western countries have advanced technologies and 
management know-how, abundant capital and experienced managers, 
Zou said, adding that China on the other hand has rich natural 
resources, a labor force of low cost, a considerable economic 
foundation thanks to several decades of reconstruction and above 
all, a huge market. 
  He said that more economic and technological interflows 
aimed 
at a long-term cooperation, therefore, could contribute to 
mutual complementarity of comparative advantage of the two sides 
for common prosperity. 
  On the form of cooperation, Zou said, it can take many 
forms. 
"trade with us is certainly welcome. But we also hope to see 
more business people with acumen come to China to invest and set 
up their own factories, to enter into partnership with Chinese 
enterprises, or to transfer technology, and explore China's 
market," he added. 
  The vice premier pledged that China's investment environment 
will keep improving and the legitimate rights and interests of 
foreign investors will be better protected under Chinese law. 
  Zou said in 1993 alone, foreign investment actually used in 
China reached 36.77 billion U.S. dollars, up by 91.5 percent 
over the previous year, in which direct foreign investment 
reached 25.76 billion U.S. dollars, up by 130 percent. 
  The investment environment in China, Zou said, is improving. 
There is more order in the financial and circulation fields and 
signs of an economic overheating have been brought under control 
after the government introduced last June a series of measures 
aimed at tightening and improving macro-economic regulation. 
  "This year, in face of greater inflation pressure and the 
quick rise of the aggregate price level, we are stepping up 
measures to control the excessive increase in investment in 
fixed assets and consumption funds and to reinforce supervision 
and examination of prices," the Chinese vice premier said.

  [Text] New York, April 19 (XINHUA) -- China-U.S. Trade and 
Investment Fair held at Los Angeles has been successful, 
according to Wu Yi, visiting Chinese minister of foreign trade 
and economic cooperation (MOFTEC). 
  Addressing the China-U.S. Trade and Investment Seminar at 
the 
Asia Society here today, Wu said that the two countries have 
signed contracts worth of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and 134 
agreements valued at 4 billion dollars in the fair. 
  The trade and investment fair is continued here in New York 
for another three days, starting this afternoon. 
  Wu noted that she hoped the fair will also have a greater 
breakthrough than that in Los Angeles. 
  The trade fair, which was deemed as the largest of its kind 
held in the United States, began on April 11 in Los Angeles. 
Representatives from 26 Chinese provinces, and municipalities 
and eight ministries and commissions of the central government 
have brought with them over 800 projects to the United States. 
  Briefing economic development, especially foreign trade and 
business growth in China, the minister noted that for the past 
15 years, China's foreign trade grew faster than its GDP. The 
foreign trade volume last year stood at 195.8 billion U.S. 
dollars, making China the 11th largest trading nation in the 
world. 
  She added that foreign direct investment in China has 
registered rapid development with the number of foreign invested 
enterprises reaching 170,000 and the actual foreign investment 
in China totaling 60 billion dollars. 
  On China's import volume last year, she said it amounted to 
104 billion dollars. "Based on this, China's total import volume 
for the next seven years will top 1,000 billion dollars," she 
predicted.

  [Text] Tashkent, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Premier Li Peng delivered a speech this afternoon at the 
Uzbekistan Parliament to hundreds of parliament members, 
government officials, and notable figures from various circles. 
In the speech, he dwelled on Sino-Uzbekistan relations, China's 
basic policy for developing ties with Central Asia, its position 
on establishing a new world political and economic order, and 
other major issues. He also gave a brief account of China's 
domestic situation and foreign policy. 
  President Karimov of Uzbekistan was present. 
  Li Peng said: President Karimov and leaders of other Central 
Asian nations have visited China in the past two years or so. I 
have now embarked on a tour of our good neighbors Uzbekistan, 
Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan at the invitation of 
the leaders of these Central Asian nations, bringing with me the 
friendship of the Chinese people. Such frequent exchanges of 
visits between the leaders of China and the Central Asian 
nations is unprecedented in history and signifies that relations 
between China and the Central Asian nations have entered a new 
era. 
  China and Uzbekistan are good neighbors. The two countries 
shared many similarities in the past and do so today. The 
ancient silk road once linked the two nations closely together. 
Today, both of our nations are concentrating on building their 
own countries; they both want a long-term stable international 
environment; and they both want to develop equal and mutually 
beneficial cooperation and establish long-term, stable 
good-neighborly relations. I believe that through this visit, 
the two nations will certainly enhance mutual understanding and 
step up cooperation. This will undoubtedly further boost the 
ongoing friendship between the two nations. 
  Li Peng said: The friendship between the Chinese people and 
their counterparts in Central Asia dates back to ancient times. 
Today, with increasing contact with the rest of the world, the 
Central Asian nations are writing new chapters in promoting 
common development and friendly exchanges between Asia and 
Europe. China attaches great importance to its relations with 
the Central Asian countries and with them, we are willing to 
work to build a new silk-road, with a perspective toward the 
future and the next century. China's basic policy on developing 
relations with the Central Asian nations can be summarized in 
the following four points: 
  First, maintaining good-neighborly relations and peaceful 
coexistence. China and the Central Asian nations are close 
neighbors, some sharing common borders. It is the shared desire 
of the Chinese and Central Asian peoples to be friendly 
neighbors, for it serves our fundamental interests. As the 
Chinese people are concentrating on building their own country, 
they need a long-term stable and peaceful international 
environment, a good surrounding environment in particular. We 
have always cherished good will toward the Central Asian 
peoples, and will remain your good friends and neighbors 
forever. China seeks no self-interest or sphere of influence in 
the world, including this region. Even when China becomes more 
developed or prosperous in the future, it will never seek 
hegemonism or power politics. Instead, China will always 
maintain equal and friendly relations with its neighbors. You 
can be fully confident that no matter what happens in the world, 
China will not change this policy. We keep our word. 
  Second, promoting equality and mutually beneficial 
cooperation and seeking common prosperity. Economic cooperation 
and trade are an important aspect of our bilateral relations. A 
good beginning has already been made in this regard, but there 
is still a lot that can and should be done. In developing 
economic cooperation with the Central Asian nations, China 
strictly abides by the principle of equality and mutual benefit, 
and attaches no political conditions. We would like to work with 
all the Central Asian countries to constantly improve the 
environment, expand the scope and enhance the quality and level 
of cooperation, and with mutual benefit, march along the path of 
common development. 
  Third, respecting the independent choice of the Central 
Asian 
peoples and never interfering in their internal affairs. As the 
world is diversified, the national conditions of the Central 
Asian nations differ from each other. There has never been and 
can never be a unified mode of development that suits the 
realities of all countries. We believe that the Central Asian 
nations, just like China and other countries in the world, are 
entitled to independently choose the social system, concept of 
values, and path of development compatible with their national 
conditions. It is our conviction that the Central Asian nations 
are fully capable of and have the wisdom to handle their own 
matters well. 
  Fourth, respecting other countries' independence and 
sovereignty, and contributing to regional stability. China 
sincerely hopes to see the maintenance of long-term peace and 
stability in central Asia. We appreciate and support all 
efforts made by central Asian countries to safeguard their 
independence and sovereignty, promote regional peace and 
stability, and enhance friendship and cooperation among nations. 
The development of our relations with any Central Asian nation 
is not directed against any third country, and we are willing to 
see the Central Asian countries living in harmony with each 
other. China is also ready to develop friendly relations with 
all countries in the world, particularly neighboring nations, 
including Russia and other CIS countries. The development of 
Central Asian nations depends on world peace and stability, 
while the world needs a stable and prosperous Central Asia. 
  Speaking of the world situation today, Li Peng said: On the 
whole, the world is still locked in complicated and profound 
changes. Therefore, the establishment of a new international 
political and economic order represents the urgent desire of all 
the peoples in the world. The new international political and 
economic order we advocate is different in essence from the old 
order which was marked by hegemonism and power politics. We 
believe such a new order includes many contents, but its core is 
as follows: 
  -- In handling international relations, the principles of 
mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual 
non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal 
affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence 
should be strictly followed. 
  -- The right of different nations to choose the social 
system 
and mode of development compatible with their national 
conditions should be respected. 
  -- All nations, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, 
are entitled to participate in international affairs, which 
should not be determined by one or several big countries. 
  -- Disputes between nations should be settled in a fair and 
reasonable way through peaceful negotiations, in the spirit of 
equal consultation, mutual understanding, and mutual 
accommodation. When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be 
shelved temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while 
reserving differences. Disputes over some issues should not 
hamper the development of normal nation-to-nation relations. 
  -- Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in 
line 
with the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and exchange of 
equal values. Developed nations face unshirkable 
responsibilities for gradually reducing the gap between the 
North and South. 
  Li pointed out: The establishment of a new political and 
economic order of the world is a long-term and arduous task. We 
are ready to work unremittingly toward that, along with all 
countries in the world. 
  In his speech, Li Peng also gave a brief account of China's 
domestic situation. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's -- the chief architect of China's reform and opening 
up -- theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, 
China has made remarkable progress in reform, opening up, and 
the modernization drive since the late seventies. From 1979 to 
1993, China's economy grew at an average annual rate of 9 
percent or more. As living standards improved in both urban and 
rural areas, our cause has gained the general and whole-hearted 
support of the people. China is now enjoying economic growth, 
political stability, national unity, and social progress. Under 
the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang 
Zemin at its core, the whole nation, full of confidence, is 
marching continuously along the path of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. 
  In conclusion, Li Peng said: China's development requires a 
lasting stable domestic environment and an international 
environment of long-term peace and stability, especially a good 
environment in its neighborhood. Today, mankind is marching 
toward a new century. For the bright future of China and the 
world at large, China will make every effort to manage its own 
affairs well; unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy 
of peace; develop friendly relations and cooperation with all 
countries, especially neighboring nations, on the basis of the 
five principles of peaceful coexistence; and make a new 
contribution to peace, stability, and development in Asia and 
the world as a whole.

  [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng, delivering a speech at the parliament of Uzbekistan here 
this afternoon, stated a four-point basic policy of the Chinese 
Government for developing relations with Central Asian nations. 
  Li, referring to the frequent exchange of visits between 
leaders of China and Central Asian nations, said "this signifies 
that relations between China and Central Asian nations have 
entered a new era." 
  The friendship between the Chinese people and their 
counterparts in Central Asia dates back to ancient times, he 
said. 
  "The Central Asian countries, as a main passage along the 
silk-road, contributed significantly not only to brisk 
commercial and cultural exchanges between Asia and Europe, but 
also to the advancement of civilization and progress of 
mankind," Li added. 
  Today, with increasing contact with the rest of the world, 
the Central Asian nations are "writing new chapters" of 
promoting common development and friendly exchanges of Asia and 
Europe, he said. 
  China attaches great importance to its relations with 
Central 
Asian countries and, together with them, "we are willing to work 
for the building of a new silk-road, with a perspective towards 
the future and the next century," Li said. 
  Li summed up China's basic policy on developing relations 
with the Central Asian nations in four points. 
  The first point is "maintaining goodneighborly relations and 
peaceful coexistence." 
  China and Central Asian nations are close neighbors, with 
some sharing common borders, Li noted. "it is the shared desire 
of the Chinese and Central Asian peoples to be friendly 
neighbors, for it serves our fundamental interests." 
  "As the Chinese people are concentrating on building up 
their 
own country, they need a long-term stable and peaceful 
international environment, a good surrounding environment in 
particular," he said. 
  "We have always cherished a good will towards the Central 
Asian peoples, and will remain your good friends and neighbor 
forever," he noted. 
  China seeks no self-interests or sphere of influence in the 
world, including this region, Li stated. "Even when China 
becomes more developed or prosperous in the future, it will 
never seek hegemonism or power politics, either. Instead, China 
will always maintain equal and friendly relations with its 
neighbors." 
  "You can be fully confident that no matter what happens in 
the world, China will not change this policy," he said, 
stressing that "we keep our words." 
  The second point is "promoting cooperation of equality and 
mutual benefit and seeking common prosperity." 
  "Economic cooperation and trade are an important aspect of 
our bilateral relations," Li said, adding that "a good beginning 
has already been made, but much more remains to be done." 
  In developing economic cooperation with the Central Asian 
nations, China strictly abides by the principle of equality and 
mutual benefit, and attaches no political conditions, the 
Chinese premier said. 
  "We would like to work with all the Central Asian countries 
to constantly improve the environment, expand the scope and 
enhance the quality and level of cooperation, and with mutual 
benefit, march along the path of common development," he said. 
  The third point of the policy is "respecting the independent 
choice of the Central Asian peoples and never interfering in 
their internal affairs." 
  As the world is diversified, the national conditions of the 
Central Asian nations differ from each other, Li noted. 
  "There has never been and can never be a unified mode of 
development that suits the realities of all countries," he said. 
"We believe that the Central Asian nations, just like China and 
other countries in the world, are entitled to independently 
choose the social system, concepts of values and path of 
development compatible with their national conditions." 
  He expressed the conviction that the Central Asian nations 
are fully capable of "handling well their own matters." 
  The fourth point Li stated is "respecting other countries' 
independence and sovereignty and contributing to regional 
stability." 
  China sincerely hopes to see the maintenance of long-term 
peace and stability in central Asia, Li said. "We appreciate 
and support all efforts made by central Asian countries to 
safeguard their independence and sovereignty, promote regional 
peace and stability, and enhance friendship and cooperation 
among nations." 
  "The development of our relations with any Central Asian 
nation is not directed against any third country, and we are 
willing to see the Central Asian countries living in harmony 
with each other," he said. 
  Also, China is ready to develop friendly relations with all 
countries in the world, particularly the neighboring nations, 
including Russia and other CIS countries, Li said. 
  "The development of Central Asian nations depends on world 
peace and stability, while the world needs a stable and 
prosperous Central Asia," he said.

  [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng, delivering a speech at the parliament of Uzbekistan here 
this afternoon, stated what China considers the main content of 
a new world order. 
  The world is moving toward multi-polarity and the Chinese 
Government holds that such a trend is of positive significance, 
he said. 
  "It is the common aspiration of people throughout the world 
to preserve peace, strengthen cooperation and promote 
development," he noted. 
  "However, we should also be aware that some problems left 
over from the Cold War era remain to be resolved, while many new 
conflicts and contradictions continue to crop up, leaving the 
world far from peaceful," he added. 
  Also, many developing countries are becoming poorer, he 
pointed out. "The issue of world peace is yet to be addressed, 
while the problem of development is even more glaring," he said. 
  On the whole, the world is still locked in complicated and 
profound changes, he said. "Therefore, the establishment of a 
new international political and economic order represents the 
urgent desire of all the peoples in the world." 
  "The new international political and economic order we 
advocate is different in essence from the old order which was 
marked by hegemonism and power politics," he said. 
  Li said, "we believe such a new order includes many 
contents,

  When conditions are not ripe, disputes can be shelved 
temporarily, in an effort to seek common ground while reserving 
differences. Disputes over some issues should not hamper the 
development of normal nation-to-nation relations. 
  -- Trade and economic cooperation should be conducted in 
line 
with the principles of equality, mutual benefit and exchange of 
equal values. Developed nations face unshirkable 
responsibilities for gradually reducing the gap between the 
North and the South, or between developed and developing nations. 
  Li called the establishment of a new political and economic 
order of the world "a long-term and arduous task," saying "we 
are ready to work unremittingly towards that, along with all 
countries in the world."

  [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Premier Li Peng today delivered a speech at the parliament of 
Uzbekistan on Sino-Uzbekistan relations, China's basic policy 
towards Central Asia and its position on establishing a new 
world order. 
  During his speech, Li also gave a brief account of China's 
reform and open policy, as well as its efforts to build up a 
socialist market economy. 
  "The fundamental purpose of China's economic development is 
to improve the quality of the life of the entire Chinese people 
both materially and morally," he said. 
  China remains a developing country and its people are not 
better-off yet, he said. "It takes arduous efforts of many 
generations for my country to reach the economic level of an 
average developed country." 
  China's development requires a lasting stable domestic 
environment and an international environment of long-term peace 
and stability as well, especially a good environment in its 
neighborhood, he said. 
  "For a bright future of China and the world at large, China 
will make every effort to manage its own affairs well, 
unswervingly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, 
develop friendly relations and cooperation with all countries, 
especially the neighboring nations on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence, and make a new contribution 
to peace, stability and development in Asia and the world as a 
whole," he said.

  [Text] According to the data provided by the provincial 
commodity administration bureau, Shandong has encountered 
serious problems in importing Russian commodities. In 1993, the 
provincial commodity administration bureau inspected 462 tonnes 
of commodities worth over $82 million imported from Russia. Of 
these commodities, 69 lots of them worth over $12 million were 
appraised as substandard in the inspection. Of the Russian 
commodities imports, particularly serious problems cropped up in 
imported fertilizer, timber, steel products, and automobiles. 
Major problems cropping up in the imported fertilizer and 
timber were that of being short in weight and length measures as 
well as substandard quality. General problems cropping up in 
the imported automobiles from Russia were three leakages, 
frequent mechanical failures, and unsuitable-size engines for 
the cars. The provincial commodity administration bureau is 
adopting effective measures to strictly guarantee the quality of 
Russian commodities imports to safeguard the vital interests of 
the country and enterprises.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe said today he has dropped his attempt to leave 
the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the race 
for the premiership. 
  Watanabe, 70, also a former deputy prime minister, conveyed 
his latest decision at a third meeting with LDP President Yohei 
Kono, who has himself vowed to run for the supreme government 
post to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa announced his resignation last Friday after eight 
months in office. 
  The LDP veteran's decision came after the ruling coalition 
parties came closer to agreeing on a policy platform and naming 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as its single candidate for the 
premiership. 
  Hata, 58, concurrently serves as leader of Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party), the ruling coalition's core party. 
  Watanabe's change of heart over the defection paved the way 
for the LDP to field Kono as its official candidate to run in an 
upcoming parliamentary election of prime minister.

<F P=106> ["Political Turmoil Ends in Japan" -- XINHUA headline] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The political turmoil 
that has raged here for the past 10 days appeared near its end 
today as parties in the ruling coalition decided to nominate 
Tsutomu Hata to succeed Morihiro Hosokawa as prime minister. 
  Hata, 58, concurrently deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister, has been the main contender since Hosokawa announced 
his bombshell resignation on April 8 amid a Diet (Parliament) 
stalemate sparked by his personal financial affairs. 
  The choice of Hata today dashed the hope of former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe, who simultaneously abandoned his plan 
to leave the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
to run in an upcoming Diet election for the premiership. 
  Watanabe, an LDP veteran, had tried to align with Shinseito 
(Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito (Clean Government Party), the 
key political forces within the current seven-party coalition, 
with the aim of leading, or at least influencing, the next 
government. 
  By keeping Watanabe and his supporters within the fold, the 
LDP, still the largest single party, has averted another major 
split and is still a thorn in the coalition's side. 
  The LDP lost its 38-year-old grip on power last summer after 
Hata and his political ally, Ichiro Ozawa, bolted the party with 
their followers to form Shinseito. 
  It was the second attempt by Watanabe, 70, for the prime 
ministership. He made his first attempt when the LDP was in 
power. 
  Political commentators said he changed his mind this time 
after realizing the slim possibility of winning support from 
Shinseito and other parties. 
  If a policy platform statement is signed by the coalition 
partners, the leaders of the alliance will nominate Hata for the 
premiership as early as Wednesday [20 April].

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Anti-Nuclear and Peace 
Committee issued here today a statement strongly protesting 
against the United States' deployment of Patriots missiles on 
the Korean Peninsula. 
  It was reported that two transports of the U.S. Navy loaded 
with 192 Patriot missiles, 48 launching pads and 84 Stringer 
missiles to be deployed in South Korea arrived at Pusan port on 
April 18. 
  The statement said that the shipment of Patriots missiles to 
South Korea by the United States led the situation on the Korean 
Peninsula to the "brink of war." 
  By deploying most dangerous weapons -- Patriots missiles in 
South Korea, the United States had violated the DPRK-U.S. Joint 
Declaration on peacefully solving the nuclear issue on the 
Korean Peninsula released last June, the statement said. The 
statement demanded that the United States stop at once deploying 
the Patriots missiles in South Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Some 30 dissidents 
staged a demonstration in front of the American Embassy in Seoul 
today in protest against U.S Defense Secretary William Perry's 
visit to South Korea. 
  Perry, who delayed his visit due to last week's downing of 
U.S. Army helicopters by friendly fire, will arrive here late 
tonight to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart Kwon 
Yong-hae on Pyongyang's nuclear issue. 
  The demonstrators, believed to belong to "Chongukyonhap," an 
alliance of dissident activists for "democracy and national 
unification," delivered to the U.S. Embassy a letter addressing 
Perry. 
  The letter accused Washington of "intentionally aggravating" 
tension on the Korean Peninsula to benefit the U.S. defense 
industry and to sustain its world hegemony as the sole military 
power even though the Cold War is over. 
  It called on Perry to drop his earlier remarks warning of a 
war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). 
It also urged the United States to withdraw immediately all 
Patriot missiles from South Korea and to suspend the 
Seoul-Washington joint military exercise "Team Spirit" 
permanently. 
  South korea and the U.S. will find ways during Perry's visit 
here to break the stalemate of the nuclear issue, including the 
timing of the "Team Spirit" joint military drill. 
  The first shipment of patriot missiles and their launchers 
arrived in South Korea Monday [18 April] aboard two U.S. 
military transport ships. The number of launchers amounted to 
24, but the number of missiles was not known. 
  South Korea and the U.S. claimed that the Patriots are 
purely 
defensive missiles designed to counter the DPRK's air strikes 
and Scud missiles. 
  However, the DPRK strongly opposes the deployment of the 
Patriots in South Korea, saying that the missiles are designed 
for offensive purposes.

nuclear inspection. 
  Addressing a working luncheon with U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State Robert Gallucci, South Korean Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu said the immediate task is to get Pyongyang to agree to 
let the IAEA to further check its nuclear facilities, the YONHAP 
NEWS AGENCY reported. 
  Gallucci arrived here last Friday [22 April] to seek a joint 
strategy with South Korea in dealing with Pyongyang's nuclear 
issue. 
  Han and Gallucci stressed the importance of an inter-Korean 
dialogue in defusing the "nuclear crisis" and promised to work 
together for successful talks between South Korea and the DPRK. 
  The DPRK opposes the pressure put by the IAEA as well as the 
U.S. and other countries for further inspection of its nuclear 
sites, saying that it met the IAEA's demands in March this year. 
  IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is due to report to the 
United Nations Security Council on the DPRK's nuclear program in 
early May. 
  The DPRK has only a couple of weeks next month, said a South 
Korean official who asked not to be identified. "Pyongyang will 
either accept the IAEA team by then or face UN.Action," he 
claimed. 
  President of the UN Security Council Jean-Bernard Merimee 
issued a statement in New York on March 31, urging the DPRK to 
allow the IAEA to complete its inspection of Pyongyang's nuclear 
facilities. 
  "The council has decided to remain actively interested in 
the 
matter and further security council consideration will take 
place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation of 
the IAEA-DPRK safeguards agreement," the statement said.

  [Text] Nanning, 18 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Beilun He Bridge in 
Dongxing, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which was 
reconstructed under a Sino-Vietnamese joint venture, officially 
opened to traffic on 17 April. Measuring 111 meters in length 
and 10 meters in width, it is the only bridge linking the 
Dongxing Development Zone in China's Guangxi with Mang Street, 
Hai Ninh County, in Vietnam's Quang Ninh Province. The original 
bridge (named the Beilun He Friendship Bridge) was put into 
operation after its completion in 1958 and destroyed during a 
bombing in 1979. Through negotiations, relevant departments 
from China and Vietnam in 1992 decided to reconstruct the bridge 
at the same location using the same design and at a budgeted 
total investment of 1.8 million renminbi yuan shared equally by 
the two sides.

  [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Acting Chinese 
Premier Zhu Rongji today conferred with visiting Australian 
Governor-General Bill Hayden on the promotion of Sino-Australian 
economic ties and cooperation and other issues of common 
interest. 
  As Chinese Premier Li Peng is abroad on official visits to 
four Central Asian countries and Mongolia, Zhu is presiding over 
the State Council's work and serving as acting premier. 
  During the meeting, Zhu recalled his visit to Australia in 
1992, saying that since that visit, bilateral relations of 
economic and technological cooperation have soundly developed, 
high-ranking officials exchanged visits frequently and bilateral 
political ties improved further. 
  He said China and Australia are mutually complementary in 
economic structures. Australia produces iron ore and wool, both 
of which are largely exported to China. At the same time, the 
two countries can cooperate in the deep-processing of 
commodities. 
  As long as Australian products maintain competitiveness and 
australia provides China with advanced technology, the prospects 
for bilateral cooperation in this regard are broad, he said. 
  Zhu noted that the joint ventures run by the two countries 
in 
Australia are successful. 
  "It is China's hope that efforts should be made not only for 
the enhancement of cooperation between the two governments, but 
also for the promotion of cooperation between the enterprises of 
the two countries," he said. 
  Hayden said he was deeply impressed by achievements that 
China has made in economic construction, adding that Australia 
places great importance on its economic relations and trade with 
China. 
  He expressed satisfaction with bilateral trade in the fields 
of iron ore and wool and agreed to China's views on giving full 
play to their advantages and conducting cooperation in products' 
deep- processing. 
  During the meeting, the two also briefed each other on the 
respective countries' domestic economies.

mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Australia. 
  Meeting with visiting Australian Governor-General Bill 
Hayden

praised the positive contributions that Hayden has made in past 
years for the promotion of Sino-Australian ties. 
  He said that the two countries have had effective exchanges 
and cooperation since they were linked diplomatically. 
  Qiao noted that in recent years the exchanges between the 
parliaments of the two countries have grown rapidly, adding that 
there are also frequent exchanges between the legislative bodies 
of Chinese provinces and Australian states. 
  "At the beginning of this month we received a delegation 
from 
the foreign affairs, trade and defence committees of the 
australian parliament, and a Chinese NPC delegation headed by 
Vice-Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Tian Jiyun will 
visit Australia soon. These events would contribute to further 
development of Sino- Australian relations and friendship of the 
two peoples," Qiao said. 
  The NPC chairman pointed out that China and Australia, both 
in the Pacific region, are complementary in their economies. 
China is willing to forge deeper and closer cooperative ties 
with Australia on the basis of the peaceful co-existance, 
equality and mutual benefit, he stressed. 
  Qiao also briefed Hayden on the work of the npc and the 
construction of China's socialist market economy. 
  Hayden expressed thanks for the warm reception he has met in 
China. 
  He said he was pleased with the achievements gained in 
Australia- China economic cooperation, which he described as 
"instrumental" to the two countries and as "favorable factors" 
for the economic development and political stability of the 
Asia-Pacific region.

mayor of Christchurch, New Zealand and (Chelnek), governor of 
the Australian State of Victoria, a friendly five-member 
government delegation led by Governor Zhang Wule departed 
Lanzhou yesterday for official friendly visits to New Zealand 
and Australia. The 10th anniversary of the establishment of 
sister-city ties between Gansu and Christchurch is 22 April 
1994. Governor Zhang Wule will attend the celebration 
activities sponsored by Christchurch. 
  In the last 10 years, our province and the city of 
Christchurch have conducted extensive exchange and cooperation 
in such areas as economics, trade, science and technology, 
education, and culture, thereby promoting mutual understanding 
and friendship between the peoples of China and New Zealand. 
  In recent years, our province and the State of Victoria, in 
Australia, have made comparatively great advances in economic 
cooperation and friendly relations. Our province has set up 
trading companies, livestock farms, and Chinese-product shopping 
malls in the state. These enterprises serve as an important 
window through which our province is developing the Australian 
market. Last year, the city of Tianshui established ties of 
friendship and cooperation with the city of [name indistinct] in 
Victoria. Zhang Wule's current visit to Victoria will have a 
positive impact on further expanding the friendly relations 
between our province and the State of Victoria, and on opening 
more channels of cooperation in Australia. 
  Vice Governor Chen Qiling and persons in charge of relevant 
departments went to the Zhongshan Airport to see the delegation 
off. Vice Governors Guo Kun and Cui Zhenghua shook hands with 
and said good-bye to Governor Zhang Wule at the gate of the 
government office building.

  [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- President Muhammed 
Husni Mubarak's forthcoming visit to China will serve to promote 
the friendly ties of cooperation between Egypt and China. 
  Egyptian Ambassador to China Samir Burhan expressed this 
belief in an interview with XINHUA. 
  President Mubarak will start a three-day state visit to 
China 
on April 21 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. 
  Burhan noted that a Cairo earthquake two years ago disrupted 
Mubarak's China trip and the forthcoming visit would be an 
extension of that visit. 
  The frequent high-level exchanges of visits are 
"manifestations of the friendly ties" between the two countries, 
he said. 
  During the visit, Mubarak is scheduled to hold talks and 
exchange views with President Jiang on regional and 
international issues of mutual concern. 
  Mubarak will brief the Chinese leadership on the latest 
developments of the Middle East peace process, and Egypt's role 
in the negotiations between the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and Israel and the withdrawal of Israeli troops 
from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, Burhan 
said. 
  As chairman of the Organization of African Unity, Mubarak 
will also brief the Chinese leaders on the developments in hot 
spots in Africa, such as Rwanda, Burundi, Somalia, Mozambique 
and South Africa. 
  Leaders of the two countries will explore new ways to 
enhance 
bilateral ties, especially those in the economic and trade 
fields, and propel these ties toward a new phase of development, 
Burhan said. 
  The ambassador touched on Egypt-China economic and trade 
relations, saying that the two-way trade volume reached 200 
million U.S. dollars last year. 
  "The figure is not all that big and there exists great 
potential for development," he said. 
  He voiced the belief that President Mubarak's visit will 
also 
serve to expand bilateral economic and trade relations. 
  Burhan revealed that the two countries are working on an 
agreement on judicial cooperation for the president to sign 
during his visit here. "This will mark another new development 
in bilateral cooperation," he noted. 
  Egypt and China share similar experiences in their 
respective 
opening drives and economic re-working, and are faced with 
common difficulties, he said. 
  The exchange of these experiences will help them to solve 
obstacles and to promote each country's progress, the ambassador 
noted.

  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Egypt and China have 
firmly established their political relations and such relations 
should spur economic cooperation and trade exchanges, Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak said in an interview with Chinese 
resident journalists in Cairo Monday prior to his visit to China. 
  "Since April 1976, I have visited China several times, each 
time has left me a very deep impression," Mubarak said, smiling, 
when meeting with the Chinese journalists in a large study in 
his Heliopolis Presidential Palace. 
  The president will pay a three-day state visit to China from 
April 21 to 23 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin. This will be his sixth tour of China and the fourth since 
he became president. 
  Sino-Egyptian relations have both historical and political 
dimensions, said Mubarak, pointing out that Egypt is the first 
Arab and African country to recognize the People's Republic of 
China. 
  So far as the political dimension is concerned, he said, 
these relations are based on a firmly established friendship 
that consists in cooperation, consultation and coordination on 
international and Arab issues. 
  These relations proceed from the major role played by China 
on the international arena and the important role enjoyed by 
Egypt in the Arab world, the Middle East and Africa, he added. 
  The president noted that the historical heritage of both 
Egypt and China, mutual confidence between the two countries and 
their cooperation in the economic, cultural and scientific 
fields have laid a solid foundation for mutual understanding 
between the two peoples, which has in turn further boosted the 
strong friendly ties existing between Cairo and Beijing at the 
highest level. 
  "If our political relations have become so firmly 
established, we of course hope that our economic cooperation and 
our trade exchange will come up to the same level." 
  The big progress the Chinese have made in their economic 
development and the impetus that has been given to the Egyptian 
economy in recent years are likely to create wide prospects for 
Egypt and China to expand their trade and increase their shares 
in the world trade, Mubarak said. 
  Those two facts are also likely to enable Egypt to make use 
of the industrial and technological progress achieved by China, 
he added. 
  "We cannot ignore the importance of the economic and 
political role of the countries in Asia, particularly in the Far 
East, which contribute 50 percent of the world production, that 
foreshadows that the next century will be the century of Asia," 
Mubarak said. 
  Egypt's cultural and religious ties with a number of Asian 
countries have promoted Egypt to devote due attention to 
fostering cooperation and understanding with the Asian 
countries, he said.

  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- There is an analogy 
between Egyptian and Chinese economic reforms and the two can 
make use of each other's experience, President Husni Mubarak 
told Chinese journalists prior to his visit to China. 
  In an interview Monday [18 April], Mubarak said that as a 
developing country that adopted centralized economic planning, 
Egypt has borne a lot of burdens as a result of several armed 
conflicts in the Middle East. It has met with difficulties in 
creating the infrastructure necessary for economic development, 
and has suffered from a steady population growth rate not in 
proportion to that of the economic growth. 
  In the face of these problems, said the president, Egypt 
began in the early eighties to comprehensively review its 
economic programs and plans in line with the requirements of 
modern economy, carrying out its economic reform programs in a 
way compatible with its own social conditions and the needs of 
Egyptian citizens. 
  He said that having executed two five-year economic plans 
and 
started a third one in 1992 and gradually adopted policies for 
economic liberalization and privatization in accordance with 
conditions of Egyptian society, Egypt has managed to restore the 
vitality of the egyptian economy, and its ability to produce, 
export and provide labor opportunities for thousands of young 
people. 
  The problem is not over yet, but it was carefully diagnosed, 
he said. The Egyptian economy, including industry, agriculture, 
reconstruction and public services, began to appear healthy and 
strong. 
  The president said that there is no little likeness between 
Egypt's experiment and that of China, despite their 
peculiarities. Shifting from centralized planning to the market 
mechanism and individual enterprises is a characteristic of both 
experiments. 
  But the fact the two experiments have taken into 
consideration the social peculiarities of the Egyptian and 
Chinese peoples, or "what we call the 'social dimension of 
economic development'," is perhaps the most prominent 
characteristic that they have in common, the president stressed. 
  Invigorating the public sector, establishing free economic 
zones, encouraging foreign investments and developing medium and 
small- sized industrial enterprises are characteristic of the 
reforms in China, which can be found, though on a small scale, 
in Egypt's economic reform experiment, Mubarak said. 
  Both the Egyptian and Chinese experiments reflect the 
conditions of economic development in the two countries, they 
are not a mechanical response to some plans or pieces of advice 
that were not necessarily compatible with the characteristics of 
the two experiments, said the Egyptian president.

  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Egyptian President Husni 
Mubarak hoped the year of 1994 will be a year of peace in the 
Middle East. 
  He spoke of the aspiration in an interview Monday [18 April] 
with resident Chinese journalists in Cairo prior to his visit to 
China. 
  The Middle East cannot afford to remain always in a state of 
war, for war is not the solution, peace is the only choice, the 
Madrid peace conference is deemed as a historic turn in boosting 
the Middle East peace march, he said. 
  Throughout the two years of difficult, sometimes faltering, 
talks, all parties concerned have unanimously expressed their 
will to opt for peace, overcome all obstacles and rebuild 
long-lost confidence, Mubarak noted. 
  The Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles reached 
last September is undoubtedly an important landmark, which has 
brought together all the parties concerned close to an 
acceptable peaceful settlement, Mubarak said. 
  This settlement will bring the Palestinian issue to the 
threshold of a new phase in which self-rule will be realized by 
the start of interim arrangements and negotiations on the final 
status of the occupied territories, he added. 
  With the same level of importance, there have been serious 
negotiations along the Syrian-Israeli, Lebanese-Israeli and 
Jordanian-Israeli tracks. This reflects an obvious political 
will on the part of parties concerned that the best means to 
reach agreement is through dialogue and mutual acceptance, he 
said. 
  Mubarak said a resolution of the conflict between Syria and 
Israel needs a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights. 
  Mubarak said Egypt has been committed consistently to the 
strategy of peace based on justice. The Egyptian role started 
years before the Madrid peace conference and has continued till 
now since Egypt enjoys the trust of all the concerned parties in 
the peace process and has direct contacts with both regional and 
international leaders. 
  Egypt is the only Arab country that has diplomatic relations 
with Israel and maintains good relationship with the Arab 
parties involved in the Arab-Israeli negotiations. It has 
received leading officials of the parties to the conflict 
regularly to narrow gaps of differences. 
  Establishing comprehensive peace in the Middle East region 
is 
a great historic contribution to the peace and stability in the 
world, concluded the Egyptian president.

  [Text] Cairo, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Egypt's Foreign Minister 
'Amur Musa said today that President Husni Mubarak's forthcoming 
visit to China will be of political and economic importance. 
  China, as a major power, plays a key role in world affairs, 
Musa told a press conference on the eve of Mubarak's visit which 
takes place from April 21 to 23. 
  Praising relations between China and Egypt and between 
President Mubarak and the Chinese leadership as time-tested and 
distinguished, the foreign minister said that intensive 
consultations between the two countries over the past 10 years 
have laid down a base for further promotion of Sino-Egyptian 
relations. 
  A number of economic agreements will be concluded during 
this 
visit, Musa said. 
  He said Egypt and China enjoy close ties. Egypt is the first 
Arab and African country to recognize the People's Republic of 
China. 
  Since 1956, friendly relations have developed on the basis 
of 
understanding and mutual cooperation. 
  He said Egypt supports China's joining of the GATT 
agreement, 
adding China's tremendous development in industry and free zones 
calls for enhanced co-operation between the two nations. 
  Musa voiced hope that the volume of trade between the two 
countries will increase. The two-way trade stood at 224 million 
U.S. dollars in 1993. 
  Musa will leave Cairo Wednesday [27 April] and join the 
delegation accompanying President Mubarak during his official 
visit to China. Mubarak is now in Oman.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The forthcoming visit 
to China by Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak is 
expected to be a complete success, Chinese officials here said. 
  Prior to Mubarak's arrival here tomorrow, senior Chinese 
diplomats and trade officials expressed this conviction to 
XINHUA, saying they are looking forward to the trip. 
  Reached by telephone, Chinese Ambassador to Egypt Yang 
Fuchang, who returned here for the visit, said Mubarak's 6th 
trip here will serve to enhance mutual understanding and be 
beneficial to each country's development. 
  He described Egypt, a major country in the Arab world and 
Africa, as playing a significant and unique role in the Middle 
East peace process. 
  As chairman of the Organization of African Unity, the 
Egyptian president also has an important role to play in African 
affairs, said Yang, who was vice foreign minister before he was 
appointed Chinese ambassador to Egypt. 
  China and Egypt, two ancient civilizations, have always been 
very good friends. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 
38 years ago, the two countries have maintained cooperative ties 
of friendship in fields of politics, economy, culture and 
science and technology. 
  "Egyptian Prime Minister 'Atif Sidqi once said that Chinese 
technologies suit Egypt and that the suitable ones are the 
best," he said. 
  Therefore, there is enough room for the two countries to 
further their cooperation in economic, and scientific and 
technological fields, the ambassador said. 
  China and Egypt are both striving to reform their economies 
and have achieved a lot, he said, adding that the two are faced 
with similar problems in the course of development. 
  Mubarak's visit and the bilateral contacts at various levels 
will enable the two sides to exchange in-depth views, deepen 
mutual understanding and help to further the reforms and 
economic growths in the two countries, Yang said. 
  An official from the Foreign Ministry's Asia and Africa 
Department echoed Yang's view, saying that the visit will serve 
to consolidate the friendly Sino-Egyptian cooperation and the 
traditional friendship between the two countries. 
  Calling Mubarak a respected old friend of the Chinese 
people, 
the official noted that the Egyptian president has made 
important contributions to the development of bilateral 
cooperation. 
  During the visit, Mubarak is scheduled to exchange views 
with 
Chinese leaders on the furthering of Sino-Egyptian ties, and 
regional and international issues of mutual concern. 
  Touching upon Sino-Egyptian trade links, an official from 
the 
ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation noted that 
there had been relatively rapid development in this regard in 
recent years. 
  The two-way trade volume reached over 200 million U.S. 
dollars-worth last year, making Egypt China's second-largest 
trade partner in Africa. 
  China exports to Egypt mainly food and cereals, chemical and 
light-industrial products, and machinery and electrical 
appliances, and imports iron, steel and aluminum. 
  The two huge markets provide many opportunities for the 
expansion of bilateral trade, he said. 
  China and Egypt are discussing ways to enhance their 
bilateral economic and trade cooperation, including the setting 
up in egypt of joint ventures and Chinese-owned enterprises. 
  During Mubarak's visit the two countries' leaders will 
explore cooperation in these and other fields, he said. 
  To facilitate investment and trade between China and Egypt, 
an agreement on the protection of investment between the two 
countries is expected to be signed during Mubarak's visit, he 
revealed.

  [Text] Amman, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Minister of Culture Amin 
Mahmud today met with a three-member Chinese cultural delegation 
led by Fan Zhonghui, deputy director-general of the Ministry of 
Culture, which had a stopover here on its way to Baghdad. 
  The two sides exchanged views on furthering cultural 
contacts 
and exchanges between the two countries. 
  During the meeting, Mahmud said China's political views and 
brilliant culture impressed him profoundly during his school 
years in Egypt. He said he highly appreciated China's stand of 
supporting the Palestine cause, which was made clear by late 
Premier Zhou Enlai, whom he first met in Cairo as a student in 
the audience. 
  He expressed hope that Jordanian-Chinese cultural exchanges 
will continue to develop with constant mutual visits of cultural 
troupes and teams. 
  Fan Zhonghui said that China and Jordan have enjoyed a fine 
relation in politics, economy and other fields including 
culture. He proposed that the two sides organize more 
small-scaled programs of cultural exchanges such as art 
galleries, exhibition of arts and handicrafts and troupe 
performances. 
  China has earlier agreed to provide Jordan with about 9 
million U.S. dollars to help the kingdom build a library and a 
children's hospital.

  [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen expressed the conviction here 
today that with joint efforts, the friendly ties of cooperation 
between China and Cote d'Ivoire, based on equality and mutual 
benefit, will enter into a new phase of development. 
  Qian, holding talks with Cote d'Ivoire Foreign Minister 
Amara 
Essy here this morning, described the bilateral ties in the 
political, economic and trade, cultural and other fields as 
"developing smoothly". 
  "This is embodied in the high-level exchanges between the 
two 
countries in the past two years and we are satisfied with it," 
Qian said. 
  Cote d'Ivoire is a major country in West Africa and "we 
cherish our friendship with it," Qian said, adding that China 
speaks highly of Cote d'Ivoire's wishes to develop ties with 
China. 
  The Chinese Government appreciates the peace, neutrality and 
non-alignment policy pursued by the Cote d'Ivoire Government, as 
well as its tenacious efforts to maintain unity and peace in 
Africa and its efforts for the setting up of a new world order. 
  Qian noted that China and Cote d'Ivoire share common views 
on 
many important international issues, and support and cooperate 
with each other in world affairs. This is beneficial to both 
countries under the current complicated and volatile 
international situation. 
  He reiterated that it constitutes a major part of China's 
foreign policy to develop its unity and cooperation with african 
countries. 
  Qian said after the de-colonialization, Africa faces a major 
task of developing its economy. And only after raising people's 
living standards and satisfying their rights to survival and 
development could it have the means to pursue other things. 
  Without sustained economic growth, it will be very difficult 
for the continent to develop democracy, Qian said. 
  Qian voiced China's support for the efforts to strengthen 
unity and economic integration in africa. 
  He also voiced its concern over the recent conflicts in some 
parts of the continent. Peace is the first important thing to 
these areas, Qian said. 
  Essy said his country attaches importance to its ties with 
China and follows China's development with interest. 
  He congratulated his host on the constant lifting of China's 
status on the international stage, and expressed appreciation of 
China upholding justice in world affairs and safeguarding the 
rights and interests of developing countries. 
  The Cote d'Ivoire Government is grateful to China for its 
sincere aid and help, Essy said. He also reiterated the "one 
China" stance of his country. 
  Essy and his party arrived here on Sunday [17 April] to 
begin 
a week-long goodwill visit to China as Qian's guests.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" By Teng Wenqi: "A Great Change in S. </F>
African Situation"] 
  [Text] Johannesburg, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Inkatha 
Freedom Party (IFP) decided today to participate in the April 
26-28 elections in South Africa. 
  The decision was announced by South African President 
Frederick Willem de Klerk in Pretoria today after talks among 
himself, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson 
Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 
  Observers here believe the IFP's decision to participate in 
the poll is of great importance to the current situation in 
South Africa. 
  The ruling National Party, ANC and IFP are the three largest 
political parties in South Africa. It is estimated that the 
three parties are able to obtain more than 85 percent votes in 
the elections. 
  The IFP itself boasts of the support from the majority of 
Zulus which are the biggest tribe among the black people in 
South Africa. The IFP has a strong base within the Kwazulu 
Homeland. 
  The IFP stood for the establishment of a federal or 
con-federal state for future South Africa and therefore opposed 
the 1993 interim constitution drafted by the multi-party 
negttiations and adopted by the parliament. 
  The IFP registered for the elections early March, but later 
asked for the postponement of the elections and refused to 
submit its candidates for the elections. 
  Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and six other 
foreign mediators came to South Africa on April 12 in an attempt 
to help solve the constitutional differences between the ANC and 
IFP, but failed. 
  Supporters of the ANC and IFP clashed time and again since 
1986, bringing the death toll to more than 10,000. The 
violence has been escalating since the beginning of this year. 
More than 300 people died of violence monthly. 
  De Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi signed a memorandum of 
agreement for reconciliation and peace today after their talks 
in Pretoria. 
  The memorandum said the three parties "reject violence and 
will therefore do everything in their power to ensure free and 
fair, elections throughout the Republic of South Africa." 
  In a joint statement the three leaders appealed to their 
followers and to all South Africans to end violence, to exercise 
maximum restraint and to pursue their objectives by peaceful 
means. 
  The IFP decision and the signing of the memorandum will 
greatly reduce the violence raging in South Africa. 
  The Zulus, accounting for more than twenty percent of the 
total South African people, are taking part in the elections. 
This means a great change in the elections in South Africa. 
  Buthelezi said at a press conference today "South Africans 
may well have been saved from the disastrous consequences of 
unimaginable proportions." 
  Mandela said the memorandum of agreement is "a leap forward" 
for peace, reconcilation and an inclusive election process." 
  "IFP's participation in the poll deserves the support of all 
leaders and of all those who love South Africa," Mandela stated.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (AFP) -- Beijing rejected 
Wednesday Britain's request for clemency for jailed Hong Kong 
journalist Xi Yang, saying the affair was China's "internal 
affair" and that his sentence was "appropriate." 
  "Chinese judicial departments' trial of Xi Yang according to 
law is China's internal affair," a foreign ministry spokeswoman 
said when asked for Beijing's response to British Ambassador to 
China Robin MacLaren's appeal Tuesday for clemency. 
  "In light of the facts of the crime committed by Xi Yang, 
the 
sentence given to him by our judicial department is 
appropriate," she said, referring to the 12-year term passed 
down on the MING PAO newspaper reporter in a secret trial in 
March for allegedly stealing state secrets. 
  The appeal by 38-year-old Xi against the heavy sentence was 
briskly rejected by a court here last week, sparking large 
protests in Hong Kong amid concern over press freedom after the 
British territory's reversion to Chinese rule in 1997. 
  The United States has also added its voice to the protests, 
with the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong issuing a statement Tuesday 
saying Xi's sentence was "far out of proportion to the acts he 
allegedly committed." 
  The journalist's arrest followed the publication of a report 
on Chinese financial and banking policy, which the Beijing court 
ruled was based on secret documents illegally obtained by Xi 
from a Chinese bank employee. 
  The bank employee has been jailed for 15 years. 
  In Hong Kong, a spokesman for MING PAO dismissed the 
Chinese foreign ministry's remarks, saying the ministry is "not 
in a position to decide." 
  "According to the Chinese constitution, the standing 
committee of the National People's Congress has the power to 
decide on clemency appeals," he said. 
  The spokesman added that the newspaper had yet to decide 
whether to make a formal appeal.

<F P=106> [By Tad Stoner] </F>
  [Text] The Chinese government has extended a period of 
tough restrictions on the operations of the BBC on the mainland 
by six months. The limits on coverage include severe 
restrictions on reporting by the broadcaster's Beijing 
correspondents and a ban on the entry of film crews and radio 
reporters. These moves have reduced the BBC's news gathering to 
public press functions around the capital. The restrictions, 
previously set to apply until mid- summer, have now been renewed 
for another six months, according to sources close to the BBC. 
  The limits, never officially announced, were placed on the 
corporation after Beijing warned Britain about "serious 
consequences" if it allowed the BBC to screen a controversial 
documentary, Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor, a critical account 
of the late Communist Party chief's life. The hour-long film 
was never shown in China or on World Service Television, but 
drew heated protests from Beijing, infuriated by the broadcast 
on the BBC's United Kingdom domestic service. 
  Quoting contacts in the Chinese capital, BBC sources last 
night said mainland authorities had "upgraded" the corporation 
to a list of "unfriendly" and possibly dangerous foreign media. 
The sources said both the foreign and broadcast ministries in 
Beijing had circulated documents ordering provincial and local 
authorities to "avoid relations" with the BBC, and to treat any 
requests by correspondents "coolly". "The other thing is a ban 
on all BBC reporters visiting China," one source said. 
  "Usually, at any time, you're likely to have BBC teams in 
China, all up to various things: documentaries, World Service 
Television. 
  "Since the Mao documentary, though, no one from the BBC had 
received official permission to go into China." 
  Authorities refused to allow BBC coverage of the National 
People's Congress in March, despite the presence of American, 
Canadian, German, and Japanese crews. 
  "When Xinhua (the New China News Agency) in Hong Kong made 
it 
clear that no one would get visas, London sent a letter to the 
government through the Beijing bureau and there was no 
response," a source said. 
  The corporation's two Beijing correspondents, James Miles 
and 
Carrie Gracie, have had at least three applications for internal 
travel refused since December, while local authorities have 
maintained their longstanding refusal to accredit a camera crew 
to the service. "It's been almost a ban, except that the one 
application that was granted was for a time when they couldn't 
go," a source said. 
  Another source said: "The indications we've had, as to when 
applications for travel or entry might be convenient, were 
originally that July would be the time. Now, though, the 
Chinese embassy in London has suggested that it would be a year 
(after the Mao documentary was shown)." 
  Problems created by the documentary have been compounded by 
deteriorating Sino-British relations over Hong Kong and what one 
executive described as the increasing popularity of the BBC as 
it offers Mandarin-language TV broadcasts and wider penetration 
via transmission facilities in South Korea and Japan. The 
departure on Sunday of World Service Television from Star TV's 
north Asia broadcast service, which includes China and Hong 
Kong, has drawn no response from Beijing.

<F P=106> [By Ren Kan: "London Exchange Lures Chinese Firms"] </F>
  [Text] The London Stock Exchange yesterday wooed Chinese 
firms in a bid to participate in the country's economic boom. 
  The exchange held a seminar in Beijing, at which it 
introduced itself to Chinese business leaders and explained how 
firms can list their shares on the London market. 
  The seminar attracted officials from some large firms, 
securities companies and banks. 
  The exchange showed its commitment to working with the 
Chinese by sending Nigel Atkinson, head of listings, to the 
conference. This followed the March visit to Beijing by the 
chairman of the exchange. 
  The British delegation, which arrived last Saturday, had a 
series of detailed discussions with Chinese securities 
authorities. Atkinson described the talks as very constructive. 
  "It is still in an early stage, but I believe the 
willingness 
on both sides will take the talks forward," he said. 
  The discussions were aimed at briefing Chinese authorities 
on 
the regulatory requirements of the exchange, he said. The 
London group will also find out if Chinese firms have any 
special requirements, he added. 
  "We are conscious of the special requirements in Hong Kong," 
Atkinson said. "We need to make a study as to whether we need to 
do something similar in London." 
  He added that his side wants a formal agreement signed to 
ensure the Chinese understand stock exchange rules. 
  And the China Securities Regulatory Commission is expected 
to 
come up with a formal memorandum. 
  Atkinson said the number of Chinese firms seeking overseas 
listing will group rapidly in the coming years. 
  "We feel it is very important for London to respond to the 
need as an international stock market," he said. A number of 
Chinese companies have already expressed interest in listing 
shares in London, he said. 
  But before they formally apply to London, they need approval 
from Chinese authorities. 
  "We are waiting for our turn," he said. "We hope it will be 
soon and the capital market in London is very keen to 
participate in Chinese is sues." 
  The central government has selected 22 domestic firms for 
possible overseas listing this year. Most of them will be 
listed in Hong Kong with some in New York or London. 
  Atkinson said Chinese firms which will arouse international 
investors attention have substantial growth potential. 
  And they will need good long-term prospects, he said. 
  If Chinese firms want to list their shares in London, the 
first thing to do is to appoint a sponsor familiar with that 
market, he said.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Chang Weimin: " Rolls Royce Coasts Over </F>
the Great Wall"] 
  [Text] Rolls Royce Motor Cars yesterday signed an 
agreement with a Hong Kong firm to exclusively import its 3.75 
million yuan ($431,000) luxury sedans to the Chinese mainland. 
  And the British car maker plans to set up a series of multi- 
million dollar dealerships and service centres in cities like 
Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. 
  The new company, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of China, will 
invest 
in parts plants and training centres, said Ian Skeggs, of 
Inchape Motors International in Hong Kong. 
  However, a source close to Rolls Royce said it had ruled out 
manufacturing cars in China because local workers were not as 
skilled as those in Britain. 
  Demand for the expensive cars in China has been on the rise, 
prompting the import deal with Inchape, executives said. 
  Michael Donovan, a Rolls Royce managing director, signed the 
deal with Skeggs yesterday on the Great Wall. 
  "This new venture provides us with a great opportunity to 
show our confidence in the future, our commitment to Asia in 
general and China in particular," Donovan said. 
  "It's an indication of the dynamic approach our new 
re-vitalized company is making to ensure that our future is as 
glorious as our past." 
  Rolls Royce's has sold 50 cars on the mainland in the past 
18 
months. Donovan said rising demand has given him confidence in 
the market. 
  Sales in 1992 hit 10 cars, in 1993, 30 units. And in the 
first quarter of this year, 11 sedans were sold. 
  The cars cost 1.5 million Yuan ($172,000) each on average, 
not including the 150 percent tariff they face which boosts the 
total price tag to about 3.75 million yuan ($430,000). 
  The government early this year cancelled preferential 
policies, which allowed foreign-funded ventures to buy duty-free 
imported cars. 
  Donovan said that the tax change will not hamper business 
because of Rolls' long-term commitment to the country. 
  He denied rumours that Rolls Royce is opening markets in 
China because business is plummeting in Britain and across the 
world. 
  After experiencing extreme difficulties in 1991 and 1992, 
business began to turn around last year, he said. 
  And the first quarter of this year continued the gradual 
upturn wit 10 percent growth over the same period last year, 
Donovan said.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Wu Huizhong (0702 1920 1813)] </F>
  [Text] Santiago, 16 Apr (XINHUA) -- General Chi Haotian, 
Chinese state councillor and defense minister, said here today 
that the foundation of cooperation between China and Latin 
America in the political, economic, science and technology, and 
military fields is solid, and that the prospects of cooperation 
are broad. 
  Chi Haotian made these remarks to a XINHUA correspondent 
after concluding his two-week formal visits to Brazil, Uruguay, 
and Chile. 
  Chi Haotian stated: As the first Chinese defense minister to 
visit Latin America since the founding of new China, my visits 
were accorded warm and friendly receptions by the governments, 
militaries, and peoples of Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. This 
fully expressed Latin America's deep affection and sincere 
friendship for the Chinese Government, military, and people. 
  Chi Haotian added: The state and military leaders of these 
countries all expressed their wishes to strengthen and broaden 
the scope of cooperation and exchange with China in all fields. 
They hailed China's policy of reform and opening up, and its 
independent foreign policy of peace without seeking hegemonism. 
They very much admire efforts by the Chinese Government and 
people to develop their own country, and hoped China will become 
stronger and make contributions to achieving lasting world peace 
and stability. 
  Chi Haotian added that China can learn and make use of many 
things in the economic construction and troop building of these 
Latin American nations. 
  Chi Haotian said his visits were completely successful and 
had achieved the purpose of enhancing mutual understanding, 
learning from each other, broadening the scope of cooperation, 
and furthering friendship.

<F P=106> [Article by Cai Hong from the "Opinion" page: "Decrees </F>
Construct Legal Basis for Religious Rights"] 
  [Text] Two decrees issued by the State Council earlier 
this year will ensure legal protection for legitimate religious 
activities and exchanges between Chinese religious groups and 
their overseas counterparts on the basis of friendliness and 
mutual respect, according to a prestigious figure in China's 
religious circle. 
  "The two mandates mean a breakthrough in establishing a 
legal 
framework for China's religious sector," said Dr Han Wenzhao, 
vice-president of the China Christian Council. 
  The decrees issued on January 31, are the Regulations for 
the 
Control of Sites of Religious Activities and the Regulations for 
the Control of Religious Activities of Aliens in the Territory 
of the People's Republic of China. 
  In drafting the regulations, Chinese authorities solicited 
opinions of the religious circles. 
  "We are satisfied with the decrees," Han said, "since the 
two 
regulations will act as legal protection for normal religious 
activities and exchanges between Chinese religious groups and 
their overseas counterparts on the basis of equality and mutual 
respect." 
  The two laws affirm the Chinese authorities respect for 
foreigners' religious freedoms. Aliens are guaranteed the right 
to participate in normal religious activities and to have 
friendly exchanges with Chinese religious circles. 
  According to Han, the edicts have seized headlines and 
gripped imaginations abroad. Some foreigners assumed the 
regulations meant that new controls would be imposed on 
religious activities in China. 
  "Most of the foreign articles I have read are inaccurate," 
Han said. He criticized reports that triggered unnecessary 
apprehension among the overseas friends who are concerned with 
Chinese affairs. 
  He maintained that the two rules would be instrumental to 
encouraging Chinese religious associations' ongoing friendly 
exchanges with their counterparts in other countries. 
  "If there are some restrictions, they are designed for the 
foreigners who are engaged in illegal, guileful activities in 
China," Han said. 
  The regulations uphold the principle articulated in China's 
Constitution that the country's religious groups and religious 
affairs should not be directed by overseas forces. No foreigner 
should interfere in China's religious affairs. 
  The eighth article of the regulations on the management of 
religious activities of aliens, for example stipulates that 
"foreigners must not set up religious organizations, offices or 
sites in China, recruit religious followers among Chinese 
citizens, or appoint religious ecclesiastics." 
  Just 10 days after the promulgation of the two laws, seven 
people from the Hong Kong Revival Christian Church, including 
the Reverend Dennis Balcomb, were detained for several days in 
Henan Province for their illicit religious activities. 
  The incident touched off erroneous stories in some overseas 
newspapers. 
  The Reverend Balcomb is not a new name in China. He wrote a 
statement of repentance several years ago when he was given a 
serious warning for similar illegal undertakings, Han said. 
  Today, peace and development are the common pursuits of 
people worldwide, requiring an environment of conciliation. 
Objective and accurate reporting will help create better 
understanding between different peoples. 
  Although the Cold War has drawn to a close, the influence of 
the media from that time lingers. Quite a few people abroad 
have taken it for granted that the atheistic Chinese Communist 
Party (CPC), the ruling party in China, racks its brains to wipe 
out religion. 
  "Biased, they turn a blind eye to or disbelieve in the 
achievements made by the State's religious policies," Han said. 
  The reality of' Chinese Christians has long been ignored by 
the foreign press. 
  When visiting the United States in 1993, Han talked about 
Christian honesty and ethics with Christian journalists from the 
major news media. 
  He called for impartial reporting, both domestic and 
overseas, to enhance understanding between China and the rest of 
the world. 
  Han notes that only a few foreigners are malicious to China. 
Many Christian associations and individuals abroad deem the two 
Chinese decrees as fair and reasonable. 
  Han said his Christian council is grateful for the 
clarification made by 21 foreign Christian reverends residing in 
Hong Kong. 
  The past decade has witnessed dramatic changes in China's 
Christendom. According to Han, 8,000 churches are now open to 
Christians. On top of that, China has set up 13 seminaries to 
train clergy for its 6 million to 7 million Christian believers. 
  Since 1985, the Amity Foundation, founded by Christian 
believers in China, has been sponsoring around 80 foreign 
teachers annually for China's institutions of higher learning.

<F P=106> [By reporter He Jingsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 11 Mar (XINHUA) -- Addressing a national 
telephone conference last evening on the task of turning 
enterprise losses into profits, State Council Vice Premier Zou 
Jiahua stressed: Leaders at all levels should increase their 
understanding of the task and implement positive measures to 
earnestly and effectively undertake the job of turning losses 
into profits as a major economic task for this year. 
  Zou Jiahua said: Some results have been obtained in the task 
of turning losses into profits nationwide last year. However, 
the huge losses of state-owned enterprises is currently still a 
prominent economic problem. The situation has not only brought 
losses to enterprises but also created great financial 
difficulties for the state and localities. In addition, it has 
direct and adverse effects on a sustained, rapid, and healthy 
economic development, as well as affected the smooth process of 
enterprise reform. Enterprise losses will lead to lower living 
standards and increased difficulties for workers as well as 
directly affect social stability. We must understand the 
importance, necessity, and urgency of the task of addressing 
enterprise losses from a strategic high plain. Thus, Zou Jiahua 
asked departments at all levels to effectively tackle the 
following tasks: 1) Strengthen leadership, formulate plans, and 
establish the responsibility system. Localities and departments 
should, in accordance with actual conditions, outline goals and 
programs for turning losses into profits as well as implement 
the programs with plans. It is necessary to determine persons 
responsible for the task as well as mobilize and rely on the 
masses for resolving the loss problem. Leading cadres at all 
levels must become personally involved in resolving prominent 
problems of their localities. 2) Earnestly analyze causes of 
enterprise losses and offer systematic guidance aimed at 
addressing the causes. 3) Stress the tasks of turning losses 
into profits in some key industries and enterprises. We must 
undertake the tasks in coal, oil, textile, and light industries, 
particularly in localities and state-owned enterprises whose 
losses are over 40 percent or 1 billion yuan. 4) Departments at 
all levels must assist enterprises to resolve their difficulties 
and enterprises must strive to turn around their losses. While 
actively promoting reform, enterprises at all levels should, in 
accordance with the demand of domestic and foreign markets, 
actively readjust product mix, strive to manufacture marketable 
products, continue to develop new products, realistically and 
strictly strengthen operations control, explore internal 
potential, and demand efficiency from management. In addition, 
enterprises must implement technological modifications, utilize 
new technologies, and seek to upgrade efficiency with 
technological applications. Enterprises should also arouse the 
people's enthusiasm in increasing production and conserving 
spending. Banks should extend circulating fund loans to 
enterprises that are capable of turning losses into profits. 
Finance departments should release funds due for loss subsidies 
as soon as possible. 
  At the conference, Wang Zhongyu, minister of state economics 
and trade commission, outlined specific plans for this year's 
tasks of turning losses into profits. He said: Enterprises at 
all levels must effectively identify their principal products. 
They should modify, limit, or eliminate the production of 
low-grade products of small market sales, while increasing the 
production of marketable products to conquer the market. 
Enterprises at all levels must strive to improve internal 
efficiency, formulate operations policies and strategies, reduce 
stockpiles, quicken fund turnover, and upgrade efficiency in 
fund application. We must do a good job in screening and 
evaluating the assets of deficit-ridden enterprises to properly 
account for their assets. When there is no hope to rescue an 
enterprise whose funds cannot meet its debts, experiments in 
bankruptcy should be carried out in accordance with the 
"Bankruptcy Law." Wang Zhongyu pointed out: It is necessary to 
carry out the task of turning losses into profits by closely 
centering on the guidelines for invigorating large and medium 
state-owned enterprises. It is necessary to target localities, 
industries, and enterprises, identify situations, and offer 
systematic guidance to score results in our tasks.

<F P=106> [By reporter Chen Jinwu (7115 6855 2976)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- The National People's 
Congress [NPC] Committee for Education, Science, Culture, and 
Health and the China Patent Bureau met in Beijing today to mark 
the 10th anniversary of the promulgation of the PRC Patent Law. 
  In a greeting letter sent to the meeting, Vice Premier Li 
Lanqing represents the State Council and congratulates the 
successes achieved since the promulgation of the law 10 years 
ago. He says in the letter: The past decade was a period in 
which the Patent Law was implemented along with the policy of 
reform and opening up. During this decade, China's formerly 
nonexistent patent system has developed rapidly from a small one 
into a big one. After the law was amended in 1993 in 
particular, the level of China's protection for patents has 
basically reached that of the world. This law not only has 
implemented the party's policy of respecting knowledge and 
intellectuals and significantly aroused the zeal of scientists, 
technicians, and the masses to engage in inventions, but also 
has created a good legal environment and good legal conditions 
for carrying out reforms, opening up to the outside world, 
bringing in foreign capital, and launching joint ventures and 
cooperative projects. 
  Li Lanqing continues: As economic and 
scientific-technological competition has become increasingly 
vigorous among countries today, protection for patents and 
intellectual property rights has become increasingly important, 
and governments of all countries are attaching great importance 
to the protection of intellectual property rights. This issue 
has become an important part of all countries in promoting 
foreign economic relations, trade, and diplomacy. The Chinese 
Government also attaches great importance to this issue, and the 
"Decision on Strengthening the Protection for Intellectual 
Property Rights" which the State Council will soon promulgate 
will be instrumental for China to intensify its efforts in 
protecting patents and intellectual property rights in China. 
Thus, as our reforms continue to proceed, our opening up policy 
continues to broaden, and our socialist market economic system 
continues to improve, we must waste no time in intensifying our 
efforts in protecting patents and intellectual property rights. 
We must intensify our efforts in publicizing and enforcing the 
Patent Law and in supervising its implementation, energetically 
heighten the whole society's patent awareness, especially the 
awareness of leading cadres of departments in charge of science, 
technology, economic affairs, and trade. We must make sure 
that issues relevant to patents and intellectual property rights 
are placed high on our agendas. 
  Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat 
and president of the Supreme People's Court, attended and 
addressed the meeting. He said: In the last decade, not only 
have we had a rather comprehensive Patent Law, which is up to 
advanced international standards, as well as other supporting 
regulations, but we have also made conspicuous and substantial 
headway in areas governing patent application, patent 
authorization, and patent protection. In a sense, the market 
economy is an economy based on law. The Patent Law is an 
important law for safeguarding the order of the market economy 
and protecting fair competition. The trend of development over 
the past several years shows that people have become 
increasingly aware of the importance of using legal measures to 
safeguard patent owners' legitimate rights and interests, to 
stop patent infringements, and to prevent patent disputes; and 
that tasks in protecting patents have become increasingly 
arduous. Ren Jianxin urged people's courts and patent offices 
at all levels to work even closer, train more personnel 
specializing in patent protection, intensify efforts in handling 
cases about patent infringement, strictly punish patent 
violators, and fairly handle each and every case of patent 
dispute so as to safeguard China's patent system and create a 
new situation for patent protection. 
  Present at the meeting were Fei Xiaotong and Wu Jieping, 
vice 
chairmen of the NPC Standing Committee; comrades in charge of 
the NPC Committee for Education, Science, Culture, and Health; 
comrades in charge of the NPC Standing Committee's Law 
Committee; comrades in charge of relevant departments and 
committees of the State Council; and representatives from legal 
circles and some enterprises in the capital.

"State Statistical Bureau Spokesman Says First Quarter Sees 
Economic Growth at 9 to 10 Percent"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr (TA KUNG PAO) -- At a press 
conference held here today, Ye Zhen, spokesman for the State 
Statistics Bureau, said: The mainland's economic operation in 
the first quarter shows that the comprehensive appraisal of the 
country's economy has shifted from the "red light" and "yellow 
light" situation at the end of last year to the current 
situation of "yellow light" and "green light." Economic growth 
in the first quarter has reached the expected goal of 9 to 10 
percent which was the overall target of macroeconomic regulation 
and control. 
  Giving an account of the first quarter, Ye Zhen pointed out: 
GNP for the first quarter totaled 862 billion yuan. Viewed 
from the internal economic structure, the excessive increase in 
production, construction, and sales has dropped somewhat. Of 
this, added value of industry amounted to 533 billion yuan, an 
increase of 16 percent over the same period in 1993. Energy 
production also increased steadily. Investment by the state 
sector in fixed assets totaled 81.5 billion yuan, an increase of 
36.2 percent over 1993. The investment set up had the following 
three characteristics: First, the growth in local projects 
decreased while that of central projects increased rapidly; 
second, transportation, post, and telecommunications further 
strengthened; and third, the confusion in real estate was 
brought under control and the number of housing projects aimed 
at improving basic housing conditions increased. The volume of 
retail sales in the first quarter totaled 352.2 billion yuan, 3 
to 4 percent lower than normal years. The overall market 
situation remained steady with some slack. In the first 
quarter, average real income of urban and rural inhabitants for 
living expenses rose by 9.3 and 13.1 percent respectively over 
the same period last year. 
  Ye Zhen's account of the first quarter continued: First, 
exports increased sharply and the exchange rates remained 
steady. The volume of exports in the first quarter totaled 
$19.1 billion, up 18.2 percent from the corresponding period of 
1993; the volume of exports [word as published] reached 29.4 
billion yuan, up 18.2 percent, with imports exceeding exports by 
$1.3 billion. [figures as published] Second, revenue increased 
steadily and expenditure remained normal. Revenue in the first 
quarter increased by 21.4 percent and expenditure was up 23.8 
percent. Third, the financial situation was stable as was the 
withdrawal of currency from circulation. In the first quarter, 
the banks granted 35.1 billion yuan in loans and received 207.2 
billion yuan in deposits. The currency put into circulation 
before the Spring Festival was withdrawn by the end of March. 
  Meanwhile, Ye Zhen stressed that, viewed from the economic 
situation during the first quarter, we still face serious 
difficulties and problems and the tasks for the next stage are 
extremely arduous. The difficulties and problems include: 
First, soaring prices. In the first quarter, the country's 
retail prices, mainly of the basic necessities, rose 20.1 
percent compared to last year. The highest rates were 
registered in Haikou, 34.1 percent; Urumqi, 30.6 percent; and 
Nanjing, 30.1 percent. Moreover, prices rose 24 percent in 
Beijing, 26.3 percent in Tianjin, 23.3 percent in Shanghai, and 
24.3 percent in Guangzhou. Thanks to the measures adopted by 
the government at all levels, Ye said, price increases eased 
somewhat in March. Second, difficulties in the operation and 
production of state enterprises were further aggravated. In the 
first quarter, state industry increased by only 2.2 percent over 
the same period last year and both the number of losing 
enterprises and the amount of their deficits increased. Some 
49.6 percent of enterprises suffered losses, with the amount of 
deficits totaling 15.7 billion yuan. The main reasons include: 
The failure of enterprises to change their mechanisms; hidden 
deficits were made public following the reform of the accounting 
system; and overall losses did not increase but losses in 
certain enterprises increased somewhat following the tax reform 
and enterprises which had made small profits in the past turned 
into loss-making enterprises. Third, there are still hidden 
worries in agricultural production, the gap in incomes between 
urban and rural inhabitants further widened, and some households 
with low incomes could not make both ends meet. 
  Ye Zhen said that macroeconomic control and regulation is 
now 
at a crucial stage and consideration will be given to stable 
prices and economic growth in the future.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Control over the 
expansion of credits will continue even though the financial 
situation nationwide is stable, a People's Bank of China [PBC] 
official said today. 
  This decision of the central bank was taken in view of 
soaring prices, said Vice-President Dai Xianglong of the bank. 
  As some state-owned enterprises are facing increasing 
financial difficulties, banks will extend loans for operational 
funds on a case-to-case basis while continuing to tighten the 
control over investment in fixed assets, Dai added. 
  Speaking at a national conference now in session here, the 
bank official described China's financial situation as 
"generally good" while "problems do exist." 
  By the end of March, he noted, three billion yuan had been 
withdrawn from circulation in the spring festival shopping 
spree, meaning that the total amount of newly issued bank notes 
in circulation was 25 billion yuan less than a year ago. 
  In the first quarter of this year, savings deposits by urban 
and rural residents throughout the country was 117 billion yuan 
more than the same 1993 period. Bank deposits by enterprises 
last month was 26 billion yuan more. 
  Also in the first quarter, banks and rural credit 
cooperatives extended an additional 15.7 billion yuan in 
agricultural loans, 3.8 billion yuan more than a year ago. Key 
construction projects "have had better-than-expected access to 
funds," he said. 
  Meanwhile, the PBC vice-president warned that investment in 
fixed assets, taken as a whole, was still "too large" and 
inflation "was showing no sign of improvement." 
  "We must remain cool-headed," he said, asserting that the 
central bank would continue focusing on stabilizing the currency 
to ensure "an appropriate rate of economic growth."

<F P=106> [By reporter Ding Genxi (0002 2704 0823)] </F>
  [Text] Guiyang, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national 
meeting of managers of chemical and light industrial companies 
here recently, Ma Yimin, vice minister of internal trade, urged 
cadres and workers of chemical and light industrial companies, 
as well as material supply enterprises throughout the country, 
to step up analysis and forecast of the market, to seize the 
opportunity to meet challenges, and to push the stamina and 
economic efficiency of chemical and light industrial as well as 
material supply departments in China to a new height. 
  He said: This year, with the state further tightening 
control over credit, the shortage of funds will remain. 
Therefore, all material supply enterprises should take 
effective measures to overcome the effect of unfavorable 
factors, should tap the potential for increased financial 
revenues, and should strive to improve management and operations 
and to raise the efficiency of using funds, thereby pushing the 
overall efficiency of material supply departments to a new 
height. 
  He said: In recent years, quite a few material supply 
enterprises have benefited from market analysis and forecast, 
earning profits year after year. However, some enterprises 
failed to attach importance to market analysis and to draw an 
accurate assessment of the situation, thus performing poorly and 
decreasing their efficiency whenever the market fluctuated. 
This year, the total demand and supply of capital goods are 
both expected to increase by a relatively large margin and to be 
balanced in general. However, prices of capital goods will be 
affected by the state's policies, energy, communications, and 
international market changes, in addition to supply and demand. 
Therefore, under the general trend of balanced supply and 
demand, we still cannot rule out price fluctuations, or 
relatively big price fluctuations of certain commodities in some 
regions during a given period of time. Hence, each and every 
material supply department is required to obtain a good grasp of 
the state's policies in a timely manner, to collect information 
of all kinds, and to step up dynamic analysis and forecast of 
various commodities in order to keep abreast of market trends 
and changes and to make decisions on operational strategies. 
Only by so doing can material supply enterprises become 
profitable and be able to continually expand and enliven their 
operations.

  [Text] Beijing, 3 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The 
construction of coastal shelter forests, one of China's key 
forestry ecological engineering projects, is progressing 
rapidly. At present, over 14,000 km of major continental 
coastal forest shelter belts exist, forming a "Green Great Wall." 
  Since the beginning of the construction of China's coastal 
shelter forest system in 1988, over 30 million mu of land has 
been afforested in six years. Since 1991, in particular, the 
speed of the construction of coastal forest shelter belts in 
various localities has increased rapidly. In a span of three 
years, 20 million mu of land has been afforested along more than 
5,000 km of coastline. 
  Fujian, Hainan, and Qingdao are at the country's forefront 
in 
growing coastal shelter forests. On the basis of fulfilling the 
task of the first phase project in growing coastal forest 
shelter belts in 1992, Fujian Province began last year to 
concentrate its efforts on expanding major coastal forest belts 
and farmland forest nets, and has built a 3,100 km "Green Great 
Wall" along the province's 3,300 km coastline. Hainan Province 
has grown over 1,400 km of major forest belts along its more 
than 1,500 km coastline. 
  The construction of the coastal shelter forest system has 
greatly reduced the impact of typhoons, tidal waves, and 
rainstorms, which occur several times a year, and has given 
effective protection to 48 million mu of farmland. Half of the 
counties on coastal plains have grown farmland forest nets and 
one-third of the coastal mountain counties have grown trees on 
all barren hills and mountains. This apparently has improved 
the ecological environment, and even the investment environment 
of coastal areas.

  [Text] Beijing, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China reports a 
steady growth in steel output in the first quarter of this year, 
with steel products made to meet the needs of the market, the 
mix of production improving and profits uplifting. 
  Still, the steel industry has found itself in a tight 
corner, 
due to insufficient funds, debt chains that have long been 
harassing its enterprises, and relatively low output of iron ore. 
  Data released on Tuesday [19 April] by the Ministry of the 
Metallurgical Industry show that in the first quarter of this 
year China turned out about 22.954 million tons of steel, 22.149 
million tons of iron and 20.293 million tons of rolled steel, a 
hefty rise of 7.66 percent, 11.30 percent and 9.47 percent over 
the same period of last year, respectively. 
  Steel production in the first quarter featured a high growth 
rate in the output of continuous-cast steel ingots. 
  More than 8.86 million tons of continuous-cast steel ingots 
was produced from January through March this year, an increase 
of 1.867 million tons over the same period of last year. Its 
proportion in the total output rose from 32.82 percent to 38.62 
percent, meeting the requirements set for the year-end. 
  The mix of the first quarter's production was also 
characterized by the iron and steel producers' satisfaction of 
market needs. They concentrated on raising the output of the 
steel products that are badly needed by national economic 
construction. 
  The output of heavy rails needed by the Beijing-Kowloon 
railway project, for example, jumped by 112,200 tons, a sturdy 
54.19 percent rise over the previous year's figure. 
  The production of light rails, silicon steel, and various 
types of steel plates and wires also increased by a big margin, 
and the growth rate of alloy steel jumped by 36.64 percent. 
  However, by the end of February the amount of credit due 
topped 60.7 billion yuan for the whole sector and the amount of 
debt hit 42.1 billion yuan, increases of 146 percent and 134 
percent, respectively, over the same period of last year. 
  The iron and steel enterprises are still in financial 
straits, lacking working capital. 
  In addition, the planned iron ore output in the first 
quarter 
this year was 7.91 million tons short.

<F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Ministry Steps Up Bid to Preserve </F>
Nation's Farmland"] 
  [Text] The central government is to boost the number of 
farmland preservation zones around the country, the Agriculture 
Ministry said yesterday. 
  The move is part of a bid to keep the arable acreage at 
roughly current levels until the end of the century-levels which 
are still nearly 20 million hectares short of what China needs 
to feed and clothe its people. 
  And it comes as the government makes every possible effort 
to 
preserve the country's farmland which has been overwhelmed in 
recent years by the growth of towns and cities. 
  The move was initiated by the State Council and aims to curb 
the use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes, a ministry 
official said. 
  And now a set of rules and regulations to protect farmland 
have been jointly drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and 
the State Land Administration and they will be issued later this 
year the official said. 
  The regulations say all non-agricultural use of farmland 
must 
be first approved by the authorities and the user will be 
required to pay for such use. However the official declined to 
elaborate. 
  China has only about 96 million hectares of arable land to 
feed its 1.2 billion people. That's about 0.087 hectares of 
land per head. 
  Chinese agricultural experts believed the minimum 
requirement 
is 110 million hectares of grain cropland, plus 5.7 million 
hectares of cotton-growing land. 
  Nevertheless, the limited farmland is still being overrun by 
an invasion of industrial and residential developments, said 
land administration officials. 
  A report in the Beijing-based ECONOMIC REFERENCE NEWS, says 
747,000 hectares of farmland have been lost in the past two 
years, particularly affecting grain and cotton crops. 
  The State Council, China's cabinet, launched a basic 
farmland 
preservation drive in 1992, urging all local governments to put 
mandatory preservation orders on their high-yield cropland. 
  The programme covers rich rural land, suburban vegetable 
farms, and national or local agricultural production centres. 
  The pilot programme has so far led some 900 counties, or 45 
per cent of the country's total, to set up protection zones. 
  In Shanxi Province, protection orders have been put on 3 
million hectares of land, 61 per cent of its total, while zones 
have been set up to cover 80 per cent--4 million hectares--of 
the counties in Jiangsu Province. 
  Meanwhile, most of local governments have also issued 
related 
regulations, rules or policies specifying details of the 
programme. However, the official said some problems still exist 
such as the lack of management of the protected zones and the 
regional protectionism. 
  To make up the massive land deficit, China has launched 
several projects to reclaim or develop its 33 million hectares 
of wasteland and switch some of its 333 million hectares of 
grassland to agricultural use.

  [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Forceful measures 
have been taken in central and south China to expand the 
rice-growing area this spring. 
  Nine rice-growing provinces reported a combined increase of 
rice cultivation area of over 66,000 ha this year although the 
labor force has been reduced gradually due to the relatively low 
profits from rice-growing. 
  In central China's Hunan Province, the total rice-growing 
land remained at over 1.66 million ha, and that for early-season 
rice expanded to more than 730,000 ha, a sturdy 10 percent rise 
from last year. 
  In Guangdong, a booming coastal province in South China, 
over 
50 grain-producing counties have been set up and a series of 
preferential policies enacted to encourage farmers to grow more 
rice. 
  Thanks to the steps taken by the local government and the 
rise of rice prices, the province has cultivated about 670,000 
ha of fine- breed rice, an increase of over 130,000 ha from the 
same period of last year. 
  The provincial government in Zhejiang, in East China, has 
assured farmers that early rice will be purchased at a price of 
96 yuan per 100 kg this year. In addition, the contracted price 
will be adjusted according to any new price rate. 
  The early-rice land in the province has reached about 
870,000 
ha this year, 60,000 ha more than last year. 
  Great efforts have also been made to expand the rice-growing 
areas in other provinces and regions throughout the country, 
including Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan and Anhui Provinces. 
  The local governments have decided to offer more loans to 
back grain production this year and help farmers to overcome any 
kind of problem likely to hinder the increase of the grain 
output.

  [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- With IBM, Compaq and 
other world big-name computer businesses biting into the 
burgeoning China market, China's largest computer enterprise has 
mapped out a blueprint to vie for a larger share both of the 
home and the world markets. 
  According to Vice-President Li Qin of the Beijing Legend 
Computer Group Corporation, the corporation sold a total of more 
than 27,000 microcomputers, or seven percent of the Chinese 
market, to rank top among the country's computer enterprises and 
companies. 
  He said that his corporation will strive to raise its sales 
volume to 45,000 to 50,000 sets, or some ten percent of the 
domestic market. 
  Almost all of the world's well-known computer manufacturers 
and companies are betting on the Chinese market, the potentially 
largest single market of the world. They have virtually ignited 
a battle for a share of the China market, Li said. 
  He added that many Chinese computer undertakings have been 
forced out of business as their foreign counterparts keep 
encroaching. 
  His Legend group has to outpace or at least follow closely 
the development tempo of the home market, if it is to survive 
the ever tougher market competition, the vice-president stressed. 
  Official statistics show that the sales volume of computers 
in China last year was up 80 percent over 1992, but the market 
share for Chinese-made computers declined, standing at 37.8 
percent of the total. 
  Li disclosed that his corporation will undertake drastic 
changes this year, as it has laid down a package of bold reform 
measures designed to help institute an operating set-up that 
will reflect market fluctuations. 
  The corporation will, to the fullest extent, bank on 
high-tech advantages to renew its product models as fast as the 
world market alters. Meanwhile, it will tap both the visible 
and invisible resources brought in by its brand-name products 
and the credible image that the company enjoys, according to Li. 
  To respond to the market more promptly, the corporation will 
this year improve its purchasing and selling channels as well as 
the form of credits and loans. It will also cut down the 
delivery time from more than three months to less than a month. 
  The vice-president said that his company expects to bring 10 
percent off the cost of computers by speeding up working capital 
turnover and reducing expenditure, so as to make Legend brands 
more competitive in terms of pricing. 
  To cater to the diversifying needs of the domestic market, 
the Legend group has been engaged in developing high-quality and 
inexpensive new models while promoting its already first-class 
brand names. 
  Li said that his company will spare no efforts to improve 
the 
current agency system. At least some 200 agents will be added 
this year to help form a national distributing and marketing 
network characterized by branch companies, occupational agents 
and regionally-stationed agents. 
  Meanwhile, the legend group will spend five million yuan to 
raise the number of maintenance centers from 31 to 70, scattered 
across the country. The guarantee period will also be extended 
from one year to three years so as to provide better after-sale 
service for all customers. 
  The vice-president said that the corporation will earmark a 
further 10 million yuan for publicity to make both the company 
and its brands better known. 
  According to him, the corporation has reformed its 
management 
regime and re-organized its leadership, giving all departments 
autonomy in personnel matters, budgeting and policy-making. 
  He said that nine out of ten general managers of the 
corporation's 43 branches are in their thirties. 
  According to Yang Yuanqing, a branch manager, Legend brand 
computers have outplayed their national cousins in sales volume 
for two years running. The corporation now produces one tenth 
of the world's total output of major computer components. 
  The assets of the Legend group has grown from a mere 200,000 
yuan in 1984, when it was established, to more than 400 million 
yuan, and it has set up -- at home and abroad -- 20 branch 
companies, two research and development centers, one 
experimental factory, two production bases and one training 
center, Yang said. 
  A poll last year showed that the Legend group was among the 
five microcomputer manufacturers best received by Chinese 
customers, the only one from China. 
  Vice-President Li Qin said that the Legend group, joined by 
the country's other big computer businesses, has vowed to 
develop a series of "Chinese" computers in an attempt to 
vitalize China's fledgling computer industry. 
  "The banner of China's computer industry shall after all be 
held up high by the Chinese, and the development track of 
China's computer industry will eventually be opened up by the 
Chinese too," Li noted.

  [Text] Nanning, April 20 (XINHUA) -- The total sum used for 
Chinese bank loans to support science and technology development 
has increased hugely over the past decade. 
  Bank loans which went to science and technology sectors 
increased from merely 15 million yuan in 1984 to 6.3 billion 
yuan in 1993, according to a conference sponsored by the China 
Commission for the Promotion of Relations Between Science and 
Technology and Banking, which was held yesterday in Nanning, 
capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. 
  At present, only about 15-20 percent of the scientific and 
technological achievements in China can be put into practical 
use, due to the lack of necessary funds, according to the 
meeting. 
  However, banking services related to science and technology 
undertakings have been developing rapidly over the past few 
years since the People's Bank of China initiated a science and 
technology loans project and various professional banks started 
similar services. 
  Banks have become another accelerator for the development of 
science and technology following state budgets and funds raised 
by enterprises on their own. 
  In 1984, the Bank of Industry and Commerce and the Bank of 
Agriculture took the lead in granting loans to the development 
of science and technology, which reached 15 million yuan for the 
year. 
  The figure reached 6.3 billion yuan in 1993 when the 
country's finances were in disorder for a time. Of the loans, 
1.2 billion yuan went to the "Spark Program" in favor of local 
economic development, 1.7 billion yuan went to the "Torch Plan" 
in support of the development of high- and new-technology 
projects, and 900 million yuan went to a program which is aimed 
at the promotion of new technologies among traditional 
enterprises. 
  The other funds went to research programs on the application 
of military technology to civil use, application of achievements 
of research institutes, exploration of resources, environmental 
protection and the development of new medicines. 
  Under the coordination and support of the People's Bank of 
China, professional banks have developed the services for nearly 
a decade and have achieved great economic gains. 
  Statistics from Shenyang, a major industrial city in 
north-east China's Liaoning Province, show that high and new 
technologies contributed to about 31 percent of the output value 
yielded by the enterprises in the city last year, largely 
because of support from bank loans.

  [Text] Ningbo, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China's second round of 
comprehensive supplementary urban reform is being instituted in 
18 pilot cities to pioneer the establishment of a socialist 
market economic structure. 
  This was revealed at a national conference held here on 
comprehensive supplementary urban reform. 
  The 18 cities are Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Harbin, 
Changchun, Shenyang, Nanjing, Chengdu, Xian, Chongqing, Ningbo, 
Anshan, Tangshan, Yantai, Tongling, Changzhou, Quanzhou and 
Yanji. 
  These cities, large and small, coastal and inland, are 
highly 
reform-motivated, with solid foundations in economic reform and 
economic development, and the experience drawn from the pilot 
cities could have great impact on the national urban reform. 
  The cities will be the major areas of the new round of urban 
economic reform and their influence is expected to promote 
China's market economy, said Wang Shiyuan, vice-minister of the 
State Commission of Economic Restructuring. 
  The pilot reform measures carried out by these cities 
include: 
  -- Reform the property rights system to transform 
enterprises 
in line with common practices in modern enterprises in the world; 
  -- Bring the market mechanism into full play in resources 
allocation, and cultivate and develop the market system; 
  -- Change the functions of the government to serve the 
market 
development; 
  -- Establish a sound social security system and reform the 
housing system. 
  -- Carry on other supplementary measures in other fields to 
guaranteeing the overall economic reform. 
  The vice-minister said that different from other pilot 
schemes, the 18 cities will not enjoy privileges as such cities 
previously did. 
  "The experience drawn this way could be applicable in other 
places," Wang said, noting that preferential policies run 
against the market economy, which is based on competition on an 
equal footing and international practice. 
  Wang's commission will be responsible for designing 
standards 
for the experimental work, establish a work conference system 
among pilot cities, a liaison system and an "assessment quotas 
system for reform experiments."

  The engineering industry has been developing rapidly in 
south-west China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region over the 
past few years, thanks to the adoption of a series of effective 
measures aimed at improving the management set-up of enterprises. 
  According to local officials, last year the autonomous 
region's engineering industry had a 7.5 billion yuan output 
value, with a sales ratio of 98 percent. 
  In the same year, enterprises in the engineering industry 
generated 1.4 billion yuan in profits and taxes for the 
autonomous region, and contributed 30 million U.S. dollars to 
the region's finances, from the exports of their products. 
<H5>  Yunnan Transmits More Electricity to Guangdong </H5>
  Southwest China's power-rich Yunnan Province has transmitted 
540 million kw/hour of electricity to south China's Guangdong 
Province since late last year. 
  Local officials from Yunnan Province say that they will 
continue to transmit an additional 900 million kw/hour of 
electricity to the south Chinese province this year. 
Non-Governmental Investment Zone in Fuzhou Lures More Foreign 
Funds [subhead] 
  Fuxing Investment Zone in Fuzhou City, capital of east 
China's Fujian Province, has so far approved the establishment 
of 160 businesses, of which, 127 are Sino-foreign funded 
enterprises, involving a promised foreign investment of 300 
million U.S. dollars. 
  At present, 70 enterprises in the zone have begun 
production. 
  Fuxing Investment Zone was established in 1991 by Gushan 
Township in the suburbs of Fuzhou with self-raised funds. 
Shanghai To Have More Telephones [subhead] 
  Shanghai plans to add 400,000 to 500,000 more lines to its 
telephone network this year, officials from the 
telecommunications authority said. 
  The largest city in China had 1.08 million lines by the end 
of 1993, of which 60 percent were house telephones. One fifth 
of the families in the city had telephones in their homes. 
<H5>  New Power Generating Sets in Operation </H5>
  The first generating set of a 21,000-kw hydro-power plant in 
Zhaoping County of south-west Guangxi went into operation on 
Friday, following a third 220,000-kw generating set at the 
Tianshengqiao hydro-power plant on April 2. 
<H5>  Dehydrated Vegetable Plant </H5>
  Building of a Sino-Israeli dehydrated vegetable plant able 
to 
treat 13,000 tons of fresh vegetables a year recently started in 
Wuhan, capital of central Hubei Province. 
  The Merhav Group, a leading Israeli company, will provide 
2.61 million U.S. dollars worth of first-class dehydration 
equipment as well as technologies for its first venture in 
China. Its Chinese partners include the Wuhan Institute of 
Vegetable Sciences.

"International Symposium on the Contracted Responsibility System 
of the Shougang Corporation" at the Shougang Corporation on 16 
October 1993: "State Enterprises Must Properly Solve the 
Problem of Mixing Government Administration With Enterprise 
Management"] 
  [Text] I am greatly interested in this symposium because 
this is the first time that an international symposium on the 
enterprise contract system has been held in China. The fact 
that the contract system of the Shoudu Iron and Steel 
Corporation has aroused the interest of famous professors and 
entrepreneurs at home and abroad indicates that the contract 
system is of positive significance not only in China, but also 
around the world. In particular, the contract system of the 
Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation has given brilliant answers to 
some issues of a general character which are faced by both 
Chinese and foreign enterprises. 
  In my opinion, the current international symposium has been 
successful. The success lies in the consensus reached by the 
participants on several important issues concerning how 
enterprises should be properly run. 
<H5>  1. The Management Ideology of Men Being the Foundation </H5>
[subhead] 
  At present, various countries realize that the fundamental 
factor of running enterprises properly rests in fully releasing 
the initiative of staff and workers. Both the theory of "taking 
people as the foundation" proposed by the Shoudu Iron and Steel 
Corporation and that of "behavioral science" put forward by the 
Western countries are primarily aimed at fully releasing the 
initiative, wisdom, and creativity of staff and workers. This 
is a common understanding and is also the most important 
hallmark of modern enterprise management. Therefore, an 
enterprise that fails to release the initiative of its staff and 
workers cannot be called a modern enterprise, and an enterprise 
system under which the initiative of staff and workers cannot be 
released is not worthy of the name of a modern enterprise 
system. This concept is accepted by more and more people in 
China and the world. The more modern an enterprise is, the more 
necessary it is to fully release the initiative of its staff and 
workers. The view that the more modern the technology and 
equipment in an enterprise, the smaller the role of men, 
obviously does not accord with the trend of the times. 
  An important point of the management ideology that men are 
the foundation is reflected in the participation in enterprise 
policy decisions by staff and workers. In order to release the 
initiative of staff and workers, it is necessary to enhance 
their "awareness of being masters of the country." To enhance 
such awareness, it is necessary to let them assume the role of 
"masters." In the boards of supervisors in German enterprises, 
half of the members are representatives of staff and workers, 
who, being masters of half the enterprises, are directly 
participating in and supervising major policy decisions of the 
enterprises. The system of a workers' representative conference 
practiced in the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation also allows 
staff and workers to directly participate in and supervise 
enterprise policies. This is an important foundation leading to 
the success achieved by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation. 
Therefore, the participation in and supervision of enterprise 
policies by staff and workers have become a significant trend of 
modern enterprise management. It is also an important yardstick 
for measuring whether an enterprise is practicing a modern 
enterprise system. 
<H5>  2. State-Owned Enterprises Should Properly Resolve the </H5>
Issue of Mixing Up Government Administration With Enterprise 
Management 
  The issue of mixing up government administration with 
enterprise management in making policy decisions universally 
exists in state- owned enterprises all over the world, which is 
the root cause of low efficiency and poor performance in 
state-owned enterprises. Owing to the failure of resolving this 
issue, an upsurge of privatization was set off around the world. 
In China, it is necessary to develop the private economy, but 
it is impossible to let all enterprises privatize. Likewise, it 
is impossible for all state-owned enterprises in various 
countries to privatize at present. Hence, we should 
conscientiously study the knotty problem of mixing up government 
administration with enterprise management. The Shoudu Iron and 
Steel Corporation has made a breakthrough in resolving this 
problem by practicing a contract system, and the key of the 
breakthrough rests in the rational definitions regarding the 
relationship between enterprises and government in terms of 
responsibility, power, and benefit, so that the ownership and 
management right of state assets are really separated. As a 
result, the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is robust in its 
independent operation. In fact, it is not difficult to separate 
the ownership from management rights in the private economy, but 
it is very difficult to do this in the state-owned economic 
sector. The contract system practiced in the Shoudu Iron and 
Steel Corporation is a useful experiment, and it can be called a 
new contribution that the enterprise has made. 
  3. The Incentive Mechanism in Enterprises 
  International experience shows that the incentive mechanism 
in private enterprises refers to the property mechanism and 
market mechanism. However, this incentive mechanism is chiefly 
effective for owners and operators, and not for staff and 
workers. Recently, a new wage system was introduced in Britain, 
under which the employers of industrial and commercial 
enterprises no longer pay all the originally fixed wages to 
staff and workers. Instead, they pay only two-thirds of their 
wages, while the remaining one-third is linked to the profits of 
enterprises and their amounts are decided by the size of 
enterprise profits. Thus, the mechanism of distribution linked 
to performance is introduced into the labor market in 
determining laborers' wages. This change has shown that the 
incentive mechanism in enterprises is developing in the 
direction of mobilizing the enthusiasm of owners, operators, and 
workers. The success of the distribution system of the Shoudu 
Iron and Steel Corporation lies in its reflection of mutual 
existence and common prosperity of the interests between 
government, enterprises, staff, and workers. This is an 
orientation for both state-owned and private enterprises. 
  The Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation is an example of 
China's enterprise reform, and the contract system is a focal 
point of the reform in which "the contract is regarded as a 
foundation," as people in the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation 
put it. The contract system and the complete set of measures 
relating to it practiced in the corporation is of universal 
significance to enterprise reform in China. Just as Mr. Chao 
Yao-tung from Taiwan said in his thesis presented to the 
symposium, "it was necessary to thoroughly put into practice the 
spirit of the contract system," and "since the spirit of the 
contract system implies independent operation, 
self-accumulation, self-transformation, and self- development, 
and advocates separating ownership from management rights, then 
the owners of enterprises should give full and complete 
authority to the managers." Of course, there is still something 
imperfect in it. That is why we should adopt a positive 
attitude to making it perfect. What needs emphasizing is that, 
taken from a development point of view, the perfection of the 
contract system must be connected with the institution of a 
modern enterprise system. That means the two systems should be 
joined together, and this calls for carrying out in-depth reform 
in various aspects, including the system of ownership and 
management rights, the system of organization, the system of 
management, and so on, and genuinely establishing an operational 
mechanism which is suited to the requirements of a socialist 
market economy. No operational mode is invariable. The 
ever-developing market economy always calls for us to constantly 
accept new things and quicken the pace of reform. An important 
aspect of the modern enterprise system is to practice a 
joint-stock system in enterprises and set up limited liability 
companies. As a matter of fact, a contract system does not 
reject a joint-stock system, and they are compatible. The model 
of "combining the contract system with the joint-stock system," 
initiated by the Shoudu Iron and Steel Corporation, is the best 
proof of it. In this sense, its contract system bears a 
scientific and modern character to a certain extent.

<F P=106> [By Zhang Tai (1728 3141) and Zong Yuanyuan (1350 0337 </F>
0337): "Experts Analyze and Forecast China's Economic 
Development Trend"] 
  [Text] Not long ago, "China's Macroeconomic Analysis 
System" conducted its sixth survey of the economic situation. 
Questionnaires were sent to 200 relevant experts and 158 were 
collected, the return rate being 79 percent. 
<H5>  I. Assessment of the Economic Development Trend in 1993 </H5>
  The survey findings indicate that the experts affirmed and 
felt satisfied with the measures taken by the central government 
to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. They also 
pointed out the problems in economic development. The 
prevailing opinions are as follows: 1) Among the experts, 75.9 
percent consider that economic development maintained the 
momentum of a fairly high growth, but its speed tended to be too 
fast, exceeding the sustaining power of the infrastructure and 
the basic industries; 2) 74.6 percent think the measures of 
macroeconomic regulation and control were rational and that the 
force with which the measures were implemented was appropriate. 
As a result, positive results were attained, promoting 
improvement in the relationship between supply and demand; and 
3) 53 percent think money supply was still too great and there 
was no clear evidence to show that the trend of soaring prices 
had been reined in. The experts are deeply worried about high 
price levels and consider this the chief factor that might 
affect the smooth introduction of the reform measures this year 
and the healthy development of the national economy. 
  The experts expressed their opinions on those more 
conspicuous problems in economic life in 1993: 
  --Judgment on the causes of the chaotic economic order that 
occurred in the first half of 1993. Over half the experts hold 
that economic disorder mainly manifested itself in the monetary 
disorder. Among the experts, 35.4 percent blame the 
ineffectiveness of the macroeconomic regulation and control 
measures by the central bank, 21.5 percent blame the 
nonstandardized conduct of the banks and other monetary 
institutions, 20.3 percent blame the overemphasis on economic 
growth, 11.4 percent blame overinvestment in real estate and in 
marketable securities, and 3.8 percent blame the fact that the 
planned management structure was weakened. 
  --Analysis of the shortage of funds of state-owned 
enterprises in the latter half of 1993. Comparatively speaking, 
the experts focus more attention on the problems of state-owned 
enterprises themselves. The main causes accounting for the 
shortage of funds of state-owned enterprises are listed 
according to the number of experts who selected them: Low 
benefits of state-owned enterprises (22.8 percent), irrational 
orientation of funds investment (21.5 percent), irrational 
product mix (12.7 percent), high economic growth (10.1 percent), 
lagging reform of the investment system (10.1 percent), and 
irrational behavior by banks (8.9 percent). 
  --Analysis of the phenomenon that the pace of economic 
growth 
decreased month by month while the retail price index remained 
high in the latter half of 1993, and especially the price hike 
at the end of last year. There were nine choices in the survey 
for the experts to choose from. Here is the list of the main 
causes which more experts selected: First, as the price index 
is an indicator which lags behind, the rapid economic growth and 
the excessive scale of investment in the first half of the year 
was inevitably reflected in the price index in the latter half 
of the year (39.2 percent); second, the big price hike in daily 
necessities correspondingly brought about a rather strong chain 
effect (24.1 percent); third, the year 1993 was a crucial year 
for pushing the reform in various fields comprehensively. 
However, people expected high inflation and there were signs of 
unstable customer mentality owing to certain deviations in the 
guidance of public opinion and the lack of explanation (17.7 
percent); fourth, given that the economy grew at a high speed, 
while the supply and demand relationship tended to be strained, 
the increase in costs drove up prices more quickly (10.1 
percent). 
<H5>  II. Predictions of the Economic Situation in 1994 </H5>
  1. The questionnaire included a comprehensive set of 
questions about the development of the national economy in 1994. 
The experts generally agree that the national economy will 
maintain the momentum of a fairly quick development. 
  --On GNP growth rate, 40.5 percent of the specialists think 
it will stand at 9 to 11 percent, while 38 percent think it will 
be 11 to 13 percent and 19 percent think it will be 13 to 15 
percent. No one thinks that the growth rate will be lower than 
9 percent. This shows that the experts generally consider that 
the economic growth rate this year will remain high. 
  --On the industrial growth rate, 49.4 percent of the experts 
think it will stand at 17 to 20 percent, while 24.1 percent 
think it will be at 20 to 25 percent and 17.7 percent think it 
will be at 15 to 17 percent. 
  --The growth of the consumer goods market is considered on 
the whole to be just the same as last year. Among the experts, 
44.3 percent predict the growth rate of volume of retail sales 
will stand at 16 to 20 percent, while 32.9 percent think it will 
be at 20 to 24 percent and 17.7 percent think it will be at 12 
to 16 percent. 
  --On the growth rate of the fixed-asset investment scale, 
29.1 percent of the experts consider the growth rate will be 35 
to 40 percent, 25.3 percent consider it will be over 40 percent, 
and 19 percent consider it will be 30 to 35 percent. 
  --On the financial situation, 43 percent of the experts 
hold that the financial deficit will on the whole remain the 
same as last year, 38 percent hold that it will be higher than 
last year and 17.7 percent hold that it will be lower than in 
1993. 
  --On the banking situatuon, 41.8 percent of the experts 
think 
that money supply (M2) will increase by 25 to 30 percent, 22.8 
percent think it will increase by 30 to 35 percent and 16.5 
percent think it will increase by 20 to 25 percent. 
  --On the increase in the general level of retail prices 32.9 
percent of the experts think the increase will be 10 to 12 
percent, 29.1 percent think it will be 8 to 10 percent and 22.8 
percent think it will be 12 to 14 percent. 
  2. The experts attach great importance to the inadequate 
supply capacity of infrastructure and basic industry. They make 
predictions of the supply and demand trend in railroad 
transportation, energy and raw materials. They consider that 
railroad transportation is the strongest restraint on economic 
development, while energy comes next and raw materials supply 
after that. 
  On railroads: 1) 48.1 percent of the experts hold that the 
gap between supply and demand will further increase; 2) 45.6 
percent hold that it will remain at the same level as in 1993; 
3) 3.8 percent hold that there will be a basic balance between 
supply and demand; and 4) 2.5 percent hold that supply will 
exceed demand. 
  On energy: 1) 35.4 percent hold that the gap between supply 
and demand will further increase; 2) 59.5 percent hold that it 
will remain at the same level as in 1993; 3) 2.6 percent hold 
that there will be a basic balance between supply and demand; 4) 
2.5 percent hold that supply will exceed demand. 
  On raw materials: 1) 22.8 percent hold that the gap between 
supply and demand will further increase; 2) 50.6 percent hold 
that it will remain at the same level as in 1993; 3) 22.8 
percent hold that there will be a basic balance between supply 
and demand; 4) 3.8 percent hold that supply will exceed demand. 
III. Suggestions Concerning the Macroeconomic Regulation and 
Control and Economic Restructuring in 1994 [subhead] 
  1. Suggestions about the macroeconomic regulation and 
control. 
  --The experts point out that it is necessary to further 
improve the macroeconomic regulation and control to create a 
good external environment for the introduction of various reform 
measures. On the question of the force of its implementation, 
55.7 percent of the experts think it should be kept the same as 
in 1993, while 25.7 percent think it should be relaxed and 16.5 
percent think it should be strengthened. 
  --On the question of interest rate policy, 62 percent of the 
experts think it should be maintained at the level of 1993 while 
32.9 percent think it should be properly raised. 
  --On the question of the exchange rate policy, 45.6 percent 
of the experts suggest keeping the renminbi exchange rate at the 
present level, i.e. 8.7 yuan to $1, 36.7 percent suggest that it 
should be devalued to the proper extent, while 13.9 percent 
suggest that it should be revalued. The combination of the 
exchange rates of the renminbi and its exchange under control is 
approved by 83.5 percent. They consider the timing appropriate. 
  2. Suggestions about economic restructuring. 
  a. The experts point out that the most urgent task at 
present 
is to establish the socialist market economy system. They 
suggest that the current major tasks be arranged in the 
following order: Establish a modern enterprise system (38 
percent); quicken the reform of macroeconomic regulation and 
control measures such as the tax, banking, and investment 
systems (24.1 percent); establish and perfect an open, 
competitive and orderly market system (17.8 percent); and 
quicken the establishment of a social security system (15.2 
percent). 
  The experts hold that it is highly necessary to quicken the 
reform of the tax, banking, and investment systems. Practicing 
the tax-sharing system is supported by 84 percent of the 
experts; 82 percent are for raising the proportion of the 
central finance in the total financial revenue; 60 percent are 
for the establishment of policy-oriented banks, separating 
policy-oriented business from commercial business; and most 
experts consider that growth in the investment in fixed assets 
has a lot to do with the investment system and 91 percent of 
them are for the reform of the investment system. 
  b. The experts pay special attention to the improvement of 
the enterprise environment for external development. The 
problems of the environment for development in state-owned 
enterprises are listed in the order of their importance: No 
well-defined line on property rights of enterprises (34.2 
percent); lagging conversion of government function, 
nonstandardized behavior and too much interference in production 
and operation activities of enterprises (29.2 percent); heavy 
social burdens of enterprises (19 percent); failure in actual 
implementation of the "Regulations" (12.7 percent). 
  c. The experts also emphasize that great attention should be 
paid to handling the relationship between reform and development 
so as to avoid continuously widening the differences in economic 
and social development between regions. Among the experts, 86.1 
percent hold that the central government should shoulder the 
responsibility for formulating a policy that is favorable to 
accelerated economic development in the middle and western parts 
of the country; 6.3 percent hold that reducing the differences 
should mainly rely on the efforts of the localities; while 7.6 
percent hold that the strategy favoring development in the 
coastal areas should be continued and that it will be readjusted 
when the productive forces develop further.

<F P=106> [By Yu Zengrong (6735 1073 2837): "Forecast of Trends in </F>
Major Materials Supply and Demand in 1994"] 
  [Text] China's quick economic growth rate and speedy 
development during 1992 ushered in a full boom in the markets 
for the means of production and prices have since been rising 
since then at a dazzling speed. In the first half of 1993, the 
total supply and demand of most materials were roughly in 
balance and a relatively high growth in total sales could still 
be maintained. There were three major characteristics in the 
price changes: First, prices increased monthly, peaking in 
June. Second, the prices of capital goods [tou zi xing wu zi 
2121 6327 7352 3670 6327] rocketed, representing 90 percent of 
the total price increases. Third, the prices of seven major 
categories of materials (excepting chemicals) rose by varying 
degrees. Since July, when the State's macroeconomic regulatory 
measures were introduced, the shortages of materials have been 
alleviated and prices have fallen slightly and tended to be 
stable. 
  What changes will there be in the supply and demand of 
materials in 1994? What will the trends be? The following are 
our views: 
<H5>  I. The General Situation of Materials Supply and Demand in </H5>
1994 
  First, total demand will not decrease. 
  1. The macroeconomic regulation and control this time is a 
structural readjustment and a change in the investment direction 
and flow volume of capital, not total retrenchment. Therefore, 
the ultimate demand of the means of production will not 
decrease. It is only a question of time difference. 
  2. In 1994, the total demand will grow on the basis of 1993 
and the investment scale will not be smaller than in 1993, 
coupled with such factors as the undampened investment incentive 
of the localities and the belated effects of macroeconomic 
regulation and control. Thus, the demand will not decrease 
considerably in 1994. 
  3. The infrastructural projects initiated in 1993 constitute 
a very big demand market and will play an important part in the 
total demand for materials in 1994. 
  Second, the prices of the means of production will tend to 
be 
stable or on the rise. 
  1. The push from costs keeps the means of production prices 
high. The continuously increasing costs and lowering profits of 
productive enterprises prevent product prices from being lowered 
and this, in turn, keeps the prices of the means of production 
from plummeting. 
  2. Prices are influenced by the regulation and control of 
the state's macroeconomic policy. The fact that one-third of 
the coal output under unified distribution has had price 
controls lifted, that the iron and steel industry has resolved 
the question of "market price and fixed price," and that oil, 
electricity, and transportation industries have cut rising 
costs, coupled with the cancellation of the state's mandatory 
distribution plans for eight types of materials and the removal 
of all their price controls, will have an influence on the 
prices of the means of production. 
  3. The fact that the state is importing large quantities of 
materials from abroad will cause the prices of some means of 
production to stabilize and pick up. 
  Third, communications and transportation and capital input 
are major factors affecting the materials supply-demand balance. 
  Communications and transportation are not developing very 
quickly at the present time so that ships are too plentiful, 
ports are inadequate, and traffic congestion has obviously 
increased. Railway freight transportation in general can only 
meet less than 70 percent of the total need and in some places, 
only 40 percent or so. It is also worrying that ports are 
seriously inadequate for sea transportation. The transportation 
capacity is so low that it will not improve in the near future 
and will probably get worse, directly affecting the materials 
balance across the country which, in turn, will cause price 
fluctuations everywhere. 
  Despite the fact that China can maintain a strong national 
economy and has a large demand for the means of production, 
serious fund shortages will weaken the purchasing, selling, and 
stocking power of enterprises. China is not only short of 
renminbi but also of foreign currencies. First, since imported 
goods have doubly increased, the foreign exchange needed has 
increased and there are difficulties in pooling foreign 
exchange. Second, since the foreign exchange supply-demand gap 
has widened, coupled with the role of the market, the renminbi 
exchange rates will probably fall and, since the prices of major 
raw materials on the international market have risen because 
China bought large quantities of them in the earlier period, the 
operational risks have increased. Therefore, although a general 
balance between the supply and demand of materials has been 
reached, the foundation for the balance is very weak and is 
restricted by the transportation "bottlenecks" and by the 
pooling of funds. 
<H5>  II. Predictions For Major Materials in 1994 </H5>
  First, there will be coal supply shortages and coal prices 
will increase. Affected by the changing prices of coal and 
transportation, and by the cancellation of the preferential 
policy for market coal, coal prices will rise considerably and 
the difference between the planned price and outside-the-plan 
price will continue to narrow. Owing to the inadequate 
transportation capacity, the difference between coal prices in 
northern and southern China will become more obvious and coal 
prices in coastal areas will rise gradually and in a staircase 
shape. There are two reasons for this: 
  1. The year 1993 was crucial for the coal industry in 
curbing losses and this implies that coal prices have entered 
the stage of substantive increase and that it is an inevitable 
trend that costs will push up coal prices in eastern and 
southern coastal areas. 
  2. The fact that the state will cut back on credit will 
probably make coal-producing enterprises quicken the recovery of 
money from sales. The inadequate railway transportation 
capacity will probably lead to coal shortages and an increase in 
coal prices. 
  Second, there will be a basic balance in the supply and 
demand of steel products. 
  Affected by the investment scale and retrenchment, the 
rising 
demand for steel products will be weakened. In addition to 
selling large quantities of hoarded resources, prices will tend 
to be stable and slightly lower and the decrease in the prices 
of construction materials will be comparatively obvious. Due to 
the sudden heating of the machine tools market, steel products 
for production use tend to be in short supply and market 
supplies of silicon steel and bearing steel are also in short 
supply. Their supplies will continue to be inadequate in 1994 
and steel products for production use are expected to rise 
considerably with each tonne fluctuating between 3,000 and 3,500 
yuan. The entire price situation is that steel prices are lower 
in coastal areas and southern China than in inland areas and 
northern China. 
  Third, there is a shortage of timber resources and prices 
are 
consistently high. 
  In 1993, the total timber output was planned at 56.34 
million 
cubic meters but the total demand grew by 23 percent. In the 
long term, whether domestic or international timber resources, 
they are inadequate. Moreover, hoping to reduce losses, timber 
distribution departments in all localities have sold most of 
their stock at reduced prices with the result that stock has 
decreased by 20.1 percent, making it more difficult to fill the 
timber-shortages gap in 1994. In the meantime, affected by 
world timber shortage and the frantic increases in prices, 
timber prices in 1994 are expected to be consistently high. 
  Fourth, cement demand will slightly decrease and the price 
differences between regions are obvious. 
  Because fixed assets investments are being reduced and real 
estate development is being slowed down, cement demand and 
supply tends to be stable and prices are decreasing. However, 
since the state has delegated the power of fixing cement prices 
to productive enterprises in eastern China, northeastern China, 
and Hunan, coupled with the shortages of high-grade and 
special-grade cement in the cement markets and with the drive 
from the construction projects already launched, supplies will 
tend to be short in the second half of 1994 and prices will 
gradually rise. 
  Fifth, nonferrous metals are regulated by the market and 
their supply and demand are stable. 
  Since the Shanghai Metal Exchange was established, the 
nonferrous metals market is already linked to the international 
market and has been developing well on a daily basis. In 
addition to meeting market demand, nonferrous metal resources 
also play a role in guiding and stabilizing market prices. In 
1994, affected by fund shortages and exchange rates, the 
domestic nonferrous metals market will not fluctuate very much 
as a result of the resources shortages and market prices will 
fall steadily. 
  Sixth, petroleum products will rise steadily. 
  From 1994 onward, the state will only use fuels under the 
plan in key industries such as the defense industry, fertilizer 
production, and electricity generation, while oil for other 
sectors will basically have price controls lifted. In addition, 
the increased output of Middle East oil and Iraq's restoration 
of oil exports, strike a balance between oil supply and demand 
on the international market and oil prices are decreasinging. 
This is favorable for China to import oil to make up for the 
shortage of local resources caused by the inadequate 
transportation capacity. Moreover, affected by the 
international market, oil prices on China's market will also 
begin to fall. Therefore, supply and demand in 1994 will be 
stable in the domestic oil products market and their prices will 
fluctuate by a small margin. Gasoline prices will remain at the 
1993 level but diesel oil prices will increase due to inadequate 
supplies as the state increases agricultural investment. 
  Seventh, chemical raw materials will be less in demand. 
  Since there is a certain degree of inertia in the growth of 
the speedily growing light industry, the following trends will 
appear in the chemical products market in 1994: 
  1. The supply of chemical products made from grain will 
become inadequate. The supply-demand contradictions in such 
chemical products as alcohol glacial acetic acid and acetone 
will be salient and their prices will be consistently high. 
  2. The shortage of titanium white powder will affect the 
entire paint industry. 
  3. Various types of rubber will continue to be in great 
demand, especially synthetic rubber. 
  4. Some products made from calcium carbide will be in great 
demand. 
  5. The short supply of methanol and methylamine will be 
alleviated. 
  6. The supply of pure benzene, toluene, and dimethylbenzene 
will be obviously short in some southern areas, while their 
shortages in other areas will tend not to be alleviated. 
  7. The market prices of raw materials for plastic production 
such as high-pressure polyethylene, low-pressure polyethylene, 
and polypropylene will tend to be lower. 
  8. Demand in the auto market will be stable while the 
contradictions in its product mix will be salient. 
  Since the second half of 1993, the cutback on purchases, 
retrenchment, and funds shortages have checked the excessive 
expansion of the auto market. In 1994, supply will be slightly 
greater than demand in the auto market but it will generally 
tend to develop steadily, competition will be intensified, and 
the contradictions in the product mix will be very salient. The 
heavy truck market will be promising, medium-sized trucks will 
probably sell fairly well, sedan sales will be both gratifying 
and worrying, deluxe imported sedans will sell comparatively 
well, the prices of medium- and low-grade trucks will tend to be 
stable, and some low-grade trucks will be overstocked.

  [Text] Yesterday [12 April], Jia Qinglin, secretary of the 
provincial party committee and governor, separately attended the 
discussion sessions of the Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Ningde 
delegations to listen to their opinions on the government work 
report. 
  At the Xiamen delegation's discussion session, after hearing 
the deputies' speeches, Governor Jia Qinglin said: As a Xiamen 
deputy, I am pleased with Xiamen's economic achievements, which 
have attracted world attention. The party Central Committee, 
the State Council, and the provincial party committee, and 
government now have attached importance to Xiamen's development. 
The Xiamen Special Economic Zone is not just Xiamen's special 
zone; it is also the special zone of the whole province and 
nation. The governor put forward four suggestions for the 
construction of the Xiamen special zone: 
  1. We should redevelop the special zone's strong points. 
The Xiamen special zone should play a "dragon head" role in the 
province. 
  2. We should make flexible use of the free port policy and 
should promote the development of undertakings in various fields 
of endeavor. 
  3. We should build the Haicang investment zone on a larger 
scale. 
  4. We should pay attention to the construction of key 
development projects, such as airports and highways; run Xiamen 
and Jimei Universities well; turn the Overseas Chinese Affairs 
Museum into a window for attracting overseas Chinese capital; 
and build Gulangyu into an urban district with a high cultural 
level and one of Xiamen's major scenic spots, so as to attract 
more overseas investment. 
  The governor also urged Xiamen to make full use of the 
legislative power entrusted to it by the state, manage the 
special zone according to law, and build itself better. 
  At the Fuzhou delegation's discussion session, after 
listening to the deputies' opinions, the governor said: This 
year, stability is of overriding importance. Only when 
stability is maintained can our reforms in all fields forge 
ahead. Leaders at all levels must concern themselves with the 
weal and woe of the masses of people, and must alleviate 
contradictions among the people. This year, the provincial 
party committee and government are determined to carry out more 
investigation and study; adopt realistic measures to solve, in a 
down-to-earth manner, some hot-point and difficult problems in 
society, economics, and daily life; bring the enthusiasm of 
people from all sides concerned into full play; and cherish, 
protect, and direct their enthusiasm toward reform, development, 
and stability; so as to push foward the cause of reform.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Lin Chunhua (2651 2504 5478): "The Fuzhou </F>
Railway Subbureau To Transform Itself Into Limited-Liability 
Company"] 
  [Text] Fuzhou, 5 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The Fuzhou 
Railway Subbureau is going all-out to transform itself into a 
limited-liability company solely owned by the state. 
  The Fuzhou Railway Subbureau is in charge of the railway 
network within Fujian, which has a total length of nearly 1,100 
km, an annual freight transport capacity of over 20 million 
tonnes, and an annual passenger transport capacity of more than 
17 million passengers. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, the main 
railway artery in Fujian, has been electrified. The 
construction of the Nanping- Hengyang Railway, Fujian's second 
railway to other provinces, is in full swing. The province will 
build seven more new railways before the end of this century. 
  The Fuzhou Railway Subbureau is located at the southeastern 
tip of China's railway network, and there is no transit 
transport by means of railways managed by the subbureau, so it 
is convenient for the subbureau to carry out reform in isolation. 
  It has been learned that the Fuzhou Railway Subbureau will 
take two steps to transform itself into a company. The first is 
to change from its existing state of having assets invested 
solely by the state and the reality of unified operation and 
administration of the entire network into a limited liability 
company solely owned by the state. The second step is to absorb 
other investment entities and to develop into a shareholding 
limited-liability company with state capital holding controlling 
shares.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan] </F>
  [Text] In a comfortable air-conditioned meeting room on 
the third floor of the Fujian Labour Bureau, labour-dispute 
arbitrator Peng Weidong drew on a cigarette, sipped some 
Fujianese tea, lay back on a sofa and said: "They say they 
respect human rights, I say what they do is exploitation." 
  "If they are sincere about human rights, then they should 
stop exploiting Chinese workers," he added. "They" are the 
thousands of foreign entrepreneurs who operate factories in 
Fujian to make such goods as running shoes and plastic toys. 
Statistics show these businesses -- many of them 
medium-to-small Taiwanese companies -- employed more than 
400,000 Chinese last year, mostly from other provinces. 
Although Fujian is one of the few relatively rich provinces, 
labour disputes, particularly those involving foreign 
businesses, have surged alarmingly. 
  In one instance, a female worker in a Taiwanese factory in 
Fuzhou was beaten and locked in a cage with two wolfhounds after 
she was caught stealing some unused rubber. Fellow workers went 
on strike after one of them, who helped the woman escape, was 
sacked. 
  Dangerous work conditions were also common, and some 
factories like deathtraps. Last year, 64 textile workers were 
burnt to death when fire broke out in a factory at which bosses 
had double-locked the doors. Mr Peng described workers in a 
Taiwanese factory, mostly young women with little education, who 
sat quietly along the production line when he visited. "They 
just put their hands in front of us, some without fingers -- 
they had been chopped off by machines," he said. 
  Another factory with 400 workers reported 36 industrial 
accidents -- some causing permanent injury -- in two years. And 
although low wages were often cited as an incentive to invest in 
China, some foreigners sought to maximise this advantage. Mr 
Peng said he knew of a worker who was paid only 60 yuan (HK$52) 
after laboring six months in a factory. Her manager had devised 
such exorbitant fees to be paid by workers each month that the 
woman was left with barely enough money for her train fare home. 
  Other factories were run like military camps, said Mr Peng. 
Workers had to ask permission to go to toilets and in some 
cases, women were not allowed to close toilet doors so they 
would not "stay there too long". Working hours were "eternally" 
long, Mr Peng said. Sixteen hours a day with overtime pay as low 
a 50 fens (half a yuan) an hour had become almost the norm among 
joint ventures in Fujian, he said. Mr Peng said such abuses 
were limited usually to small and medium-sized factories and 
those which had not set up labour unions. 
  Although Chinese law required all foreign-owned businesses 
to 
set up such unions, less than a fifth of foreign businesses 
operating in Fujian had set up unions by the end of last year, 
he said. Labour bureau director Wang Lihong said the Government 
was aware of the problems and had already begun provincial 
inspections. Section chief Huang Changshun said the inspectors 
would examine workers' contracts and police maximum working 
hours and the unlawful employment of children in foreign 
enterprises. "We can't sacrifice our workers' interests for the 
sake of foreign investment," Mr Wang said.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Taking practical 
steps to enliven state-owned enterprises has been put as a major 
task for the Shanghai government. 
  Some 40 enterprises, which are at present in the red, are 
required to make a profit this year. Eleven of these have 
already put forward detailed plans based on their particular 
conditions. 
  The city government has helped enterprises to find the 
causes 
for their losses. Results show that the losses come from 
inefficient operation and poor management, as well as left-over 
debts and the heavy financial burdens imposed on them. 
  The city government formulated measures and policies to help 
change the situation so that they can thrive and enhance their 
competitive ability in the market. 
  Strong leadership and qualified staff were considered as the 
key to making profits, and a contingent of outstanding business 
operators have been selected or assigned to be managers of these 
enterprises. 
  Enterprises with no hope of becoming profitable, whose low- 
quality products can find no demand, will be forced to go 
bankrupt, be merged with successful companies or have their 
ownership transferred.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 19 (CNS) -- The State Council 
Price Inspection Group yesterday affirmed the achievements made 
in price control in Guangdong and pointed out problems existing 
in the province in reporting the details of the inspection to 
the provincial government and the prices bureau. 
  Starting on April 12, the inspection team made on the spot 
surveys in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Dongwan, 
reaching the conclusion that the province was active and earnest 
in carrying out price inspections launched by the State Council. 
Regarding problems of the sharply rising prices and the confused 
market order there, the province had done a lot and had had 
obvious achievements in maintaining an economic balance in an 
overall way, development of production, cultivation of markets 
and administration over prices. 
  The economic situation in the province at present is good on 
the whole, however, the rise of price there is growing in a 
comparatively sharp way.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon, persons in charge of the 
Guangdong provincial government and relevant departments 
listened to the report by the State Council's commodity price 
inspection team on the results of its inspection of the 
province's general price developments. Beginning 10 April, the 
commodity price inspection team went down to Guangzhou, 
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, and Dongguan to conduct on-the-spot 
price inspection. The results of the inspection showed that the 
province's current economic and market price developments are 
fine on the whole, but the price hiking momentum is relatively 
grim. There is still something to be done in intensifying price 
inspection work and implementing some specific measures. 
  The commodity price inspection team pointed out: To check 
the price hiking momentum, Guangdong Province should intensify 
price inspection work, focus on the main points, and rectify the 
price order while conducting price inspection. With regard to 
the hot-point items that are most sought after by the masses of 
people and to those important commodities that have a bearing on 
the national economy and the people's livelihood, the province 
should organize forces to conduct special inspections. As for 
the commodities, grain, edible oil, important service items, and 
chemical fertilizers, the prices of which were forced up without 
authorization by capitalizing on taxation system reform, the 
province should persist in rectifying the price order while 
conducting price inspection, and should strive for speedy and 
innovative advances in this regard. It should adopt appropriate 
measures to manage grain, edible oil, pork, and major 
vegetables, and should step up efforts to introduce a system of 
risk funds for grain and for non-staple food, concentrate 
necessary forces on implementing the practice of selling goods 
at marked prices, and put price readjustments under strict 
control.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Guangzhou 
authorities in south China's Guangdong Province have revoked the 
licences of 113 overseas-funded enterprises because they refused 
to honor their contracts with the Chinese side. 
  They make up two percent of all the overseas-funded 
enterprises in the city, said the city's Industry and Commerce 
Bureau (ICB) and Foreign Economic and Trade Commission (FETC). 
  The closed enterprises had failed to observe the contracts 
to 
put enough or any capital into their ventures in the city after 
they obtained business licences, the officials said. 
  Some had even suspended operations for long periods for lack 
of funds, and others did not fade out of the enterprises after 
the terms of joint operation with local businesses were ended, 
they said. 
  However, "most of the overseas investors in the city have 
been following national and local laws and regulations and made 
considerable contributions to the city's economic development," 
and "their legal rights and interests have also been protected 
by the governments at all levels," the Guangzhou ICB and FETC 
said. 
  The closed enterprises include: the Guangzhou Flower Garden 
Exhibition Center, the Guangzhou Kangbao Beverage Co. Ltd, and 
Nanguo Hotel.

  [Text] Television lovers in Shenzhen have been given three 
days to tear down their illegal satellite dishes, an official 
said yesterday. Chen Chongtian, deputy director of the special 
economic zone's Bureau of Radio and Television, said all dish 
owners, except for hotels with foreign guests and financial 
companies, must pull down their dishes by the end of the week. 
  There has not yet been a decision to use force to implement 
the six-month-old nationwide ban on private dishes, and 
circumstances under which force might be deployed were "not yet 
clear", Chen said. 
  However, the Public Security Bureau and the Bureau of State 
Security in Shenzhen would play "coordinating" roles. The 
bureau is aware of the location of 110 dishes in Shenzhen, some 
of which are presumably legal. But some have been installed by 
private individuals without permission, Chen said. "We're 
calling on people to take the initiative. It would be best if 
they took them down themselves," he said. 
  Notices were published in Shenzhen papers yesterday 
announcing the crackdown. Chen said the uncontrolled dishes had 
caused "flaws", notably the government's loss of control over 
the watching of foreign programmes. "Some of those programmes 
from Hong Kong and Taiwan have a bad effect on the masses," he 
said. 
  "Violence and other evil depictions are not appropriate for 
our national situation." Chen said that dishes make Shenzhen 
look ugly and require more investment than cable television. 
The city expected to finish building a 400 million renminbi 
(HK$355m [Hong Kong dollars] ) cable television system by 1996 
or 1997, which would reach 100,000 households. "Cable 
television will replace satellite dishes," Chen said. "After the 
system is built, we will decide which Hong Kong and Taiwan 
programmes can be aired." 
  However, at least one satellite dish salesman in Shenzhen 
was 
already issuing instructions yesterday on how to get around the 
threat of police inspectors roving the streets looking for 
dishes. 
  "As long as they can't be seen from the street, then there 
should be no problem," said the salesman, whose electronic 
components store was set up with backing from the Shenzhen 
government last year. "There's likely to be crackdowns in areas 
where there is a concentration of dishes, but dishes which are 
dispersed and hidden will be OK," the salesman said. The 
Premier, Li Peng, announced a nationwide crackdown on private 
satellite dishes last October 8, giving local governments six 
month to implement the ban. Individuals found with unauthorised 
dishes could be penalised up to Rmb5,000 [renminbi], while work 
units faced Rmb50,000 fines. 
  Detailed regulations issued at a national ideological work 
conference in February spelt out the strict conditions for 
registering dishes and empowered local governments to "take 
positive action" to pull down unlicensed dishes. 
  Beijing's Ministry of Radio, Film and Television is reported 
to have extended the grace period for implementing the ban until 
June. However, analysts say it would take many years to search 
every hutong in China for the metal dishes, which are familiarly 
known as "pot lids"

  [Text] Haikou, 4 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In the five 
years and more since Hainan Province was established, the press 
and publishing in the province have developed rapidly and at 
present have become a rising new industry in the large Hainan 
Special Economic Zone. This was disclosed by Chen Keqin, 
director of the Press and Publication Bureau of the province, at 
the provincial culture and sports work meeting a few days ago. 
  Chen Keqin said that the press and publishing in Hainan 
Province had developed without the government's financial 
investment. When the province was established in April 1988, 
there were only one publishing house for books (the Hainan 
People's Publishing House), one newspaper (HAINAN RIBAO), and 
one magazine (TIANYA) [THE END OF THE WORLD -- 1131 1509; 
reference to Hainan's geographical location]. At present, there 
are four publishing houses (companies) for books, one 
audio-video publishing house, 17 newspapers, 37 magazines, more 
than 30 bookstores, over 30 printing presses, and 139 newspapers 
and magazines for restricted circulation. Last year, the 
province published more than 7 million copies of 518 book 
titles, more than 100 million copies of 14 newspapers, 3.58 
million copies of 31 kinds of magazines, and more than 35 
million copies (cassettes) of over 30,000 kinds of audio- video 
products. 
  Chen Keqing said that the press and publishing had made 
great 
contributions to the flourishing of the economy and culture in 
Hainan, and Hainan would adopt effective measures to promote the 
continuous and healthy development of the press and publishing.

  [Text] On 8 April, State Councillor Chen Junsheng made an 
inspection tour of our province's Nanle County to acquaint 
himself with the details of preparatory work for spring plowing 
and cotton production this year. Chen Junsheng and his party 
came to Zhengguocheng and Gujinlou Townships in Nanle County to 
have cordial discussions with local cadres and the masses on the 
farms and the edges of the fields. He asked them in detail 
about local cotton production over the past two years, the 
acreage under cotton this year, and also the situation regarding 
preparatory work for sowing. 
  Chen Junsheng and his party also visited peasant households, 
asking peasants what they needed from the government with regard 
to cotton production. In the county's cotton and linen company, 
Chen Junsheng inquired in detail about the preparation and 
supplies of chemical fertilizer, farm chemicals, and so on. 
  On the morning of 9 April, Chen Junsheng, responsible 
comrades from the relevant departments directly under the 
provincial authorities, and relevant leaders of Puyang City and 
Nanle County listened to a report on our province's agricultural 
and rural economic work. Chen fully affirmed the efforts made 
by the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the whole 
province to promote cotton production. 
  Chen Junsheng pointed out: The situation in Henan Province 
this year is favorable as a whole. The production output of 
cotton and tobacco has fallen but that of grain and oil crops 
has risen. Peasant incomes have also increased by a fairly big 
margin. However, we must not be too optimistic about the 
situation in cotton and grain production this year. Chen 
Junsheng stressed: Agriculture is the foundation of our national 
economy. People's livelihoods must be protected and we must 
provide them with food and clothing. Both of these are very 
important. The main problems in grain production are that large 
areas of the grain farms have been affected by drought and rice 
seedlings are not growing well [words indistinct]. The problem 
with cotton is the most serious this year. Provincial, city, 
and county governments have done a lot of work and made great 
efforts to deal with this problem. At present, what is most 
important is that we must ensure sufficient acreage under 
cotton. This year Henan must plant 14 million mu of cotton and 
strive for 15 million mu. We must firmly grasp preparatory work 
for sowing cotton and ensure sufficient supply of improved 
varieties of cotton and various kinds of agricultural means of 
production. We must not miss the farming season. We must do 
well various kinds of farm management work well and, in 
particular, we must properly grasp the work of preventing plant 
diseases and insects to strive for a good cotton harvest this 
year.

  [Text] A provincial propaganda and ideological work 
conference was convened in Zhengzhou yesterday with a view to 
opening up new vistas for firmly grasping two key work aspects 
at the same time; pressing ahead with reform, opening up, and 
modernization building; and raising the province's propaganda 
and ideological work to a new level. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Li Changchun delivered 
an important speech in which he first and foremost expounded on 
propaganda and ideological work's important position and role in 
the new historical period. He stated: In the new historical 
period, propaganda and ideological work is at once an important 
guarantee for implementing the party's basic line and an 
important way of uniting the broad masses of people. The 
propaganda and ideological work is of great importance to such 
overall interests as grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, 
expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability. It should submit to and serve the overall interests 
of the province's work and aim at unifying the ideology of the 
broad masses of party members, cadres, and people with the help 
of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics 
and mobilizing the broad masses of people to build a socialist 
market economic structure. This is the major theme. 
  Secretary Li Changchun pointed out: In accordance with the 
requirements laid down by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at a 
recent national propaganda and ideological work conference, and 
in light of the realities in Henan, we should firmly adhere to 
"one basic principle" and publicize "one major theme," striving 
to accomplish five major propaganda and ideological work tasks 
at the moment. By "one basic principle," we mean Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, which governs party work in all domains. We 
should firmly adhere to this basic principle in conducting 
propaganda and ideological work. By "one major theme," we mean 
grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding opening up, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability, the overall 
interests of the whole party's work. Thus, all types of work 
should submit to and serve such overall interests of the whole 
party's work. The propaganda and ideological work should aim at 
publicizing this major theme. The five major work tasks to be 
accomplished are as follows: 
  1. To arm the broad masses of the party members, cadres, and 
people across the province with the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; 
  2. To correctly guide public opinion to create a favorable 
public opinion environment for reform and opening up; 
  3. To train a new generation of people with lofty ideals, 
moral integrity, cultural accomplishments, and a sense of 
discipline; build spiritual civilization more vigorously; and to 
serve socialism and people; 
  4. To adhere to the principle as letting a hundred flowers 
blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend in order to 
bring about cultural and artistic prosperity; and 
  5. To further strengthen foreign-related propaganda work. 
  Secrertary Li Changchun emphatically noted: We now have a 
clear- cut guiding ideology for propaganda and ideological work 
as well as long- and short-term goals and tasks to fulfill. 
Moreover, we have also acquired objective conditions under 
which we are able to open up new vistas for the province's 
propaganda and ideological work. The party committees at all 
levels and the broad masses of propaganda and ideological 
workers should therefore brace themselves; strengthen 
confidence; work in a down-to-earth manner; implement to the 
letter all the relevant policies; and strive to open up new 
vistas for the province's propaganda and ideological work and 
contribute more to the province's reform, development, 
stability, and the building of two civilizations. 
  Yesterday's conference was presided over by Song Zhaosu, 
provincial party committee deputy secretary. 
  Zhang Wenbin, provincial party committee standing committee 
member and propaganda department director, relayed the spirit of 
the national propaganda and ideological work conference. 
  Yesterday's conference was attended by Lin Yinghai 
[provincial Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference 
committee chairman]; Wu Guangqian [provincial military district 
political commissar]; Zheng Zengmao [provincial higher people's 
court president]; Song Guochen; Zhang Deguang; Ma Jianzhang; 
Zhang Shiying; some other provincial leaders; various city and 
prefectural leaders; various provincial department and bureau 
leaders; Henan- based central news unit leaders; major 
industrial enterprises and mines leaders; and others.

  [Text] When conducting investigations and study in Zhuzhou 
City, Chen Bangzhu, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee and governor, pointed out that it is necessary to 
uphold reform, development, and stability. Leaders at all 
levels must do solid work and carry out work in all fields of 
endeavor in a down- to-earth manner. 
  From 9 to 10 April, accompanied by Cheng Xinhan, secretary 
of 
the Zhuzhou City party committee and Mayor Wang Xinming, 
Governor Chen Bangzhu and his party successively inspected 
enterprises which have had difficulties in operations, such as 
the Zhuzhou Ramie Spinning and Weaving Mill, the Zhuzhou Tyre 
Plant, and the Zhuzhou Welding Rod Plant, and some township and 
town enterprises in Zhuzhou and Liling. 
  On 11 April, Governor Chen held separate discussions with 
factory directors and managers of some large and medium-sized 
enterprises in Zhuzhou and city party and government leaders on 
such issues as how to establish modern enterprise systems and 
help enterprises change operational mechanisms and become market 
oriented. He said: At present, enterprises universally feel 
that funding strains are plaguing them, and some enterprises are 
operating under capacity. However, the solutions are more than 
difficult. He pointed out: To overcome difficulties, on the 
one hand, enterprises must devote efforts to tapping their 
internal potential, manage funds flexibly, strengthen 
management, reduce consumption, bring the enthusiasm of staff 
members and workers into play, tide over difficulties with one 
heart and one mind, and, on the other hand, party committees, 
governments, and departments at all levels must foster the idea 
of eliminating trouble and solving difficulties for enterprises 
and help enterprises get out of their fix. 
  He remarked: This year, reform is being carried out in an 
overall way. The introduction of taxation system reform, which 
requires intense efforts to accomplish, is in the interests of 
all sides. Moreover, Zhuzhou City is a national pilot city for 
optimizing the capital structure and enhancing enterprise 
strength. He urged leaders at all levels in the city to carry 
out, in a down-to-earth manner, ideological work in an organized 
manner and by employing necessary supporting measures and doing 
solid work to uplift the city's work to a new level.

<F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>
  [Text] Danzim, deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous 
Regional CPC Committee, delivered an important speech at the 
autonomous regional propaganda and ideological work meeting on 
the afternoon of 19 April. He pointed out that facts prove 
Tibet's propagandists and ideological workers are a contingent 
loyal to the party and the people's cause; a contingent of 
especially good, devoted, and hardship-enduring fighters; a 
contingent full of vitality; and a contingent which the party 
and people can trust. Basang, also a deputy secretary of the 
autonomous regional party committee, presided over the 19 April 
afternoon meeting. 
  Comrade Danzim's speech was entitled: Work Under the 
Guidance of the Theory on Building Socialism With Chinese 
Characteristics and Carry Out the Tasks on the Propaganda and 
Ideological Front in an All-Around Way. It contained three 
parts: (1) The basic situation of Tibet's propaganda and 
ideological front; (2) several major tasks of Tibet's propaganda 
and ideological front which we should strive to perform well now 
and in the days to come; and (3) strengthening leadership and 
improving methods to raise the level of our propaganda and 
ideological work. 
  Comrade Danzim first summarized the basic situation of 
Tibet's propaganda and ideological front. 
  He said: Over the past 40 years since the peaceful 
liberation of Tibet, the propaganda and ideological front in 
this region has done a great deal of work and made remarkable 
achievements in seriously implementing the party's basic 
theories and basic line of various periods, effecting an 
historic change in Tibet's society and accomplishing the tasks 
assigned by the party. Since Third Plenary Session of the 11th 
CPC Central Committee in particular, comrades on the propaganda 
and ideological front, adhering to the Marxist ideological line 
and working under very arduous conditions, have overcome 
difficulties, seriously conducted discussions on the criteria of 
truth, and helped bring about a thorough emancipation of the 
minds among CPC members, cadres, and the broad masses of people 
in the region. They have persistently treated economic 
construction as the central task, subordinated themselves to and 
served the party's central task, and actively publicized the 
party's line, principles, and policies, as well as the 
guidelines of the Party Central Committee's instructions on work 
in Tibet. They have carried out a thorough education in 
patriotism and in unity among all nationalities, seriously 
performed the task of arming the whole party with Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, applied the theory in unifying people's 
thinking, and promoted the study of the Volume 3 of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping." 
  Comrade Danzim said: During political storms and the Lhasa 
riots, comrades on the propaganda and ideological front in this 
region always identified themselves with the Party Central 
Committee and autonomous regional party committee, correctly 
guided public opinion, and helped maintain social stability in 
Tibet [sentence as heard]. During the course of deepening 
reforms and opening up wider, they have stepped up ideological 
education and ideological and political work, ensured the smooth 
implementation of major reform plans, and conducted active and 
effective propaganda work toward the outside world. Against the 
intensified attempt made by Western hostile forces and the Dalai 
clique to separate Tibet from China, comrades on the propaganda 
and ideological front have waged a tit-for-tat, justified, and 
forceful mass media struggle. They have publicized the accurate 
image of socialist new Tibet, made Tibet's actual situation 
known to more people, and effectively promoted Tibet's opening 
to the outside world and its cultural exchanges with foreign 
countries. They have helped the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization, and promoted cultural and educational undertakings 
and social progress in Tibet. 
  Comrade Danzim said: Propaganda and ideological work has 
made the people of all nationalities in Tibet emancipate their 
minds, and has aroused their enthusiasm, initiative, and 
creativity for participating in reforms and establishing a 
socialist market economy. Propaganda and ideological work has 
been a strong support in the anti-splittist struggle and work of 
maintaining stability. It has enriched the people's cultural 
life in Tibet, advanced the fine cultural traditions of all 
nationalities, upheld the unification of the motherland and 
unity among various nationalities, and ensured the smooth 
proceeding of Tibet's reform, opening up, and modernization 
drive. 
  Comrade Danzim pointed out that the propaganda and 
ideological front of this region should strive to do its work 
well in the following 11 major respects both at present and in 
the days to come: (1) To continue to do good work in arming the 
whole party with Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics; (2) to do good work in conducting 
news propaganda and in guiding public opinion; (3) to strengthen 
ideological education; (4) to make socialist culture, 
literature, and art flourish further; (5) to step up publication 
work; (6) to give wide publicity to the anti-splittist struggle 
and work of maintaining stability; (7) to step up the building 
of socialist spiritual civilization; (8) to continue to step up 
propaganda toward the outside world; (9) to put emphasis on 
strengthening propaganda and ideological work at grass-roots 
units in rural and pastoral areas; (10) to strengthen the 
contingent of propagandists and ideological workers; and (11) to 
seriously do good work in publicizing the 30th anniversary of 
the founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region. 
  Comrade Danzim emphatically pointed out: What should Tibet 
rely on to reform and develop itself, further liberate and 
develop its productive forces, and improve the people's living 
standards? It is most important and most fundamental to rely on 
the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Only by seriously 
studying the theory and arming our minds with it, can we 
correctly apprehend the party's line, principles, and policies; 
keep to a correct orientation, correct road, and correct 
measures in reform and development; and attain the objectives of 
reform, development, and stability in this region. 
  Danzim called on the whole region to study Volume 3 of the 
"Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," the decision of the Third 
Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the 
guidelines of the Fifth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth 
Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee, simultaneously; and to 
apply what is learned in the study to bring about a more 
comprehensive, thoroughgoing, and down-to-earth development. 
  On publicizing the anti-splittist struggle and work of 
maintaining stability, Comrade Danzim emphasized: Tibet's 
stability is a political issue concerning the situation and 
stability of the whole country. Without a stable social and 
political environment, Tibet's reform and development will be an 
empty word. Propagandists and ideological workers should deem 
it their duty to maintain social stability in Tibet; always put 
the stress of propaganda and ideological work on publicizing the 
anti-splittist struggle, maintaining the unification of the 
motherland, strengthening unity among all nationalities, and 
maintaining social stability; be (?faithful) [zhong shi] 
ideologically and solid in work: and actively maintain a 
political situation of stability and unity in this region. 
  Comrade Danzim called on the news media in Tibet to meet the 
needs of establishing the new socialist market economic 
structure, start new special columns and new programs on special 
topics, improve editorials, commentaries, theoretical articles, 
and serial reports, increase the weight and depth of news media, 
and help create a powerful public opinion for Tibet's economic 
construction, reform, and opening up. 
  In conclusion, Deputy secretary Danzim pointed out: 
Propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the 
undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
It should be done by the whole party and all party members 
should attach importance to it. Party committees at all levels 
must pay great attention to propaganda and ideological work, 
strengthen leadership over it, and seriously build both material 
and spiritual civilizations and attach equal importance to both. 
The party committees should conscientiously assume the 
responsibility for leading propaganda and ideological work in 
their respective localities and departments, strive to 
accomplish all tasks, improve the quality of propaganda and 
ideological work, and make new and greater contributions to 
promoting reform, development, stability, and comprehensive 
social progress in Tibet.

<F P=106> ["Regional Procuratorial Organs Make New Progress in </F>
Fighting Corruption in the New Year"] 
  [Text] Tibet's procuratorial organs have made new progress 
in safeguarding political and social stability as well as in 
protecting and removing obstacles to reform, opening up to the 
outside world, and economic construction in the new year. 
  Last year, Tibet's procuratorial organs earnestly 
implemented 
the central authorities' guidelines on fighting corruption and 
concentrated on handling economic crimes such as embezzlement 
and bribery. The chief procurator personally organized and 
directed his personnel. He also participated in handling major 
and important cases. Anticorruption departments introduced a 
system of responsibility for the handling of cases and adopted 
flexible means for investigating economic crimes. To find clues 
for use in cases, procuratorial organs held press conferences, 
established boxes or telephones for people to offer information 
about crimes, and adopted various means to publicize laws. The 
procuratorial organs focused on handling criminal cases 
involving the working personnel of party and government organs, 
judicial organs, law-enforcement administrative departments, and 
economic administrative departments. According to statistics, in 
1993 the region's procuratorial organs received 408 clues on 
economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery and handled 77 
cases involving 83 people. Of these cases, 40 were major cases 
involving 42 people. Seven major criminal cases involved nine 
county and departmental-level cadres. The handling of these 
cases helped recover 4 million yuan for the state. In the 
process, a number offenders guilty of embezzlement and bribery 
were punished. This has heightened the prestige of the 
procuratorial organs in the minds of the people of all 
nationalities in Tibet. 
  The year 1994 is crucial for Tibet's reform, which has 
entered the period of package advancement and breakthroughs in 
key areas. To better serve reform, opening up to the outside 
world, and economic construction, the people's procuratorial 
organs, as always, will further concentrate on cracking down on 
economic crimes. A leader of the regional people's 
procuratorate said: This year, the region's procuratorial 
organs will continue to give priority to punishing people guilty 
of embezzlement and bribery, and will earnestly implement the 
principle of "handling cases strictly in accordance with law." 
Strictly enforcing laws is a precondition for cracking down on 
economic crimes. We must rectify the phenomenon characterized 
by failure to abide by the law and lax law enforcement, must 
deal accurate and relentless blows at criminals, and must ensure 
that procuratorial organs seriously carry out their functions. 
  At the same time, the leader stated: Efforts should be made 
in making new breakthroughs in handling major cases. All cases 
involving leading cadres at and above county and 
departmental-levels must be investigated and handled. Anyone 
who is involved in a crime must be thoroughly investigated. 
  He concluded: We must strengthen leadership over 
investigation and handling of major and important cases. The 
chief procurators must personally organize and direct his 
personnel, and personally participate in handling cases. We 
should learn from good experience in handling economic crimes, 
and supervise and provide better guidance to procuratorial 
organs at all levels. In 1994 we will achieve new victories in 
fighting corruption.

  [Text] A provincial meeting on rural work closed in Kunming 
yesterday. During the meeting, provincial party committee 
Secretary Pu Chaozhu once again emphasized the importance of 
in-depth reform in rural areas at and below the county level. 
Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng delivered the concluding speech. 
  Pu Chaozhu said: To deepen the reform in rural areas at and 
below the county level, we first need to properly adjust the 
ownership structure. The reality in Yunnan is that the province 
has an underdeveloped economy and a simple ownership structure 
both of which are unfavorable to development of the productive 
forces. 
  Pu Chaozhu stressed that it is necessary to start the 
adjustment of the ownership structure from the following 
aspects: First, it is necessary to transform small state-owned 
enterprises at and below the county level into collectively-run 
or private enterprises through auction, sale, lease, or contract 
for private management with the ownership retained by the state. 
Second, it is necessary to go all out to develop the individual 
and private economies. Third, it is necessary to vigorously 
introduce the joint-stock cooperative system. Fourth, it is 
necessary to contract out uncultivated hilly land, slopes, and 
plots of land on river banks or in valleys to individuals for 
management. Local residents, people from the vicinity or from 
other provinces, and foreign investors are all welcome to 
contract for the management of all sorts of wasteland. To 
deepen the reform in rural areas, we must also thoroughly change 
the form of production and management, promote socialized 
large-scale production, expand the socialized service system, 
and run the businesses at an appropriate scale of operation. 
With regard to the management system, we must introduce the 
system of integration of agriculture, industry, commerce, 
technical services, and trading, as well as the 
production-supply-marketing integrated system. By and large, we 
must go all out to further the rural reform in depth and to 
vigorously promote the productive forces in rural areas. 
  In his concluding speech Vice Governor Huang Bingsheng said: 
During this meeting we have conscientiously discussed such 
issues as the tasks regarding rural reform, the adjustment of 
the rural production structure, and the plan to strive for a 
bumper harvest this year. The participants now have a better 
understanding, reached a consensus, and have clearly defined the 
targets, tasks, measures, and methods regarding the future 
development of agriculture and the rural economic reform in our 
province. Some requirements have been set on this year's spring 
farming. 
  The meeting commended 57 advanced localities which had 
upgraded their agriculture to a new level in 1993, of which 
Eryuan County, Dali City, Puer County, and Luchun County were 
awarded first-class prizes, Qujing Prefecture and 22 other 
localities won second-class prizes, and Wenshan Zhuang and Miao 
Nationality Autonomous Prefectures plus 29 other prefectures, 
autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties won third-class 
prizes. 
  Vice Governor Yang Jianqiang presided over the meeting. 
Present at the meeting were provincial party, government, and 
army leaders Liang Jinquan, Zhao Shumin, Zhang Baosan, Meng 
Jiyao, Bao Yongkang, Zhao Tingguang, Qiu Chuangjiao, and Li Jie; 
former leading members of the provincial party committee Sun 
Yuping and Liang Jia; party and government leaders from all 
prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties; as 
well as the people in charge of all the departments and 
committees of the provincial party committee, state organs at 
the provincial level, the provincial commissions, committees, 
departments, and bureaus, various public organizations, and all 
colleges and universities.

  [Text] The first quarter of this year saw a low growth in 
industrial output in Shaanxi Province. The aggregate gross 
output value of industrial enterprises at and above the township 
level amounted to 12.65 billion yuan, an increase of 7 percent 
over the same period last year, indicating a marked slowdown in 
the growth rate. Of this gross output value, state-owned 
enterprises contributed more than 9.8 billion yuan, a mere 
increase of 3 percent. Township-run industrial enterprises had 
the highest growth of 39 percent; collective-run enterprises had 
the second highest growth of 17.7 percent; and the growth of 
heavy industry was still higher than that of light industry. Of 
principal industrial products, the output of color television 
sets, color television kinescopes, radio sets, washing machines, 
and refrigerators increased rapidly. The output of the 
following products decreased: cigarettes, white wine, beer, iron 
ore, steel products, crude oil, coal, timber, cement, and 
heavy-duty trucks. Electric energy production increased by 6.6 
percent. 
  The most prominent problem in industrial production in the 
first quarter was that the economic returns of industrial 
enterprises declined, more enterprises were suffering losses, 
and their profit margin decreased remarkably, with 53.3 percent 
of large and medium-sized enterprises, 37.4 percent of 
state-owned enterprises, 14.2 percent of collective-run 
enterprises, and 50.7 percent of province-run enterprises 
suffering losses. The amount of profits of industrial 
enterprises decreased by 87.2 percent as compared with the same 
period last year. 
  Some longstanding problems in economic operation have landed 
the province's industrial sector in a very grim situation. Now 
and in the future, Shaanxi Province needs to vigorously adjust 
its production structure and product mix and strive to increase 
profits and reduce losses by deepening reform and improving 
management.

  [Text] Beijing, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- The concerned 
departments of the Taiwan authorities recently used the "Qiandao 
Lake incident" as a pretext to announce the "temporarily 
halting" of cultural exchange activities between the two sides 
of the Strait and "boycott" travel to the mainland and economic 
exchanges between the two sides. The actions taken by the 
Taiwan authorities have cast a shadow over relations and 
contacts between the two sides and have made more and more 
people on the island worried and dissatisfied. People of many 
trades and professions hold that the Taiwan authorities' actions 
are not appropriate and that the suspension of exchanges and 
contacts with the mainland will hurt Taiwan the most. 
  Taiwan's tourist business will suffer seriously due to 
"boycotting travel to the mainland." Taiwan's "Mainland Affairs 
Commission" decided to boycott travel to the mainland by the 
people starting 1 May and the tourist services would have to 
assume economic losses due to the decision. People of related 
trades pointed out that travel to the mainland account for a big 
proportion of Taiwan's tourist business. In Taibei [Taipei] 
City alone, there are some 100 travel services handling travels 
to the mainland. April and May are peak months for travel to the 
mainland with 15,000 to 18,000 travelers each month. The travel 
services will suffer at least 100 million New Taiwan dollars' 
economic losses due to the halt of travel to the mainland. 
People of Taiwan's tourist business pointed out that in the 
past seven years, Taiwanese visited the mainland some 6 million 
times. The number is unprecedented and the people's visits are 
practical exchanges between the two sides. Travel and contacts 
between the two sides of the strait must not stop because of 
this singular "Qiandao Lake incident." 
  People in business circles also hold that the two sides of 
the strait have already established close contacts and that the 
retrogression of economic exchanges and trade between the two 
sides will bring very big harm and loss to Taiwan's businessmen. 
Huang Zhaofu [Huang Chao-fu], secretary general of Taiwan's 
"Industrial Association for Relations Between the Two Sides of 
the Strait," said: Many Taiwan businessmen told the association 
that economic and trade activities must not be influenced by the 
"Qiandao Lake incident." Taiwan businessmen's interests are 
mixed together with the mainland's interests, and we should make 
no distinction between what are one's own and what are other 
people's interests. Using the "Qiandao Lake incident" to create 
a big display will only hurt the interests of Taiwan's 
businessmen and cannot stop the tide of Taiwan businessmen's 
investment on the mainland and economic exchanges and trade 
between the two sides of the strait. 
  The temporary halt of cultural exchanges was also opposed by 
people of cultural circles. Many people of the cultural circles 
pointed out that cultural exchanges between the two sides of the 
strait are favorable to Taiwan's absorbing the mainland's 
advantages in culture, science and technology and are conducive 
to Taiwan's cultural development. To stop cultural exchanges 
between the two sides because of this singular incident will 
hurt understanding and link established gradually through 
cultural exchanges. 
  Taiwan's news media also pointed out that some people on the 
island are using the "Qiandao Lake incident" to instigate Taiwan 
compatriots' anti-mainland sentiments and advocate "Taiwan 
independence." They are both inadvisable. The Taiwan 
authorities' "boycotting measures" are to seize on an incident 
to exaggerate matters and will hurt both sides, especially the 
people in Taiwan.

<F P=106> [Commentary by station editor Huang Keren: "From Which </F>
Direction Does the Threat to Taiwan Come?"; from the "News and 
Current Events" program] 
  [Text] Not long ago, the state security organ cracked a 
case of spy sent by Taiwan's Kuomintang [KMT]. Liu Hui, who was 
sent by Taiwan's KMT military intelligence bureau to sneak into 
the mainland to conduct espionage activities, was arrested 
according to law. This was another indication of the persistent 
hostility cherished by the Taiwan authorities. 
  A very large problem exists in the development of 
cross-strait relations: namely, the persistent hostility on the 
part of the Taiwan authorities toward the mainland. The Taiwan 
authorities treat the mainland as a powerful foe posing a threat 
to the security of Taiwan. On 27 September last year, the 
Taiwan authorities held an army-navy-air force joint military 
exercise, comprised mainly of landing, anti-landing, airborne, 
and anti-airborne operations, in Penghu [Pescadores] area, 
targeting the mainland as the imaginary enemy. This was a 
military exercise of a comparatively large scale in recent 
years. In February this year, Taiwan's marines conducted a 
military exercise code-named (?Lien-ching 68), comprised mainly 
of offensive surprise landing operations from the sea, in waters 
off the coast of southwestern Taiwan. Meanwhile, the motorized 
units of Taiwan's army will conduct north-south joint war games 
soon. All of these military exercises are directed against the 
mainland. The scale of these exercises was rarely seen in those 
conducted in previous years. In addition, the Taiwan 
authorities' national policy center sponsored a seminar on the 
management of national defense to specially study the issue of 
Taiwan's security, treating the mainland as the main foe that 
poses a threat to Taiwan's security. Such practices on the part 
of the Taiwan authorities not only cause cross-strait relations 
deteriorate and spoil the peaceful and propitious atmosphere 
across the Taiwan Strait, but will make our own people sad and 
the enemy glad. 
  For a considerably long period of time to come, the mainland 
will dedicate its efforts to reform, opening up, and economic 
construction, and will strive for fulfillment of the grand 
objectives of promoting economic development and building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, it needs an 
international and domestic environment of long-term stability to 
achieve this end. It is entirely groundless to say that the 
mainland poses a threat to Taiwan's security. Just the 
opposite, the mainland has taken a number of initiatives, such 
as dissolving the Fuzhou Military Region, reducing the number of 
army units stationed in Fujian Province, and making some ports, 
wharves, and military installations available for civilian use, 
to resolve the cross-strait hostility and to bring about a 
change in the situation of confrontation, thereby making 
important contributions to the improvement and development of 
cross-strait relations. 
  The threat to Taiwan's security does not come from the 
mainland. Instead, it comes from the Taiwan independence 
movement that has been bent on disrupting Taiwan's stability and 
has been trying hard to split the motherland. The mainland has 
played an important role in checking the Taiwan independence 
movement. It is an important force that maintains Taiwan's 
stability and protects Taiwan's security.

  [Text] Beijing, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A five-day working 
conference on mainland-Taiwan economy, presided over by the 
State Council, ended in Beijing today. 
  Communist Party and state leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao 
Shi, Hu Jintao, Li Lanqing, Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Luo Gan and 
Wang Zhaoguo attended the conference. 
  Chinese President Jiang Zemin noted that the reunification 
of 
China is the historical mission of the Chinese people and it is 
the will of all Chinese people and an irresistible historical 
trend. 
  He said that in recent years, the economic relations across 
the Taiwan Straits have been developing rapidly and have a sound 
basis. 
  He stressed that enhancing the economic exchanges and 
cooperation on the two sides of the straits will promote common 
development and common understanding and facilitate the 
development of economic relations of the two sides and 
reunification of the country. 
  Premier Li Peng said that the economy on the two sides can 
complement each other. 
  He said that the economic cooperation between the two sides 
benefit the people both on the mainland and Taiwan. 
  He called for improvement in the investment environment on 
the mainland and stressed the importance of infrastructure 
construction and cultural and ethical construction. 
  He said that the State Council will enhance coordination of 
the development of mainland-Taiwan economic relations and in due 
time solve any problems in the sector so as to promote the 
healthy development of the mainland-Taiwan economic relations. 
  Thus, he said, Taiwan businessmen's investment in mainland 
will fit in with the mainland's industrial policy and the 
businessmen will be able to make profits. 
  He said that only through economic cooperation would the 
mainland and Taiwan achieve common prosperity. 
  After reviewing work on the mainland-Taiwan economic 
relations in recent years, the conference noted that under the 
guidance of the basic principle of "one country, two systems" of 
the central committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the State 
Council has formulated and adopted many effective policies and 
measures in recent years. 
  With the efforts of local governments and departments, 
Taiwan 
compatriots gradually lost their misgivings about trade and 
economic activities with mainland counterparts. They broke 
through the Taiwan authorities' various limitations and 
contributed to the development of mutually complementary and 
beneficial economic and trade relations and common prosperity of 
the two sides of the straits. 
  Now all provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities 
have 
Taiwan businessmen-funded enterprises. 
  The conference pointed out that the mainland's economic laws 
and regulations concerning protecting Taiwan businessmen's 
lawful rights and interests are improving. 
  It noted that the rapid economic development, establishment 
of a socialist market economic structure and the vast market on 
the mainland constitute a unique opportunity for the continuous 
economic development in Taiwan. 
  The conference pointed out that while Taiwan 
businessmen-funded enterprises are encouraged to operate well on 
the mainland, the comprehensive economic exchanges and 
cooperation will be promoted. 
  The conference called on the mainland and Taiwan to enhance 
cooperation in opening up international markets and cooperation 
in agriculture and technological industry. 
  It also called for direct exchange of mail service, trade 
and 
air and shipping services between the two sides across the 
Taiwan straits. 
  The conference stressed implementation of the law on 
protection of the investment of Taiwan compatriots, solution to 
problems in consultations on information, policies and laws in 
economic activities for Taiwan businessmen, raising work 
efficiency and improving service quality so as to provide more 
convenient conditions for Taiwan businessmen. 
  Vice-Premiers Li Lanqing and Qian Qichen also spoke at the 
conference.

  [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- Justice Minister Ma 
Ying-jeou said Tuesday [19 April] that the Republic of China 
[ROC] has not exploited prison laborers for economic gain, in 
accordance with a United Nations' Convention on Human Rights. 
  Ma, in response to an inquiry by Kuomintang Legislator Cheng 
Chien-jen, stressed that the export of toys manufactured by a 
Taichung Prison to the United States has also not violated 
either ROC or United States law. 
  The associated press reported in a dispatch from Colorado on 
Monday that a 10-year-old boy found a note from a toy glider he 
bought. The note read, in broken English: "Hey lucky friends. 
This toys make in prison Taiwan ROC." The writer asked the 
recipient of her note to "investigate Taiwan ROC disobey 
international human right law." 
  Ma noted that the present law requires inmates to learn 
skills in prisons. "The process is legal," Ma said. 
  He emphasized that none of the inmates in Taiwan's prisons 
have been exploited, and that the firms contracting with the 
prisons here have not subsequently gained an unfair competitive 
edge. 
  Ma said the government will give an accounting of its 
prison-labor practices to the United States. He tried to play 
down the significance of the incident, saying it has drawn wide 
attention only because of its dramatic nature. 
  Officials at Taichung Prison identified the writer of the 
note as Liu Hsing-ping, 40, who began serving his nearly 13-year 
sentence for theft and rape in January 1991. 
  The prison has 45 workshops where inmates are employed by 35 
manufacturers engaging in toy-making, printing, sewing and other 
lines of work. 
  According to ROC law, the inmates are paid to work six to 
eight hours a day, with 40 percent of the pay going into their 
pockets and the remaining 60 percent used for upgrading prison 
facilities.

<F P=106> [By Kao Ling-yun and Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, April 19 (CNA) -- Three Taiwan legislators 
Tuesday charged Beijing with infringing upon Taiwan's right to 
participate in the United Nations. 
  The trio -- Chen Che-nan and Stella Chen of the Democratic 
Progressive Party and Tsai Chung-han of the ruling Kuomintang -- 
made the charge to the UN Commission on Human Rights. 
  They asked the commission to send officials to Taiwan to see 
for themselves Taiwan's current political and economic situation 
and its desire to join the UN. 
  "A trip to Taiwan will help you understand how unreasonable 
it is that the 21 million people in Taiwan are not represented 
in the world body," Stella Chen told a commission official. 
  The three lawmakers also asked the UN commission to condemn 
Beijing for its callous handling of the March 31 Qiandao Lake 
travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists died, and push 
Beijing to unveil the truth about the incident. 
  The UN official said the three must furnish the commission 
with more data before it can accept their charge against Beijing. 
  He told the Taiwan lawmakers that the UN General Assembly 
recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate government of China 
and regards Taiwan as part of China. 
  "That is a political reality which this commission, a UN 
affiliate, cannot revoke," the official noted. 
  He said although he is fully aware that Taiwan and Mainland 
China are ruled by two different governments and each has its 
own military, "I, as a UN civil servant, cannot freely criticize 
the UN for turning a blind eye to such facts." 
  He added that even if Taiwan declares independence after 
holding a plebiscite, its chances of joining the UN are still 
slim unless the UN General Assembly changes its "one China" 
policy. 
  Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since Beijing 
assumed the UN China seat in 1971. 
  The three lawmakers told the news media later that they will 
launch a "one person, one letter" campaign after returning to 
Taiwan, which will encourage every Taiwan resident to write to 
the UN expressing the country's strong desire to win a seat in 
the world body. 
  They arrived in Geneva late Monday [18 April] after 
attending 
a meeting of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization 
(UNPO) in the Hague. 
  At their request, the UNPO filed a lawsuit against Beijing, 
on behalf of Taiwan, in the International Court of Justice 
Monday for Beijing's repeated attempts to prevent Taiwan from 
entering the UN. 
  Two court officials accepted the lawsuit, but they didn't 
make any comments or explanations. 
  The three Taiwan lawmakers later lodged a protest with the 
mainland Chinese Embassy in the Hague, demanding that Beijing 
apologize to the bereaved families of the 24 Taiwan tourists 
killed in the Qiandao Lake incident, and stop blocking Taiwan's 
efforts to join the UN. The trio put their protest in an 
embassy letter box as no embassy official would meet them. 
  Dozens of overseas Chinese from the Netherlands and Germany 
joined the three in a demonstration outside the mainland embassy. 
  The three along with another DPP legislator, Parris Chang, 
arrived in the Hague last Friday to attend the UNPO round table 
meeting which was chaired by Chang. 
  The UNPO, an alternative United Nations, was founded in the 
Netherlands in February 1991 to help ethnic minorities and 
peoples which are not represented in the UN or other major world 
organizations.

  [Text] The Hague, April 15 (CNA) -- The Unrepresented 
Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) will support Taiwan's 
bid to join the United Nations, UNPO Secretary-General M.C. Van 
Walt Van Praag said Friday [15 April]. 
  The Hague-based organization has a wealth of experience in 
lobbying the United Nations and maintains close relations with 
some Western countries. "We can use our special ties and 
experience to help Taiwan win a UN seat," Van Praag told CNA. 
  The UNPO can also mobilize the world news media to support 
Taiwan's UN bid, he noted. 
  Taiwan has been kept out of the world body since Beijing 
assumed the UN China seat in 1971. 
  Van Praag said UNPO may discuss detailed measures to help 
boost Taiwan's UN bid during its April 18 round table session. 
  However, Van Praag, a lawyer and an international law 
expert, 
said the UNPO cannot sue Beijing in the International Court of 
Justice for blocking Taiwan's entry to the UN. 
  "Only UN members or affiliate organizations can file 
lawsuits 
in the world court," explained Van Praag. "Although the UNPO is 
recognized by the UN as a non-governmental organization, it is 
not a UN affiliate," he noted. 
  Van Praag, who is also legal advisor to Tibetan spiritual 
leader the Dalai Lama, was commenting on a proposal by four 
Taiwan legislators that the UNPO sue Beijing in the world court 
on behalf of Taiwan. 
  The four -- Parris Chang, Stella Chen, Chen Tze-nan of the 
Democratic Progressive Party and Tsai Chung-han of the ruling 
Kuomintang -- arrived here Friday to attend the UNPO round table 
session. 
  Parris Chang, chairman of the UNPO Steering Committee, will 
chair the meeting, which will discuss the prevention of 
international conflict in the post-Cold War world. 
  The two-day conference will bring together more than 200 
delegates from 36 UNPO members, the United Nations, the UN high 
commissioner for refugees, and other major international 
organizations. Senior officials from the Dutch Foreign Ministry 
and several European countries will also attend the meeting. 
  The UNPO, an alternative United Nations, was founded in the 
Netherlands in February 1991 to help ethnic minorities and 
peoples which are not represented in the UN and other major 
world organizations.

<F P=106> [By reporter Lu Chao-lung (0712 2507 7127)] </F>
  [Text] Taipei -- It was disclosed that the Army will spend 
more than NT$ [New Taiwan Dollars] 10 billion for the purchase 
of 200 Patriot missiles of an improved version to equip three 
missile companies to be deployed in northern Taiwan to guard 
against tactical missiles and air defense. The Patriot is the 
only missile that has had actually been able to counterstrike 
other missiles. 
  During a luncheon with Legislator Wang Tien-chin yesterday 
[13 April], Lt. General Chang Kuang-chin, deputy commander in 
chief of the Army, and other high-ranking Army officers briefed 
him in detail about the purchasing plan. The Army was quite 
impressed with Wang's recent rather professional questions on 
Patriot missiles. 
  It was disclosed that, after extensive assessment, the Army 
is able to combat the problem of launching Patriot missiles even 
under circumstances that the Republic of China [ROC] lacks 
satellite navigation for missile launching. A high-ranking 
general also confirmed that the launching of Patriot missiles 
will not be affected by lack of satellite navigation. Army 
officers also learned from a study trip in the United States 
last July that the U.S. Army does not consider the Patriot 
outdated and will continue to improve the missile. 
  Regarding how accurate the missile is in hitting a target, 
information provided by the Army shows that Patriot missiles can 
be 40 to 70 percent accurate in hitting a target. The 
information is based on various sources, including briefings at 
the U.S. Congress given by an assistant chief of staff of the 
U.S. tactical planning units. 
  It was pointed out that Patriot missiles have been improved 
four times and the system the ROC Army will purchase is the 
latest. On the basis of the tactical capabilities it 
demonstrated in the Persian Gulf War, this model has gone 
through the U.S. Army's tactical tests and thus has a better 
launching control system.

  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- President Li Teng-hui 
will address the Nicaraguan Parliament on his official visit to 
the Central American country next month, a Foreign Affairs 
Ministry official said Friday [15 April]. 
  "President Li would become the third foreign head of state 
to 
give a speech to the Nicaraguan Parliament," said Hou 
Ching-shan, an official with the Ministry's Central &amp; South 
American Affairs Department, who is fresh from visiting 
Nicaragua to arrange Li's trip. 
  "It would be the highest honor accorded to the head of a 
foreign state," Hou said. 
  President Li will arrive in Nicaragua on May 4 and then meet 
with Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Hou said, 
adding that a joint statement will be issued following the 
meeting. 
  Li will also visit a Taiwan-owned textile factory that 
employ 
1,500 workers, making it the largest single employer of textile 
workers in Central America. 
  From Nicaragua, Li will proceed to Costa Rica on May 6 to 
attend the inaugural ceremony for President-Elect Jose Maria 
Figueres. Li will be awarded a medal by Costa Rica in 
recognition of his contribution in promoting ties between the 
two countries. 
  A joint communique will also be issued after a meeting 
between Li and the outgoing Costa Rican President Rafael Angel 
Calderon. 
  Accompanying Li on the two-leg visit will be Foreign Affairs 
Minister Chien Fu, Chairman Hsiao Wan-chang of the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development, and Governor Samuel C. Shieh 
of the Central Bank of China. 
  Nicaragua and Costa Rica, along with five other Latin 
American countries, submitted a letter to United Nations 
Scretary-General Butros Butros Ghali last August requesting that 
the United Nations put the Republic of China's UN bid on the 
agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993. The 
request was later voted down.

  [Text] Taipei, April 16 (CNA) -- The Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) reportedly has reached an agreement with 
the Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China [ROC] on a US$50 
million low-interest loan to Nicaragua. 
  Under the agreement, the Taiwan bank will extend a US$30 
million 20-year soft loan to Nicaragua at 3 percent annual 
interest. The loan includes a 78-month principal and interest 
holiday, the Taipei- based UNITED DAILY NEWS reported in a 
dispatch from Washington, DC, on Friday [15 April]. 
  IDB agreed to provide U.S.$20 million of the loan, which is 
expected to be used for Nicaragua's agricultural development 
projects, the paper said. 
  If realized, the paper said, it will be the second loan 
extended by IDB and Taiwan. In 1992, they loaned U.S.$130 
million to Nicaragua to help the Violeta Barrios de Chamorro 
administration modernize its trade and banking sectors. Taiwan 
provided U.S.$30 million of the loan, the paper said. 
  However, an Export-Import Bank spokesman told CNA that he 
knew nothing about the proposed loan and a Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs official, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied an 
agreement had been reached with the IDB. 
  The official declined to elaborate. 
  The report came less than three weeks Before president Li 
Teng- hui is scheduled to visit Nicaragua. Li will meet 
Nicaraguan President Chamorro during his May 4 visit. 
  Nicaragua is a staunch ally of Taiwan. Nicaragua, together 
with six other Latin American countries, submitted a letter to 
United Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali last August 
requesting that the UN put the Republic of China's UN bid on the 
agenda for the 48th General Assembly in September 1993.

  [Text] Taipei, April 16 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan 
and the United States will meet in Washington next month to 
discuss tariff and non-tariff trade issues related to Taiwan's 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) membership 
application, a Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) official said 
Saturday [16 April]. 
  "The second round of informal Taiwan-U.S. trade 
consultations 
under the GATT framework will begin May 9 and we hope the talks 
will produce concrete results," said Tsai Lien-sheng, a BOFT 
department director. 
  Major topics will include tariff reductions and the removal 
of non-tariff trade barriers, including liberalization of 
agricultural imports, government procurement and aircraft 
purchases, Tsai noted. 
  During the first round of talks held in Taipei in late 
February, American delegates were dissatisfied with 
Taiwan-proposed tariff cuts on a range of industrial and 
agricultural products. 
  Tsai said the U.S. wants Taiwan to make greater tariff 
reductions in accordance with the GATT Uruguay Round accord and 
allow free imports of farm products. 
  Tsai said the government will seek a 10-year adjustment 
period for local rice farmers. Taiwan will only allow imports 
of 1 to 4 percent of its annual rice consumption for the first 
10 years after joining GATT. After the adjustment period, 
Taiwan's market will become fully open to foreign rice imports, 
he explained. 
  Tsai said Taiwan may agree to sign a GATT agreement on 
government procurement to facilitate its GATT entry. 
  BOFT Deputy Director-General Lin Yi-fu will head the Taiwan 
delegation to the May talks, Tsai added.

  [Text] Taipei, April 14 (CNA) -- Acid rain is posing a 
greater threat to Taiwan than ever before, according to the 
Environmental Protection Administration [EPA]. 
  An EPA official said the north of Taiwan was at greatest 
risk, but that the pattern exists around the island. 
  According to data collected by the EPA from 12 sites around 
the island from September [word indistinct] through March 1994, 
the rain falling at Wanli, a coastal township about 30 minutes 
drive from Taipei, was the most acidic, with an average PH level 
of 4.3. 
  PH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in 
water. The range of PH values is from 0 to 14. PH levels from 0 
to 7 indicate acidity, with 0 being the most acidic, and PH 
levels from 7 to 14 indicate alkalinity. A PH level from 6 to 8 
is considered safe. PH levels in rain at all 12 sites the EPA 
kept statistics for were all below 6. 
  The EPA statistics show that rain falling at Wanli and 
Panchiao, a suburb of Taipei, [words indistinct] levels of 3.9 
in January, while Yangmingshan and Kuanying -- also in the north 
-- also had especially acidic rainfall. 
  The lowest levels of acidity in rain were found in Taihsi in 
western Taiwan and Taitung in the southeast. PH levels there 
were 5.6 -- signaling a smaller threat to the environment, but a 
threat nonetheless.

<F P=106> [By Harald Bruning in Macao] </F>
  [Text] The Portuguese Prime Minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva, 
will meet the Governor, Chris Patten, today to discuss the 
run-up to 1997 and Macao's reversion of sovereignty in 1999. 
  Cavaco Silva, who arrived in Hong Kong yesterday afternoon 
from Macao for a two day visit, denied that Chinese leaders had 
given him a message to convey to Patten during his seven-day 
visit to China last week. 
  Speaking at a press conference before he left Macao 
yesterday, Cavaco Silva said Portugal would strengthen its 
presence in Macao after 1999 with the establishment of 
Portugal's largest mission in a foreign country. 
  Unlike Britain's stormy relationship with Beijing, Portugal 
has so far avoided any public dispute with China over the 1999 
hand-over and both countries regard the enclave as Chinese 
territory under Portuguese administration. 
  "I am very interested in talking with Chris Patten about the 
transition periods of Macao and Hong Kong," Cavaco Silva said. 
"If I had any message from Chinese leaders for Chris Patten, I 
would not reveal it here [in an interview]." 
  Cavaco Silva also yesterday defended his stance on human 
rights during his talks with Chinese leaders -- the Premier, Li 
Peng, and President Jiang Zemin. 
  He has been criticised by the Catholic Church in Portugal 
which accused him of not pursuing the issue adequately. The 
Portuguese media also accused Cavaco Silva of avoiding raising 
the issue in order to acquire trade advantages for Portugal. 
But the Prime Minister said that a "discreet" and "private" 
approach when dealing with China on the issue achieved better 
results than discussing it "on a public square". 
  Cavaco Silva said Portugal advocated the "Western and 
democratic concept of human rights" in its relations with 
foreign countries, particularly those in Asia and Africa. 
  The Prime Minister said Portugal would also make efforts to 
establish itself as a gateway for Asian businesses while Macao 
constituted an "advantage for the Portuguese" entering China and 
other regional markets.

  [Text] Lu Ping, the director of the Hong Kong and Macau 
Affairs Office, will visit the territory next month for the 
first time since Chris Patten took office as Governor. 
  He will attend meetings of the Preliminary Working Committee 
(PWC) - China's "second stove" - but will avoid any contact with 
Patten and other senior Hong Kong government officials. 
  There was "absolutely no way" that Lu would meet the 
Governor 
next month "no matter how many times he has been invited by 
Patten", a senior Chinese official said yesterday. 
  Mike Hanson, the Government's spokesman, said Patten had 
recently written to Lu to again invite him to Hong Kong but had 
not received a reply. "We want to go on talking on a whole 
range of issues. We are happy to do so. 
  "Lu is directly involved in all these issues and dialogue 
must be useful for the long term well-being of Hong Kong," 
Hanson said. "The Governor has made it clear many, many times 
that he would be delighted to welcome Lu Ping to Hong Kong." 
  Lu was last in Hong Kong to bid farewell to the previous 
governor, Lord Wilson. His decision to stay away is seen as a 
response to the controversial political reform plans Patten 
published in October, 1992. The Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) on the new airport stipulates that Lu and Patten should 
"hold regular meetings" to discuss Hong Kong affairs. Lu will 
attend the PWC's government and administration and economic 
sub-committee meetings from May 2-5. 
  A Chinese official based in Hong Kong said there were 
political considerations behind the decision to hold PWC 
meetings in the territory. "It shows that the Chinese 
government is determined to facilitate the work of the PWC and 
to make it public that the so- called second stove, or shadow 
government, is working effectively," he said. Lu will be 
accompanied by his two deputies, Wang Fengchao and Chen Ziying. 
  Lu is expected to remain in Hong Kong for another few days, 
a 
Chinese official said, to "gather first-hand information about 
Hong Kong's sentiments" towards the PWC's work.

<F P=106> [By Sally Blyth] </F>
  [Text] The Executive Council [Exco] has approved the 
legislation needed for setting up of the controversial Court of 
Final Appeal, paving the way for talks on the issue to reopen 
with China within the next few weeks. 
  The draft bill is based on the 1991 Sino-British agreement 
on 
the Court of Final Appeal, which was vehemently opposed by the 
legal profession and legislative councillors at the time. There 
are also signs that China will not be entirely happy with the 
legislation either. However, Exco's endorsement comes amid 
renewed government warnings that legislators will be left with a 
stark choice: "now or never" if the court is to be set up before 
1997. [as published] 
  The Government has also revealed there are already signs of 
international uncertainty over the territory's future legal 
system. 
  Senior officials said a copy of the draft bill, together 
with 
an explanatory note, would be submitted to China within the next 
"two to three weeks", and it is hoped the talks can begin with 
Beijing as soon as possible after that, under the auspicies of 
the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group. 
  Britain always promised China would be consulted over 
implementation of the 1991 agreement. That accord limits to one 
the number of overseas judges who can sit on the five member 
body. However, there are already indications from Beijing that 
it wishes to put further restrictions on the composition of the 
court by insisting that the Chief Justice, who will head it, and 
the three local judges will be Chinese nationals with no right 
of abode other than Hong Kong. Under the Basic Law, only the 
Chief Justice has to meet this requirement and there has been no 
previous mention of the nationality of the three judges. The 
Government maintains there is no reason for Beijing to oppose 
the new law since it has followed all previous accords on the 
issue. 
  There remains the further hurdle of the bill then being 
passed by the Legislative Council [Legco]. So far there has 
been no sign that either the legal profession or legislators 
have eased their opposition to the original Sino-British 
agreement. Legco has vowed to fight the bill on the grounds 
that the limit placed on the number of overseas judges who can 
sit on the body is in breach of the Joint Declaration and the 
Basic Law. 
  Government sources have reiterated concern that time is 
running out for the establishment of the Court of Final Appeal. 
They say there is no hope of renegotiating the deal and unless 
the court is set up in accordance with what has been agreed, 
there is a grave danger that Beijing might establish a Court of 
Final Appeal after 1997 which would be worse than the present 
arrangements. The administration is also warning there are 
signs the international community is already wary of the 
uncertainty over Hong Kong's judicial system and this could get 
worse in the run-up to 1997.

  [Text] The territory's pro-Beijing forces split further 
yesterday, the day after the liberals formed a new alliance. A 
new pro-China party, the Hong Kong Progressive Alliance, to be 
officially launched today, has more than 50 members, most of 
whom have close contacts with the Chinese Government. Its core 
members include Ambrose Lau Hon-chuen, a Hong Kong affairs 
adviser and Central and Western District Board chairman Yu 
Sun-say, a delegate to the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Committee; Yu Kwok-chun, an affairs adviser and 
owner of the Yue Hwa Chinese Products Department Store. 
  Mr Lau said members did not share the political beliefs of 
the pro-China flagship, the Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment of Hong Kong (DAB), and felt they needed their own 
party. "There's no reason why we should join DAB and not form 
our own party?" Mr Lau said. He said it was unfair to label the 
party as pro-China but emphasised that their strong links with 
China would enable better communication. Members have informed 
XINHUA (the New China News Agency) of their intention to form 
the party. 
  The party will field candidates for September's District 
Board election.

<F P=106> ["Analysis" by political editor Chip Tsao: "Party Merger Is </F>
a Pragmatic Move"] 
  [Text] The merger of the United Democrats and Meeting 
Point to form the new Democratic Party, announced yesterday by 
Martin Lee and Anthony Cheung, is a blow to China's "united 
front" ploy to divide and conquer Hong Kong's democratic forces. 
Hong Kong's political battlefield provides fertile ground for 
China to employ this powerful political weapon in place of more 
violent means to impose its will on the political system. 
  Hong Kong entered a new era of political pluralism after the 
signing of the Joint Declaration. But the concept of pluralism 
was carried too far as democratic parties sprouted like 
mushrooms. The union of the two parties is not only a pragmatic 
response to China's divisive strategy, but a rare move breaking 
the cultural myth that Chinese people are hopeless in standing 
united together. It would only be too natural for Beijing to 
read this unprecedented development in Hong Kong's short 
democratic history with an eye of suspicion. 
  Lee and Cheung yesterday came out as winners, although the 
leader of the new party will not be decided until a party 
election in October. The appeal for others to join the union 
was directed to other equally influential politicians like 
Christine Loh and Emily Lau, both independent legislative 
councillors. If they heed the appeal, it will not only soften 
the male-dominated image of the new party, but harden its 
political muscle by showing voters that the new party is 
equipped with some of the most forthright pioneering 
personalities who will contest the 1995 election. This, in 
turn, will be balanced by the relatively moderate and 
intellectual former members of the Meeting Point. 
  One of the losers is Frederick Fung Kin-kee's Association 
for 
Democracy and People's Livelihood (ADPL). The ADPL's image was 
tarnished seriously when one of its founding members, Law 
Cheung- kwok, raised his hand mistakenly to agree to a motion 
proposed by some Hong Kong members of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference last month in Beijing to urge 
the Chinese government to disband the three-tier councils after 
1997. Since then Fung's party has been at pains to explain that 
it has not been opportunistic and sycophantic in its relations 
with China. 
  The formation of the new party will only further embarrass 
the ADPL as it becomes marginalised. Relations between the ADPL 
and some United Democrats have been cool since 1989. Some 
veteran United Democrats, like Szeto Wah, view the ADPL with a 
mixture of contempt and jealousy for its limited communications 
with Beijing. 
  Fung says he has a sense of deep respect for Szeto, claiming 
that his party was only following Szeto's old teaching of using 
the carrot-and-stick ploy to deal with China. Its differences 
with the United Democrats as a whole are less easily glossed 
over. In fact, it seems that Fung has no choice but to unite 
his party with the new Democratic Party, by way of a rite to 
cleanse itself of the Law's appalling sin. Indeed the ADPL is 
already knocking timidly on the door of the honeymooning newly 
wedded political couple by "welcoming" the merger, asking if 
there is still room for it to join the threesome. 
  Other parties yet to form an alliance are Allen Lee's 
Liberal 
Party and Tsang Yok-shing's Democratic Alliance for the 
Betterment (DAB) of Hong Kong. They, however, make a much less 
well-matched couple than the United Democrats and Meeting Point. 
Their only common ground is that neither wants to upset Beijing 
and the electorate at the same time. Some Liberals see the idea 
of uniting with the DAB, being the party with a clear 
pro-Chinese birthmark, as a suicidal move that will kiss goodbye 
to Liberals' chance of getting directly-elected in 1995. 
  Xu Tzemin, a local member of China's National People's 
Congress, has tried to be a marriage broker, dying to see the 
newly-formed adulterous "anti-communist alliance" contained by a 
united counterpart. It is unlikely there will be another 
wedding party soon. It looks like an ironic retribution that 
Hong Kong's democrats have stolen China's secret recipe of the 
"united front" to form their own real united front.

  [Text] The merger between the main liberal political 
parties -- the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) and Meeting 
Point -- will strengthen the electoral position of the 
pro-democracy camp. That prospect alone will provoke China's 
ire. But the formation of the Democratic Party also represents 
a form of united front, a tactical turning of the tables on 
Beijing, and China will find this all the more infuriating. 
  Beijing has been trying to woo what it regards as "moderate" 
liberals away from the "subversive" UDHK. That tactic has 
suffered an awkward reverse. Far from isolating the UDHK, it 
has drawn the democratic movement into its bosom with the 
appointment of Meeting Point Chairman Anthony Cheung Bing-leung 
as a Hong Kong Affairs adviser. Mr Cheung now turns out to be a 
UDHK ally after all. The merger allows Meeting Point to put its 
democratic credentials on display, after some months during 
which it seemed they might have been placed in the bottom drawer. 
  China undoubtedly sees the new party's pending foundation as 
a provocation. Already officials are saying the merger has not 
changed their view that core members of the United Democrats are 
subversive. 
  But the new party is also an opportunity and a challenge. 
For the United Democrats have shown that their oft-proclaimed 
desire for dialogue with China is not mere lip service. They 
see the value of having a link, through Meeting Point, to China. 
The opportunity for China is to take up the implied offer, in 
the interests of hearing different points of view so it can 
better understand the thoughts and feelings of all the people of 
Hong Kong. 
<H5>  Pragmatism </H5>
  The recent unhappy history of political relations between 
Hong Kong and China suggests anger will prevail, but it would be 
far better if dialogue could follow. 
  The merger, however, is not merely an anti-Beijing 
countermeasure. At a more fundamental level, it reflects 
maturity and pragmatism on the part of both parties. It is a 
recognition that neither has anything to gain from allowing 
their opponents to exploit largely artificial divisions in the 
liberal camp. A single party has a better chance of winning an 
election outright than a coalition of like-minded parties. Even 
nominally divided, the democratic camp is less than the sum of 
its parts. 
  However, while the merger may have been dictated by simple 
electoral arithmetic -- and the need to dispel any public 
perception of differences over China policy which would have 
kept the voters away in droves -- its long-term success will 
depend on how it weathers China's expected attempts to blow it 
apart. 
<H5>  Cold shoulder </H5>
  From what mainland officials have said, it seems likely 
China 
would not have appointed Mr Cheung as an adviser if it had known 
he was about to make common cause with the United Democrats. 
Faced with the failure of its attempt to drive a wedge between 
the parties, it must now decide whether to cancel his 
appointment -- and thus confirm its cold shoulder of the UDHK. 
  A more subtle resolution to its dilemma would be to exploit 
Mr Cheung's apparent desire to maintain some favour with Beijing 
to place destructive strains on the UDHK from within. However, 
that would be an admission that the UDHK as a party is not 
beyond the political pale. 
  China should not find dealing with the new party impossible 
on grounds of principle. Meeting Point and the more compliant 
Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood both retain 
group membership of the "subversive" Hong Kong Alliance in 
Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China. The UDHK 
does not. Yet China has accepted the leaders of both the first 
two parties as advisers, while rejecting the United Democrats on 
the grounds that some of its leaders are core members of the 
alliance. 
  In practice, however, China will have difficulty accepting 
members of the UDHK, since this would make it harder to exclude 
it from elections to the first post-1997 legislature. If it 
confirms Mr Cheung's appointment as an adviser, Hong Kong's 
pro-democracy politicians will have strengthened their position 
not only for the 1995 elections but also for those thereafter.

  [Text] Construction firms and the Provisional Airport 
Authority remain deadlocked over contract conditions despite 
three days of negotiations. Talks broke up yesterday afternoon 
without the expected agreement which would have ended the 
10-week row. This was despite concessions by the authority 
which resulted in provisional agreements on four of the five 
issues raised by the Hong Kong Construction Association and 
agreement on 20 minor amendments. The remaining point 
outstanding is how contractual disputes should be handled. 
  Contractors said that without an agreement on this point a 
deal on the rest was meaningless. The four tentative agreements 
clarify the duties and powers of the project manager, limit 
contractors' responsibility for extra work to structures it has 
also designed, limits the amount of general damages authority 
can impose, and restricts the work needed to make good ground 
settlement. No new date for further discussions has been fixed 
but the two groups are likely to be in contact over the next few 
days to set a timetable for the next meetings. 
  "There has been a substantial measure of agreement and a 
substantial measure of flexibility," said an authority 
spokesman. "I think both sides need to have time to reflect on 
the progress which has been achieved and consider their future 
options accordingly." After talks with the authority ended, the 
association's negotiating team held a meeting with 
representatives from more than 25 contracting firms who have 
boycotted four airport advance works contracts. Held behind 
closed doors, the meeting enabled association negotiators, 
including legal and contract specialists, to give contractors a 
progress report. The contractors decided to continue the 
boycott until there is an agreement to include similar dispute 
resolution measures to those on government- funded airport core 
projects. These allow for mediation and adjudication while 
construction continues and arbitration at the end of the 
contract if the dispute is still unresolved. The authority 
originally refused to accept these measures because "they were 
not in the public interest". Called ADR (alternative disputes 
resolution), they were proposed by the association. 
  "Without ADR agreements about the rest of the conditions are 
meaningless because it allows the authority to slip all the 
onerous conditions back into the contract again once work is 
underway. Under the present dispute procedure there is no 
redress until the end of the contract and that is unacceptable," 
commented one contractor. "Contractors and consultants mistrust 
the authority so much that there is a solid feeling that if we 
do not take steps to protect our interests now then this will be 
the last chance we get," added another. Consequently no bids 
will be submitted on Friday for any of the four contracts for 
passenger terminal foundations, temporary roads, water pipelines 
and site accommodation. Nevertheless the authority is hoping 
there can be a quick settlement to the row. This will permit it 
to announce a revised tender date.

  [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Three projects -- in 
Henan, Hunan and Shanxi provinces -- were given awards here 
yesterday as outstanding contributions to the elimination of 
poverty in China. 
  At the same awards giving ceremony, 75 technologists were 
presented with the service award of the Zhenhua poverty relief 
by technology fund. 
  The fund has been donated by Hong Kong academic circles. 
  A leading official of the State Science and Technology 
Commission (SSTC) said at the ceremony that the fund was of 
great importance, because the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong are 
jointly promoting the work of poverty elimination through 
technology. 
  Sponsored by the society of Hong Kong Scholars (SHS), the 
fund aims to encourage and support technological and 
professional personnel to go to poverty-stricken areas to help 
citizens there to escape poverty. 
  Elimination of poverty and common prosperity are considered 
as the basic requirement of socialism and a reflection of the 
advantages of a socialist system in China. 
  At the national conference on poverty elimination held last 
month, China promulgated an ambitious seven-year plan to wipe 
out abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothing 
shortages for the remaining 80 million poverty-stricken citizens. 
  The official said that the key to the goal lies in the 
advancement of science and technology and improvement of 
knowledge and skills of farmers. 
  Since 1986, the state commission for science and technology 
has given 8.5 million yuan of special funds for poverty 
elimination, and 200 million yuan in loans. 
  Furthermore, it helped poverty-stricken areas to bring in 
more than 400 poverty elimination projects and 2,700 suitable 
techniques, which made direct profits of 800 million yuan for 
the poor. 
  Most of the below-poverty-line citizens live in rural areas 
of 699 counties in the central and western parts of China.

  [Text] Macao, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said today that his recent visit to 
Beijing made him confident about Macao's future. 
  Cavaco Silva made this remark at a news conference held here 
today. 
  The Portuguese prime minister, whose visit coincides with 
the 
seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese joint 
declaration, described the joint declaration as a symbol of 
cooperation between China and Portugal and a document providing 
the basis for Macao's future. 
  He said, "to speak in a frank way, the Chinese Government 
has 
strictly implemented the joint declaration in the past seven 
years, which gave us confidence in dealing with the macao issue." 
  When answering a question about China's economic 
development, 
silva said that he was deeply impressed by the rapid economic 
development in China, which in fact has also surprised other 
European countries. 
  He noted, the portuguese government supports the resumption 
of China's trading party status in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), saying international elements could 
make China's economy maintain a sustained rapid development. 
  The Portuguese prime minister ended his four-day visit to 
Macao and left for Hong Kong for a 24-hour visit this afternoon.

  [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese 
Premier Li Peng and Uzbek President Islam Karimov had a 
wide-ranging and in-depth exchange of views this morning on 
bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual concern. 
  At their formal meeting, Karimov said that with Li's visit, 
the Uzbek-Chinese ties have entered "a new stage of maturity," 
according to a Chinese spokesman. 
  Central Asia, where Uzbekistan is located, represents a huge 
market with vast potentials, Karimov said, adding that expansion 
of business contact between Uzbekistan and China is in line with 
the fundamental interests of the two peoples, and is conducive 
to regional stability and prosperity as well. 
  Along with efforts to develop trade and economic 
cooperation, 
the two countries should also strive to expand exchanges in 
cultural and other fields, he said, adding that he expects Li's 
visit to "strongly boost the growth of bilateral ties." 
  Li, meanwhile, praised President Karimov's contributions to 
the growth of relations between the two countries. 
  On bilateral trade and economic cooperation, Li described 
the 
successful Sino-Uzbek joint ventures here as "only a beginning." 
he invited entrepreneurs of Uzbekistan to go to China for study 
tours as a way to forge a more comprehensive cooperation. 
  The Chinese premier said he was satisfied with the 
wide-ranging contact and with the agreements or letters of 
intent signed between the two sides in the past two days. A 
delegation of leading Chinese businessmen is traveling with the 
premier. 
  On regional issues, Li said the development of China's 
relations with Central Asian nations would not affect its ties 
with other nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS), including Russia. 
  "We hope the CIS nations would maintain friendly relations 
and work together for regional stability and development," he 
added. 
  Li noted that China and Uzbekistan, which have no 
fundamental 
conflict of interests, share identical or similar views on many 
major international issues. 
  "Therefore, the development of our bilateral relations 
enjoys 
a comprehensive basis," he said. 
  "China is ready to have regular exchange of views or 
consultations on regional and international issues with 
Uzbekistan so as to enhance mutual understanding and trust," he 
said. 
  Li said he believed that Uzbekistan would succeed in 
revitalizing its national economy although it might encounter 
some "temporary difficulties." 
  During the talks, the premier, on behalf of Chinese 
President 
Jiang Zemin, also extended invitation to Karimov to visit China 
again later this year. 
  Uzbekistan is the first leg of Li's 12-day five-nation tour 
which will also take him to Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan 
and Mongolia.

  [Text] Tashkent, April 19 (XINHUA) -- China and Uzbekistan 
signed four agreements this morning on bilateral cooperation 
aiming at boosting economic development between the two 
countries. 
  Premier Li, who is in Tashkent on a seven-day official 
visit, 
and President Islam Karimov attended the signing ceremony of 
these documents. 
  These include an agreement on the Chinese Government 
providing loans to the Government of Uzbekistan, the Sino-Uzbek 
agreement on civil aviation, an exchange of notes on China 
presenting a batch of materials to Uzbekistan and an agreement 
on cooperation between China Council for the Promotion of 
International Trade and Uzbekistan's Ministry of Foreign 
Economic Relations.

with Li signed with Uzbek businesses several agreements and 
letters of intent on cooperation in the fields of construction, 
petroleum, metallurgy, textiles, paper-making and electronics. 
  Under these agreements, China will purchase not only 20,000 
tons of cotton from Uzbekistan next year but also 20,000 tons of 
cotton velvet annually from the country in the future.

venture and an assembly line for household electric appliances

first of its kind argentina has signed with an Asian country, 
and was also the first a Latin American country has signed with 
China. 
  He added that the memorandum would facilitate direct 
exchanges between the two ministries.

<F P=106> [Video report by unidentified correspondent; from the </F>
"National News Hookup" program] 
  [Text] During his inspection of grain work in Tianjin from 
2 to 4 April, Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC Central Committee 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice premier of the 
State Council, emphatically pointed out that we should conduct 
in-depth investigations and studies, seek opinions from people 
from all walks of life, and make a scientific decision, to 
develop as soon as possible a grain production and marketing 
system that is in line with China's national conditions and the 
socialist market economy. 
  Accompanied by leaders of the State Commission for Economics 
and Trade, the Ministry of Internal Trade, and Tianjin 
Municipality, Zhu Rongji inspected Tianjin's (Zhaofuli) Grain 
Store and (Zhishuidao) farm products marketplace, and heard a 
report on Tianjin's economic situation and on the production, 
supply, and marketing of grain and agricultural and sideline 
products. Zhu Rongji fully approved the Tianjin Municipal CPC 
Committee's and Government's placing great importance on 
agricultural and grain work. 
  Zhu Rongji said: Grain is the most treasurable thing and 
grain price is the base of all prices. Stability of grain 
market affects the entire social stability. Leaders at all 
levels must have a full understanding of this. Since grain 
prices were decontrolled on 1 April last year, the situation of 
grain markets in the country has been good in general. However, 
decontrolling grain prices does not mean that we can relax 
macroeconomic regulation and control over grain market. On the 
contrary, governments at all levels should truly tighten 
management of grain market, ensure ample grain supply, and 
prohibit grain speculators from reselling grain at a profit and 
driving up grain prices. Grain market must always be under the 
state's control. Food is the greatest concern of the people. 
All localities -- be they grain production areas or major grain 
marketing areas, and be they coastal or interior provinces -- 
should deepen their understanding of the importance of grain 
issue, and governments at all levels should regard it as an 
important part of their work, in order to ensure that grain work 
is properly done.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of report by Chen Biting, chairman of the </F>
Jiangsu Provincial Planning and Economic Commission, on the 
implementation of Jiangsu's 1993 national economic and social 
development plan and the draft 1994 plan] 
  [Text] 1. Implementation of the 1993 Plan 
  In 1993, all localities in Jiangsu were able to maintain the 
vigorous momentum of economic development and achieve new 
success in all social causes. This is a result of following 
through with the guidelines from the important talks which 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave in southern China and the guidelines 
laid down by the 14th National CPC Congress, namely seizing 
opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside 
world, accelerating the restructuring process, expediting 
scientific and technological progress, and intensifying 
macroeconomic regulation and control. On the whole, the 
situation was gratifying. The province's gross value of goods 
and services increased 18.5 percent, totaling 225 billion yuan, 
and attained the goal of quadrupling the province's industrial 
and agricultural output seven years ahead of time. The output 
of cereal and oil-bearing crops was basically stable, and the 
rural economy developed in all sectors. The value of total 
agricultural output increased 8.4 percent, totaling 79.6 billion 
yuan in 1993. Total grain output was 32.797 million tonnes, and 
total output of oil-bearing crops was 1.257 million tonnes, 
which was slightly lower than a year ago. The total cotton 
yield decreased 18.7 percent, dropping to 429,000 tonnes. The 
development of village and town enterprises and export-oriented 
businesses was quite fast. The industrial economy grew rapidly 
and the level of overall development was higher. In 1993, the 
output value yielded by enterprises operated by townships and 
larger areas increased 34.2 percent, totaling 502.4 billion 
yuan. The sales rate of industrial goods produced by 
enterprises operated by townships and larger areas increased to 
95.3 percent, up from 93.6 percent a year ago. The composite 
index of industries' economic returns totaled 99.34 percent. 
The investment pattern continued to improve, and significant 
progress was made in building major infrastructures and basic 
industries. Public investments in fixed assets increased 51 
percent, totaling some 107.49 billion yuan. This included 
state-owned units' investments of 45.87 billion yuan, or a 59.3 
percent increase in their fixed assets. Many major capital 
construction projects and technological upgrading projects were 
put into operation or were basically completed. The development 
of tertiary industries picked up speed, and the commodity market 
was prosperous and stable. The added value of tertiary 
industries in 1993 was 62.3 billion yuan, an increase of 20.3 
percent. The total sales of consumer goods in the year 
increased 33.9 percent, totaling 107.42 billion yuan. Banking 
operations continued to improve, and the growth of revenues was 
quite quick. The amount of public savings was 36.934 billion 
yuan more than that registered early in the year, and the amount 
of loans extended was 28.916 billion more than that registered 
early in the year. Revenues in 1993 increased 45.3 percent, 
totaling 22.13 billion yuan. Opening up wider to the outside 
world, the province's export-oriented economy developed 
vigorously. Total imports and exports in the province increased 
39.2 percent, totaling $8.7 billion. The total amount of 
foreign capital actually used in the province increased 90.9 
percent, totaling $3.29 billion, and the establishment of 10,032 
new foreign-invested businesses was approved. Enterprises made 
some headway in replacing their operating mechanisms, and 
reforms continued to deepen in various fields. A total of 600 
limited-liability companies and 104 corporations selling stocks 
to specific sectors were established throughout Jiangsu, and the 
stocks of six companies were listed. Small state-owned 
enterprises carried out all sorts of reforms such as 
restructuring operations, switching production, leasing out 
operations, contracting outside businesses, and selling 
themselves to buyers. A total of 9,500 urban enterprises as 
well as village and town enterprises became joint-stock 
businesses. Substantial headway was achieved in rural and price 
reforms. Remarkable results were achieved in promoting 
scientific and technological development. Educational services 
were improved. The province accomplished 100 projects of 
developing and producing major new products, popularized 2,000 
types of new technology, and many centers were built for 
tackling scientific and technological problems, for conducting 
industrial experiments, and for carrying out engineering 
research. The province accelerated the pace of its educational 
reform, restructured its educational system, and improved the 
basic education. Compulsory nine-year education was carried out 
in 28 counties (cities and districts) as well as 420 townships 
and towns. Illiteracy was wiped out among 565,000 young people 
and people in their 30's through 50's. The people's standard of 
living continued to improve. The province's total population 
was 69,672,700 by the end of the year; the natural population 
growth rate was 7.36 per thousand. By the end of the year, 2 
percent of urban dwellers were unemployed. Per capita wages 
increased 26.6 percent, totaling 3,533 yuan; the per capital 
income of farmers increased 207 yuan, or 19.4 percent, totaling 
1,267 yuan. New success was achieved in the development of 
cultural and health services, radio and television broadcasts, 
sports, civil affairs, environmental protection, tourism, and in 
promoting socialist ethics. 
  Major problems existing in Jiangsu's economic and social 
life in 1993 were demonstrated by: 1) latent factors of 
instability in agriculture: 2) a worsening funds problem; 3) 
insufficient vitality and low efficiency among state-owned large 
and medium enterprises; 4) a structural contradiction remained 
conspicuous; and 5) an excessive rise in commodity prices with 
the overall social retail commodity price index reaching 15.4 
percent. 
<H5>  2. Guiding Thoughts in Mapping Out Plans for 1994 and </H5>
Several Major Tasks To Be Fulfilled Well 
  Guiding thoughts in mapping out a province-wide plan for 
1994 
will be: To thoroughly implement guidelines of both the 
14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenum of the 14th CPC 
Central Committee and to realize the overall objectives of 
establishing a socialist market economic system by further 
emancipating the minds, seizing the opportunities, intensifying 
reform, accelerating opening to the outside world, speeding up 
structural adjustment, strengthening macaoeconomic regulation 
and control, striving for better efficiency and quality in 
economic operations, attaching greater importance to maintaining 
the basic balance between total social supply and demand, and 
ensuring sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic 
development to promote all-around social progress. Based on 
the aforementioned guiding thoughts, the primary goals for 
province-wide national economic and social development for 1994 
will be: 
  A 12-percent increase in GNP, of which increases in 
primary, secondary, and tertiary industry will be 4 percent, 14 
percent, and 18 percent, respectively; 
  A 7-percent increase in revenues; 
  An investment of 124 billion yuan in total local social 
fixed assets, which represents a 25-percent increase; 
  A total import and export value of $9.5 billion -- a 
9-percent increase -- of which the total value of exports will 
increase by 17 percent to reach $7 billion; 
  An actual use of foreign funds amounting to $4.2 billion 
-- a 27.6 percent increase -- of which the direct use of foreign 
funds will be increased by 30 percent to reach $3.9 billion; 
  A total social commodities retail volume of 129 billion 
yuan, or a 20-percent increase; 
  The rate of the increase in overall social retail 
commodities prices is to be controlled, in the region of 12 
percent; 
  A 1,450 yuan per capita net income for peasants, an 
increase of 180 yuan or over 14 percent; 
  The natural population growth rate is to be limited to 
9.83 per thousand; and 
  The job-waiting rate for both urban and rural areas is to 
be controlled at 2.5 percent or lower. 
  Various tasks related to province-wide national economic and 
social development for 1994 will be thoroughly unfolded to meet 
the overall requirements of seizing the opportunities, deepening 
reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability. To achieve this year's 
set targets, we are prepared to do the following tasks 
particularly well: 
<H5>  (1) To Strengthen the Agricultural Base by Energetically </H5>
Increasing Peasants' Incomes and Promoting Overall Rural 
Economic Development. 
  First, we should continue to deepen rural reform; stabilize 
and improve the responsibility system, the main form of which is 
the household contract with remuneration linked to output; 
establish and perfect the mechanism of transferring land use 
rights; gradually liberalize both prices and the management of 
all major agricultural products; set up grain risk funds and a 
surplus stock system; strengthen the construction of a rural 
socialized service system; and strictly control and 
realistically lighten peasants' unreasonable burdens. Second, 
we should strive to increase input into agriculture to raise its 
comprehensive production capacity. The input into agriculture 
should be concentrated mainly on improving agricultural 
infrastructure; and supporting the construction of commercial 
grain and quality cotton base counties, the comprehensive 
development of agricultural resources, the construction of farm 
produce markets, the integration of trade with industry and 
agriculture in enterprises, and the agricultural service system. 
Third, we should readjust the agricultural product-mix and go 
all out to develop diversified management. We should rely on 
science and technology in develop agriculture towards a pattern 
of high yields, high quality, and high efficiency. We should 
strengthen organization and guidance over diversified management 
and, under the premise of ensuring stable grain and cotton 
output, expand the area of cash crops. We should step up 
efforts to promote the "vegetable basket" project to ensure a 
stable supply of nonstaple foods for urban areas. Fourth, we 
should energetically develop secondary and tertiary industries 
in rural areas. We should continue to develop village and 
township enterprises. In economically developed areas, village 
and township enterprises should concentrate efforts on expanding 
scale, raising product quality, and improving management. In 
underdeveloped areas, village and township enterprises should 
gradually integrate trade with industry and agriculture. We 
should advocate the establishment of lateral ties between the 
south and the north. We should vigorously develop tertiary 
industries in rural areas to expedite the shift of the rural 
work force. Fifth, we should do a good job in the production 
and supply of agricultural capital goods. We should enforce 
price differentials in the circulation of major agricultural 
capital goods. We should establish a price risk fund and 
reserve system at different levels for major agricultural 
capital goods, and should continue to renovate and expand 
industries producing support-agriculture goods in accordance 
with the Eighth Five-Year Plan. 
<H5>  (2) Actively Readjust the Industrial Structure To Promote </H5>
Efficient Growth of Industry. 
  First of all, we should emphasize the focal points of the 
readjustment and make breakthroughs in developing fine-quality, 
large-scale, high added-value, and export-oriented industries. 
We should concentrate resources on developing a number of 
highly interrelated staple products containing extensive 
technology and having high added value and marketability for 
earning foreign exchange. We should rely on key enterprises 
with rich resources to develop enterprise groups. We should 
organize Jiangsu's pillar industries to set up new enterprise 
groups. We should accelerate the implementation of the 
"hallmark engineering" project to set up high and new-tech 
industries and increase the application of technology in 
Jiangsu's industrial economy. We should further develop an 
export-oriented economy and speed up Jiangsu's convergence with 
the international economy. Second, it is necessary to 
effectively coordinate essential factors for production. 
Alleviation of the strain on Jiangsu's coal supply in 1994 will 
depend on railway transportation. Therefore, we should step up 
the coordination with relevant state departments to increase the 
delivery of coal covered by the state plan, while actively 
seeking resources not covered by the state plan. Power 
shortages will continue this year, with demand topping supply by 
more than 3 billion kwh. We shall mainly take the following 
measures: operating the existing generating units at full 
capacity; actively organizing trans-regional power supply for 
processing industries; increasing the loading factor of power 
consumption; and accelerating the construction of generating 
units. Industry will continue to face a shortage of working 
capital this year. Therefore, it is necessary to raise funds 
through various channels to increase the total capital supply; 
to energetically limit production, reduce stocks, and increase 
sales to reduce the occupation of funds; and to optimize 
investment patterns to ensure the development of key products 
and enterprises. 
<H5>  (3) Make Greater Efforts To Readjust Investment Strucure and </H5>
Concentrate Energy To Ensure the Completion of Key Projects. 
  This year, the state set the fixed assets investment scale 
for our province's collective-owned units at 82.92 billion yuan. 
The state-owned units will invest 34.05 billion yuan in fixed 
assets. A total of 12.31 billion yuan and 16 billion yuan will 
be used for basic construction and technological transformation 
at state-owned units. Under that arrangement, we will devote 
greater efforts to readjust investment structure, and we will 
use limited funds and materials for key projects conforming to 
industrial policy and for key projects that can generate good 
economic returns. In water conservancy projects, we will mainly 
direct our efforts to harness Huaihe and Taihu, and to divert 
Yihe, Shuhe, Sihe, and Tongyuhe. In the area of power supply, 
we will strive to add 1.225 million kwh of power generation 
capacity to our province this year. In transport, we will 
continue to build the Shanghai-Nanjing Expressway, first-class 
Nanjing-Lianyungang Highway and Nanjing-Nantong Highway, the 
Sunan Canal, and to start building the New Nanjing Airport, the 
Changjiang Highway Bridge at Jiangyin section, and the Xinchang 
Railway. In telecommunications, we will increase the number of 
telephones in urban and rural areas to 1.25 million. In raw 
materials, we will continue to strive to do well in steel and 
polyester production, to try to complete ongoing machinery, 
electric, light textile projects, urban infrastructure 
facilities, and other social undertakings at an early date. 
This year we will concentrate efforts to upgrade technologies 
for producing major products. We will see to the implementation 
of key projects and will monitor the progress of key projects. 
We will accelerate the construction pace of the state's and 
province's key projects and see to the completion and putting 
into production of 100 projects, including medical equipment, 
and digital-controlled machine tools as scheduled. We will step 
up the startup work on the key projects of the "87 projects." 
We will also strive to do well in the "landmark projects." 
<H5>  (4) Accelerate the Development of Tertiary Industry and </H5>
Continue To Raise Its Proportion. 
  We will concentrate on the following to accelerate the 
development of tertiary industry. First, we will accelerate the 
establishment of a market system, foster and improve a number of 
commodity markets, as well as the finance, technology, labor, 
real estate, and information markets. Second, we will stress 
improving transport, telecommunications, civil administration, 
and public services. Third, we will encourage the development 
of insurance business, the entry of foreign banks, the proper 
development of non-bank financial institutions, the 
establishment of cooperative banks in urban and rural areas, and 
the reform of social insurance and security systems. Fourth, we 
will vigorously develop promising forms of tertiary industry, 
support intelligent-type tertiary industry, standardize and 
develop the real estate market, and promote tourism and 
recreation industry. Fifth, we will encourge individuals and 
private businesses to develop tertiary industry. Sixth, we will 
pool funds through various channels to develop tertiary industry. 
<H5>  (5) Put Great Effort Into Foreign Trade and Strive To </H5>
Develop an Open Economy. 
  First of all, we should deepen reform of foreign trade 
enterprises' operating mechanisms. We should encourage foreign 
trade enterprises to move toward industrialization and 
internationalization, to amalgamate into groups, and to 
institute the shareholding system. We should continually 
accelerate granting qualified enterprises and science and 
technology research institutes the power to engage in foreign 
trade. We should support counties where conditions permit 
enterprises to engage in export. Second, we should continue to 
implement the strategy to diversify markets. We should 
extensively explore markets in Western Europe, the Middle East, 
Southeast Asia, South America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and the 
Commonwealth of Independent States. We should encourage various 
localities to look for trade opportunities in a well-guided and 
planned manner; promote marketing and after-sales service 
outside Jiangsu; and actively adjust the export product mix. 
Third, we should open up more areas to foreign investment. 
This year, we will focus on attracting foreign direct 
investment, channeling it into high-technology, large-scale, and 
high-efficiency projects, and further develop cooperative 
relations with foreign transnational companies and consortium. 
We will attract Taiwan and overseas Chinese investment in an 
ever active manner; widen channels for foreign investment in 
infrastructural facilities, raw and processed materials, high 
and new technologies, agricultural development, real estate, and 
other domains; accelerate transforming large- and medium-sized 
enterprises through utilizing foreign funds; and strengthen 
macro management over foreign-funded enterprises. Fourth, we 
should unfold foreign economic tasks in all domains, at 
different levels, and through many channels, on the basis of 
running Jiangsu's foreign economic and technical cooperation 
companies smoothly. Fifth, we should strengthen the 
construction of development zones and give full play to the 
development zones serving as "windows" to openness. 
<H5>  (6) Work Hard To Explore Markets in Urban and Rural Areas </H5>
and Continue To Improve Living Standards. 
  We should pay close attention to the issue of the market; 
strengthen market research and analysis; make great efforts to 
explore markets in urban and rural areas; continue to stabilize 
and expand sales contingents; formulate scientific and flexible 
marketing strategies; strengthen the construction of the market 
system and marketing network; organize various promotions, 
exhibitions, and order-placing fairs; make a success in 
introducing industrial products to rural areas; attach 
importance to exploring markets in rural areas and remote 
provinces and regions; strive to expand the international 
market; and increase Jiangsu-made products' market share. 
According to the state's arrangement, the public functionary 
system and wages reform are implemented step by step, thereby 
improving employees' income. With the improvement of productive 
forces and efficiency, workers' income increases 
correspondingly. At the same time, peasants' income is much 
improved, thanks to the development of the rural economy and 
increases in the price of agricultural products. We should make 
arrangements for the well-being of the retired, workers of 
loss-making enterprises, peasants in poverty-stricken areas, and 
teachers of primary and middle schools. 
<H5>  (7) Vigorously and Steadily Promote Price Reform and Strive </H5>
To Keep the Rises of the General Price Level Under Control. 
  The major thrust of the price reform is: raising procurement 
prices for grain and cotton; lifting control on coal and 
chemical fertilizer prices that fall under unified state 
distribution; breaking down the disparity in crude oil prices 
and correspondingly raising crude oil and refined oil prices; 
appropriately raising electric utility rates; cautiously 
handling reactions resulting from the readjustment of prices of 
basic products; gradually raising rents on citizens' houses; and 
adjusting fee collection items which produce conspicuous 
contradictions. In view of last year's excessive price rises 
and this year's mounting inflationary pressure, and to control 
price rises to a level tolerable to the masses, we must 
earnestly enhance our capability to control commodity prices. 
We should concentrate our price control efforts on the supply 
of vegetables and rice because these have a direct effect on the 
people's daily life. We will continue to enforce the target 
responsibility system over the level of price rises. We will 
establish a sound and special reserve system for grain, cotton, 
cooking oil, meat, and for such major commodities as coal, heavy 
oil, and means for farm production. We will set up and improve 
a market price regulatory fund as well as a risk fund for the 
prices of major commodities. 
<H5>  (8) Deepen Reform, Strengthen Management, and Manage Well </H5>
Enterprises in a Down-To-Earth Manner. 
  It is necessary first of all to implement well the 
"Regulations on the Transformation of the Management System of 
State-Owned Industrial Enterprises" and the "Regulations on the 
Supervision and Management of State-Owned Enterprises' Assets" 
and conscientiously supervise and check the implementation of 
those two regulations; to genuinely return decision-making 
rights to enterprises; to accelerate the transformation of 
government functions; to effectively lighten enterprises' 
burdens; and to resolutely put a stop to illegal collection of 
fees, fines, and other charges. Second, we must truly change 
enterprises' operation mechanisms by concentrating efforts on 
establishing a modern enterprise system. Reform of the corporate 
system should be carried out at state-owned enterprises in a 
planned manner. The pace of reforming the shareholding system 
should be stepped up. It is necessary to strive to do a good 
job at 800 state-owned enterprises which have been selected to 
carry out investigations of assets. State-owned small and 
medium-sized enterprises should continue to practice the 
management method of enterprise contracting, leasing, and sales. 
We should continue to promote the cooperative shareholding 
system at collective-owned enterprises and work toward realizing 
the goal of having 30 percent of the collective-owned 
enterprises in the province adopt the cooperative shareholding 
system this year. Encouragement and support should be given to 
the development of the non-public economic sectors. Third, we 
must enhance enterprise management and fully tap enterprise 
development potential. Campaigns to transform enterprise 
operation mechanisms, to improve enterprise management, to 
enhance enterprises' development potentials, and to increase 
enterprise efficiency should be extensively launched. There is 
a need to establish a strict management system. Continuous 
efforts should be exerted to help enterprises turn losses into 
profits and to conserve and lower energy consumption. We must 
practice strict quality control, monitor and check quality 
control work, and promote the quality- certification system 
practiced by the international business community. Fourth, we 
must stress safe production work; conscientiously implement the 
"safety first, prevention is the best" policy; enforce safe 
systems of production responsibility; enhance the safety 
inspection and supervision system; improve leadership over the 
handling of accidents; and enforce strict safety inspection 
measures. 
<H5>  (9) Pay Close Attention to Science, Technology, and </H5>
Education, Promote Coordinated Development of Social 
Undertakings. 
  We should continue to speed up the reform of the science and 
technology management system, comprehensively promote basic and 
developmental research, put new and high technology to use in 
production, and vigorously combine science and technology with 
the economy. We should promote the transformation of scientific 
and technological achievements into a productive force: 1) we 
should do a good job in carrying out a number of key projects to 
tackle difficult scientific and technological problems that have 
a great bearing on economic and social development; 2) we should 
step up the building of basic facilities for scientific research 
and support the construction of some engineering research 
centers; and 3) we should vigorously make technological 
development, hold technological demonstrations, and promote new 
products. 
  In practical terms, we should give strategic priority to the 
development of education. We should further strengthen 
elementary education and do a particularly good job in 
implementing the nine-year compulsory education system; we 
should vigorously develop secondary occupational and technical 
education and adult education; and we should stabilize and 
develop higher education. We should continue to increase our 
investment in education. People should be encouraged to raise 
funds to set up and run schools. Attention should be paid to 
improving the quality and efficiency of education and stepping 
up the building of a contingent of teachers. It is necessary to 
make vigorous efforts to develop culture, the press, publishing, 
broadcasting, film and television, public health, sports, 
tourism, and other undertakings and to further strengthen the 
building of socialist spiritual civilization. We should 
continue to do a good job in family planning, strengthen 
environmental protection, and pay attention to protecting and 
rationally utilizing natural resources such as land, mineral 
resources, forestry, and water. We should promote a coordinated 
development of both the environment and the economy. 
<H5>  (10) Further Improve and Strengthen Macroeconomic Regulation </H5>
and Control; Raising the Coordinating Capability of the Economy. 
  In 1994 we should take measures to further improve and 
strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. First of all, 
we should effectively carry out various reforms according to 
unified state arrangements. Second, we should effectively 
maintain a balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply 
and readjust the economic structure. In macroeconomic 
regulation and control, the province this year should focus its 
attention on optimizing the economic structure and improving 
efficiency and strive to maintain a basic balance between 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Third, We should make 
full use of local favorable conditions and rationally readjust 
the distribution of productive forces. We should take effective 
measures to support northern Jiangsu in accelerating the 
construction of infrastructural facilities. Fourth, we should 
do well in making long- and medium-term plans and start drafting 
the Ninth Five-Year Plan and a long-term program for the period 
from now to 2010. Fifth, we should strengthen our forecasting 
and analysis of economic trends and regularly provide economic 
information to grass-roots units and enterprises. Sixth, we 
should continue to strengthen the capability of macroeconomic 
regulation and control at the provincial level and ensure the 
completion of key provincial- level projects and tasks. 
Seventh, economic planning departments should effectively 
improve their work methods, work style, efficiency, and services 
according to the requirement for changing functions, so as to 
make a greater contribution to economic construction.

  [Text] The 900-MW large nuclear plant fuel package [zu 
jian 4809 0115] production line has been comprehensively 
completed in the Yibin Nuclear Fuel Package Plant and was 
formally put into production a few days ago. This is a 
gratifying step toward realizing the goal of equipping the Daya 
Bay Nuclear Power Plant with homemade fuel. 
  As China's only nuclear power plant fuel package production 
base, since its founding in 1991, the broad masses of workers, 
cadres, engineers, and technicians in the Yibin Nuclear Fuel 
Package Plant have labored under an excessive workload and, 
after two years and seven months of efforts, the plant has 
smoothly passed the following five rigorous tests one after 
another: The test by the State Bureau for Nuclear Safety; the 
simultaneous acceptance test of the three aspects of 
environmental protection by the State Environmental Protection 
Bureau; the project construction appraisal by French 
specialists; the industrial approval test; and the product 
approval test. The plant will begin to provide the No. 2 
Generating Unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant with [words 
indistinct]. This will enable us to provide large nuclear power 
plants with as much homemade fuel packages as possible.

  [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- Navy Commander-in-Chief 
Adm. Chuang Ming-yao will resign Saturday [16 April] to take 
responsibility for a cash-for-secrets scandal sweeping the 
Navy's top ranks, Defense Minister Sun Chen said Friday. 
  Vice Defense Minister Adm. Ku Chung-lien, 62, will succeed 
Chuang, who will become a strategy advisor to the president, Sun 
added. 
  "Chuang, whose resignation comes only two weeks before his 
two-year tenure expires, will step down to take responsibility 
for a major arms procurement scandal involving many of the 
Navy's top brass," Sun explained. Investigation into the 
scandal was sparked last December by the murder of Navy Captain 
Yin Ching-feng. 
  Chuang, 65, is the first senior naval officer to step down 
since the body of Captain Yin was found floating in the sea off 
Taiwan's northeastern coast December 10, 1993. 
  Meanwhile, Chang Chen-ya, director of the Navy's Political 
Warfare Department, will also leave his post Saturday, Sun said. 
  "The personnel changes are the first step the government has 
taken to assume responsibility for the Yin case," Sun noted, 
adding more military officers will be disciplined for the arms 
purchase scandal which includes bribe-taking and leaking of 
military secrets in addition to the death of Yin. 
  Disciplinary measures will be announced after judicial 
authorities make a final judgment on those involved, Sun added. 
  On Thursday, military prosecutors indicted Captain Kuo 
Li-heng, a Navy weapons procurement officer who has been in 
custody since late last year, for corruption and leaking 
military secrets. 
  Kuo allegedly took bribes totaling NT$12 million 
(us$452,830) 
offered by civilian arms dealers in exchange for military 
secrets, the Ministry of National Defense said. 
  The ministry did not detail what secrets were leaked and 
whom 
the information went to, but the local media said earlier that 
Kuo gave the information to an arms dealer who worked for a 
foreign arms supplier. 
  Kuo will be tried by a military court and if convicted, he 
will face either the death penalty or life in prison. 
  Kuo faces a separate trial by a civilian court for his 
alleged role in the Yin murder case. A Taipei prosecutor has 
promised to issue indictments for Kuo and three other suspects 
before the end of April. 
  Yin, whose killers have not yet been identified, is believed 
to have been murdered as he was about to disclose irregularities 
in the awarding of lucrative military contracts, the local media 
said. The Defense Ministry and police have offered cash rewards 
totaling NT$7 million for information leading to the arrest of 
Yin's killers. 
  At least eight other military officers and six local arms 
dealers have been detained for the case.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- Some 2,000 villagers 
in the northeastern district of Hong Kong's New Territories on 
17 April staged a rally, strongly condemning the British Hong 
Kong authorities' support for amending the draft of the "New 
Territories Land (Exemption) Regulations" in an attempt to 
divide up the people of Hong Kong and to induce social 
instability in New Territories. 
  In a speech at the rally, Liu Huangfa, chairman of the New 
Territories Township Council, said: With only three or more 
years left before China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over 
Hong Kong, the customs and habits and traditional rights and 
interests of the original inhabitants of New Territories are 
being brutally trampled upon. What is worse is that the British 
Hong Kong authorities, intending to break the promise made when 
they leased New Territories, have suddenly rendered support to 
some council members' motion to amend the draft of the "New 
Territories Land (Exemption) Regulations." He said: "We are 
justified to believe that quarters concerned are carrying out a 
major scheme aimed at destroying the traditions of the New 
Territories, depriving the original inhabitants of their rights 
and interests, and dividing up the people of Hong Kong." 
  Chairmen of the seven township councils in the northeastern 
district, as well as many villagers, including women, and former 
inhabitants of the New Territories who have taken up residence 
abroad, spoke at the rally, supporting the New Territories 
Township Council's action to protect the original inhabitants' 
lawful rights and interests. A female college student denounced 
some Legislative Council members for making statements that 
smear the image of original female inhabitants of the New 
Territories. According to her, the majority of the original 
female inhabitants, who do not care much about the family assets 
of their father's generation, hold a harmonious and ethical 
society more important than material interests. 
  After the rally, villagers proceeded to Fengji Township to 
pay tribute to martyrs who died while resisting British troops 
96 years ago. In 1898 when British colonialists wanted to 
forcibly lease New Territories after occupying Hong Kong, more 
than 100,000 people of the 423 New Territories villages staged 
valiant resistance and many died heroically. In April 1899 when 
British troops took over the New Territories, the masses 
bombarded British barracks and were brutally suppressed. Some 
200 villagers sacrificed their lives.

  [Text] Yesterday, Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial 
party committee and governor, visited with delegations from the 
cities of Sanming and Putian to listen to their discussions on 
the government work report and he discussed his views with the 
deputies on issues such as the development of agriculture and 
the rural economy, technological transformation of old 
state-owned enterprises, technological input, and the building 
of spiritual civilization. 
  Jia Qinglin said: In view of the relatively low income the 
peasants earn from working the land, the provincial government 
has taken some measures and increased grain prices. Therefore, 
it is necessary for leaders in various localities to do more 
ideological work, encourage the spirit of dedication, and manage 
grain-producing areas well. Not only should grain-producing 
areas pay attention to grain production, but the coastal areas 
should also do the same. When talking about the new line of 
thinking on developing grain production, he said: We should not 
develop a one-crop economy and take grain as the key link as we 
did in the past, because such a practice will lead us nowhere. 
Grain production should be carried out as part of the entire 
rural economic development in connection with the development of 
a diversified economy and the bid to increase the peasants' 
income. The more grain production is developed, the greater the 
need to develop a diversified economy will become. Only when 
the entire rural economy develops and the peasants' income rises 
can grain production possibly be uplifted. 
  When discussing large and medium-sized enterprises, he 
pointed out: Large and medium-sized enterprises must speed up 
the pace of technological transformation, continuously upgrade 
technology, enhance their competitiveness, and at the same time, 
do a good job of the basic work to establish a modern enterprise 
system, strengthen internal enterprise management, continue to 
change the way enterprises operate, and gradually strive to 
become modern enterprises. 
  When dealing with technological input, he remarked: There is 
still a problem of low returns in regard to the current 
transformation of scientific and technological research 
achievements into productive forces. Scientific and 
technological efficiency cannot entirely be achieved by relying 
exclusively on government investment. It is necessary to 
conduct a series of reforms in agriculture and the scientific 
research structure and absorb some useful experiences from 
foreign countries. It is my hope that departments concerned 
will do more research. 
  Jia Qinglin also stressed: It is necessary to place 
simultaneous stress on the two civilizations and attach 
importance to the development and construction of Meizhou Wan.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 18 (XINHUA) -- East China's Fujian 
Province has designated its priorities for economic development 
this year. 
  The major tasks were discussed at a recent economic 
symposium 
attended by Hong Kong, Macao and overseas Chinese entrepreneurs, 
as well as local government officials. 
  They put forward the following tasks: 
  -- The further improvement of the current open pattern of 
this coastal province to promote local development. The 
construction of the economic zone at the mouth of the Minjiang 
River, and the petroleum, chemicals, iron and steel and power 
industries, and the port at Meizhou Bay will be speeded up. The 
economy in the mountainous area will be promoted with the 
building of Wuyishan Airport and railway construction. 
  -- Infrastructure construction will be accelerated to 
improve 
the investment environment. The province's planned investment 
in infrastructure is 26.2 billion (about three billion U.S. 
dollars), 20.4 percent higher than last year. Some 30 key 
infrastructure projects have been designated by the province, 21 
of which are in the transport and power sectors. 
  -- Approval procedures for foreign investors will be 
streamlined. Crucial problems concerning major projects will be 
coordinated by the provincial government. Laws and regulations 
concerning foreign- funded projects will be strengthened. 
  -- Foreign investment will be oriented mainly toward ports, 
the power industry, airports, highways, agriculture and the 
technical upgrading of old enterprises. 
  -- Foreign-funded firms will be helped in their operations, 
especially in the fields of marketing, raw materials, labor and 
energy supply. 
  -- Efforts will be made to maintain a stable influx of 
foreign funds. 
  Wang Jianshuang, deputy governor of Fujian, told the 
symposium that the province would provide more convenient 
conditions for overseas investors.

<F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan recently in Fuzhou] </F>
  [Text] Fujian, China's frontline province with Taiwan, is 
hoping to penetrate Taipei's "white glove" mainland policy by 
opening her harbour resources to Taiwan businesses. The 
invitation by the newly-elected Fujian Governor Chen Mingyi is a 
tempting offer because Taiwan which has achieved impressive 
economic growth over the past decade, has been under great 
pressure to expand its already saturated harbours. Taiwan's two 
largest ports, Keelung and Kaohsiung, have been so heavily 
congested in recent years that seagoing vessels often face 
lengthy delays. 
  According to Mr Chen, Taiwan's petrochemical and shipping 
business could reap impressive economic benefits if they made 
use of port facilities on Fujian's 3,300-kilometre coastline. 
For example, Mr Chen said Fujian was ready to open the Meizhou 
Bay and a military port at Sandouao to Taiwan. They are ideal 
for the construction of deep-water port facilities. Mr Chen 
believed these two ports not only provided a solution to the 
congestion problems at Taiwan's Keelung and Kaohsiung, they 
could also serve as entrepot to Taiwan. Furthermore, economic 
co-operation between Fujian and Taiwan could also cover joint 
development of petroleum resources in the Taiwan Strait, 
meteorological studies and agriculture, Mr Chen said. 
  According to another Fujian official, Communist Party 
Secretary Jia Qinglin, Beijing has already earmarked Zhangzhou 
in southern Fujian as a "priority development zone" and promised 
to allocate 20 million yuan (HK$17.76 million) every year for 
its development. The last attraction was considered a direct 
response by Beijing to an earlier suggestion by Taiwan President 
Lee Teng-hui that Taiwan farmers might consider joining hands 
with their mainland counterparts. 
  Plagued by rising land cost and serious environmental 
pollution, Taiwan farmers have been pressuring the Government 
for assistance to maintain their market competitiveness. In 
addition, Mr Jia, who is also the chairman of the province's 
legislature, said Xiamen, which was opposite to Taiwan's Quemoy 
island would soon introduce new laws to guarantee the protection 
of Taiwanese investors' interest there. 
  Fujian's eagerness to lure Taiwan business was also evident 
from the fact the Government was ready to invest billions of 
yuan in energy projects including a US$4 billion (HK$30.88 
billion) nuclear plant in a small town called Shanqian. 
  Although the Kuomintang Government in Taiwan still 
officially 
maintained its "one China" policy, it has steadfastly resisted 
pressure from her business community to open direct 
communication and transport link with the mainland. This "white 
glove" policy by Taipei was a major obstacle to large Taiwan 
businesses investing in China.

<F P=106> [By reporter Qiu Jiangbo (6726 3068 3134)] </F>
  [Text] Fuzhou, 1 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Fuzhou Vice 
Mayor Sun Haishan disclosed here today that half of Fuzhou's 
state-owned industrial and communications enterprises have had 
injections of foreign capital. 
  It is learned that one of the four major forms of reforming 
the property rights system for state-owned enterprises in Fuzhou 
city is to graft foreign capital onto them. In 1993, a 
breakthrough was made in transferring enterprises. The Fuzhou 
Perfumery and the Fuzhou Printing and Dyeing Mill were 
completely transferred to foreign businessmen, and a large 
number of large and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Fuzhou 
Special Steels Plant, the No. 1 Plastics Plant, and the Fuzhou 
Silk Factory, formed joined ventures with foreign capital. In 
1993, 28 enterprises signed 31 joint venture or cooperation 
projects with foreign businessmen, with a contractual investment 
volume of over $82 million and the use of over $25 million in 
foreign capital. The number of state-owned enterprises in 
Fuzhou City that have had foreign capital grafted onto them now 
accounts for 52 percent of the total. 
  After the grafting, most state-owned enterprises have 
changed 
their operational mechanisms and have notably improved their 
economic returns. According to a briefing from official 
quarters, a large state-owned light industrial enterprise in 
Fuzhou suffered losses as soon as it went into production. It 
lost a total of 170 million yuan in 10 years. After having 
foreign capital grafted onto it, it made a profit of over 1 
million yuan in 1993. 
  Official quarters added: The transfer and grafting of 
state-owned enterprises have also brought many social problems, 
such as the placement and medical insurance of staff from former 
state-run factories. 
  Sun Haishan said: In the future, Fuzhou will go on promoting 
the grafting of state-owned enterprises to foreign capital to 
boost the reform of state-owned enterprises. What is slightly 
different from past practice is that the city will also select 
some state- owned enterprises which have good returns and a good 
market share to be grafted onto foreign capital. Moreover, 
standards for assessing foreign capital will also be raised. 
The focus of foreign capital to be introduced will be shifted 
to large companies in Europe, America, and Asia, and the grade 
of foreign capital utilized will also be raised.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 17 (XINHUA) -- Fuzhou, capital of 
east China's Fujian Province, has experienced a rapid expansion 
in export-oriented economy over the past years. 
  According to local officials, in the past year the city 
approved the establishment of 1,134 foreign-funded projects, 
with contracts involving a promised foreign investment of 3.3 
billion U.S. dollars. The two figures represent sharp increases 
compared with the corresponding figures of the previous year. 
  The officials said the total investment, as well as foreign 
investment of the approved projects last year both surpassed the 
related totals of the past 14 years. 
  The officials attributed the achievement to the fact that 
since last year the city has made active efforts in launching 
investment promotion activities at home and abroad, and has made 
painstaking efforts to improve its investment environment. 
  The emergence of foreign-funded enterprises in large numbers 
has greatly promoted the development of the export-oriented 
economy, said the officials. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises have developed into the main 
contributor of the city's economic growth. For instance, in 
1993 foreign-funded firms in the city completed 10.8 billion 
yuan-worth of industrial output value, accounting for 48 percent 
of the city's industrial output value created by enterprises at 
or above township level. 
  These foreign-funded enterprises last year exported goods 
amounting to 730 million U.S. dollars, making up 80 percent of 
the provincial capital's total exports. 
  Many of the foreign-funded enterprises have settled down in 
the city's economic and technological development zones, making 
these zones into areas of great vitality for economic 
development. 
  As more and more overseas investors have begun to try their 
luck in Fuzhou, many of the city's existing foreign-funded 
enterprises have also started to enlarge their investment 
scales. Last year 128 foreign-funded firms in the city 
increased their investment, and the increase totalled 300 
million U.S. dollars. 
  According to the officials, the city has 1,146 
foreign-funded 
enterprises in operation.

  [Text] Nanchang, April 19 (XINHUA) -- East China's Jiangxi 
Province is starting its second World Bank-funded red soil 
transformation project. 
  The six-year project will cost a total of 538.84 million 
yuan, including 40 million U.S. dollars in World Bank loans. 
  The program aims to transform 15,394 hectares of red-soil 
land, with 12,300 hectares of land to be opened up for planting 
fruit trees and creating grassland. 
  On the rest of the land, about 230,000 lean-meat pigs and 
1,000 dairy cows will be raised. 
  The program also includes reconstruction of a 100,000-ton 
fodder factory and a silk textile plant. 
  The program is strong on ecological development, with a 
focus 
on integration of farming, animal husbandry and fruit tree 
cultivation. 
  It will also rationally allocate resources to infrastructure 
construction and to setting up a social service network. 
  The program encourages farmers to go to the mountains to 
open 
up red soil land with contracted targets.

  [Text] The provincial people's government sponsored an 
enlarged plenum on the afternoon of 18 April to hear the report 
on the economic situation prevailing in the first quarter and to 
make work arrangements for the next period. 
  During the plenum, Governor Zhao Zhihao delivered a speech 
in 
which he contended: The general situation prevailing in the 
first quarter was good and main manifestations were that the 
measures for reform were issued in an associated way, these 
measures were enforced more smoothly, the economic operation was 
basically normal, a faster economic growth was maintained, some 
social contradictions were dissolved, social stability was 
maintained, and the work style of organs improved obviously. 
The province made a good start in various areas thanks to the 
positive efforts made by units at all levels and various 
departments and the province can still maintain a higher speed 
in economic development in the second quarter. However, the 
economic environment will tend to be strained. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: In conducting work in the second 
quarter, we should give priority to grasping reform and 
stability to promote the healthy development of the economy. By 
no means should we contend for speed, open enterprises, and new 
projects blindly. Efforts should be made to realistically orient 
the guiding ideology of economic work onto the track of 
readjusting structure, making technical progress, enhancing 
management, and increasing economic results. 
  In his speech Governor Zhao emphatically put forward demands 
in the following five aspects: 
  1. We should earnestly implement the spirit of the rural 
work 
conference sponsored by the central authorities; vigorously 
realize the stable increase in the output of grains, cotton, and 
oil-bearing seeds; enable the rural economy to achieve 
development in an overall way; and increase peasants' income on 
a large scale. 
  2. A good job should be done in directing enterprises, 
particularly large and medium-sized enterprises, and enterprises 
encountering difficulties to improve their production and 
operation and to conduct technical renovations. Efforts should 
be made to accelerate the merger, association, auction, rent, 
and reform in share-holding systems among the enterprises that 
are encountering particular difficulties. We should find a way 
out from conducting reform and enable them to get rid of their 
difficulties as soon as possible. 
  3. We should give priority to key projects and further 
deepen 
the reform in an overall way. Units at provincial, prefectural, 
and county levels should give priority to reform and push the 
reform forward in an overall way. State-owned, 
collectively-owned, and township enterprises should shift their 
business mechanism in an overall way. Problems cropping up in 
the reform in the financial and tax systems should be dealt with 
as quickly as possible. We should make great progress in 
establishing the systems of social security this year. In line 
with the practical situation, reform in the housing systems 
should be gradually carried out in stages and by group. We have 
no problems related to going too far and too fast in opening up, 
so should take faster steps and adopt more effective measures in 
this regard. 
  4. A good job should be done in enlivening the financial 
affairs and expanding the channels of raising funds to relieve 
the contradiction of fund shortage. 
  5. Various industries, trades, and departments should 
closely 
coordinate with one another to vigorously maintain social 
stability.

  [Text] The two-day provincial on-the-spot 
experience-exchange meeting on deepening reform and employing 
surplus workers ended at the Laiwu General Iron and Steel 
Complex on the afternoon of 5 April. Li Chunting, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor of 
the provincial government; and Chen Jianguo, standing committee 
member of the provincial party committee and vice governor of 
the provincial government, were present at the meeting. 
  Li Chunting stressed in his speech: According to the 
requirements for deepening enterprise reform and changing 
managerial mechanism, on the premise of ensuring social 
stability, and according to different actual conditions, all 
localities should adopt various forms and open various channels 
to explore ways for arranging enterprises' surplus staff members 
and workers, gradually set up an enterprise employment system 
suitable to the socialist market economic system, strive to 
change the enterprise managerial mechanism, upgrade labor 
productivity, and comprehensively increase enterprises' economic 
results. This is also the province's general guiding ideology 
of arranging jobs for enterprises' surplus staff members and 
workers. 
  Li Chunting pointed out: Reform, development, and stability 
are the overall work situation this year. The economic work 
should be submitted to and serve this situation. We should 
persistently grasp reform and development with one hand and 
stability with the other. This year, the state worked out a 
series of major reform measures with enterprise reform as its 
nucleus. Appropriately employing surplus personnel is an 
important content of the enterprise reform as well as a 
difficult and hot-debated issue. Realistically solving the 
problems in this regard is the internal requirement for 
deepening reform as well as an essential requirement for 
accelerating the pace of development. A calculation shows that 
so far, about 30 percent of the enterprises' staff members and 
workers are surplus personnel. The problems in some enterprises 
where production is totally or partially suspended are more 
prominent. This situation, if not changed, will seriously 
restrict and obstruct the deepening of enterprise reform and the 
setup of the modern enterprise system. Simultaneously, 
appropriately arranging jobs for surplus staff members and 
workers is a need for maintaining social stability. Therefore, 
we should enhance the sense of urgency and the sense of 
responsibility and be determined to achieve the work in this 
regard. 
  Li Chunting said: This year, the enterprise managerial 
mechanism is being changed noticeably at a faster speed. The 
failure to solve the problems relating to surplus staff members 
and workers will affect reform and the trial implementation of 
the modern enterprise system. Therefore, the enterprises 
carrying out the modern enterprise system on a trial basis and 
carrying out the shareholding system should simultaneously 
expand the dynamics of reforming labor, employment, and 
distribution systems and regard the employment of surplus staff 
members and workers as an essential task. Simultaneously, 
according to the actual conditions of enterprises, we should 
study and explore effective ways and methods for arranging jobs 
for surplus staff members and workers. According to advanced 
and reasonable "dual standards," the enterprises with better 
economic results should boldly and resolutely reduce the number 
of surplus staff members and workers, solve the problems that 
enterprises take on heavy burdens to develop social 
undertakings, divorce themselves from the organizations 
providing auxiliary service to enterprises, expand service 
functions, and enhance the capability of assimilating labor 
forces. The enterprises with general economic results should 
combine the arrangements of jobs for surplus workers with the 
enterprise structural readjustment and technological 
transformation, reasonably distribute labor resources, and 
vigorously develop the tertiary industry with less investment 
and faster economic results. The enterprises suffering 
long-term deficits are allowed to adopt such methods as 
providing labor services, exporting techniques, and encouraging 
staff members and workers to engage in individual management and 
self-employment to arrange jobs for the surplus staff members 
and workers. 
  Li Chunting stressed: The most realistic and basic way for 
arranging jobs for surplus staff members and workers is internal 
digestion. We should carry out the method dominated by the 
arrangements by enterprises and supplemented by social 
arrangements instead of the wait-and-rely-on method. In line 
with the reform of employment, labor, and distribution systems, 
we should rely on our own efforts to make development; develop 
new entities, tertiary industry, and a diversified economy; 
adopt various forms to encourage a portion of personnel to 
engage in self-employment; and try every possible means to 
distribute and arrange surplus personnel.

  [Text] Industrial, commercial, tax, and public security 
departments in Zhaoyuan city have adopted powerful and effective 
measures to deal strict blows to gold smuggling and other 
illegal activities in coordination with other fields, yielding 
remarkable results. Since the beginning of this year, these 
departments have cracked 48 cases on illegal production and 
sales of gold and have confiscated 885 grams of gold, 1,500 
grams of silver, 83 tonnes of gold ore, 67 tonnes of gold 
concentrate, and 395 gold ornaments molds. 
  Zhaoyuan city is well known throughout the country for 
abounding in gold. Over the past few years, along with the 
increasingly more gold mining activities, such unlawful 
activities as illegally producing, processing, and selling gold 
have become relatively serious. For this reason, industrial, 
commercial, tax, and public security departments in Zhaoyuan 
city have gone into concerted actions to deal severe blows to 
gold dealers. They have specially established a gold 
instruments inspection station and also set up six inspection 
posts in key gold townships and towns in order to investigate 
and deal with cases right after they are discovered. In 
addition, they have established a gold production rectification 
group in close coordination with other departments concerned and 
formulated the decision on protective gold mining. For the 
newly initiated enterprises, their quality has been put under 
strict control. Those false collectives and those enterprises 
which were unable to mine and dress gold ore in a connected 
sequence have all been banned. At the same time, specific 
regulations have been promulgated to punish illegal gold 
producers. Those who violated these regulations have had their 
illegal materials and money confiscated and have been punished 
by imposing fines. 
  From January to March this year, some 300 enterprises and 
individuals have been punished for illegally extracting finished 
gold. Now, the city's gold mining has embarked on the path of 
regularization, legalization, and standardization.

  [Text] Jinan, 2 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According to 
statistics from the department concerned, there was a serious 
imbalance between the two sexes of babies born in Zaozhuang City 
of Shandong Province. The ratio of boy babies to girl babies 
was 144.6 to 100; and the ratio in Tengzhou City, which is 
subordinate to Zaozhuang, was 163.8 to 100. 
  According to analysis, a major reason for the serious sex 
imbalance among babies was the use of the ultrasound B test. 
Many people use this technology to determine the sex of embryos 
so that they can keep boy babies and abort female embryos. 
  In view of this situation, the Zaozhuang City CPC Committee 
recently ordered that if Communist Party members receive or 
administer ultrasound tests, they will be expelled from the 
party. The same offense will cause state cadres and workers in 
state-owned institutions to be dismissed.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is speeding 
up the installation of a total quality control system in 
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. 
  This is part of the efforts to beef up the competitiveness 
of 
the city's industries in the market. 
  Some 5,000 managers, chief accountants and chief engineers 
from 2,000 state enterprises are attending training seminars by 
the Shanghai Quality Control Association (SQCA), and waiting for 
their enterprises to be officially attested. 
  The national "gb/t1900-iso9000 quality control and quality 
criteria" system was issued in 1992, in line with the standard 
series of iso9000 system promulgated by the international 
standardization organization in 1977. 
  "The qc system and its attestation is fundamental for 
shanghai's industries to be able to compete in the world market 
in a coherent framework with the developed economies in regard 
to producing quality products," said Xu Zhiyi, director of the 
Shanghai economic committee, a renowned qc expert in China. 
  Thirty state-owned enterprises are expected to be approved 
this year, he said, adding that another 400 key enterprises with 
annual sales up to 500 million yuan (56.82 million U.S. dollars) 
are preparing to be attested. 
  Some foreign-funded companies--among them Shanghai Foxboro 
Ltd, Shanghai AT and T, and Shanghai Belling Micro-Electronics 
Co.--have already passed the official attestation. And more 
companies of this kind are undergoing such attestation 
procedures. 
  Hundreds of enterprises and managers in Shanghai have been 
sent to the United States, Britain, Japan, Singapore and other 
countries to receive training in management expertise and the 
latest developments of world trade.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 18 (XINHUA) -- China foreign 
exchange trading center started formal operation here in 
Shanghai today. 
  The center is equipped with modern telecommunications 
network, linked with electronic computers, and will provide 
services in foreign exchange trading and final estimates for 
Chinese enterprises, Sino-foreign joint ventures and solely 
foreign-funded firms across China. 
  At today's ceremony to mark the start of the center, Zhu 
Xiaohua, deputy president of the Central People's Bank and 
director of the State Foreign Exchange Administration, said the 
formal operation of the center is of great importance for 
equalizing in time foreign exchange among different financial 
organizations across the country, speeding up the turnover of 
funds among banks and enterprises, and the circulation of 
foreign exchange in the whole country. 
  He believed that the center will also serve as an effective 
tool for effecting in China a single and well-managed foreign 
exchange market, based on demand and supply and with floating 
exchange rates, and for eventually making the Chinese renminbi 
yuan convertible on the world market. 
  According to Zhu, the center has got 170 Chinese and foreign 
financial organizations as members. 
  He stressed that China will also establish a strong 
macro-control mechanism under the central bank, further develop 
and improve financial market mechanisms, and make the foreign

  [Text] Hangzhou, March 30 (XINHUA) -- An international 
forum on China's Spark program, which aims at spreading modern 
science and technology in rural areas and improving the quality 
of Chinese peasants, will be held from April 4 to 8 in east 
Zhejiang Province where the program has been the most successful. 
  A spokesman for the Zhejiang provincial government said here 
today that the forum will be attended by agricultural officials 
and experts from 18 countries in Asia, Africa and South America 
as well as 120 representatives from 28 Chinese provinces. 
  The forum will be jointly sponsored by the United Nations 
Development Program, the Chinese State Science and Technology 
Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation. 
  China launched the Spark program in 1986. To date, nearly 
50,000 projects have been carried out, covering 85 percent of 
the rural counties. The projects have resulted in many new 
agricultural and industrial technologies in rural areas and 
contributed greatly to rural economic growth. 
  Zhejiang Province has been especially successful in 
implementing the Spark program. 
  From 1986 to 1993, the province launched 3,346 Spark program 
projects, yielding 22.4 billion yuan in output value. 
  Among the 3,346 rural enterprises which implemented Spark 
projects, more than 1,000 had their products exported, earning 
foreign currencies worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. 
  While 15 of these enterprises are producing an annual output 
value of more than 100 million yuan, most of the enterprises 
have improved their product quality, performances and efficiency. 
  Zhejiang has, through Spark projects, trained 650,000 farmer 
technicians. 
  Through the Spark projects, the province has also introduced 
new species of crops, animals, vegetables and fruit. 
  The Spark program is now developing toward high and new 
technology and export-oriented industries.

  [Text] Zhejiang's private economy has developed rapidly. 
When it comes to paying taxes, Zhejiang's individual and 
private businesses ranked first in the nation by delivering 2.23 
billion yuan in taxes to the state in 1993, up 39.5 percent from 
the previous year. Private economy has become Zhejiang's 
important economic growth sector. Not only Zhejiang saw a rapid 
increase in the number of individual and private businessmen 
last year, it also witnessed the constant improvement of the 
quality of those who are involved in the private economic 
sector. In 1993, there were 1,238,000 registered individual 
businessmen employing 1,972,000 people, representing an increase 
of 10 percent and 13 percent, respectively, over the previous 
year and making 1993 the year of fastest growth in term of the 
number of individual businessmen and the number of people they 
employed since the beginning of the 1990's. The number of 
private enterprises rose to 19,400 and the number of people they 
employed to 255,000, marking an increase of 68 percent and 67 
percent, respectively, over the previous year. And the trend in 
the composition of those engaged in the individual and private 
economy tended to become younger, more educated, and more 
professional. Many of the individual businessmen were former 
street vendors. They then turned to retail business, to running 
companies and factories, to large-scale production, and to 
production of upscale products. By the end of last year, 
individual businessmen's registered capital in the province 
stood at 8.67 bilion yuan. There are 641 private enterprises 
with a registered capital over 1 million yuan, 566 of them 
registered last year. The number of enterprises with an annual 
output value of over 1 million yuan and over 10 million yuan was 
877 and 77, respectively. The annual output value of an 
enterprise in Tiantai and another one in Linhai topped 100 
million yuan. 
  Now the business scope of individual and private economy has 
expanded to all sectors that are permitted under the state 
policy. Transcendng regions, trades, and ownership system, many 
individual and private enterprises are adopting diverse 
management, combined management, and intensive management 
through share acquisition, merger, contracting, and leasing. 
  At present, the province has five enterprise groups whose 
members are mainly from private enterprises. In 1993, 639 
individual and private enterprises exported 500 million yuan 
worth of goods, up two-fold over the previous year. Private 
enterprises attracted $110 million in foreign funds and formed 
170 joint-venture enterprises with foreign businessmen. Nine 
private enterprises in the province also set up plants in other 
provinces.

  [Text] Moscow, April 20 (XINHUA) -- Kyrgyz President Askar 
Akayev today expressed the hope that the forthcoming official 
visit by Chinese Premier Li Peng to the Central Asian country 
will promote ties between the two countries. 
  Akayev, who is on a visit to Moscow, told XINHUA in an 
interview that he viewed Li's visit as a historic event in 
Kyrgyzstan's relations with China. He expected it to boost 
bilateral cooperation in economy and trade and technological and 
cultural exchanges. 
  Premier Li Peng, who is on a visit to Turkmenistan after a 
three- day stay in Uzbekistan, is scheduled to visit Kyrgyzstan 
from April 22 to 25, on the third leg of his current five-nation 
Asia nation tour. 
  Li began his 12-day Asia trip on Monday and will travel to 
Kazakhstan and Mongolia after visiting Kyrgyzstan. 
  "China is the only socialist country that succeeds in 
economic reforms...and (Kyrgyzstan) can borrow the experience it 
has gained in carrying out reforms in stages, especially that in 
overhauling agriculture," the Kyrgyz president said in the 
50-minute interview. 
  Akayev, while praising China's peaceful foreign policy, said 
that remarkable economic achievements will lead China to a 
larger role in maintaining world peace. 
  The president also expressed satisfaction over the progress 
in Sino-Kyrgyz relations since his 1992 visit to Beijing, saying 
China is of increasing importance to Kyrgyzstan's foreign trade. 
  Taking the cooperation in earthquake forecast as an example, 
Akayev pointed out that technological cooperation between the 
two countries has also been improving over the past two years.

  [Text] Beijing, April 21 (AFP)--Three Russians and a 
Ukrainian have been given prison sentences ranging from five to 
16 years for armed robbery by a court in the northeastern 
Chinese city of Harbin, the Heilonjiang Legal daily said 
Thursday [21 April]. The four were accused of stealing 40,200 
yuan (4,620 dollars) from two Chinese on February 24 in a Harbin 
hotel after threatening them with a knife. 
  They were arrested several days later in the neighbouring 
province of Liaoning. One of the Russians managed to escape but 
was recaptured a short time later in the eastern city of 
Nanjing. The escapee was given 16 years in jail March 22, while 
his accomplices received terms ranging from five to 10 years, it 
said. The sentences were particularly heavy given the 
relatively small amount of money involved and the fact that 
neither victim was injured, observers said.
