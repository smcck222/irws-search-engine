<F P=106> ["Roundup:" "Historic Poll Peaceful, Logistical Problems </F>
Exist"] 
  [Text] Johannesburg, April 27 (XINHUA) -- The second day of 
South Africa's historic elections has been peaceful, but 
logistical problems delayed voting at various polling stations 
in the country. 
  Millions of voters flooded into the 9,000 polling stations 
today in the country's first all-race elections which marks the 
end of 350 years of white domination and the beginning of a new 
era. 
  Most of the 22.7 million South African voters are voting 
today and tomorrow to elect a 400-seat national assembly and 
provincial legislatures. 
  About 16 million voters, or 72 percent of the total, are 
blacks who are casting their bollats for the first time in their 
life to exercise their political rights. 
  At 07:15, 15 minutes after the opening of the polling 
stations, a car bomb exploded at Jan Smuts Airport in 
Johannesburg, injuring 18 people. Police were questioning a 
suspect who matched the description of a white man seen running 
away from a car shortly before the blast. 
  But in other parts of South Africa, no death related to 
political violence or terrorist acts has been reported. 
  About 10,000 policemen and 67 companies of the defense force 
have been depolyed at and around the polling stations. The 
heavy presence of security forces have deterred rightwingers 
from disrupting the elections. 
  Political leaders in South Africa joined South African 
voters 
in the polls today. 
  African National Congress (ANC) leader Nelson Mandela cast 
his vote at a polling station at Ohlange High School, north of 
Durban, at 07:05. He is the first to cast votes today at the 
polling station. 
  After casting his vote, Mandela said, "this is for all South 
Africans, an unforgettable occasion. It is the realization of 
hopes and dreams that we have carried over decades. 
  "The dream of a South Africa which represents all South 
Africans. 
  "It is the beginning of a new era. We have moved from an era 
of pessimism, division, limited opportunities, turmoil, and 
conflict," he said. 
  Mandela said: "We are starting a new era of hope, 
reconciliation and nation building." 
  President F.W. de Klerk cast his vote at the Arcadia Primary 
School in Pretoria. 
  After voting, De Klerk told reporters that the country is on 
the eve of a golden era. 
  De Klerk said that he is enthusiastic about the many people 
flooding to the polls. 
  "it's a great day for South Africa. We have worked for this 
for more than five years," he said. 
  He described the event as "a wonderful day to vote for the 
new South Africa." 
  Due to logistical problems, voting at some polling stations 
were delayed. Supplies of ballot papers ran out at a number of 
polling stations in Eastern Cape before lunch. Security force's 
helicopters were placed on standby to ferry voting materials to 
the stations in the Eastern Cape once they had arrived from the 
headquarters of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). 
  Voters in East Rand townships, eastern Johannesburg, were 
among the most frustrated as 10 of Thokoza's polling stations 
failed to open at all, while similar problems were experienced 
in other stations in the region. 
  Facing the problems, President De Klerk declared tomorrow a 
public holiday in favor of the voting. 
  The IEC also decided to extend the voting period today and 
tomorrow to enable all voters to cast their ballots. 
  According to the IEC decision, polling stations will stay 
open after the 19:00 (17:00 GMT) closing time today and tomorrow. 
  The IEC also decided to order the urgent printing of four 
million extra ballot papers for Eastern Cape, where several 
polling stations were shut down because of lack of ballot papers. 
  Meanwhile, the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) threatened to 
pull 
out of the elections, saying that IFP stickers have not been 
attached to the ballot papers fefore they were issued. 
  The IFP's name failed to appear on the ballot papers because 
its late entry into the election process, and an IFP sticker has 
to be attached to each of the ballot papers. 
  President De Klerk said the IFP should not make such threat 
at this stage and the problems are being solved. 
  Twenty-seven political parties are contesting the elections 
with eight of them only contesting at the regional level. 
  The elections are expected to produce a government of 
national unity led by the African National Congress and its 
President Nelson Mandela is likely to become the country's next 
president. 
  Yesterday was the special voting day for the disabled, the 
pregnant, the infirm and members of the defense force, police 
force and national peacekeeping force, and certain classes of 
prisoners. South African citizens living abroad also cast their 
votes yesterday. 
  The special voters who did not vote also voted today.

<F P=106> ["China's Politics and Economy" column by Hua Hsia (5478 </F>
1115): "Zhu Rongji Again Shows the True Qualities of a Czar"] 
  [Text] Faced with the grim economic situation, Vice 
Premier Zhu Rongji has once again shown the true qualities of an 
economic czar. From 12 to 17 April, Zhu Rongji inspected 
Heilongjiang Province, dismissed Governor Sun Weiben from office 
face-to-face, and ordered former Liaoning Governor Yue Qifeng to 
take over the post of Heilongjiang governor. 
  This move caused great shock in the CPC's internal circles, 
because since the founding of communist China there has never 
been a central leader who ordered the dismissal of a provincial 
governor face-to-face. Zhu Rongji's inspection tour of 
Heilongjiang and his face-to-face dismissal of a provincial 
governor is unprecedented in the history of the CPC. He was 
very high-handed. 
  During the inspection tour of Heilongjiang, Zhu Rongji took 
with him a dozen heads of ministries and commissions; the 
entourage, powerful and mighty, went directly to local places to 
inspect work and give instructions. The work style was highly 
efficient and very decisive. 
  There are two main reasons for such a show of force. First, 
the leadership in Beijing wants to assert its authority and pose 
in a way which shows that the central leadership can control the 
overall situation and manipulate it easily, so as to strike at 
the recent arrogance of local economic lords. When the National 
People's Congress was underway in March, Zhu Rongji severely 
criticized the often self-important Guangdong Province. Zhu 
Rongji accused the money-rich Guangdong of frequently going to 
various provinces to buy grain, to the extent of triggering a 
rapid increase in grain prices and disturbing the people's 
minds. Zhu Rongji said to the Guangdong delegation that if 
Guangdong has the money, it may buy grain from foreign 
countries, but it should not act recklessly on the mainland. His 
words created an unharmonious atmosphere. 
  Another reason is that Heilongjiang has many state 
enterprises, and therefore it is a very heavy burden; these 
enterprises keep asking for money from the central leadership, 
causing great trouble for Beijing. Consequently, Beijing 
decided to change the governor in the hope that the move can 
open a way for Heilongjiang.

<F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>
  [Text] While the Premier Li Peng, cavorts on the Central 
Asian steppes, his duties have been assumed by "acting Premier" 
Zhu Rongji. This is the first time Zhu has been given the title 
"acting Premier" (dai zongli) which -- according to 
China-watchers -- may signal an important shift in the politics 
at Zhongnanhai (party headquarters). 
  Zhu's new title was quietly announced at a meeting with the 
Australian Governor-General, Bill Hayden, last week, causing a 
storm of speculation in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Observers said it 
could signal that Zhu will continue to handle many of the 
Premier's functions after Li returns from the Far West tomorrow. 
  Last year, when Li was put out of action by a heart attack, 
Zhu took over chairing national work meetings and greeting 
foreign dignitaries, but his status was referred to as 
"entrusted by the Premier" (shou zongli weituo). Since then, 
Zhu and the other vice-premiers have used this title when 
standing in for Li. 
  China-watchers are divided on whether Zhu's star has been 
rising or falling recently, but most agree that being given the 
nod as acting Premier shows an improvement in his status. The 
same title was often used by a former vice-premier, Yao Yilin, 
before his retirement last year. A revolutionary war hero and 
contemporary of the party patriarch, Deng Xiaoping, Yao -- who 
was at that time also a member of the politburo standing 
committee -- had far higher seniority in the party hierarchy and 
considerably greater influence in the corridors of power than Li. 
  Alone among the current vice-premiers, Zhu also claims the 
distinction of membership in the politburo standing committee, 
the supreme decision-making body of the Communist Party. 
  But with only three years experience as a vice-premier and 
no 
previous ministerial posts before he took over the reins at the 
People's Bank of China last July, Zhu remains a relative 
outsider in Zhongnanhai. 
  In addition, he carries a stigma within the party for having 
been labeled a "rightist" during the 1957 Hundred Flowers 
campaign -- for which he was expelled from the party and served 
five years in a reform through-labour camp. Among those betting 
on Zhu's rise, the acting Premier designation reflects moves to 
set the stage for the next premier in the light of Deng's 
deteriorating health. 
  "The Chinese denied last year that Zhu was the first among 
equals," Maurice Brosseau of the Chinese University of Hong Kong 
said. "But in the last few months, things have been changing 
fast in preparation for something, maybe the death of Deng 
Xiaoping." 
  In Brosseau's view, the acting Premier title shows that Zhu 
is clearly tipped as the successor to Li, who is approaching the 
end of his stint at the top of the civil government hierarchy. 
"Nobody can deny Zhu the right to take the leadership now," he 
said. 
  Zhu's successful handling of the financial crisis last 
summer 
and tax reform earlier this year was the testing ground on which 
he proved himself worthy to be Premier, Brosseau believes. "He 
solved most of the problems which emerged in the country since 
1989, which is more than Li Peng could do," he said. 
  Zhu showed he was willing to take the rap for unpopular 
policies when his crude efficiency in the crackdown on excessive 
investment and tax issues stirred resentment. This was 
appreciated by some conservative senior party members, including 
Li's own protector and mentor, Chen Yun. 
  "It shows he has emerged from the eclipse. Calling him 
acting Premier shows he is back in the running," Peter Zheung, 
of Hong Kong University, said.

<F P=106> ["Preface to Shanghai of Contemporary China by </F>
Zhu Rongji -- written on 25 March 1991"] 
  [Text] Shanghai of Contemporary China has been 
published. This is a collective work specifically aimed at 
reflecting the historical development of Shanghai since the 
founding of New china. 
  Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "We should not only be good at 
destroying the old world but also at building a new world." The 
development of history has transformed, or is transforming, this 
maxim into fact. Since Shanghai was liberated in May 1949, 
under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council and with the vigorous support of various fraternal 
provinces and cities, we have, after more than 40 years of hard 
work, overcome difficulties and perils on our way forward and 
transformed the former semicolonial, semifeudal "paradise of 
adventurers" into a socialist new Shanghai full of vigor and 
vitality. 
  In the course of building Shanghai into a new socialist 
city, 
what is most worthy of mention is the ten years since the 
introduction of reform and opening to the outside world. During 
these ten years, Shanghai, like the rest of the country, 
experienced one of the best periods for its economic and social 
development since the founding of the Chinese People's Republic 
of China. These are the main features of the period: Reform of 
the economic structure was carried out in an all-around way, 
giving rise to a pattern in which all sectors of the economy 
exist side by side on the premise of upholding socialist public 
ownership as the mainstay; great strides were made in opening to 
the outside world, and Shanghai's economy is marching into the 
world arena in the forms of utilizing foreign capital, importing 
technologies, running economic and technological development 
zones, exporting labor, and contracting projects overseas; 
significant progress was made in production and construction, 
and Shanghai's economic strength increased considerably with the 
completion of a number of key projects such as the Baoshan Iron 
and Steel Complex's first- and second-phase projects, Jinshan 
Petrochemical General Plant's second- and third-phased projects, 
Santana Sedan Factory's first-phased project, new railway 
passenger station, Yuejiang tunnel in Yanan East Road, 
[Yaohua-Pierjinton] Glass Plant, color picture tube plant, and 
cold-rolled sheet plant; in addition, projects under 
construction include a subway system, waste water treatment 
plant, the Nanpu bridge, the expansion of the Hongqiao airport, 
and installation of program-controlled telephones. These 
infrastructure facilities strengthened Shanghai's capacity to 
develop its economy and improve its appearance. A change took 
place in its industrial setup, and new progress was made in 
advancing technology. The ratio of the service industry rose 
from 21 percent in 1980 to around 30 percent. By transforming 
secondary industry, the ratio of technology-intensive 
enterprises rose to about 20 percent. Space, aviation, and 
sedan-manufacturing industries and other new generation of 
pillar industries are developing. The comprehensive functions 
of a city are beginning to show themselves. Even though the 
pattern of national income distribution has changed 
considerably, Shanghai still retained its lead in per capita 
income, in the realization of output value for every 100 yuan of 
fixed assets, and in delivering profits and taxes to the state. 
In terms of financial and foreign exchange matters, and in 
allocation of commodities, Shanghai has continued to make 
greater contributions to the state than other areas. At the 
same time, the people of Shanghai have significantly improved 
their material life, and they have made progress in education 
and culture and in building a spiritual civilization. These 
tremendous achievements have strengthened Shanghai's peoples' 
confidence in carrying forward the socialist modernization drive 
and enhanced their determination to overcome difficulties. 
  Now, history has entered the last ten years of this century. 
Shanghai is now at a new starting line. In the middle and later 
parts of the 1980's, the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council approved the "Outline of the Report on the Strategy for 
Developing Shanghai's Economy," the "General Urban Development 
Plan for Shanghai," and the "Report on Deepening Reform, Opening 
Wider to the Outside World, and Speeding up the Transformation 
of Shanghai's Economy into an Export-Oriented Economy." In 
April 1990, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made 
the decision to develop Pudong and open it to the outside world, 
thus mapping out the direction for Shanghai's future 
development. 
  In accordance with the guidelines of the 
Seventh Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee and 
the documents mentioned above, the 11th Plenary Session of the 
Fifth Shanghai CPC Committee, held in early January 1991, set 
the strategic guidelines and goals for Shanghai's economic and 
social development in the 1990's. They are as follows: 
Invigorating Shanghai, developing Pudong, serving the whole 
country, focusing on the world market; during the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan and the Ninth Five-Year Plan periods, efforts 
will be made to build Shanghai into an open, multifunctional, 
and socialist modern city with a rationalized industrial setup, 
advanced science and technology, and a high degree of spiritual 
civilization. When the proletarian revolutionaries of the older 
generation spent their Spring Festival of 1991 in Shanghai, they 
strongly affirmed these guidelines and goals. They encouraged 
Shanghai to do its work boldly, speedily, and successfully. 
  To realize this glorious, great, yet arduous mission, we 
must 
earnestly implement the principles, tasks, and policies set by 
the Seventh Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee; 
undertake major reforms that directly affect the national 
economy, the people's lives, and economic development; focus on 
developing Shanghai's economy; and do our best to invigorate 
large- and medium state-owned enterprises. We must concentrate 
on building infrastructural facilities, especially the 
construction of housing to benefit the people, to satisfy them, 
and to inspire them. We should continue to deepen education on 
socialism, uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois 
liberalization, improve party work style, build a clean 
government, rectify irregularities in various professions, and 
strive to do a good job in building a socialist spiritual 
civilization. We will train and bring up a contingent of cadres 
who have a firm political stand, adhere to Marxism and 
materialist dialectics, know their professions well, have a good 
work style, and advance and assume responsibilities boldly to 
lead the people of Shanghai to work hard in creating a better 
situation for Shanghai's construction and reform. 
  In conclusion, I want to thank the comrades who worked 
arduously in editing and publishing this book.

<F P=106> [by Li Zhurun and Zhou Genliang] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- China is formulating 
a set of methods for more effective implementation of the 
"Copyright Law," a senior legislator told XINHUA today. 
  According to Cai Cheng, vice-chairman of the Law Committee 
of 
the National People's Congress, also being prepared are rules 
and regulations that aim at stepping up protection of foreign 
economic and technical trade-related intellectual property 
rights. 
  He said that these will allow customs a still bigger role in 
preventing goods produced by infringing upon intellectual 
property rights of others from being shipped out of China. 
  For now, the attention is focused on the "Copyright Law". 
Cai added that law enforcement bodies will investigate "major 
and important" cases in cooperation with departments of science, 
technology, culture, public security, industry and commerce. 
  The legislator cited a recent circular calling for a 
crackdown on counterfeit compact and laser discs. 
  The circular was issued by the Communist Party Central 
Committee Propaganda Department and six government organs 
including the State Planning Commission and the State Press and 
Publications Administration. In response, Guangdong inspectors 
shut down 400 CD stalls and 50,000 discs were confiscated along 
with 3,000 video tapes. 
  The cities of Guangzhou, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong 
Province are setting up courts to try cases of intellectual 
property rights violation, in the wake of the establishment of a 
provincial court of the same type. 
  In addition to the Guangdong Provincial Court, intellectual 
property rights courts are now operational in Beijing, Shanghai 
and Shenzhen, the booming special economic zone adjacent to Hong 
Kong. 
  The central government, for its part, will improve its 
supervision of law enforcement by local authorities. "Problems 
such as ineffective implementation of laws and too-lenient 
treatment of law-breakers must be resolved," he said. 
  While the government strives to do its best, Cai said, the 
non-governmental sector is encouraged to help. 
  Cai was referring to lawyers and auditors as well as 
professional societies and associations in science, technology 
and culture. "When organized, these can provide services, 
including legal consultancy and investigation into complaints," 
he said. 
  Cai cited the Intel-Protect Services (China) Ltd., a 
mainland-Hong Kong joint venture established last July, which is 
China's first and until now only non-governmental agency 
specializing in protection of intellectual property. 
  One of the company's clients was Hazeline, a British soap 
producer, which late last year demanded investigation into 
alleged abuse of its trademark. 
  Last month, IPS inspectors discovered the bootleg producer, 
a 
factory in Xiashan Town of Chaoyang City in Guangdong. Upon 
receiving the IPS report, local police shut down the factory. 
  According to official statistics, an average of 13,000 cases 
of trademark abuse and counterfeited goods are reported every 
year, including 500 that directly affect foreign companies. 
  Cai attributed this to the fact that intellectual property 
protection is still new in China. "But the country is sincere 
and serious in its effort to improve and will always be," Cai 
said. 
  He noted that laws and government decrees published so far 
cover "almost every aspect of intellectual property." 
  The country is now a member of the World Intellectual 
Property Rights Organization and has acceded to, among others, 
the Paris Convention on Industrial Property Rights Protection, 
the Madrid Convention on International Registration of 
Trademarks and the Berne Convention for the Protection of 
Literary and Artistic Works. 
  Cai's view is shared by Maria Wai-chu Tam, a Hong Kong 
barrister-at-law, who is concerned with the mainland's 
intellectual property protection work. "I'm optimistic," she 
said. 
  "In just a few years China has made laws to go by and that's 
no easy task," she said. "The question is how to ensure their 
full implementation." 
  China is also increasing its international contacts on 
intellectual property, cai said, citing an international 
symposium in May, at which Chinese officials and experts will 
consult their foreign counterparts on how to improve. 
  The symposium will be featured by reports on the current 
situation and planned improvements in the protection of 
trademarks, copyrights and patents as well as judicial work, Cai 
said.

freedom of his "comrades-in-arms" who were still in jail. In an 
interview with the South China Morning Post, Mr Wang made it 
clear that he would continue to speak his mind although he had 
been warned by Beijing not to engage in "activities against the 
interest of the motherland" before he left Beijing. 
  Mr Wang was freed and arrived in New York on Saturday for 
treatment for hepatitis after serving five years of a 13-year 
jail term for organising the 1989 pro-democracy movement -- an 
accusation denied by Mr Wang. 
  According to Mr Wang, labour reform officials warned him 
that 
they would be watching his activities abroad. "But I asked them 
what is the interest of the motherland? The interest of a few 
individuals doesn't equal to the interest of the motherland... 
The interest of the motherland is the interest of the majority 
of Chinese people," he said. "They said I have not been 
reformed well. But I told them it was not I who needed to be 
reformed, it was they who should be," the defiant activist said. 
  Mr Wang declined to give a direct answer on the 
controversial 
debate over China's most favoured nation (MFN) trading status. 
But he stressed he would make public his position when he was 
ready. "It is their (the U.S. Government) business to deal with 
MFN. But I can't make up my mind before I find out what is the 
wish of the majority of Chinese people on this issue," he said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide before June 3 
whether 
to extend China's MFN status this year although it is widely 
believed that the President will do so after Mr Wang's release. 
  Mr Wang said he agreed to leave China because he feared that 
if he turned down the offer, it would jeopardise the chance of 
other dissidents who might want to leave. 
  Having served less than half of his 13-year sentence, Mr 
Wang 
is one of three dissidents allowed to leave for medical 
treatment in the US. The other two are physicist Fang Lizhi and 
labour activist Han Dongfang. Before his release on Saturday, 
Mr Wang was told by his captors that he was being freed because 
"the U.S. Government has requested it and it was agreed by the 
Chinese Government." It was understood that the U.S. Government 
had also put forward the names of at least four other jailed 
dissidents: Chen Ziming, Ren Wanding, Liu Gang, and Bao Tong -- 
generally believed to be in poor health and either in prison 
clinics or hospitals. 
  Mr Wang also expressed concern about dissident journalist 
Gao 
Yu who was arrested in October for allegedly leaking state 
secrets to foreign publications. A verdict on her was expected 
this week. 
  Although Mr Wang said he was aware that China had banned Mr 
Han from returning to the country, he believed there was no 
reason for Beijing to refuse him. "I have done nothing against 
the law in China. And I will not do so even now I am out of the 
country. There is no reason why they should not allow me to 
return to my country," he said. "To do so would be a violation 
of international convention," he added. 
  On his time in jail, the 35-year-old activist said 
conditions 
were so poor that he had to initiate 21 hunger strikes in five 
years to protest against his ill treatment.

  [Text] Wang Dan, one of the most prominent leaders of the 
1989 student movement, will not be in Beijing for the fifth 
anniversary of the June 4 massacre. 
  Mr. Wang, 25, said yesterday he had decided to leave the 
capital towards the end of May and return a few days after the 
anniversary. "The political situation here is very sensitive at 
the moment so it really would be inconvenient for me to be here 
on June 4," he said. 
  Analysts said the absence of Mr. Wang, the only significant 
leader of the student movement still in Beijing would make it 
difficult for any meaningful commemorative protest to take place 
on June 4. "Any commemorative activity would require a 
figurehead and Wang Dan is just about the only person who fits 
the bill," a Western diplomat said. "Everyone else is either in 
detention or abroad." 
  Mr. Wang had earlier said he felt a moral responsibility to 
be in Beijing during the anniversary but admitted yesterday to 
having a change of heart. "I've come to the conclusion that 
things will only get worse if I stay," he said. Mr. Wang said 
he would probably be travelling on his own and at his own 
expense although he had not yet decided where to go. 
  He has been under intense pressure from the security forces 
to curtail his political activities and stay away from foreign 
journalists. Friends of the democracy activist said the 
pressure was affecting him and it was not surprising that he had 
decided to lay low for a while.

  [Text] China is secretly maneuvring to polish its human 
rights image after the authorities suddenly postponed the trials 
of 14 dissidents held on counter-revolution charges for nearly 
two years. The decision was made in the runup to June when the 
United States decides if the most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade 
status will be granted. 
  Family sources said yesterday that Chinese authorities had 
suddenly postponed, to an unspecified date, the trials of at 
least 14 dissidents originally scheduled for this week, 
following the weekend release of imprisoned dissident Wang 
Juntao. 
  The brother of one defendant said: "The trial for the entire 
group has been postponed indefinitely -- lawyers for each of the 
defendants informed us by phone on Saturday." 
  The wife of another family member said: "I have no idea why 
they have decided to postpone it. There is a good chance it has 
something to do with MFN status." 
  A Beijing Intermediate Court spokesman said the case of the 
14, the largest batch of political dissidents to be tried in 
China since prosecutions following the 1989 Tiananmen Square 
protests, was still in the pre-trial stage. She said by phone 
it was difficult to say when the formal court session would be 
held. 
  Meanwhile, the Chinese trade minister said in Hong Kong she 
was confident of China getting the renewal after her lobbying 
mission to the U.S. last week. 
  Wu Yi, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, 
said U.S. entrepreneurs and congressmen favoured an 
unconditional U.S. renewal of MFN to China. "I have met a large 
bunch of big entrepreneurs this time and all of them unanimously 
think that MFN should be granted to China unconditionally," she 
said, adding that the same attitude prevailed among some 30 
senators she visited during her stay. 
  The dissidents were charged for alleged involvement in 
underground pro-democracy and labour groups, among them the Free 
Labour Union of China and the Liberal Democratic Party of China. 
Two, Gao Yuxiang and Li Quanli, have been excused from 
prosecution, at least temporarily, because of illness, the 
relatives said. In Washington, the visiting Chief Secretary 
Anson Chan continued to lobby key congressmen for unconditional 
renewal of MFN. 
  A leading proponent of linking MFN and human rights 
congressman Nancy Pelosi brought forward a meeting with Mrs. 
Chan. 
  The two met last night (HK time) following an interview with 
Mrs. Chan on the national CNN television network. 
  Mrs. Chan also kept a number of appointments with key MFN 
players including House speaker Tom Foley, Democratic leader in 
the Senate George Mitchell, and Assistant Secretary of State for 
East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord. 
  Also in Washington, a White House press secretary said the 
release of Mr. Wang was "a positive step" toward meeting U.S. 
conditions for renewed MFN to China.

  [Text] By sending Wang Juntao into perhaps permanent 
exile, Beijing has deprived itself of an opportunity to build 
bridges to the dissident community and other disaffected sectors 
of society. 
  Permission given the veteran activist to leave jail and seek 
medical treatment in the United States confirms a policy the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) adopted more than a year ago: To 
get rid of "troublemakers" by exiling them. 
  The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has 
already 
cited the "release" of Wang as a sign of improvement in 
Beijing's human rights record. "Emigration" is one of criteria 
set forth in Mr. Clinton's executive order, the fulfilment of 
which is necessary for the renewal of China's Most Favoured 
Nation (MFN) status in early June. In spite of Beijing's 
refusal to allow Han Dongfang and other exiled dissidents to 
return to China, Washington -- and Western governments in 
general -- have yet to decry this as a violation of the civil 
rights of Chinese citizens. 
  "Almost all dissidents who have left China have seen their 
effectiveness as the custodians of the national conscience 
suffer," said political scientist Yan Jiaqi, who fled the 
country immediately after Tiananmen Square. Professor Yan, who 
recently moved to New York from Paris, added: "They are cut off 
from their soil. Moreover, even big names among exiles have to 
solve their livelihood problems. This detracts from their 
ability to pursue the (pro- democracy) crusade on a full-time 
basis." 
  In spite of Wang's credentials as one of China's most 
respected and combat-hardened intellectuals, analysts are 
pessimistic that he could unify the badly fractured overseas 
dissident movement. Two other figures of comparable stature who 
have settled in the U.S. -- astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and 
Shanghai-based writer Wang Ruowang -- have disappointed their 
followers by failing to provide strong leadership. 
  In the past two years, the flagship of the overseas 
dissident 
movement, the Paris-based Federation for a Democratic China, has 
splintered into six outfits most of whose leaders do not talk to 
each other. 
  Friends of Wang Juntao said they would advise him not to 
join 
any of the six so as not to get bogged down with ugly 
in-fighting. And while Wang had to contend with the Herculean 
task of pursuing the pro-democracy crusade on alien soil, 
negotiating with Beijing over the terms of his return could be 
as daunting. 
  The CCP administration has in the past year forced a number 
of "second-line" exiles to submit to humiliating conditions for 
their homecoming. These include pledges that upon returning to 
China, they abstain from "anti-government activities" and stay 
away from "underground political organisations." 
  Beijing has, however, been adamant against letting prominent 
dissidents including Professors Yan and Fang, Han, and 
journalist Liu Binyan to go home on any terms. In most 
instances, the Chinese embassy in Washington and the consulates 
have simply refused to renew their Chinese passports. 
  A West Coast-based dissident journalist indicated last week 
that Beijing was using the threat of permanent exile to "cow him 
into subservience". "Senior cadres visiting the U.S. have told 
me I have no hope of returning unless I stop writing 
`anti-Chinese' articles in Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers," the 
journalist said. "Last month, when a friend of mine renewed his 
passport at the local consulate, he was asked by the consular 
official to relay the same message to me." 
  Both as a means of clinching MFN and to rid the 
administration of challengers, Beijing is expected to give more 
dissidents one-way tickets to the West. Yet if the CCP had the 
interests of the country at heart -- or even if it is merely 
committed to the much narrower goal of maintaining stability, as 
numerous party leaders have reiterated since January -- it 
should keep a more open mind. 
  Setting free Wang -- with his unique background and 
experience -- and allowing him to stay in China could actually 
help Beijing defuse tension in the dissident community and 
society in general. In spite of Wang's reputation as the "black 
hand" of the 1989 movement and his being characterised by 
Premier Li Peng as a "tiger which should never be allowed to 
return to the hills," the economist and editor is a moderate 
within the pro-democracy movement. 
  "Since his activism began in the late 1970s, Wang has always 
believed in evolutionary changes inside the system," a source 
said. 
  During the Democracy Wall period, Wang worked with the 
liberal wing of the CCP, then led by the late party chief Hu 
Yaobang, to bring about progress from within. "Wang and Hu 
struck up a friendship which lasted into the early 1980s," the 
source said. 
  In the three or so years before the June 4, 1989 crackdown, 
Wang -- together with fellow "black hand" Chen Ziming, who was 
also given 13 years in jail in 1991 -- was involved with a 
quasi-private institute for economic and social research as well 
as the now- defunct Economics Weekly, a paper that urged market 
reforms. 
  "Wang has never advocated revolution," another friend said. 
"Right through early June 1989, he tried hard to prevent 
radicals among the students and intellectuals in the Square from 
directly confronting the regime." 
  Until the eve of the massacre, Wang maintained ties with 
liberal cadres and the children of party elders. Analysts said 
if the hardline faction of the CCP could put aside its 
prejudices, Wang together with Chen, another candidate for 
"medical bail" -- would be an ideal mediator between Beijing and 
the dissidents. Instead, the CCP has refused to consider 
options other than using the weapons of the "dictatorship of the 
proletariat" to impose control. 
  It is true that Beijing might, through a spate of detentions 
since the spring, be able to stifle the voice of opposition in 
the run-up to the fifth anniversary of June 4. 
  However, the underlying causes of revolt -- hyperinflation, 
unemployment, corruption and the party's total refusal to share 
power are more acute now than in early 1989. 
  Without the moderating influence of "evolutionists" like 
Wang 
and Chen, the next outbreak of the democracy movement could be 
more extreme -- and violent -- than ever. Packing the likes of 
Wang into exile merely ensures that when the conflagration 
erupts, there could be no dialogue between the administration 
and its critics.

<F P=106> [Report: "At the Provincial Meeting on Media and </F>
Ideological Work, Li Zemin Stressed the Need To Do a Good Job in 
Media and Ideological Work by Proceeding From the Overall 
Situation of Building Socialism With Chinese Characteristics"] 
  [Text] On the morning of 8 March, the provincial party 
committee held a provincial meeting on media and ideological 
work in Hangzhou. Li Zemin, provincial party committee 
secretary, attended and spoke at the meeting. He emphatically 
pointed out: Comrades of party committees and government 
departments at various levels and the media and ideological 
front must understand the extremely important nature of media 
and ideological work in carrying out the strategy of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics and implementing the 
party's basic line in an all-round way. Under the new situation 
of building a socialist market economic structure, we must take 
a clear-cut stand on the task, content, and battle front of 
media and ideological work, on what should be publicized and 
advocated and what should not be allowed, and on what should be 
resisted and opposed and what should be encouraged. We must pay 
special attention to guiding theoretical study, public opinion, 
social customs, and the creation of nourishment of the mind. We 
should effectively strengthen and improve ideological and 
political work at the grass-roots level. 
  The meeting was presided over by Lu Zhangong, provincial 
party committee deputy secretary . Liu Xirong, Li Jinming, and 
Liang Pingbo, Standing Committee members of the provincial party 
committee, attended the meeting. 
  Li Zemin fully affirmed the work and achievements made by 
workers on the media and ideological front in the province. He 
said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central 
Committee, reform, opening up, and economic and social 
development in this province have developed, the people have 
emancipated and changed their minds through explorations and 
creations, the broad masses of media and ideological workers 
have worked hard and played a great role in improving and 
strengthening media and ideological work with great vitality. 
The media and ideological work have vigorously promoted the 
people's ideological emancipation and change of concept, created 
a favorable public opinion for speeding up reform and opening 
up, and promoted economic development. The media and 
ideological work have united the party and the people's hearts; 
have protected social stability; have promoted healthy social 
customs; and have provided a powerful spiritual motive force and 
ideological guarantee as well as powerful intellectual support 
and favorable public opinion in the society and a good 
environment for carrying out reform and opening up. 
  Li Zemin said: At present, there is an unprecedented good 
trend in reform, opening up, and economic construction in 
Zhejiang like other places of the country. However, in the 
course of making progress, we have also met with some new 
situations and contradictions. To maintain this good trend in 
carrying out reform and development and to overcome difficulties 
and contradictions on our advancing road, we must implement the 
policy put forward by the party Central Committee for "seizing 
the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting 
development, and maintaining stability," and correctly handle 
the relations between reform, development, and stability. Media 
and ideological work should be carried out in light of the 
overall situation. Li Zemin called on media and ideological 
workers to proceed with their work by keeping their minds on the 
overall situation of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, and to consider the following points as their 
guiding principles: 1) Taking economic construction as the 
central task; 2) persisting in being responsible to the people 
as well as the party; 3) adhering to and vigorously advocating 
the main theme while allowing diversification; and 4) keeping to 
democratic principle and the policy of explaining things to the 
masses. 
  Li Zemin also put forward four correct ways and one basic 
task for implementing the guidelines of the national work on 
media and ideological work, further implementing the "Zhejiang 
provincial program for building socialist spiritual 
civilization," and doing a good job in media and ideological 
work in Zhejiang in the future. 
  Earnestly organize the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and 
conscientiously provide a correct theoretical guidance. Party 
committees at all levels should take theoretical study 
seriously, make the study of Volume 3 of the Selected 
Works of Deng Xiaoping the central element, and combine it 
with the study of the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee and policies, laws, and 
regulations related to socialist market economy. We must link 
the study of theory with practice and our efforts to implement 
this year's general task and to study, investigate, and grasp 
new situations and resolve new problems. We must continue to 
make use of the party committee's core study group system to 
improve the quality and results of the study. We must earnestly 
carry out the theoretical education and training of party 
members and cadres. Comrades in the propaganda and ideological 
departments should take the lead in studying theory deeper and 
better. They should do a good job in theoretical study and 
propaganda. Under the current circumstances, every front must 
serve and subordinate itself to the party's general task. 
Particularly, it should earnestly study and comprehensively 
understand Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important thinking on reform, 
development, and stability and use it to guide work in every 
field. 
  -- Create a favorable public opinion for deepening reform, 
promoting development, and maintaining stability, and earnestly 
guide public opinion. Party committees, propaganda departments, 
news media, and publishing units must guide public opinion well 
with a strong sense of responsibility and work hard to create a 
public opinion conducive to reform, opening up, and economic 
development; to the building of socialist spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and a legal system; and to promoting 
national unity, easing people's minds, and promoting social and 
political stability. Foremost, we must clearly recognize the 
situation; understand the overall task; grasp well relations 
between reform, development, and stability and between the 
partial and general interests; and do our best to truthfully 
reflect problems. Second, we must keep ourselves in touch with 
reform, opening up, and economic construction and with the 
masses and real life. Third, we must use a variety of 
propaganda forms and typical examples to guide the masses, avoid 
the tone of teaching, and carry out our work in a way loved by 
the masses. Fourth, we must help supervise public opinion, 
avoid confusing it, focus on resolving practical issues, and 
settle and resolve conflicts. Fifth, we must strictly observe 
propaganda discipline and differentiate between internal and 
external consumption [nei wai you bie 0355 1120 2589 0446]. 
  In light of this year's situation and task, we must 
emphasize 
the following in guiding public opinion: First, we must change 
the ideology guiding economic work. We must shift from the 
previous practice of doing things blindly on a large scale and 
of expanding our businesses and managing them loosely to one of 
optimizing structures, improving qualities, raising efficiency, 
and developing externally. Second, we must stabilize and 
strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the 
economy. The entire party and society must attach importance to 
agriculture and protect and support its development. We must 
maintain stability in the total output of grain and balance 
between regions. We must gradually establish a macroeconomic 
regulation and control mechanism to strengthen, protect, and 
support agriculture. We must work hard to overcome the relative 
low economic returns from growing grain and guide the peasants 
onto the path of intensive management in agriculture to benefit 
from the economies of scale. Third, we must vigorously promote 
reform in five major areas. We must guide the masses to 
correctly understand reform and ardently support and actively 
take part in it. We must guide enterprises to adapt themselves 
to changing external environments; to explore and experiment 
boldly; to become independent socialist commodity producers and 
dealers, responsible for their own profits or losses and for 
their own decisions about whether to expand or not; and to enter 
the market. Fourth, we must attach importance to strengthening 
correct guidance on flash-point social issues, do more work to 
promote stability, and truthfully report what we have done and 
accomplished to win the masses' understanding and support. 
  Actively advocate good social ethics and earnestly guide it 
to achieve the goal of bringing up a new generation of socialist 
people with ideals, morality, knowledge, and discipline. To 
achieve the goal of bringing up such a new generation, we must 
make patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and Comrade Jiang 
Zemin's 64-character pioneering spirit the central elements of 
education and set different demands on different people at 
different levels. We must pay close attention to guiding 
people, especially juveniles, to cultivate correct idealism, 
faith, and outlook on world, life, and value; to oppose money 
worshiping, pleasure-seeking, and ultra-individualism; and to 
resist the corrosive effects of decadent capitalist and 
feudalist ideas. Society, school, and family must closely 
coordinate with each other, earnestly summarize their 
experience, promptly popularize effective educational forms and 
methods to earnestly carry out this work. We must promote 
traditional Chinese ethics such as making selfless dedication, 
acting heroically to promote justice, supporting the poor and 
people in need, and taking pleasure in helping others. We must 
promote truth, goodness, and beauty and denounce falseness, 
ugliness, and evil. We must concentrate our efforts on changing 
prevailing habits and customs in the countryside and advocate 
healthy and rewarding lifestyle. We must adopt multiple 
measures to curb the spread of such evil practices as holding 
wedding ceremonies and funerals in a big way, engaging in feudal 
superstition, and gambling. We must guarantee religious 
freedom, advocate atheism, strengthen the management of 
religions, and actively guide religions to adapt themselves to 
socialism. We must extensively launch cultural activities among 
the masses and promote the development of cultural activities in 
communities. We must make cultural activities in enterprises 
our focus and advance cultural activities in villages and towns, 
campuses, and homes to mold people's temperament. We must 
integrate cultural development in communities with education in 
professional and social ethics and with the building of 
civilized units. We must bring about the improvement of our 
social ethics through measures implemented in various regions 
and trades and professions. 
  -- Work hard to create more and better spiritual products to 
satisfy people's cultural needs, and earnestly guide their 
creation. We must uphold the policy of grasping two links at the 
same time, attaching equal importance to both. We must promote 
the creation of outstanding and healthy spiritual products to 
bring prosperity to our cultural market and at the same time, 
pay attention to managing and cleaning up our cultural market to 
improve people's tastes in appreciating beauty and mold their 
spirits. We must work hard to create high-taste spiritual 
products to bring prosperity to the cultural market. We must 
encourage cultural workers to immerse themselves among the 
masses and penetrate deep into life to actively create spiritual 
products that are healthy in content, particularly products that 
eulogize reform, opening up, and modernization and are 
artistically appealing. Each year we must produce a large 
number of outstanding motion pictures, television programs, 
dramas, operas, music, dance, fine arts, and literary works that 
are loved by the masses. We must continue to carry out the 
project of creating spiritual products that are outstanding in 
five areas, and we must earnestly organize cultural activities 
on major holidays. We must carry out the work of eliminating 
pornography by strengthening the management of the cultural 
market, focusing on the management of the publication of books, 
newspapers, magazines, motion pictures, television programs, and 
audio and video tapes, as well as performances and 
entertainment. We must regulate the cultural market by 
controlling both production and circulation. 
  -- Strengthening and improving grass-roots ideological and 
political work. This year particular emphasis must be laid on 
bringing into full play political advantages to correctly handle 
contradictions among the people and effectively strengthen 
grass-roots ideological and political work. To ensure a good 
job in the work of this aspect, it is necessary to, first of 
all, clarify the principle for pooling efforts and achieving a 
common understanding; second, to adhere to an effective method 
of guidance for clearing contradictions, neither sidestepping 
nor aggravating them; third, to emphasize, understand, and 
reflect the truth so as to obtain a real good grasp of 
situations; fourth, to stress the need to establish a 
responsibility system at each level for solving contradictions 
at the grass roots in the embryonic stage without reporting them 
to higher authorities; and fifth, to urge leading cadres to 
improve their style of work, to forge close ties with the 
masses, and to conduct ideological work in light of solving 
practical problems for ordinary people. This year, ideological 
and political work in rural areas should be focused on 
stabilizing the role of agriculture as the foundation of 
national economy; on striving to win a bumper grain harvest; on 
continuing to develop agriculture toward a pattern of high 
yields, high quality, and high efficiency; and on increasing 
incomes of peasants; so as to harness their enthusiasm, protect 
their interests, and maintain stability in rural areas. In 
enterprises, ideological and political work should be carried 
out with a clear objective in mind along with the progress in 
establishing a modern enterprise system and on the basis of 
different ownership structures, organizational forms, and 
operation conditions. A special effort must be made to conduct 
ideological and political work in enterprises experiencing 
hardships to guide their workers and staff to heighten the 
spirits and overcome difficulty while doing everything possible 
to help them tide over difficulty, thereby safeguarding 
stability of enterprises. In schools, it is necessary to pay 
close attention to carrying out ideological and political work 
among teachers and students, and to ensure the stability of 
schools of higher learning, in particular. 
  Li Zemin emphasized: Propaganda departments and, even more, 
party committees at various levels are duty-bound to strengthen 
propaganda and ideological work. Under the current situation of 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, party 
committees at all levels should bear in mind the ideology of 
"grasping two links at the same time." We should focus 
attention on reform, development, and stability, and attach as 
much importance to propaganda and ideological work as to 
economic work. We should put propaganda and ideological work on 
the top of the agenda, conducting the work several times a year 
to analyze the situation, to keep abreast of social trends and 
ideological traits of the masses, to publicize their work plans 
and focal points, and to outline tasks and measures. In 
conducting propaganda and ideological work, the provincial, 
city, prefectural, and county party committees should discuss 
and deal with major issues related primarily to direction, 
including the direction of theory, of public opinions, of social 
trends, and of intellectual products; and should ensure that 
propaganda and ideological work develop along the correct 
direction. We should pay close attention to the overall quality, 
and show concern and support for the input into propaganda and 
cultural undertakings and the construction of their facilities. 
We should attach importance to the pattern and adopt policies 
to foster a rational pattern and to encourage intellectual 
products to reflect the spirit of our times. We should stress 
coordination and pool the efforts of the press, publications, 
radio, television, and other cultural departments. We should 
concern themselves with reform, improve the party and 
government's leadership system and method of propaganda and 
ideological work, support the reform of propaganda and cultural 
undertakings, and invigorate propaganda and ideological work. 
We should pay close attention to personnel and continually 
enhance their ideological and political awareness and 
professional competence by supporting them politically, 
ideologically, and in their work and everyday life. By doing 
so, we can bring into full play the talent and wisdom of 
ideological and political workers and enable younger ones to 
grow to maturity quicker. 
  In the afternoon, Liang Pingbo, Standing Committee member 
and 
director of the Propaganda Department of the provincial party 
committee, relayed the guidelines of the national propaganda and 
ideological work conference. 
  The meeting was attended by deputy secretaries of all city 
(prefectural) and county party committees in charge of 
ideological work and their propaganda department directors; 
leaders of lecture groups, foreign publicity office directors, 
and editors-in-chief of party newspapers of all city 
(prefectural) party committees; party committee officials of 
enterprises and schools of higher learning affiliated with the 
provincial government; officials of work committees for organs 
under the provincial party committee and the provincial 
government, for schools of higher learning, and for enterprises; 
and responsible persons of the propaganda departments of the 
Provincial Trade Union Council, the Provincial Communist Youth 
League Committee, and the Provincial Women's Federation. 
  The meeting was also attended by representatives to a 
provincial conference of cultural bureau directors on radio and 
television propaganda work and press and publication work, and 
to a Hangzhou city propaganda and ideological work conference.

<F P=106> [By reporter Xu Lai (1776 0171): "China's Procuratorial </F>
Organs Deal Sternly With Lawbreaking Procuratorial Personnel"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 26 Mar (FAZHI RIBAO)--This reporter has 
learned from the second discipline inspection and supervision 
work meeting held today that, last year, the procuratorial 
organs across the country made great efforts to strengthen 
anticorruption work within procuratorial organs, solemnly 
handled a number of discipline violation cases, strictly banned 
and corrected the unhealthy practices of indiscriminately 
collecting fees and imposing fines, and quite successfully 
safeguarded the prestige of procuratorial organs. 
  Wang Ke, head of the discipline inspection group sent to the 
Supreme People's Procuratorate by the Central Discipline 
Inspection Commission, gave an account at the meeting of 
anticorruption work within procuratorial organs. Wang Ke said 
that last year, a total of 12,934 leading cadres at or above the 
department level of the procuratorial system across the country 
took part in democratic life meetings which discussed honesty 
and self-discipline. This accounted for 99 percent of leading 
cadres who should have attended such meetings. Viewed from the 
results of self-examination, most leading cadres have 
strengthened their sense of honesty and self- discipline and 
carried out self-examination and self-correction in accordance 
with the five stipulations. 
  Wang Ke said that procuratorates at all levels handled cases 
of violation of discipline, regarding this work as an important 
task in anticorruption within procuratorial organs. Last year, 
568 personnel who had broken laws and violated discipline were 
put on record for investigation and prosecution, accounting for 
3.3 per mill of the total number of procuratorial personnel 
across the country. Of this number, 159 were punished for 
violating party discipline, 343 for violating administrative 
discipline, and 87 were investigated and affixed with criminal 
responsibility. These included: The case of Chen Zhiwen, 
former chief procurator of the Changping County Procuratorate in 
Beijing Municipality, who accepted bribes amounting to nearly 
20,000 yuan and the case of Cui Xingguo, former deputy chief 
procurator of theinunchun City Procuratorate of Jilin Province, 
who embezzled $4,000 from fines and money which had been 
confiscated. At the same time, various localities also strictly 
stopped and corrected the unhealthy practices of 
indiscriminately collecting fees and imposing fines. According 
to incomplete statistics, the procuratorial system sorted out 24 
items of fees being indiscriminately collected and fines 
indiscriminately imposed, involving over 16.29 million yuan. 
Over 7.63 million yuan was returned to those who had paid and 
over 1.17 million yuan was handed over to the state. By the end 
of last year, 15 provinces (regions and municipalities) had 
returned over 70 percent of such fees and fines to the payers. 
  Wang Ke said that since the Supreme People's Procuratorate 
issued the "Notice Reaffirming Prohibition on Procuratorates 
Overstepping Power or Violating Laws in Handling Cases" for the 
second time last year, various localities have solemnly handled 
this kind of case. Hebei Province, in cooperation with the 
provincial discipline inspection commission, carried out 
investigation and dealt with a discipline violation case in 
which the Zhuozhou City Procuratorate meddled in 25 economic 
disputes and kept 490,000 yuan in the course of demanding 
payment of debts. The procuratorate has returned 277,000 yuan 
from fees which it collected unlawfully. Zhang Weimin, chief 
procurator, and Tian Fang, deputy chief procurator of the 
procuratorate have been dismissed. 
  Talking about the major anticorruption tasks within 
procuratorial organs this year, Wang Ke urged that all 
procuratorial personnel should, centering closely round the new 
demands of three items of work put forward by the central 
authorities, in accordance with the unified planning of local 
party committees, and in light of their own actual situation, 
carry out thorough-going, sustained, and more effective 
anticorruption work within procuratorial organs and strive to 
make achievements in education, self-discipline, handling cases, 
and improving rules and regulations.

<F P=106> [Report by Xin Wen (6580 2429): "Minister of Public </F>
Security Tao Siju Urges Public Security Organs at All Levels To 
Fight Corruption in Light of the Specific Conditions"] 
  [Text] At the national meeting of the discipline 
inspection commission secretaries of public security departments 
(bureaus), Tao Siju, minister of public security, stressed that 
the in-depth struggle against corruption in the public security 
organs has a bearing on the overall situation of guaranteeing 
reform, development, and stability throughout the country, so 
public security organs at all levels must better understand the 
significance of the struggle, must truly grasp the key points, 
take effective action, and strive for new results in carrying 
out the anticorruption struggle in depth. 
  Tao Siju said: After the second plenum of the CPC Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission last August, the Ministry of 
Public Security and the public security organs in all provinces, 
autonomous regions, and municipalities carried out the 
anticorruption struggle. Leading cadres at and above the section 
level and directors and political commissars of the county and 
city (district) public security bureaus first examined and 
rectified their own behavior and further enhanced their 
consciousness in preventing and resisting corruption and 
exercising self-discipline. Discipline was strictly enforced, 
and a number of lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases were 
seriously handled. The misconduct of some local public security 
organs in coastal areas -- such as getting involved in smuggling 
and shielding smuggling activities -- was effectively checked. 
Irregular charges and fees were basically stopped. Initial 
results were achieved in dealing with the problem of running 
profit-making enterprises and doing business. Such malpractices 
as partially enforcing the law, bending the law for the benefit 
of relatives or friends, and replacing prison terms with fines 
was brought under control. 
  Tao Siju pointed out: In the anticorruption struggle, the 
public security organs should grasp the key points in light of 
their own characteristics and should concentrate their efforts 
on eliminating such malpractices as bending the law for the 
benefit of relatives or friends or for selfish gain, extorting 
confessions by torture, and seeking illegal gains by abusing 
powers for issuing certificates, licenses, and right of abode in 
cities. The anticorruption struggle should focus on eliminating 
such misconduct, and stern action should be taken. A number of 
serious lawbreaking and discipline-violating cases involving 
leading organs, leading cadres, and police officers should be 
thorough investigated and properly handled. 
  Tao Siju stressed: The public security organs must exercise 
more effective leadership over the anticorruption struggle, must 
explicitly fix the responsibilities for leading cadres and 
leading organs so that they will actually exercise effective 
supervision over their immediate subordinates from the Ministry 
of Public Security on down. Leading cadres in the public 
security organs should have a stronger sense of management and 
should strictly manage the police rank and file. If any problem 
occurs in a public security organ, disciplinary action should 
not only be taken against those involved, but also against those 
in charge. Public security organs at all levels must continue 
to conduct education on the principle of serving the people 
wholeheartedly, on the mass line, and on the legal system for 
all personnel. At the same time, the relevant rules and 
regulations should be improved, and supervisory mechanisms 
should be perfected. 
  Tao Siju finally required that the discipline inspection and 
supervisory departments and various functional departments of 
the public security organs perform their functions more 
effectively, coordinate their work in exercising comprehensive 
control, and jointly advance the anticorruption struggle in the 
public security organs.

<F P=106> [Article by XINHUA correspondent Zou Qingli (6760 3237 </F>
7787): "Can Anti-forgery Identification Prevent Counterfeiting?"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- The results of a survey 
recently conducted by a concerned department show that about 
half of consumers look for anti-forgery identification when they 
purchase commodities, believing those with anti-forgery 
identification are positively genuine. 
  However, can anti-forgery identification really prevent the 
counterfeiting of products? 
  A few years back when markets were inundated with forgeries 
of famous-brand goods and shoddy products, the concerned 
department and victimized enterprises backed products designed 
with anti-forgery identification as an effective way of checking 
counterfeiting activities. Around 1990, Qingdao's Meiqi Laser 
Holographic Image Company and other enterprises were the first 
to import laser holographic image production lines from abroad. 
Since then, packages of famous-brand products such as 
"Zhangguang 101" hair tonic, "Sun" rice crust, and "Sanjiu" 
gastric medicine have been treated with laser holographic 
anti-forgery identification to prevent counterfeiting. The 
initial results of anti-forgery identification were great. In 
1991, the State Bureau of Technology Supervision issued a 
document popularizing anti-forgery technology on famous-brand 
products. 
  Nonetheless, counterfeit manufacturers did not disappear. 
They have used anti-forgery identification as "certificates of 
identity" on forged products. As a result, the use of 
anti-forgery identification has entered a weird cycle: On the 
one hand, in order to prevent counterfeiting, more and more 
enterprises manufacturing famous-brand products have started to 
use, or have continually changed, their anti-forgery 
identification. On the other, counterfeit manufacturers have 
closely followed famous-brand manufacturers in using or changing 
anti-forgery identification. Thus, the demand for anti-forgery 
identification has grown abnormally. 
  It is understood that so far there are nearly 1,000 
enterprises engaged in research and development of anti-forgery 
technologies or in the production of goods with anti-forgery 
identification, as well as a dozen anti-forgery technologies 
including laser holographic imagery, fluorescent ink, magnetic 
ink, alteration-proof ink, temperature-changing ink, and special 
plate printing. Of these, some 70 enterprises are engaged in 
the production of laser holographic anti-forgery goods, with a 
production capacity far exceeding demand. These enterprises, 
which are scattered all over the country, are run by collective, 
private, or individual sectors as well as by joint ventures. In 
the absence of a strict and unified management, the scope of 
supplying some products is arbitrarily decided by enterprises, 
thus defeating the purpose of using anti-forgery identification. 
Meanwhile, due to the lack of unified national standards, some 
anti-forgery ink products are technology-deficient. As their 
chemical composition can be easily deciphered, they have become 
the targets of counterfeiters. 
  According to a briefing by an official of the State Bureau 
of 
Technology Supervision, of the forgery and shoddy products 
seized by technology supervision departments in various 
localities, a considerable portion were forged "famous-brand 
products" using anti- forgery identification. In addition to 
fraud against consumers, these forged and shoddy products have 
caused grave economic losses to famous-brand manufacturers and 
damaged their credibility. The manufacturer of "Sun" rice crust 
has spent nearly 10 million yuan changing anti-forgery 
identification on four occasions, but still has failed to thwart 
harassment by counterfeiters. The sales volume of "Sun" rice 
crust has recently dropped to less than a quarter of that three 
years ago. 
  In view of the fairly large production scale of anti-forgery 
products in China, concerned government departments should 
establish a special administrative organization, and should 
formulate national standards and administrative measures and 
rules related to anti- forgery technology and products. They 
should exercise strict supervision and management by 
implementing a system of fixed locations for the development and 
production of anti-forgery technologies. While issuing 
production licenses and quality certificates, it is necessary to 
examine the qualifications of users of anti-forgery technologies.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- The second plenary 
session of the Fourth Council of the Chinese Journalists 
Association (CJA) opened today in Beijing. 
  CJA Vice-Chairman Li Yan made a report at the meeting on the 
work of the association. More than 200 members of the council 
in mass media across the country took part in the meeting. 
  Li hailed the great contributions the association has made 
over the past three years in developing China's journalism. 
  Talking about the association's future task, Li said the 
role 
of "bridges" and ties of the association as a non-governmental 
organization should be brought into full play. 
  He said the association must better serve all journalists, 
uniting and promoting the press circles to make greater 
contributions toward new success in China's reform, opening and 
modernization drive. 
  The vice-chairman added that the CJA should make positive 
efforts to push forward the exchanges and cooperation between 
Chinese journalists and overseas journalists. 
  He noted that as an authoritative non-governmental 
organization the CJA should adapt itself to meet the demands of 
the time and the journalists, broaden mass viewpoints and play a 
better role as a bridge and tie in the new situation. 
  He said that China has more than 500,000 people who are 
engaged in journalism. 
  Xu Weicheng, deputy director of the Propaganda Department of 
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, also spoke at the 
meeting. 
  Xu said that it is necessary to adhere to the correct 
orientation of the ideological and media work, serving the 
economic construction, reform and opening, and social and 
political stability.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- All-round army 
construction should be directed by Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, a senior 
military leader said. 
  Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military 
Commission, had a discussion yesterday in Beijing with six 
military area commanders and political commissars who were 
attending a forum. 
  Referring to the significance in studying the third volume 
of 
Deng's works, Liu said that it is a long-term strategic task for 
the Army to arm all the soldiers and officers with Deng's theory 
of Chinese socialism and his idea of army building in a new 
period. 
  He stressed that relations between reform, development and 
stability, and between parts and the whole, should be handled 
correctly by means of deepening the study. 
  He said that leading offers in particular should work hard, 
lead their officers and soldiers in any effort and do a good job 
in all aspects of army construction so as to make active 
contributions to the nation's reform, opening and modernization 
drive and to the maintenance of social stability. 
  He said that officers and soldiers should be educated to 
inherit the Army's fine working style. 
  Several top military leaders of the People's Liberation Army 
were also present at the discussion.

<F P=106> ["Liaowang Forum" by staff commentator: "Commodity Prices </F>
Are Not Trifles"] 
  [Text] Since last winter and this spring, there have been 
fairly sharp price rises, and this has evoked strong 
repercussions among the masses. The party Central Committee and 
the State Council are paying great attention to this. Recently, 
the State Council has issued a series of circulars and adopted a 
series of measures to curb unauthorized rises in prices and fees 
and to standardize price behavior to meet the needs of 
establishing a socialist market economy system and to keep price 
rises for the basic necessities of life and service fees within 
a range that most people can sustain. 
  At present, our country enjoys political stability and 
economic prosperity, and the situation of reform and development 
is good. However, some problems also exist in economic life that 
should not be neglected. The fairly sharp rise in prices is a 
prominent problem. Some enterprises have taken advantage of the 
introduction of tax, exchange rate, and price reforms to drive 
up prices. For the sake of local interests, some localities 
have exceeded their own power in fixing prices and 
indiscriminately collecting fees. Disregarding regulations on 
putting goods on sale with clearly marked prices, some 
businessmen have asked exorbitant prices, monopolized business, 
cheated people in the same trade, and played the bully. They 
have even caused consumers to suffer and sought staggering 
profits by selling fake and shoddy products. All of this 
illegal business behavior has pushed the general price level 
higher and consequently injured the interests of the people. If 
the above-mentioned behavior is not effectively checked and 
problems are not solved in a timely fashion, it will inevitably 
disrupt the normal price order in the market, affect the 
people's lives and social stability, and be disadvantageous to 
the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy. Commodity prices are not trifles. Sufficient 
attention should be attached to them. 
  The causes of the price hikes are varied. There are problems 
in economic operations, in macroeconomic regulation and control 
and management, and in the ideological understanding of leaders 
in some localities and departments. To solve these problems, it 
is fundamental to grasp both aspects of our work: The first is 
to do a good job of macroeconomic regulation and control in 
economic operations and to keep an overall balance in the 
economy. It is most important to control the scale of 
fixed-assets investment, and, at the same time, rein in the 
overgrowth of consumption funds. The second is to develop 
production and ensure market supply. Special attention should 
be paid to strengthening agriculture to maintain growth in farm 
products, especially major farm products such as grain, cotton 
and edible oil, and to grasp the "shopping basket project" to 
ensure market supply. 
  We should have a correct understanding of the price problem. 
The fluctuation in grain prices which occurred in November and 
December last year has sent us a warning: In practicing a 
socialist market economy, we should by no means let go our hold 
of and take no further interest in prices, especially of the 
basic necessities of life and service fees. One view holds that 
practicing a market economy means completely letting go our hold 
and depending wholly on regulation by market mechanisms. 
Whoever wants to practice macroeconomic regulation and control 
and provide necessary guidance and carry out necessary 
intervention in prices is considered to be going against the 
laws governing the market economy and returning to the old ways 
of the planned economy. This viewpoint is wrong. Practice over 
the past few months offers a clear answer to this problem: 
Macroeconomic regulation and control is necessary and 
appropriate government behavior in the course of building a 
socialist market economic structure. All countries in the 
world, including developed ones, do the same thing. In the 
course of establishing a socialist market economic structure and 
changing the old system to a new one, it is necessary to carry 
out macroeconomic regulation and control and exercise necessary 
price supervision. If we let things go adrift, the price order 
will be disrupted, price violations will not be stopped, and 
economic construction and reform will be affected. 
  There are also others who ask: Have we not liberalized our 
prices after carrying out price reforms for many years? Why 
should we supervise and inspect the prices of some goods? Does 
this conform to the orientation of reform? This viewpoint 
reflects some comrades who do not have a correct understanding 
of price reform. In carrying out price reform, it is of course 
necessary to gradually abolish means of production and means of 
living prices that were controlled too tightly under the planned 
economic system and to form market price mechanisms. In the 
past few years, we have done this and have achieved great 
results. But price liberalization is only part of price reform. 
The final goal of price reform lies in doing away with the 
price system and price formation mechanisms that were 
established under the planned economic structure and 
establishing a new price formation mechanism and a system of 
inspection and control which is in keeping with the socialist 
market economic structure. This is a task where we have a long 
way. It does not conform to the requirements of price reform to 
let prices go adrift without control before a new price 
formation mechanism is perfected. Through practice, we should 
gradually establish and perfect a new price formation mechanism 
by way of price liberalization and the necessary means of 
supervision, inspection, and intervention to make it conform 
with the socialist market economic structure and finally 
accomplish the task of price reform. 
  There are also some comrades who hold that it does not 
matter to have a certain amount of price hikes as the people's 
living standards have greatly improved and their capacity to 
sustain price hikes has been strengthened. After over 10 years 
of reform, the overwhelming majority of the people have actually 
benefited from the reform, and their lives have improved 
remarkably. However, in view of the uneven development in 
various regions in our country, we must not overestimate this. 
It is our duty to be responsible to the people. We must take 
measures to bring price hikes for services and basic 
necessities, which are closely related to the people's daily 
life and of immediate concern to their interests, within a range 
which most people can sustain. The practice of indiscriminately 
raising prices and collecting charges should by no means be left 
unchecked. 
  It is an important task at present to overcome the 
above-mentioned erroneous or vague understandings, unify our 
thinking, take unified action, carry out conscientiously the 
series of State Council directives, do a good job of price 
inspection, do a really good job of supervising and inspecting 
prices of basic necessities and service items, curb price 
violations, standardize the market price order, and rein in 
excessive rises in the general level of price. Only when we do 
a good job of this can we stabilize the people's lives, maintain 
social stability, and create a good environment for economic 
development and the battle to storm heavily fortified positions 
of reform which began this year.

<F P=106> ["Reform Scanning" Column: "Some SEZs Are To Be Converted </F>
Into Free Trade Zones in Wake of China `Regaining GATT 
Membership'"] 
  [Text] According to GATT's nondiscrimination principle, 
after "being admitted to" GATT, the relevant country must ensure 
unified implementation of the agreement nationwide. In GATT's 
view, introducing special policies will affect unified 
implementation of the foreign trade system throughout the 
relevant country and will thus create an environment for unequal 
competition, weakening the central government's ability to 
fulfill its GATT obligations. Therefore, preferential policies 
granted to special economic zones [SEZs] and development zones 
will be gradually withdrawn. In its 12-point suggestions, GATT 
demanded that China abolish the different investment and 
taxation policies applied in different regions. 
  The SEZs Office pointed out: When China is admitted to GATT, 
the discrepancy between local policies will disappear gradually 
and the market system will be adjusted according to the 
international practice represented by GATT. In future, there 
will be only differences in the development of a fully fledged 
market rather than in market policies. Naturally, since the 
SEZs have set up a complete set of market systems which suit the 
international economic pattern on the strength of preferential 
policies, they will possibly continue to lead the way in 
building a fully fledged market. 
  At present, some places are still vying with one another to 
introduce preferential policies. The SEZs Office believes it is 
necessary to draw lessons from the growth of the SEZs. The 
unparalleled role played by policies will come to naught with 
the gradual improvement of the market and legal systems. 
Policies can only play a role for a short period.

  [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A nationwide economic 
data system has been established in China, which is expected to 
play an important role in economic policy-making and 
administration. 
  So far, data banks have been set up in all the 30 provinces, 
autonomous regions and municipalities, all the cities with the 
status of municipalities, and all the 280 major cities and 
prefectures as well as 1,500 counties throughout the country. 
  These data banks provide governments at various levels with 
timely, accurate and useful data for medium- and long-term 
economic forecasts. Last year the State Information Center 
submitted a report to the central government, warning that the 
country's total investment in fixed assets had surpassed 1,000 
billion yuan, thus helping the central government to immediately 
strengthen macro control over investment in fixed assets. 
  In particular, the administrative data banks have been 
systemized. The administrative data bank on projects to absorb 
foreign funds has collected over 100,000 pieces of information 
on 3,000 projects. The data is updated regularly. In addition, 
the national data bank of investment in fixed assets, the 
national data bank of laws and regulations and the national data 
bank on macro economic control have all gone into regular 
operation. 
  Besides, a joint service network of data banks has been set 
up to cover 13 provinces and municipalities. The services will 
cover foreign investment guidance, tourism, international 
finance and enterprise laws and will charge fees.

  [Text] Wuhan, April 26 (XINHUA) -- In an effort to further 
tighten the management of foreign investment assets, China will 
enact new methods of their appraisal and management from May 1, 
according to a national conference held recently in Wuhan, 
capital of central China's Hubei Province. 
  The methods were jointly stipulated by the State 
Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities and the Ministry of Finance. 
  In recent years, foreign investment in China has risen 
rapidly. By the end of 1993, China had approved 170,000 
foreign-funded enterprises, involving 210 billion U.S. dollars 
in contracted foreign funds, 60 billion U.S. dollars of which 
were finally put to use. Eighty percent of the investment was 
in the form of machines and equipment and margins existed 
between their value and evaluation. 
  In 1993, the State Administration for the Inspection of 
Import and Export Commodities re-evaluated 2,121 cases of 
foreign investment assets, claimed by owners to be worth more 
than 965 million U.S. dollars, and found that they were worth 
slightly over 800 million U.S. dollars. 
  The appraisals to be adopted will cover variety, quality, 
quantity, value and losses. Appraisals of variety, quality and 
quantity will cover the assets' names, types, quality, quantity, 
size, trademark, rate of obsolescence, date of production, 
nation of origin and manufacturer. Value appraisal will cover 
the contemporary evaluation of foreign investment assets and 
loss appraisal will cover the reasons and degrees of losses 
caused by natural disasters and accidents, cost of clearing up 
losses and remaining value of the assets. 
  The State Administration for the Inspection of Import and 
Export Commodities will take charge of the nationwide appraisal 
of foreign investment assets and its local bureaus will take 
care of the local appraisal work. 
  To deal with the examination of foreign investment assets, 
an 
accounting office must hold a value appraisal certificate of the 
State Administration for the Inspection of Import and Export 
Commodities or other relevant organizations, the "methods" said.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Beijing's 
manufacturing industries will step up cooperation with 
multi-national companies over the next seven years, a municipal 
government official said today. 
  Addressing a news conference today, Gao Zuozhi, director of 
the Municipal Economic Commission, invited multi-national 
companies to invest in such priority industries as automobiles, 
electronics, meters, new chemicals, new building materials, 
pharmaceuticals, clothing, food processing, computers, 
program-controlled switchboards, and integrated circuits. 
  Specifically, he said, Beijing seeks cooperation with 
multi-national companies and other overseas firms in 
manufacturing goods with a low consumption of energy, raw 
materials or water, but with a high added value. 
  Beijing also wishes to cooperate with overseas investors in 
moving factories in downtown areas to suburbs and undertaking 
real estate development projects and building service-oriented 
companies there, he added. 
  Gao also revealed that Beijing has set up a number of major 
joint ventures with multi-national companies, including the NEC 
Company of Japan, the Chrysler Company of the United States, the 
Philips Corporation of the Netherlands and ABB Company of 
Switzerland. 
  By the end of 1993 manufacturers in Beijing had established 
40 major joint ventures with overseas firms, each involving at 
least 10 million U.S. dollars in foreign investment, he said. 
  These ventures involve 2.08 billion U.S. dollars in total 
foreign investment, he added.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- China is speeding up 
drafting of its first law on negotiable instruments, in a bid to 
ensure their safe and smooth circulation. 
  An official from the Bureau of Legislative Affairs under the 
State Council said here today that the legislation on negotiable 
instruments in China has become increasingly imperative as the 
market economy is developing rapidly. 
  Speaking at a seminar on negotiable instruments held by the 
Chinese Chamber of International Commerce (CCIC) and the Chamber 
of International Commerce, the official said that the National 
People's Congress and the State Council have attached great 
importance to the work on such a law. 
  The legislative branch has already put the draft and viewing 
of the law on its top agenda. 
  China began its work on drafting the law in 1990 and the 
initial draft has taken shape. 
  The official said that the drafting group did research not 
only on the use and circulation of domestic negotiable 
instruments but made studies on the relevant laws abroad. 
  Xu Dayou, vice president of CCIC, said that the seminar was 
aimed at better understanding foreign laws on negotiable 
instruments and international experiences in the area by Chinese 
lawyers, financiers and industrialists, in order to standardize 
Chinese actions of negotiable instruments in international trade 
and investment fields and ensure the normal use and circulation 
of negotiable instruments. 
  During the two-day meeting, experts on checks and bills from 
the Chamber of International Commerce and Britain will exchange 
views with Chinese legislators and financiers on international 
norms on rules, structures, sorts and actions of negotiable 
instruments as well as the current situation of the use of 
negotiable instruments in China.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Ma Chenguang: "Negotiable Notes To Be </F>
Regulated With New Law"] 
  [Text] China is introducing a law on bills of exchange to 
better regulate their proper use and circulation, an official 
from the State Council said yesterday. 
  The draft of the Law on Negotiable Instruments has been 
completed and will be submitted to the State Council for 
deliberation soon, said Li Shishi from the council's Legislative 
Affairs Bureau. 
  As indicated in the draft, negotiable instruments will 
include bills of exchange, promissory notes, bearer shares, 
bonds and negotiable certificates of deposits, Li said at an 
international seminar in Beijing. 
  The law is intended to ensure the proper handling of 
transactions involving payments, exchanges, credit, and 
financing and dissolving debts. 
  The introduction of a socialist market economy in China has 
led to the increasing use of various negotiable instruments for 
finance, investment and international trade. The growing role 
these documents play calls for a timely law to regulate their 
use . 
  The lack of such a law has resulted in disputes and crimes, 
such as circulation of bad checques and fake bills, he said. 
According to the draft law, these crimes will be severely 
punished. 
  The law will stipulate the pattern of negotiable instruments 
and the information that they must include. It also will 
establish details about the transfer of holders' rights and cash 
deposits and the effectiveness period for the documents. 
  Research for the draft began in 1990 and was mainly compiled 
by experts from the People's Bank of China, he said. After 
deliberation at the State Council, the law will be submitted to 
China's legislature for approval. 
  Li spoke at a two-day seminar on negotiable instruments, 
which was organized by the China Chamber of International 
Commerce and the International Chamber of Commerce. 
  The organizers said they wished to draw useful experiences 
from other countries through the seminar to provide perspective 
for China's compilation of its law. 
  Analysts at the seminar said the draft law is expected to be 
passed this year.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The legitimate rights 
and interests of the vast number of laborers in China are being 
better protected, as the system of labor dispute arbitration and 
labor supervision is becoming fully-fledged. 
  According to the China Labor Development Bulletin issued 
here 
jointly today by the Ministry of Labor and the State Statistics 
Bureau, arbitration committees for labor disputes at various 
levels had by the end of last year been seized of 12,300 
disputes, up 51.6 percent over the previous year. 
  Liu Guanxue, spokesman for the Labor Ministry, told 
reporters 
that Chinese laborers have now become more conscious of the 
importance of self-protection. The labor departments, on the 
other hand, are doing their best to step up labor protection by 
all legal means. 
  The bulletin shows that the arbitration committees examined 
and handled 11,400 labor disputes last year, some 92.2 percent 
of the total. 
  At the same time, according to the spokesman, the labor 
supervisory system has also been greatly strengthened. By now, 
altogether 16 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities 
nationwide have set up labor supervisory institutions. 
  They have established the system of mass-reporting of 
illegal 
labor activities and launched various forms of checks on labor 
recruitment. 
  According to statistics from the provinces of Guangdong, 
Sichuan and Zhejiang, the most labor-intensive areas in China, 
the labor supervisory institutions cracked down on more than 100 
illegal labor intermediary institutions in 1993, which 
effectively maintains order in the state's labor markets.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- China will implement 
over 20 forceful measures in the near future to curb the state's 
unemployment growth, which now stands at 2.6 percent. 
  One of the major counter-measures is to set up an 
unemployment warning line, according to Zhang Xiaojian, head of 
the Employment Department of the state's Labor Ministry. 
  The official said that the warning line will be determined 
in 
light of the jobless rate, mass layoffs and the economic targets 
of various localities. 
  A special organ headed by the labor departments will be set 
up in order to take charge of organizing counter-measures to cut 
the unemployment rate. 
  Zhang revealed that the government will promulgate a series 
of relevant laws and regulations for the purpose of supervising 
or penalizing enterprises when they conduct illegal layoffs. 
  The enterprises should set up a declaration system for 
releasing redundant personnel and have to pay placement fees 
when conducting mass layoffs. 
  According to the official, the government will still issue 
administrative orders to prevent enterprises from firing aged 
working staff. 
  As for the enterprises whose assets cannot offset debts, yet 
which are still hopeful of being rescued, the concerned 
departments will help to pull them through difficulties, so as 
to avoid bankruptcy and large-scale layoffs. 
  To help curb the growth of unemployment, the enterprises 
have 
to confine rural recruitment within strict limits and give 
priority to those people who have lost their jobs. 
  Moreover, according to the official, the state will set up 
unemployment insurance funds at central and provincial levels. 
He said that when the unemployment rate in certain localities 
surpasses the unemployment warning line, they may take advantage 
of the central and provincial funds to make up for local fund 
shortages. 
  As for the bankrupt enterprises, the concerned government 
departments will ask the enterprises to appropriate special 
funds out of their remaining assets as relief aid to the 
unemployed staff. 
  Zhang, the leading official charged with resolving the 
state's unemployment problem, attributed the serious 
unemployment state to the radical transformation of economic 
structures and the sharp contradiction of labor supply exceeding 
demand. 
  Zhang expects the number of the unemployed to reach 5 
million 
by the end of this year. He stressed that it will be still 
possible to contain the jobless rate within 3 percent.

  [Text] The seven-day Second Session of the Seventh Fujian 
People's Congress ended in Fuzhou this morning after fulfilling 
various items listed on the agenda. The session called on 
people throughout the province to unite more closely around the 
CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. 
Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of 
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and of the 
party's basic line, and under the leadership of the provincial 
party committee, they must be of one heart and one mind, and 
must make persistent efforts to carry out reform, rely on their 
own efforts, and work hard to promote their undertakings. They 
must strive for a new victory in our province's reform, opening 
up, and construction. 
  The executive chairmen of the session--Jia Qinglin, Yuan 
Qitong, Guo Ruiren, Huang Changxi, Su Changpei, Liu Yongye, 
Zhang Mingjun, Hong Huasheng, and Song Jun--were seated in the 
front rows of the rostrum. Presided over by Su Changpei, the 
session adopted a resolution approving the work report of the 
provincial people's government. The resolution held that the 
review of the report on last year's work conformed with reality, 
and that the tasks and arrangements proposed by the report for 
the coming year were practical and feasible. 
  The session also adopted the following resolutions: The 
resolution on the implementation of the plan for the national 
economic and social development in our province last year, and 
plan for this year; the resolution on our province's final 
accounts last year, and this year's budget; the resolution on 
the work report of the provincial people's congress standing 
committee; the resolution on the work report of the provincial 
higher people's court; and the resolution on the work report of 
the provincial people's procuratorate. 
  After approving these resolutions, Jia Qinglin, newly 
elected 
chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee, 
and Chen Mingyi, newly elected governor of the provincial 
people's government, made their respective speeches.

relations between Fuzhou and Taiwan. 
  Fuzhou is separated from Taiwan by the Taiwan Strait and is 
the closest mainland city to Taiwan Island. Because of human, 
geological, and blood relations, trade, economic cooperation and 
various kinds of exchanges between the two places have been 
increasing in recent years and remarkable results have been 
achieved. Xi Jinping believes that Fuzhou City has a lot of 
favorable conditions for attracting capital from Taiwan and, at 
present, the investment environment improves with each passing 
day. As far as the "hard" environment is concerned: Various 
counties (cities) under the city have gone all out to build 
high-grade major highways from north to south and east to west 
and the 7,500-tonne passenger wharf open to the outside world 
has been completed and put into operation; after expansion, 
Fuzhou's Yixu Airport opened more than 80 air routes to various 
major cities in China and preparatory work for the construction 
of the Changle International Airport is almost complete and 
construction work will start soon; and the Fuzhou Huaneng Power 
Plant will be expanded. As far as the "soft" environment is 
concerned, Fuzhou City has set up a Taiwan Compatriot Investment 
Service Center to help Taiwan businessmen solve problems in 
making investment in a timely manner. 
  Xi Jinping told these reporters that capital introduced from 
Taiwan this year would be used mainly in infrastructure, such as 
transportation and power facilities, agricultural production 
which could earn foreign exchange, and industries using new and 
high technology. Preferential treatment would be given to 
investment in major construction projects and infrastructure 
projects such as airports, wharves, roads, and power plants. 
Taiwan businessmen would be encouraged to set up bonded 
warehouses and carry out entrepot trade in the bonded zone and 
they would also be encouraged to transform, lease, contract, and 
purchase various enterprises by setting up joint ventures. He 
said that in the Fuzhou Bonded Zone, tariffs and permits were 
exempted, international trade organizations were allowed to be 
established to carry out international entrepot trade, and the 
establishment of a capital goods market would also be allowed. 
  He said that in attracting capital from Taiwan this year, 
Fuzhou City would further improve the system for keeping in 
contact with Taiwan enterprises involved in investment of over 
$10 million, do a good job in providing services for Taiwan 
enterprises, organize the functional departments concerned to 
carry out investigation and study on Taiwan enterprises and to 
help solve various difficult problems, and strive to make new 
breakthroughs in attracting investment from major financial 
groups. At the same time, Fuzhou would further strengthen the 
construction of the "soft" investment environment, establish and 
improve the joint examination and approval system, simplify 
procedures for examination and approval, properly organize 
activities on reception days for Taiwan and foreign businessmen, 
carry out official work on the spot in the economy and 
technology development zone, and the Taiwan Businessmen's 
Investment Zone, and strengthen the building of Fuzhou's Taiwan 
Compatriots Investment and Trade Service Center and Foreign 
Businessmen's Investment Service Center to improve efficiency 
and service functions. 
  Talking about how to urge Taiwan businessmen to abide by 
laws 
and how to earnestly protect the legitimate rights and interests 
of workers and staff members of enterprises following the 
increased number of Taiwan-invested enterprises in Fuzhou year 
after year, Xi Jinping said that it was necessary to safeguard 
the legitimate rights and interests of Taiwan compatriots who 
make investments in Fuzhou and to assist Taiwan businessmen to 
make investment and operate enterprises in Fuzhou City in the 
long-term. On the other hand, it is necessary to earnestly 
safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers and 
staff members; to urge Taiwan-invested enterprises to implement 
the state laws, decrees, and regulations concerned and inspect 
how they implement them; and to ensure proper labor insurance, 
labor protection, welfare, and wages for workers and staff 
members so that state laws, decrees, and regulations can be 
implemented smoothly in Taiwan-invested enterprises and those 
enterprises can develop in a healthy direction.

<F P=106> [Excerpts of the work report of the Jiangsu Provincial </F>
People's Procuratorate delivered by Acting Chief Procurator 
Zhang Pinhua to the Second Session of the Eighth Jiangsu 
Provincial People's Congress on 27 February 1994] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: On behalf of the Jiangsu 
Provincial People's Procuratorate, I now submit to this session 
for your examination and approval a report on the major work of 
provincial procuratorial organs in 1993. 
  Since the First Session of the Eighth Provincial People's 
Congress, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu, while upholding the 
party's basic line, have seriously implemented the guidelines of 
the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of 
the 14th CPC Central Committee; have conscientiously adapted 
themselves to the new situation of accelerated reform and 
opening up as well as to the socialist market economic 
structure; have fully performed and constantly improved their 
procuratorial functions; have strictly enforced the law and 
handled criminal cases; and have resolutely punished according 
to law serious criminals, including those who committed economic 
crimes. In this way they have actively served reform, opening 
up, and economic construction, and have made new achievements 
and progress in procuratorial work. 
<H5>  1. Concentrate on Investigating and Handling Embezzlement, </H5>
Bribery, and Other Major Economic Cases; Promote the Deepening 
of the Anti-Corruption Struggle 
  In 1993, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu placed the stress 
of 
their work on combating embezzlement and bribery. Particularly 
after the Party Central Committee made new and important 
arrangements for the anti-corruption struggle, procuratorial 
organs at all levels promptly joined the struggle; concentrated 
on investigating and handling major cases; punished embezzlers 
as well as those who offered or accepted bribes; promoted the 
deepening of the anti-corruption struggle; and provided legal 
protection and service to Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and 
economic construction. Within the year, the province placed on 
file and investigated 2,841 cases of economic crimes, including 
embezzlement and bribery, 7.1 percent more cases than handled in 
1992. Of the 1993 cases, 1,314 or 46.3 percent were major 
cases; the high percentage was unprecedented. Twenty-six cadres 
of county or provincial department level involved in 23 criminal 
cases were investigated and dealt with. The procuratorial 
organs instituted proceedings against 1,668 people in people's 
courts, and recovered 94.65 million yuan from the direct 
economic losses of the state and collectives. 
  We placed the stress of our work on investigating and 
handling cases of embezzlement, bribery, and other crimes, 
particularly major cases involving personnel of party and 
government organizations, judicial departments, administrative 
law-enforcement departments, and economic management departments. 
  (1) A number of criminal cases involving functionaries 
of party and government organizations were investigated and 
handled. In 1993, the procuratorial organs in Jiangsu 
investigated 191 functionaries of party and government 
organizations involved in cases of embezzlement, bribery, and 
other economic crimes, including some cadres at the county or 
provincial department level. Although criminal cases involving 
party and government cadres were small in number, they have done 
considerably serious harm and hurt the blood- and-flesh ties 
between the party and government and the people. Moreover, they 
could promote unhealthy tendencies and induce more crimes. 
  (2) Some criminal cases involving judicial personnel 
and administrative law-enforcement personnel were sternly dealt 
with. In 1993, we investigated 29 judicial personnel 
involved in economic crimes. We also handled a number of 
embezzlement, bribery, and other economic crimes involving such 
administrative law-enforcement departments as the Administration 
of Industry and Commerce, taxation departments, and customs 
offices. For instance, Cheng Renmin, deputy director of the 
Zhangjiagang Customs Office, colluded with two office 
accountants to embezzle more than 400,000 yuan of public funds. 
Cheng also diverted 500,000 yuan of public funds to be used in 
his personal profit-making undertakings. 
  (3) A number of criminal cases involving banking and 
economic management departments were detected. In 1993, 
procuratorial organs at various levels in Jiangsu resolutely 
implemented the central authorities' policy decision on 
strengthening macro-economic regulation and control, and helped 
rectify the banking order and improve the management of the 
securities and real estate markets. They promptly investigated 
and handled cases of embezzlement and bribery, as well as cases 
of using public funds in speculation on stocks, real estate, and 
futures. They detected 108 criminal cases involving 122 persons 
of the Banking Department. Wang Guangyi, secretary of the 
leading party group of the Bank of Agriculture and president of 
the Keyin Real Estate Development Company in the Runzhou 
District of Zhenjiang, and four others took bribes of 240,000 
yuan renminbi and HK$20,000 from real estate speculators. After 
they were prosecuted by procuratorial organs, they were 
sentenced to imprisonment ranging from five to 13 years. The 
procuratorial organs in various localities also detected a 
number of cases in the supply and marketing, materials, grain, 
and other economic management departments. 
  (4) Resolute efforts were made to combat such crimes 
as trademark falsification, tax evasion, and fraudulent export 
tax refund. Trademark falsification, tax evasion, and 
fraud greatly jeopardize the establishment of the socialist 
market economic structure. In 1993, the province investigated 
252 cases of trademark falsification, 167 percent more than in 
1992. Of those cases, 57 involved illegal business volume of 
more than 100,000 yuan each, and three involved illegal business 
volume of more than 1 million yuan each. Fraudulent export tax 
refunds are a new form of crime. In 1993, this province 
discovered 14 cases in this regard and placed them on file for 
investigation. 
  As far as economic criminal cases which are under 
investigation by Jiangsu procuratorial organs are concerned, 
currently such crimes as corruption and bribery are rampant. 
The major characteristics of such cases are: First, the amount 
involved in such crimes is increasing. In 1993, the average 
amount involved in each case totalled 35,000 yuan, up 40 percent 
over 1992. Thirty-nine corruption and bribery cases were filed 
for investigation, each involving more than 100,000 yuan, plus 
six embezzlement cases, each involving more than one million 
yuan. Second, the number of cases involving more than one person 
has increased, and many cases are characterized by collusion 
between insiders and outsiders. Among filed cases, there were 
720 people jointly committing crimes. Third, many crimes are 
committed by youth, and many of these are major cases. Among 
filed cases, there are 232 criminals under 25. Some embezzled 
large sums of money when they took their posts; others spent 
freely and indulged in wanton pleasure after receiving huge 
amounts in bribes. Fourth, more and more criminal elements 
abscond with funds. In 1993, 93 criminals absconding with funds 
were apprehended; some carried funds worth hundreds of thousand 
yuan. 
2. Crack Down on Major Criminal Activities and Maintain 
Political and Social Stability 
  In 1993, procuratorial organs across Jiangsu continued to 
carry out the policy of giving heavier punishments over a short 
time according to the law and of cracking down on major criminal 
activities in order to maintain social stability and ensure that 
Jiangsu's reform, opening up, and economic construction 
proceeded smoothly. Particularly during the "summertime 
crackdown" launched across Jiangsu in June-September, 
procuratorial organs at various levels earnestly carried out 
their duties, closely coordinated with public security organs 
and courts, and cracked down on a number of criminal elements of 
major cases. In 1993, procuratorial organs at various levels 
accepted applications for approval by public security organs to 
arrest 31,157 criminals; authorized the arrest of 28,708 
criminals, an increase of 17.3 percent over 1992; and prosecuted 
28,063 of the 31,157 criminals transferred from public security 
organs. 
  During crackdowns, we concentrated on curtailing crimes that 
seriously endanger social order and public security as well as 
people's lives, properties, and security; we mercilessly 
punished such major criminal elements as murderers, robbers, 
rapists, major thieves, hooligan groups, "train and road 
bandits," and "river bandits." In 1993, 8,903 criminals of 
major cases were prosecuted across Jiangsu. To quickly punish 
criminals from major cases, procuratorial organs at various 
levels were involved early in the investigations and preparatory 
examinations by public security organs; examined and verified 
facts and evidence; proposed ways to obtain evidence; adhered to 
the principles of having irrefutable facts and conclusive 
evidence as well as avoiding quibbling over side issues; and 
ensured they not miss any opportunities in procuratorial work. 
Procuratorial organs across Jiangsu were involved in 1,211 
criminal cases which were still under investigation by public 
security organs; participated in the inspection of the crime 
scene 1,294 times; participated in preparatory examination and 
case discussions 2,354 times; and presented 2,082 proposals for 
obtaining evidence. 
  In 1993, procuratorial organs across Jiangsu earnestly 
participated in comprehensive management of the social order and 
strived to strengthen the social effect of the "crackdown" 
campaign. First, they coordinated with the courts to organize 
meetings on a certain scale for public trials and verdicts, 
publicized knowledge of the legal system, and educated the 
masses by exposing crimes. Second, focusing on areas and 
sections where public security problems were conspicuous, they 
coordinated with the concerned departments and made great 
efforts to launch special crackdown and management projects. 
Third, they established public security networks, rectified 
public order, and implemented preventive measures. Fourth, they 
doubled their efforts to educate, redeem, and help juvenile 
delinquents. Fifth, they doubled their efforts to investigate 
the execution of a criminal's sentence outside prison and to 
help and teach those exempted from prosecution. Sixth, they 
earnestly launched a procuratorial advise campaign in light of 
handling cases, urging units in such localities where public 
security is worse to implement reform measures so as to prevent 
and reduce crimes. 
  3. Strengthen Supervision Over Law Enforcement To 
Ensure the Unified and Correct Implementation of the Laws of the 
State 
  As state organs in charge of supervision over laws, 
procuratorial organs shoulder heavy responsibility for 
supervising law enforcement and for maintaining the dignity of 
the laws and regulations of the state. Last year, procuratorial 
organs at all levels in Jiangsu Province conscientiously 
fulfilled their duty of supervision over law enforcement, 
strengthened supervision over investigations by public security 
organs and over criminal trials by people's courts, earnestly 
conducted procuratorial work at detention centers as well as 
procuratorial work on civil cases and cases involving 
administration, and scored new achievements. 
  (1) Strengthen Supervision Over the Investigations and 
Trials of Criminal Cases. Last year, while insisting on 
using facts as the basis and laws as the criteria, procuratorial 
organs throughout the province strictly checked up on cases 
submitted to higher authorities for approving the arrest and 
prosecution of suspects; conscientiously made a distinction 
between those who were guilty and those who were not, as well as 
between different kinds of guilt; prevented mistakes and 
omissions; and corrected violations of the law. While punishing 
criminals in accordance with the law, they protected innocent 
people from criminal investigation. They decided not to grant 
approval for the arrest of 3,005 criminals among those submitted 
by public security organs, and decided to arrest and prosecute 
90 more criminals in addition to those submitted by public 
security organs. While supervising the trial of criminal cases, 
we focused attention on improving the work of protesting a 
verdict. At the beginning of the year, the Jiangsu Provincial 
People's Procuratorate conducted a special survey on the work of 
protesting a verdict, proposed measures for improvement, 
improved guidance for and examination of protest cases, and 
resolutely supported the correct opinions on protesting a 
verdict put forward by people's procuratorates at the lower 
level. Last year, procuratorial organs across the province 
lodged a total of 53 cases with people's courts in protest of 
their verdicts in accordance with the law; they corrected some 
cases which had been given improper court verdicts. Yin 
Fengxiang, chief of the accounting section of Taizhou's Chengbei 
Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, embezzled 
240,000 yuan. After being prosecuted by procuratorial organs, 
he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment with five years' 
probation after both first and second court hearings. The 
punishment meted out to him was unusually lenient. The Taizhou 
People's Procuratorate persisted in its correct opinion to 
protest the verdict. With resolute support from the Jiangsu 
Provincial People's Procuratorate and intervention by the 
Taizhou People's Congress and the Yangzhou People's Congress, 
the sentence for criminal Yin Fengxiang was finally changed to 
eight years' imprisonment plus the deprivation of his political 
rights for two years. 
  (2) Improve Procuratorial Work at Detention Centers; 
Supervise the Implementation of Court Verdicts and Rulings on 
Criminal Cases, and Court Decisions on Reeducation Through Labor 
and Remold Through Education Under Custody in Accordance With 
the Laws. Last year, procuratorial organs throughout the 
province focused attention on examining and correcting the 
implementation of court rulings and decisions not in accordance 
with the provisions of the law; the use of money to avoid jail 
terms; and the collection of unwarranted fees from reducing a 
penalty, granting parole, and accepting bail on medical reasons. 
They proposed a total of 11,413 opinions on correcting such 
violations of the law. The detention center at Dafeng County 
arbitrarily accepted money for bail and pledges, and released 14 
criminals serving jail terms. After procuratorial organs timely 
proposed their opinion on correction, all the released criminals 
were again taken into custody to serve their jail terms, and all 
the money taken for bail and pledges was returned. Wu Yilin, 
former deputy chief of the Dongtai Public Security Bureau, was 
sentenced to two years' imprisonment for fraudulent practice out 
of personal considerations. Less than two months after he began 
serving his jail term, his penalty was reduced to 11 months. 
After procuratorial organs proposed a correction in accordance 
with the law, the court ruling on the reduction of his penalty 
was annulled. In addition, procuratorial organs in all areas 
placed on file, investigated, and handled criminal cases 
committed by 17 working personnel of custody and remold centers 
involving corruption, taking of bribes, releasing inmates 
without authorization, and subjecting inmates to corporal 
punishment and maltreatment. 
  (3) Improve Procuratorial Work on Civil Cases and 
Cases Involving Administration, and Fulfill the Duty of Legal 
Supervision Over Court Trials on Civil and Administration 
Cases. Throughout the entire year, procuratorial organs 
throughout the province handled a total of 702 appeal cases 
lodged by citizens and legal persons against verdicts and 
rulings given by people's courts on civil cases, economic cases, 
and cases involving administration; placed 163 cases on file for 
investigation; and lodged 16 cases in protest of court verdicts. 
The number of protest cases lodged by the Jiangsu Provincial 
People's Procuratorate alone totaled seven. They made 
suggestions to judicial organs on conducting a trial again, or 
served circulars on correcting law violations; the number of 
such cases totaled 45. While handling protests against verdicts 
given on civil cases and cases involving administration, we also 
paid attention to discovering and investigating favoritism, 
malpractice, the taking of bribes, and the bending of the laws 
committed by judicial personnel in making a court judgment. 
While handling a case on contract disputes, Xu Zhongchen, 
judicial officer of the economic court of the Changzhou 
Intermediate People's Court, abused his power, accepted bribes 
offered by the litigants, and bent the law in making court 
judgments. After having conscientiously conducted a thorough 
investigation of the facts, procuratorial organs lodged a 
protest against the erroneous verdict in accordance with the 
law, meanwhile resolutely investigating Xu Zhongchen's taking of 
bribes and bending the law. 
  4. Procuratorial Organs Safeguarded the Legitimate 
Rights and Interests of Citizens As Well As the Normal Functions 
of State Organs by Earnestly Investigating Cases About "Rights 
Infringements" and Negligence of Duties, As Well As Complaints 
and Petitions 
  Last year, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu established files 
for investigating 618 cases concerning negligence of duty and 
infringement of citizens' democratic rights. That was an 
increase of 5.5 percent over a year previous. By so doing, we 
retrieved economic losses exceeding 95 million yuan. While 
carrying out our assignments, we focused our attention on 
investigating cases of corruption, extortion by torture for 
confession, unlawful detention, malfeasance, and major accidents 
caused by negligence of duty; because of our efforts, the 
prosecution of lawless behavior continued to deepen. It is 
noteworthy that the problem of lawless detention--such as the 
holding of hostages [ren zhi xing fei fa ju jin 0086 6347 0992 
7236 3127 2153 4391]--was still quite conspicuous. Owing to 
disputes over debts, creditors often unlawfully abducted and 
detained the debtors' relatives as hostages. Last year, 
procuratorial organs in Jiangsu established files for 
investigating 53 of 100 cases of this nature, and freed 87 
people held as hostages. Last year, procuratorial organs in 
Jiangsu also established files for investigating 350 major 
accidents caused by negligence of duty. That was 5.9 percent 
over the preceding year; cases of this nature caused 240 million 
yuan of direct economic losses and the death of 335 people. 
  Regarding the investigation of people's complaints as an 
important aspect of safeguarding citizens' legitimate rights and 
interests, Jiangsu's procuratorial organs last year played a 
fairly effective role in this regard by cracking down on crime, 
protecting the innocent, upholding justice, and keeping promises 
they had made to the people. Compared with 1992, the number of 
people's complaints presented either through letters or personal 
visits increased 35.3 percent, totaling 36,940. People were 
particularly eager to report all sorts of crimes. Procuratorial 
organs investigated 17,709 of the 20,890 first-time reports they 
accepted. That was 63.9 percent greater than accepted in 1992. 
Many major cases, serial cases, and unresolved cases were 
cracked because of clues provided by the masses. While 
investigating complaints, procuratorial organs in Jiangsu also 
followed the principle of seeking truth from facts and 
correcting all mistakes, established files for investigating 564 
cases of various complaints, and reinvestigated complaints 
presented by people who disagreed with procuratorial organs' 
decisions not to arrest people they reported and not prosecute 
them. Certain mishandled cases were corrected. Last year, 
procuratorial organs in Jiangsu handled 74 collective petitions 
and 81 letters calling for emergency handling, and calmed 
petitioners and solved the problems in different ways according 
to the circumstances. 
<H5>  5. Stronger Contingents of Procuratorial Personnel Were </H5>
Built, and Police Officers' Political and Professional Qualities 
Were Improved 
  Last year, procuratorates at all levels in Jiangsu, 
upholding 
the principle of building stronger contingents of procuratorial 
personnel while handling day-to-day operations, made new headway 
in building stronger procuratorates and strictly managing 
procuratorial personnel. First of all, we organized police 
officers to study the guidelines of the 14th national party 
congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee, and the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping," thus arming the minds of procuratorial personnel with 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. 
This has heightened their awareness of implementing the party's 
basic lines, and their sense of responsibility and mission in 
discharging their duties and following the correct political 
course under the new situation. Second, we actively carried out 
ideological and political work relevant to the characteristics 
of procuratorial organs, and by so doing we educated 
procuratorial personnel on professional ethics, 
responsibilities, and discipline as well as the need to serve 
the people wholeheartedly. We also carried out competitions for 
excellence, commended advanced units and individuals, and guided 
police officers to wage arduous struggle and be brave to make 
contributions. At one time or another, the provincial 
procuratorate commended units and individuals having 
distinguished themselves in cracking down on crime and 
corruption, and issued a circular urging procuratorial personnel 
to learn from Comrade Ji Zhong, director of the Haimen County 
Procuratorate Office, who selflessly and diligently dedicated 
himself to his work even when he was stricken by cancer. Wuxi's 
procuratorial authorities also launched a series of educational 
activities on comparing contributions and striving to become the 
best. 
  Procuratorial organizations are important forces in the 
fight against corruption, and those organizations themselves are 
considered as key departments which need to be investigated in 
the anticorruption campaign. Last year we seriously made 
efforts to check ourselves in the anticorruption campaign. 
First, we arranged to have leading cadres of procuratorial 
organizations at various levels, especially cadres at and above 
department level, take part in democratic life meetings to check 
if they met with the five requirements set by the party Central 
Committee on self discipline, the three supplementary provisions 
set by this province, and the "10 forbidden things" set by the 
Central Commission on Politics and Law. We checked and corrected 
our behavior against those requirements one by one. We 
conducted positive education for the broad masses of 
procuratorial cadres and policemen. We attached importance to 
the "three rectifications and being strict in three things," 
namely rectifying our ideology and being strict in conducting 
education, rectifying our workstyle and being strict in 
administration, and rectifying discipline and being strict in 
setting demands. On this basis, various procuratorial 
organizations all established and improved rules and regulations 
to ensure honesty in performing official duties. Second, we 
seriously straightened up and corrected the situation of wanton 
collection of fees by using procuratorial power. We 
investigated and rectified all companies and economic entities 
established by procuratorial organizations in the province, and 
adopted measures to close or transfer those companies and 
economic entities. Third, we seriously investigated cases of 
violation of law and discipline by procuratorial workers, and 
made decisions on punishing 17 procuratorial cadres and 
policemen who violated the law and discipline. At the end of 
last year, we also made an all-round investigation on the 
enforcement of law and discipline by procuratoratial 
organizations throughout the province. We corrected and improved 
all problems discovered in the investigation. 
  Fellow deputies: The procuratorates in this province made 
certain achievements in 1993. We gained understanding in the 
following five areas: 
  (1) Serving economic construction is the guiding 
ideology which must be firmly adhered to in carrying out 
procuratorial work. 
  (2) Enforcing law in a strict manner and investigating 
and handling cases in a relentless manner are correct guiding 
policies for promoting the constant improvement of procuratorial 
work. 
  (3) Firmly adhering to the party's leadership is an 
important principle of procuratorial work. 
  (4) Consciously accepting supervision by the people's 
congresses and various circles is a guarantee for enforcement of 
law in a just manner. 
  (5) Persisting in integrating the work of 
procuratorial organizations with the mass line is an effective 
way to improve procuratorial work. 
  Reviewing the work over the past year, we have found that 
there are still shortcomings and problems, although we have made 
some achievements. For example: The ideological understanding 
and methods of work of some procuratorial personnel still cannot 
fully meet the new requirements in the establishment of a 
socialist market economy; a small number of leaders are not 
resolute enough when they meet with difficulties and resistance 
in the enforcement of the law; procuratorial work has been 
carried out unevenly in various places, some locales lack 
effective measures, and their results are not prominent in 
investigating and handling major and serious cases; some places 
cannot promptly investigate and handle clues due to a lack of 
manpower; organizations for handling civil cases are not sound, 
and the progress of their work is slow; and investigative work 
is relatively weak due to backward equipment and facilities, 
lack of funds in handling cases, and other reasons. 
  Fellow deputies, 1994 is crucial to China's reform and 
opening up. It is essential that we have a comprehensive legal 
system to regulate and safeguard the establishment of a sound 
socialist market economic structure. As state organs in charge 
of supervising law enforcement, procuratorates shoulder a major 
responsibility in safeguarding uniform and correct law 
enforcement and in bringing China's law enforcement in line with 
its socialist market economy. Its tasks are heavier and more 
difficult. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee 
and the provincial party committee, and guided by their plans, 
our current struggle against corruption has achieved interim 
success. However, corruption as a social phenomenon in history 
will exist for a long time. Accordingly, the struggle against 
corruption will be a protracted, complicated process. Presently 
the lack of strict law enforcement to crack down on crimes 
exists in varying degrees throughput the province. In some 
economic crimes, investigation has encountered fairly large 
resistance. The masses still have doubts about the struggle 
against corruption. Thus, the drive to crack down on corruption 
and bribery still has a long way to go. Although the situation 
is generally stable as far as public order is concerned, 
destabilizing factors still exist in force. The lack of a good 
social order is still a matter of general concern among the 
masses. Cracking down sternly and swiftly on grave criminal 
offenses remains an important task for procuratorial organs. 
  In 1994, procuratorial organs at all levels in the province 
will earnestly implement the guidelines of the 14th 
National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 
14th CPC Central Committee, as well as those of the national 
conference of chief procurators and the seventh plenary 
(enlarged) session of the eighth provincial party committee; use 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as our guide; uphold the policy of 
"grasping two links simultaneously, attaching equal importance 
to both"; strengthen their role in legal supervision; strictly 
enforce the law; vigorously investigate cases; concentrate 
efforts on cracking major and important cases; deal blows to all 
kinds of criminal activities; protect the citizens' legitimate 
rights and interests; safeguard political and social stability; 
and ensure the establishment and development of a socialist 
market economy. To provide them with an ideological guide 
for this year's work, the provincial procuratorate asks all 
procuratorial organs in the province not to waver in their 
thinking that: 1) procuratorial work shall serve the cause of 
establishing and developing a socialist market economy; 2) 
strict law enforcement and vigorous investigation constitutes 
the heart of procuratorial work; 3) it is necessary to 
strengthen their role in legal supervision and firmly safeguard 
uniform and correct law enforcement; 4) it is necessary to crack 
down on corruption in accordance with the law, and to 
consolidate and develop the fruits of the anticorruption drive; 
and 5) it is necessary to enforce strict discipline within 
procuratorial organs and improve the ranks of procuratorial 
personnel. In day-to- day work, they are asked to take further 
steps in the struggle against corruption in three areas: 1) to 
continue concentrating their efforts on investigating major and 
important cases, particularly important criminal cases involving 
leading cadres; 2) to strengthen law enforcement supervision and 
strictly investigate law-breaking and criminal cases, such as 
failures to strictly enforce the law; and 3) to investigate 
criminal cases involving legal entities.

  [Text] On the morning of 26 April, Zhao Zhihao, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee and governor, gave 
an important speech at the provincial conference on opening to 
the outside world. He mobilized the people at the higher and 
lower levels across the province to further emancipate the mind, 
comprehensively implement the strategy of developing the export- 
oriented economy to bring along the entire economy, accelerate 
the progress of the patternized economy, and create a new 
situation in developing an open economy in Shandong. 
  Jiang Chunyun, secretary of the provincial party committee, 
presided over the conference. 
  Governor Zhao Zhihao's speech was divided into four parts: 
  1. Correctly understand the new situation facing the 
province's opening up and strengthen the sense of urgency of 
developing an open economy. 
  Zhao Zhihao said: Since reform and opening up, particularly 
after the issuance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech 
made during his tour to South China, the whole province has 
witnessed a developed economy, stable political situation, unity 
among the people, and social progress. The entire modernization 
drive has entered a new development period, and fairly big 
breakthroughs have been made in opening to the outside world. 
The province's open economy has begun to embark on the path of 
sustained and rapid development. At present, the new pattern of 
opening up in all directions and to all layers has been 
basically formed in the province; great breakthroughs have been 
made in the development of the export-oriented economy; 
noticeable achievements have been made in developing friendly 
contacts with foreign countries; and opening up has played a 
noticeable role in promoting national economic and social 
development. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Although our province has made 
great achievements in opening to the outside world, we should 
also soberly recognize that compared with advanced provinces and 
cities, we still have disparities. The higher and the lower 
levels across the province should enhance the sense of 
responsibility and urgency, expand their work strength, and 
realistically turn the province's advantages of natural 
resources into advantages of the economy and competition, 
improve quality to promote quantity increase, and enable the 
province's economy to grow from a big one to a even stronger one. 
  2. Comprehensively implement the strategy of developing the 
export-oriented economy to bring along the entire economy and 
form a new advantage for our province's economic development. 
  Zhao Zhihao said: It is necessary to optimize the economic 
structure, cultivate new industrial advantages, accelerate the 
building of market systems, cultivate new market advantages, 
press ahead scientific progress, form new technology and 
personnel advantages, give play to the impetus role of cities, 
strengthen the advantages of central cities, and establish new 
mechanisms by deepening reforms. 
  3. Concentrate efforts on priorities, expand measures, and 
promote a sustained, rapid, and sound development in the open 
economy. 
  Zhao Zhihao said: To comprehensively implement the strategy 
of developing the export-oriented economy to bring along the 
entire economy, we must grasp the key points, pinpoint the 
priorities, strengthen measures, and strive to make new 
breakthroughs as quickly as possible. It is necessary to 
optimize the province's overall plan of opening to the outside 
world, raise the overall quality of opening up, continue to 
implement the strategic policy of opening all parts of the 
province to the outside world, making breakthroughs in some key 
areas, pressing the work ahead step by step, combining the 
efforts of the eastern part of the province with that of the 
western part, accelerating development, stabilize and improve 
the eastern part, accelerate development in the central part, 
and adopt special policies to support the western part. We 
should regard using foreign capital as the most important step 
in the development of the open economy, realistically regard the 
utilization of foreign capital as the key point for stimulating 
national economic growth, and grasp this work firmly. We 
should not be afraid of running an enterprise in the red as long 
as it is in line with the industrial policy of the state, is 
efficient, and is export-oriented; not fear letting foreign 
businessmen hold a big portion of shares in general trades, 
occupy a part of the market, or earn money. We should be bolder 
and give a free hand in inviting business and introducing 
capital. It is necessary to implement the strategy of 
developing various kinds of markets, develop markets at home and 
abroad, give emphasis to turning enterprises into industrialized 
and international enterprise groups, actively develop enterprise 
groups and companies in foreign countries, and persist in 
setting high standards and a high starting point in the course 
of accelerating the development of all sorts of development 
zones. At present, our province has established 62 state-grade 
or provincial-grade development zones of various descriptions. 
In principle, no new development zones will be established in 
the near future. As for those development zones that have been 
approved, we must give different guidance, persist in setting a 
high starting point, and make them have distinctive features. 
It is necessary to strengthen the service systems and 
realistically solve the prominent problems existing in the 
development of the current open economy. 
  4. Further strengthen leadership, form a joint force, and do 
a good job in the battle of opening to the outside world. 
  Zhao Zhihao said: Comprehensively implementing the strategy 
of developing the export-oriented economy to bring along the 
entire economy and accelerating the pace of linking up with the 
international economic track is a new task, as well as a new 
test for our people at all levels. We must further strengthen 
leadership, mobilize the enthusiasm of all trades and 
professions, turn them into a powerful joint force, and 
resolutely fight well this battle of crucial importance. To 
achieve this, we must further emancipate the mind, intensify 
study and research, strengthen external propaganda, do a good 
job in building contingents, and strengthen this joint force. 
  Zhao Zhihao pointed out: Seizing the opportunity, deepening 
reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and 
maintaining stability is the overall situation of this year's 
work. We should properly handle the relations of reform, 
development, and stability, always uphold the principle of 
taking a two-handed approach in work and be tough with both, pay 
simultaneous attention to grasping economic work as well as 
propaganda and ideological work, fighting corruption, and 
promoting honesty. The provincial party committee and the 
government are firmly convinced that as long as the higher and 
the lower levels across the province unswervingly implement all 
central principles and policies on reform, opening up, and 
modernization, promote the spirit of fearing no hardships, are 
unwilling to lag behind, are making earnest efforts to do 
practical things, and are vying to create first-grade 
achievements, we will surely be able to comprehensively create a 
new situation in developing our province's open economy and 
triumphantly fulfill the grand objective of modernization.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 28 (XINHUA)--Chinese teenagers 
nowadays are enjoying a better material life but feeling mental 
pressures earlier than their parents did. 
  This phenomenon has drawn the attention of psychologists and 
educators, who are striving to tackle it. 
  A recent sample survey among 1,200 teenagers in this, 
China's 
largest economic center shows that 28.5 percent feel pressure 
from their studies; some 28 percent said they had trouble in 
building good relations with their teachers and classmates; 13 
percent were involved in love affairs; and 9.3 percent said they 
could not get along with their parents. 
  As China accelerates the process of modernization, it 
requires more and more talented people. To meet this need, the 
courses in primary and middle schools have become much more 
difficult, and schools and parents have set stricter demands on 
school children. 
  "All these things have imposed heavy ideological burdens on 
teenagers, who lack psychological preparation," the psychologist 
explained. 
  A student in grade three of a junior middle school said, "at 
present, I seem to live only for studying, eating and sleeping, 
and this is meaningless." 
  Sharing his feelings, many other students summed up school 
life as "living in a cage". 
  The contrast between the complex social reality and the 
ideal 
school ethical education is an important factor in teenagers' 
problems. 
  A middle school student said, "even if I enter a university, 
how much can I earn after graduation?" 
  Another grade two student in a middle school felt that "it 
is 
difficult to find a real friend". 
  Some parents estrange their children by refusing to confide 
in them. In addition, divorce and gambling cause young people 
to feel repugnance for their parents. 
  It is natural for teenagers to feel puzzled during puberty, 
according to psychologists, who have called on the whole of 
society, teachers and parents in particular, to help young 
people solve their psychological problems. 
  At present, Shanghai has a number of hotlines and special 
letter boxes as well as psychological consultancy stations 
specially for teenagers. 
  A survey shows that a letter box specially for youth has 
received more than 1,000 letters from young people since it 
opened here last year. 
  More than 30 teenagers have given up the idea of committing 
suicide, running away from their families or injuring others 
after receiving advice from psychologists and counselors 
specialising in work among teenagers. 
  Shanghai's Qinghua Middle School has made progress in this 
regard in form of heart-to-heart talks with students and helping 
them analyze the situation in present-day society. 
  Xu Zhixi, deputy head of the school, said, "the fundamental 
task of a school is to train students to adapt and contribute 
themselves to society. So if they have problems the school must 
do its utmost to help them." 
  Feng Enhong, head of Shanghai's Jianping Middle School, 
strongly opposed the training of students to be "examination 
machines" and the extension of class hours. 
  He encouraged teachers to improve their teaching methods and 
make their classes more interesting and relevant to modern 
problems.

<F P=106> [Government work report delivered by Zhejiang Governor Wan </F>
Xueyuan at the Second Session of the Eighth Zhejiang Provincial 
People's Congress on 26 February 1994] 
  [Text] Fellow deputies: 
  Please examine the government work report I am going to give 
on behalf of the provincial people's government. I would also 
like to ask members of the provincial committee of the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference and other observers 
at this meeting to present their views. 
<H5>  1. A Review of Work Accomplished in 1993 </H5>
  The year 1993 was one in which Zhejiang seized opportunities 
to speed up its development. It was also a year in which 
Zhejiang was able to maintain a steady economic growth while 
intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control. Under the 
leadership of the party Central Committee, the State Council, 
and the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee, we achieved new 
successes in all sectors, thanks to following the guidelines 
laid down in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks and those 
of the 14th national party congress and the resolution of the 
first session of the provincial people's congress, as well as 
the efforts exerted by people throughout Zhejiang. We enjoyed 
fast economic growth, social prosperity and progress, and 
political unity and stability. Most of the objectives set in 
our economic and social development plan were fulfilled and 
overfulfilled. The gross domestic output is expected to 
increase 25 percent over that of 1992, reaching 164.5 billion 
yuan. The objective of quadrupling the gross industrial and 
agricultural output was achieved seven years ahead of time. 
  In 1993, Zhejiang maintained a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic growth, giving priority to strengthening the 
agricultural foundation, improving industrial efficiency, 
opening up the economic sector to the outside, building stronger 
infrastructures, and improving financial and banking 
operations 
  -- Zhejiang's agriculture and rural economy withstood severe 
tests caused by the removal of controls over grain buying and 
marketing prices, and our province used this as an opportunity 
to speed up agricultural restructuring. Agricultural projects 
which emphasized efficient and high yield of quality 
agricultural products developed. The rural areas' primary, 
secondary, and tertiary industries all enjoyed growth. The 
development of village and town enterprises reached a higher 
level. The proportion of the province's village and town 
enterprises increased to 65 percent from the previous 56 percent 
in Zhejiang's industry, and their sales increased 76.21 percent 
over that a year before, reaching 238.952 billion yuan. 
  -- The province's industrial production became more 
efficient 
while maintaining its rapid growth. It is expected that the 
added value of industry will be 40 percent higher than that of 
1992, reaching 87 billion yuan. Those industrial enterprises, 
which are operated by townships and larger areas and which are 
authorized to have independent accounting, succeeded in 
increasing their output, sales, and profit taxes at the same 
time by 46.9, 52, and 42.5 percent, respectively, over 1992. 
Enterprises also accelerated the pace of upgrading their 
technology. Their technology and equipment are now better as a 
result of their investment of 12.4 billion yuan, an amount which 
exceeded that of 1992 by more than 100 percent. 
  -- New successes in opening up our economic sector were 
achieved with progress made in developing foreign trade, using 
foreign capital, and promoting foreign economic relations. The 
province's exports increased 19.9 percent over 1992, reaching 
$4.439 billion; and the province's growth in ordinary trade and 
the volume of exports handled by cities, prefectures, and 
counties themselves ranked top in the country. Last year, the 
province approved the establishment of 4,487 foreign-funded 
enterprises; new agreements were signed on the utilization of 
$3.746 billion of foreign capital, and the amount of foreign 
capital actually used during the year was $1.033 billion, 
topping those of 1992 by 191.9 and 128.8 percent, respectively. 
The absolute values of both exceeded the total amounts 
registered in the preceding 14-year period. Noticeable 
progress was achieved in promoting foreign economic and 
technical cooperation, as well as in developing international 
tourism. 
  -- More efforts have been made in improving the 
infrastructure, with key construction projects going on 
smoothly. The investment in state-owned fixed assets reached 60 
billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 66.2 percent over the 
previous year. The Xiaoshan power station's 125,000 kw 
generating units, the Nantaitou water control gate project in 
the Hangjia Hu, and 10 other key construction projects have been 
put into operation, with good economic results. Construction of 
the Jinwen railway, the Hangyong superhighway, a 200,000-tonnage 
ore berth in Beilun Harbor, and other major projects is in full 
swing. Postal services and telecommunications are in a leading 
role for the whole nation. Eight optical fiber lines have been 
built and are now on a trial run. Program-controlled and 
cellular telephone service is now available in all counties and 
cities. Particularly, the investment system has been improved 
in accordance with the principle that each locality is 
responsible for seeking investment funds for itself, building 
projects for itself, managing projects for itself, and paying 
back loans itself. As a result, substantial progress has been 
made in transportation construction. Last year witnessed the 
largest investment in transportation construction, with an 
initial estimate of 2.52 billion yuan including 1.02 billion 
yuan of self-funded investment. New progress has been made in 
water conservancy projects, with the state, collectives, and 
peasants having put in 900 million yuan of investment and 360 
million work hours. Urban construction and renovation have been 
accelerated by implementing a system for the transfer of 
state-owned land-use rights with compensation, promoting 
commercialization of housing projects, and attracting peasants' 
investment for undertakings in cities. 
  -- The financial and banking situation has been improved, 
with urban and rural markets enjoying prosperity. Zhejiang's 
fiscal income reached 16.665 billion yuan in 1993, representing 
an increase of 38.6 percent over the previous year and 128.2 
percent of its annual budget. Deposits in banking institutions 
at the end of 1993 increased by 27.982 billion yuan, with 12.82 
billion yuan coming from urban and rural residents' savings. 
Urban and rural markets enjoy brisk business, with an ample 
supply of commodities. The total retail sales of consumptxion 
commodities reached 67.837 billion yuan, an increase of 37.4 
percent over previous year. While the economic situation 
improved, people enjoyed a better living standard. Urban 
residents' per capita living expense income reached 3,371, while 
peasants' per capita net income was 1,746, respectively, 
representing an increase of 15 percent and 10.3 percent after 
adjusted for inflation. 
  In 1993, Zhejiang did a great deal of work in carrying 
out macroeconomic control, promoting reform and opening, and 
developing scientific, technological, and educational 
undertakings by centering around the work of creating a fine 
economic environment and invigorating the national economy. 
  (1) Uphold the principle of proceeding from the actual 
situation in Zhejiang and conscientiously carrying out the 
central authorities' major decision concerning the improvement 
of macro-economic control. 
  On the basis of studying the guiding spirit of the central 
authorities and unifying ideological understanding, we have 
consolidated financial order and enforced financial discipline 
to deal with some new problems cropping up during the course of 
rapid economic growth. We have concentrated our efforts to 
ensure the construction of major projects and strengthened 
control over investment in fixed assets. More efforts have been 
made to improve financial and taxation management and curtail 
financial deficits. The management of real estate markets has 
been strengthened and various kinds of development zones have 
been consolidated and standardized. Positive results have been 
achieved in macroeconomic control. The financial situation is 
increasingly stable. Financial and taxation order are gradually 
being standardized. The investment scale is under control and 
the investment structure was improved. Zhejiang does not issue 
"iou" slips for the purchase of main farm and nonstaple 
products. Funds for key construction projects and circulating 
funds for enterprises can be obtained fairly easily. 
  When enforcing macroeconomic regulation and control 
measures, we took Zhejiang's actual conditions into 
consideration, paid attention to applying proper force in 
implementing macroeconomic regulation and control measures and 
to carrying out in-depth reform to solve economic problems. 
This helped maintain the momentum of a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the province's economy. With a view to 
bringing about new growth in other economic sectors and to 
steping up building a reserve force for development, we 
conducted study on and worked out arrangements for urban 
construction, exploitation of marine resources, development of 
hilly areas, and for rendering support to poor households in old 
revolutionary bases, in regions inhabited by minorities, and in 
remote areas. We mapped out development plans for transport and 
power supply. We also strove to improve the economic setup and 
to readjust the industrial structure. 
<H5>  (2) Constantly Promote Reform and Opening Up To Build a </H5>
Socialist Market Economic System 
  The provincial government formulated and promulgated rules 
to 
implement the "Regulations on the Transformation of the 
Management System of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises." We 
returned autonomy rights to enterprises. To promote enterprise 
reform in depth and breadth, we sought a breakthrough by 
reforming the property rights system. The shareholding system 
was tried out in a number of large and medium-sized state and 
collective-owned enterprises. The shareholding cooperative 
system was promoted on a large scale at collective enterprises 
in urban and rural areas. Measures were taken to step up 
experiments with leasing, mergers, auctions, and bankruptcy at 
small industrial and commercial enterprises. Foreign investment 
helped transform the management systems of some 800 enterprises. 
Some 200 new enterprise groups were formed through mergers and 
share acquisition. 
  Steps were taken to accelerate the pace of building up and 
improving various market systems. A large number of specialized 
retail markets emerged throughout the province. There were 107 
retail markets in the province, with eah one's annual business 
turnover reaching over 100 million yuan; ten of them even 
exceeded 1 billion yuan. Of the plan to organize the 
establishment of 12 provincial-level large scale markets for 
means of production at the beginning of the year, 9 became 
operational. Labor and real estate markets developed rapidly. 
While fostering market systems, the province stepped up market 
management, cracked down on fake and shoddy goods, checked 
unfair competition, and put some irregular market practices 
under control. 
  Reform of the social security system was carried out in 
depth. A system requiring administrative employees and workers 
to contribute premiums to a pension insurance fund was put in 
place in the province. An integrated pension system was 
promoted among administrative employees and workers at urban and 
rural enterprises and among private businessmen in Wenzhou and 
Taizhou. A total of 32 counties and cities were selected to 
experiment with a pension system for farmers. Unemployment 
insurance was extended to cover administrative employees and 
workers at urban and rural enterprises. Approved by the 
provincial government, cities and counties in the province began 
implementing the housing system reform plan. Progress was made 
in reforming the public health care system at government organs, 
institutions, and enterprises. 
  Government functions were transformed and macromanagement 
mechanisms were reformed. The province basically lifted control 
on the prices of agricultural and industrial products. 
Mandatory plans for agricultural and industrial production and 
for the distribution sector were scrapped. To meet the 
requirements of the nation's efforts to reform the macroeconomic 
system, the province reformed its finance, monetary, invesment, 
foreign trade, and state-assets management systems by taking 
Zhejiang's actual situation into consideration. The province 
also formulated an implementation program for reform of 
provincial-level government organs. 
  Rural reform was further deepened. Controls on grain 
procurement and marketing prices were lifted. A shareholding 
cooperative system was developed. Large-scale operation was 
cautiously promoted. Support was given to develop the 
"locomotive" enterprises. The socialized service system was 
improved. Pilot poverty-shedding programs were conducted. 
Moves were taken to enhance the reserve strength of the rural 
economy. 
  The province strove to open itself wider to the outside 
world. Approved by the State Council, the province set up the 
Hangzhou and Xiaoshan state-level economic and technological 
development zones and embarked on the Daxie Island comprehensive 
development project. On the basis of rectification, 
consolidation, and standardization, the provincial government 
newly approved a number of provincial- level economic 
development zones. We also sponsored several large scale trade 
fairs, expanded cooperation and increased exchanges with foreign 
countries, and achieved some fruitful results. 
  (3) Actively Implement the Strategy of Using Science 
and Education To Invigorate the Province and Make Scientic and 
Technological Education Better Serve Economic Construction 
  To reform the scientific and technological system, establish 
a technological market, and encourage scientific and 
technological progress, the provincial government worked out a 
number of strategic documents; localities also adopted 
corresponding measures to coordinate with the provincial 
government. This helped further mobilize the enthusiasm of 
scientists and technicians and enhanced scientific research 
units' development capability and their capability to better 
serve economic construction. The technological market saw rapid 
development and the technological trade amount increased by 
leaps and bounds. The province achieved new progress in 
tackling scientific problems, implementing the Torch Plan, the 
Spark plan, developing new and high technologies, and in 
transforming traditional industries. A total of 297 scientific 
and technological items won provincial-level scientific and 
technological progress awards, and 49 items won spark prizes. 
The province reaped great benefits from the application of a 
number of scientific and technological results in production. 
  New progress was achieved in the steady implementation of 
the 
"Program for Reform and Development of China's Education," in 
further defining the idea and goals for education reform and 
development, in deepening reform of the educational system, in 
readjusting eduational and teaching structures, in relying on 
society to run schools, in increasing investment in education, 
and in improving teachers' quality. The nine-year-compulsory 
education was extended to 74.5 percent of villages and townships 
which encompassed 83.1 percent of the province's population. 
Some 96,000 young and middle-aged people were taught to read 
and write. The province certified that 17 counties and cites 
(districts) had basically practised the nine-year-compulsory 
education and basically eliminated illiteracy among young and 
middle-aged people. Enrollment at various types of middle-level 
vocational schools and at ordinary high schools increased 37.6 
percent and 31 percent, respectively, from the previous year. 
We also provided 4 million people with various types of 
on-the-job training. 
  While accelerating the pace of economic development 
last year, the province stressed the policy of "promoting the 
reform and opening up with one hand and cracking down on severe 
crimes with the other and of placing equal emphasis on both" and 
enhanced socialist spiritual civilization building, democratic 
legal system building, and government administration 
improvement 
  We conscientiously implemented the "Program To Promote 
Spiritual Civilization Building in Zhejiang," extensively 
carried out the drive to promote spiritual civilization building 
and to spread the guidelines set forth at the 14th CPC National 
Congress among the masses. The drive to crack down on 
pornography was carried out in earnest. Efforts to build and 
enhance management over cultural market were made. We saw the 
production of excellent artistic works and publication of a 
number of good books. Construction of cultural facilities was 
stepped up. The building of the new Zhejiang Museum was 
completed. The Yuyaohe Mudu Museum and the Zhejiang Natural 
Museum were open to the public. The Shanghang radio and 
satellite television station was completed and became 
operational. Provincial-level radio and television programs 
could be tuned in and received in 41 countries and regions. 
Sports became more popular with the masses. The province's 
athletes won 55 gold medals at major domestic and foreign sports 
meets. Some 10 demonstrative counties passed state inspection 
on implementing primary-level public healthcare plan. Public 
health conditions in urban and rural areas improved. Greater 
efforts were exerted to prevent and immunize against local 
diseases, job-related diseases, and infectious diseases. 
Various social sectors attached greater importance to family 
planning and to environmental protection. The province's 
natural population growth rate stood at 7.03 percent. Regions 
which used to be weak in family planning work showed 
improvement. The target responsiblity system for environmnetal 
protection was better implemented. Steps were also taken to 
strengthen construction in urban and rural areas. Remedial 
efforts were taken to deal with major pollution cases. 
  The Zhejiang Provincial People's Government has 
conscientiously accepted supervision from the Zhejiang 
Provincial People's Congress and promptly reported to the 
people's congress and its standing committee on major issues 
during the course of economic and social development. The 
Zhejiang Provincial People's Government has supported the 
Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference in carrying out its fundamental 
functions of political consultation and democratic supervision 
and listened to opinions expressed by provincial committees of 
all democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry 
and Commerce in their participation in the administration and 
discussion of state affairs. In its effort to accelerate the 
administrative legislature, the provincial government has 
submitted to the provincial people's congress standing committee 
eight regional regulation drafts and promulgated 11 regional 
administrative provisions and regulations. We have done a great 
deal to improve all facets of public security and launched a 
drive to eliminate social evils and severely punish offenders of 
various criminal and economic crimes. The government has 
strengthened efforts in publicizing the legal system and in 
promoting law dissemination awareness. Great progress has also 
been made in the work concerning religious affairs, nationality 
affairs, foreign affairs, overseas Chinese affairs, and Taiwan 
affairs. Extensive efforts have been made to launch campaigns 
such as supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to 
the families of revolutionary soldiers, supporting the 
government and loving the people, as well as joint construction 
between the army, the police, and the people. We have 
energetically promoted national defense education and 
strengthened border and coastal control. We have 
conscientiously carried out the work concerning conscription, 
arranging new jobs or living places for retired soldiers, 
training of reserve militia, and arming the people. As a 
result, relations between the army, the government, and the 
people have become even closer. 
  In accordance with the unified planing of the central and 
provincial CPC committees, we have conducted a thoroughgoing 
anticorruption campaign. Leading cadres at all levels have 
conducted self-inspection and self-correction in accordance with 
the five regulations for promoting integrity and 
self-discipline. All supervision organs in Zhejiang have 
registered and investigated 464 corruption cases. As a result, 
346 people have been given the punishment of political 
discipline. The provincial government has canceled 310 
irrational charges and fees and conducted a special supervision 
and inspection to alleviate peasants' burdens. Relevant 
departments of city, prefectural, and county as well as 
provincial levels have also canceled a batch of irrational 
charges and fees. Efforts have been made to check whether 
governmental organizations have engaged in business operations 
or running enterprises. Problems such as abusing power and 
monopolizing business operations have been checked. The 
practices of accepting gifts in the forms of money or valuable 
certificates have been basically stopped. While conducting the 
anticorruption campaign, we have also emphasized the importance 
of diligently attending to government affairs and cherishing the 
people as well as that of earnest work. To achieve these goals 
and carry out the major tasks for each developmental stage as 
put forward in the government work report adopted by the First 
Session of the Eighth Provincial People's Congress, we have 
assigned specific localities and departments to accomplish 
specific tasks. We have conducted routine inspections and 
supervision on these tasks. 
  Fellow deputies, Zhejiang's economic development and 
achievements in various undertakings over the past year have not 
been easily won. On behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial People's 
Government, I would like to express my sincere thanks to 
workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres, PLA personnel, and 
armed police as well as to all friends at home and abroad who 
are concerned about and support Zhejiang's undertakings. 
  While affirming the achievements, we should also 
soberly understand that deep-seated structural problems in our 
economic system are still outstanding. Many problems also exist 
in our social life. With a poor agricultural foundation, 
the comparative economic performance for grain production has 
dropped. Serious phenomena, such as unauthorized use of 
farmland for nonagricultural purposes and leaving farmland 
unplowed, led to less production of grain, cotton, and 
oil-bearing seeds in 1993, as compared with the previous year. 
Industrial enterprises are relatively poor in their ability to 
adapt to the changes in the outer environment. Some enterprises 
produce poor economic results because their circulating funds 
cannot be retrieved promptly. Commodity price increases came 
too fast, resulting an increase of 16.7 percent over the 
previous year. The supply and demand of daily necessities, 
mainly "vegetable basket" commodities, experienced a fairly 
great fluctuation. As a result, some people's living conditions 
have been affected. The contradiction between the construction 
scale and the supply of capital is very serious. Bottleneck 
problems in transportation, energy, and other aspects are still 
very serious. Scientific, technological, educational, cultural, 
public health, sports, and other undertakings cannot meet the 
needs of economic development and the people's livelihood. 
Unstable factors still exist in our social life, with some 
localities having poor public security conditions. 
  There are still weak links in the work of the government. 
In the course of replacing the old system with a new one, the 
government has failed to keep up with the developing situation 
in the fields of organizational setup, management system, 
thinking and concepts, and work style. Some departments and 
units have lacked a strong concept of service, and their work 
efficiency is low. The unhealthy tendencies and corruptive 
practices among some functionaries have affected the close ties 
between the government and the people. We must pay close 
attention to these problems and be serious in solving them. 
<H5>  2. Major Tasks and Work in 1994 </H5>
  Nineteen ninety-four is a crucial year for deepening the 
reform and is also an important year for maintaining the growth 
momentum of the national economy. This year, the general 
requirements of government work are, under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, to implement 
in an all-around way the guidelines of the 14th CPC National 
Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee; to implement the guidelines of the ninth provincial 
party congress; to accelerate the building of a socialist market 
economic structure; to strive to realize sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development of the national economy and all-round social 
progress; and to basically fulfill Zhejiang's Eighth Five- Year 
Plan one year ahead of schedule. 
  Seizing opportunities, deepening the reform, opening wider 
to 
the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability remain the important parts of our work this year. 
Economic development is the center of all work; reform and 
opening to the outside world is a strong motive force for 
stimulating development; development is the foundation for 
political and social stability, and maintaining social stability 
is an indispensable condition for economic development and the 
smooth progress of reform. We must correctly handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability. The 
three should coordinate with and promote one another to ensure 
that all tasks are done well. 
  In accordance with the requirements mention above, this year 
we plan to increase the gross provincial product by 12 percent 
over that of 1992, of which primary industry will increase 2.8 
percent; secondary industry, 15 percent; and tertiary industry, 
over 12 percent. Investment in fixed assets will go up 20 
percent; total sales of consumer goods, 22 percent; exports, 12 
percent; annual inflation will be kept under 12 percent; and the 
natural population growth rate will be around 8.39 per 1,000. 
<H5>  (1) Quicken the Pace of Reform and Acclerate in an </H5>
All-Around Way the Building of a Socialist Market Economic System 
  The following are the main points of the reform of the 
economic structure this year: First, we will deepen reform of 
the enterprise system; seond, we will accelerate reform of the 
system of macroeconomic control. In coordination with this 
reform, we will advance the building of a market system with 
priority on the building of markets for important means of 
production, and push forward the reform of the social security 
system. 
  We will strive to explore effective ways and methods of 
building a modern enterprise system; continue to implement the 
"Enterprise Law," the "Regulations on Transforming the Operating 
Mechanisms of Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People," 
and the "Implementation Rules" formulated by the province; give 
enterprises greater decisionmaking power; and guide enterprises 
to deepen their labor, personnel, and wage reform. We will 
strengthen supervision over and management of state-owned assets 
and strive to preserve and increase their value; focus on reform 
of the system of property rights in enterprises, and clearly 
define property rights relationships, and strive to make 
breakthrough progress in this respect. We will actively 
encourage large and medium enterprises to form limited liability 
companies whose stocks are owned by several legal entities; 
expand experiments in forming shareholding limited companies; 
rationalize the property rights relations in collective 
enterprises, especially town and village enterprises; and 
popularize the shareholding cooperative system. For small 
state-owned and collective enterprises, we will, in line with 
different conditions, accelerate the introduction of the methods 
of leasing, auctioning, merging, and bankruptcy. We will 
continue to form, in a planned way, inter-regional and 
intertrade enterprise groups with large and medium enterprises 
as the core; encourage qualified enterprise groups to develop 
into transnational corporations; and encourage various areas to 
conduct experiments and exploration in changing the operating 
mechanisms of enterprises. 
  We should earnestly reform the 
financial, banking, and investment system. In accordance with 
the principles of fairness, norms, and simplicity and 
convenience, we should adjust the financial relations between 
the province and cities, prefectures, or counties rationally; 
establish a financial management system on the basis of the 
system of tax distribution; double our efforts in levying and 
controlling tax revenues; and crack down on tax evasion and 
fraud and refusal to pay taxes. Financial organs at various 
levels should adhere to the principles of keeping expenditures 
within the limits of income and acting in accordance with their 
capacities; strictly control financial expenditures; and strive 
to keep a balance between financial revenue and expenditure. We 
should support people's banks in tightening their supervision 
and management over financial institutions and banking 
activities according to law; support and help specialized banks 
change to commercial banks step by step; step up the 
construction of credit cooperatives in rural and urban areas; 
create conditions for establishing cooperative banks in urban 
and rural areas; and win over national commercial banks, 
policy-related banks, and regional commercial banks to set up 
branches in Zhejiang. We should further administer and develop 
such nonbanking institutions as insurance and stock companies; 
operate and manage different trades separately; perfect and 
oversee cooperative funds in rural areas; and earnestly guide 
nongovernmental investment. We should deepen reform of the 
investment system; define the principal part of investment by 
differentiating investment in competing projects from that in 
infrastructural and social welfare projects; implement a 
corporate responsibility system for a key project under 
construction in an all-around manner; establish a risk 
responsibility system of corporate investment and bank credit 
step by step; strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control 
over the volume and structure of investment; and avoid acting 
blindly. 
  We should make great efforts to develop a market system. In 
accordance with the principles of uniformity, openness, 
competition, and orderliness, we should double our efforts in 
planning and managing the building of markets. While 
consolidating, perfecting, and improving the consumer goods 
markets, we should give the establishment and development of 
various production-factors markets strategic importance. We 
should further develop the interbank borrowing and lending 
network; earnestly expand the stock markets; establish interbank 
foreign exchange markets; develop the property rights markets in 
a planned way; help liquidate assets and increase asset value; 
continue to construct a large-scale capital goods market; 
further develop labor, technology, real estate, and information 
markets; strive to build futures markets in line with domestic 
and international demands; and develop and perfect brokerage 
organizations for various markets. We should improve and 
strengthen management and supervision over markets; perfect 
market rules; put an end to illicit competition; punish such 
illegal activities as production and sale of fake and shoddy 
products, cheating, and monopolizing strictly according to law; 
maintain market order; and protect the legitimate interests of 
operators and consumers. 
  We should continue to reform the social security system and 
the housing system in cities and towns. We should popularize 
the procedures for integrating social pensions and social 
security; perfect the unemployment insurance system; and expand 
unemployment insurance coverage. In the prerequisite of 
ensuring basic medical care for workers, we should continue to 
study and reform public health services and the labor insurance 
system. We should promote the sale, leasing, and construction 
of housing simultaneously while concentrating on the sale of 
public housing; accelerate housing construction in cities and 
towns, especially the construction of housing for those who have 
housing difficulties and residential housing construction with 
marginal profits; and help commercialize residential housing. 
  While strengthening the public sector of the economy, all 
localities in the province should continue their efforts to 
attract foreign investment, actively encourage the development 
of the individual and private economy, and seriously guide and 
administer these sectors of the economy to ensure their healthy 
development. Governments at all levels should treat all 
enterprises equally and create an environment for them to 
compete in the market on an equal footing. 
  This is a year in which we have published more reform 
measures, and there are both a great momentum and great 
difficulties in various reforms. We must strengthen leadership 
over reforms, strive to make overall progress while making 
breakthroughs in selected aspects, and carry out various reforms 
in a more coordinated way. Attention should be paid to studying 
the feasibility of reform plans. While supporting bold 
exploratory reforms in various localities, we should also pay 
attention to reducing risks and promote reforms in a steady and 
safe way. We should adhere to a mass line; wholeheartedly rely 
on the working class; give full play to the initiative and 
creativity of workers, peasants, intellectuals, cadres and other 
working people; and ensure a smooth proceeding of all reform 
measures. 
<H5>  (2) Open Up Wider to the Outside World and Vigorously </H5>
Develop an Export-Oriented Economy 
  Zhejiang has a relatively high degree of market economy and 
a 
relatively better foundation of opening up. We should take full 
advantage of this strong point to open the province to the 
outside even wider and deeper and to a higher degree. We should 
make better use of both international and domestic markets and 
both foreign and Chinese resources, take an active part in 
international economic cooperation and division of labor, and 
accelerate the process of making our economic structure and 
operational mechanisms compatible with the international 
economic and international market. 
  In support of the development and opening up of [Shanghai's] 
Pudong, we should take the further step of improving the 
province's opening arrangements. In opening up the province to 
the outside world, we should bring into full play the leading 
role of the coastal open cities of Ningbo and Wenzhou, the 
international tourism city Hangzhou, and the economic 
development zones. In particular, we should support Ningbo in 
accelerating its comprehensive reform according to the demands 
of the state. Its reform should lead to opening up wider and 
provide some experience for the whole province to learn from. 
We will urge the State Council to give a prompt approval for 
Wenling and some other counties and cities to become coastal 
open economic zones so that a longer stretch of coastal area is 
open to the outside world. We should accelerate the development 
of the areas along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railroad and the Jinhua- 
Wenzhou railroad, as well as border cities and counties, and 
open up Zhejiang's central and western parts wider to the 
outside. 
  We should actively and effectively use foreign capital. We 
should pay attention to guiding foreign investment into desired 
fields and reserve the proper projects for foreign investors. 
We should encourage foreign investment in basic industries, 
such as energy sources and raw and processed materials 
industries, in developmental agriculture and export-oriented 
agriculture, in transforming conventional industries, in the 
development of high- technological industries, in tourism, and 
in the tertiary industry which directly serves production and 
the people's livelihood. We should encourage the establishment 
of more foreign-funded banks and conduct an experiment on 
allowing foreign-funded retail enterprises. While continuing to 
attract investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, we should 
make more efforts to invite investors from Europe, the United 
States, Japan, the ROK, and Southeast Asian nations. We should 
try in every possible way to attract more investment by foreign 
consortiums and large enterprises and strive to enlarge the 
scale and raise the technological level of foreign investment. 
To obtain more outside investment, we should give full play to 
the positive role of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots; 
overseas Chinese compatriots; and Zhejiang's organizations 
abroad. We should further improve the investment environment 
and make great efforts to accelerate infrastructural 
construction, improve policies and legislation, simplify 
administrative procedures, provide better services, and raise 
the quality of workers and staff members. We should administer 
foreign-funded enterprises according to the law and protect 
their legitimate rights and interests and their legitimate 
production and business activities. We should see to it that 
they put their capital into operation and start operations on 
time according to contract. We should urge them to raise their 
foreign exchange earnings and economic efficiency. 
  We should concentrate on running well the development zones 
of various categories. We should persist in making scientific 
and rational plans, promote development with good projects, set 
high standards for construction, raise the efficiency of 
development, and step up the infrastructural construction and 
the work of inviting investors for the development zones. The 
Ningbo, Wenzhou, Hangzhou and Xiaoshan economic and 
technological development zones, the Hangzhou high-technological 
industrial development zone, and the Zhijiang tourism district 
have entered the stage of inviting investors and large-scale 
construction. The Ningbo bonded zone has been put into 
operation. We are assisting in formulating the overall 
development plan for Daxie Island. By formulating and improving 
the procedures for managing the provincial-level development 
zones, we have been performing a standardized management of the 
development zones and appraising them according to their actual 
performances. 
  We will maintain the good foreign trade development trend. 
Proceeding from unifying foreign exchange rates, we will make 
positive efforts to transform foreign trade enterprises' 
operating mechanisms; strive to win foreign trade rights for 
more cities, counties, enterprises engaging in both production 
and marketing, and research units; encourage the three kinds of 
partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises to increase 
exports; and further ensure that the province earns more foreign 
exchange by exporting products of various categories. We will 
step up efforts to integrate marketing operations with 
industrial production, marketing operations with agricultural 
production, and marketing operations with technological 
development. We will quicken the step of establishing foreign 
trade-based enterprise groups and export production bases, with 
the aim of establishing more enterprise groups and of making our 
enterprises more industry-based and internationalized. We will 
practice the development strategy of diversifying our markets 
and winning customers with our good-quality products. We will 
step up efforts to keep track of and study international market; 
to improve our export product mix; improve the quality, grades, 
and efficiency of our export products; and increase exports and 
foreign exchange earnings. 
  We will extensively promote foreign economic and 
technological exchange and cooperation, will further broaden the 
scope of foreign labor cooperation and project contracting, 
introduce more technologies and intellectual resources from 
outside the country, and take various measures to develop 
international tourism. We will endeavor to properly manage 
enterprises invested by companies outside the country, establish 
and refine regulations for managing these enterprises, and 
improve management of them. We will step up exchanges and 
cooperation with our sister cities and look for new ways to 
strengthen foreign economic and technological exchange and 
cooperation. 
  While broadening the scope of opening up to the outside 
world, we will establish closer ties with central government 
departments and fraternal provinces and municipalities, promote 
economic cooperation in various forms with them, and encourage 
mutual support between counterpart departments of the Zhejiang 
and central government departments and counterpart departments 
of our fraternal provinces and municipalities, in order to 
benefit each other and to achieve common prosperity. 
<H5>  (3) Strengthen the Agricultural Base To Bring About a </H5>
Bumper Agricultural, Especially Grain, Harvest 
  Agriculture is a fundamental issue affecting the overall 
situation. Governments at all levels must place agriculture on 
the top of their economic work; top leaders of all localities 
must personally take charge of and assume overall responsibility 
for agricultural work; agricultural work should be used as a 
major criterion for evaluating leaders' performance. While 
decontrolling the purchase and marketing prices of grain, and 
while developing "good-quality, high-yield, and 
highly-efficient" agriculture and making agriculture more 
market-oriented, we should take comprehensive economic and legal 
means and necessary administrative measures to further protect 
and support and to improve macroeconomic management of the 
agriculture to ensure that it develops continuously and peasant 
incomes increase steadily. 
  To step up agricultural production, we must first ensure the 
production of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. Grain is a 
special commodity that affects the national economy and the 
people's livelihood, as well as a strategic material that 
affects social stability; therefore, we must always pay close 
attention to grain production -- an issue affecting the overall 
situation -- and ensure that the grain production areage, grain 
output, and grain stock are maintained at certain levels. We 
should ensure that the principle "be self-sufficient in grain 
supply, regulate surplus grain, and ship in grain to make up for 
grain shortages" is truly carried out, and that the province's 
total grain output is maintained at about 15 million tonnes. 
According to the law, we will resolutely prevent farmland from 
being left unused, and strictly prohibit farmland, especially 
grain fields, from being used for growing perennial crops to 
maintain our grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops production 
capabilities. We will refine the contract purchasing system; 
appropriately increase the grain purchase prices and the 
contract purchase prices of cotton; refine the system of 
establishing grain risk funds and the system of adjusting grain 
stock; establish a system for maintaining a stock of major 
agricultural capital goods; support the efforts of major grain, 
cotton, and oil-bearing crops production areas to increase 
production and to promote value-adding processing of 
agricultural products; improve relative agricultural production 
efficiency; and rally peasants' production enthusiasm. 
Currently, we should particularly ensure that the decided early 
rice growing acreage is fully planted with the crop and early 
rice is properly taken care of. We will strive to expand the 
acreage of spring corn, spring soybeans, and vegetables, and 
ensure the supply of farming materials, to lay a good foundation 
for reaping a bumper agricutural harvest this year. 
  In addition to making efforts to stabilize grain 
production, we actively provided guidance to farmers and 
encouraged them to readjust the agricultural production 
structure; to grow nongrain crops and cash crops; to develop 
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline products, and fisheries; 
and to increase the effective supply of farm produce and its 
added value. We persisted in relying on science to develop 
agriculure. We helped stabilize the ranks of farm technology 
teams and improved their services in rural areas; stepped up 
efforts to popularize advanced agricultural technologies and to 
introduce technologies suitable for rural areas; encouraged 
farmers to grow excellent strains of early rice; and offered 
good prices to procure quality grains. We spared no efforts in 
increasing investment in agriculture. Expenditures provided by 
the province's budget in support of farming production rose by 
10 percent over the previous year. While striving to control 
the extension of new loans at the previous year's level, banks 
in the province still managed to increase the proportion of 
loans for agriculture. Fees were collected across the province 
for setting up a special water conservancy fund. A special land 
development fund was set up with fees collected from land 
leasing and from granting of land-use rights. We improved the 
mechanisms of "industry supporting agricultural development" and 
of "agricultural sectors extending mutual support to each 
other." We made sure that the agricultural development fund 
contributed to by village and township enterprises would always 
be in place. Farmers and economic organizations in rural areas 
were mobilized to try various ways to increase investment in 
agriculture. We built and repaired irrigation works, greatly 
promoted farmland infrastructure, and concentrated efforts to 
harness the rivers in the Taihu and the Hangjiahu River basins 
and to tame the "three rivers" system. Measures to protect 
farmers' interests, to lighten their burdens, and to help them 
enhance the capability to combat natural disasters were 
continuously implemented. Steps were taken to enhance 
management over prices for means of agricultural production and 
to resolutely investigate cases of "cheating" farmers. Measures 
to strengthen land management was further strengthened. We 
mapped out a general plan for land utilization, worked out a 
sound system for the establishment of a farmland protection 
zone, and vigorously developed land resources. Stricter 
guidelines were set for construction-use land planning. We also 
tightened the processing and approval of construction-use land 
applications. We resolutely put a stop to illegal land use and 
to illegal occupuation and abuse of arable land. After land was 
requisitioned for development, we saw that an early development 
was carried out. A large-scale afforestation drive was launched 
to realize the goal of greening all the mountains in our 
province one year ahead of schedule. 
  We carried out in-depth reform in rural areas. We strove to 
improve the dual management system of unified and independent 
management which is based on the household contract 
responsibility system; we also extended the land-contracting 
period. While adhering to the principle of land being owned by 
the collective and to the principle of not changing the basic 
purpose for the use of land, we established a turnover mechanism 
for the right to use land. We actively promoted large-scale 
agricultural operations in regions with advantageous conditions. 
The shareholding cooperative system was expanded from village 
and township enterprises to other economic sectors in rural 
areas. We strove to bring about a rational distribution of 
major means for agricultural production. In addition to 
establishing a sound socialized service system in rural areas 
and to reforming the distribution system for agricultural 
products, we encouraged and supported various social sectors, 
particularly those collective economic organizations in rural 
areas and those specialized farm households, to set up 
"locomotive" enterprises. We helped farmers to bring their 
produce to the market and strove to bring about the 
comprehensive development of the agriculture and the rural 
economy. 
<H5>  (4) Readjust and Optimize the Economic Structure and Help </H5>
Raise Quality in the Growth of the National Economy 
  To promote development, we focused our efforts on 
readjusting 
structure, raising product quality, and improving economic 
efficiency. We not only strove to consolidate and upgrade 
agriculture, but also increased efforts in infrastructure 
construction and basic industry. We also strove to transform 
and upgrade the processing industry, to foster and develop 
leading industrial sectors, and to accelerate the pace of 
developing tertiary industry. To readjust industry mix in our 
province, we made good use of market mechanisms. 
  We should improve the structure of investment in 
fixed assets and step up the building of infrastructural 
facilities and basic industries. Continuous efforts should be 
made to control the scale of investment in fixed assets. We 
should give first priority to alleviating the strain on 
transportation. Focusing our attention on projects in 
transportation, communications, power, and water conservancy, we 
should speed up the construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo 
Expressway, the Jinhua-Wenzhou Railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi 
Multiple-Track Railway, the Zhujiajian Airport, the ore wharf at 
Beilun Harbor for 200,000-ton ships, telephone networks in the 
province's cities and prefectures, the Beilun Power Plant, the 
second-stage project of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, the 
Jiaxing Power Plant, the Tianhuangping Pumped Hydroelectric 
Storage Station, the Wuxi Jiang diversion project, the 
Jinqingxin floodgate, the Shafan and Wanyao reservoirs, and the 
key Yuxi water conservancy project. Conditions should be 
created for building the Xiaoshan- Ningbo Multiple-Track Railway 
and the fourth-stage project of the Taizhou Power Plant. Full 
preparations should be made for the construction of the new 
Hangzhou international airport, the Taizhou section of the 
Ningbo-Taizhou-Wenzhou Expressway, a second bridge over the Ou 
Jiang, the Hangzhou-Jinhua-Quzhou special highway for motor 
vehicles, the Zhejiang section of the Hangzhou-Nanjing 
Expressway, the Sanmen Nuclear Power Plant, thermal power plants 
in coastal areas, the key Shanxi water conservancy project, and 
the Tankeng Hydroelectric Power Station. In raw and 
semifinished materials industry, we should continue to do a good 
job in building the Zhejiang Acrylic Fiber Plant, the Zhejiang 
Polyester Fiber Plant, the Zhejiang Chemicals Plant, and the 
Quhua fluoride project and make full preparations for the 
construction of the 600,000-tonne catalytic cracking project, 
the Beilun Iron and Steel Works, and the 300,000-tonne ethylene 
project. 
  It is crucial to raise funds and use them according to plan 
in stepping up the construction of infrastructural facilities 
and basic industries. Governments at various levels should 
institute a system under which special funds are earmarked for 
the construction of communications, electric power, and water 
conservancy projects. Meanwhile, they should actively introduce 
market mechanisms and open channels for raising funds. On the 
one hand, they may raise funds by issuing bonds or stocks. In 
building communications, power, and major raw and semifinished 
materials projects, they may organize shareholding companies 
which will be responsible for raising funds and the construction 
and operation of projects. While strengthening communications 
management, they should further implement and improve the 
principle of "self-reliance in four aspects [si zi fang zhen 
0934 5261 2455 6859]" and give full play to the initiative of 
localities in setting up and running transport facilities. On 
the other hand, they should try to attract foreign funds and 
have them participate in building projects in infrastructure and 
basic industries. Limited funds should be used for key 
projects. The provincial government should concentrate its 
resources on projects bearing on the overall situation. City, 
prefectural, and county governments should do their best to 
build key projects according to their own capabilities. 
  We should vigorously open markets, accelerate 
technological progress, and resolutely develop industry by 
improving its management. We should effectively strengthen 
our market analyses and provide more market information. We 
should guide enterprises in giving first priority to opening 
markets, actively readjusting their product mix, and improve the 
competitiveness and market percentage of their products. 
Enterprises should exercise strict internal management and 
improve the system of responsibility for putting an to losses 
and increasing profits, strengthen their quality control, and 
lower their consumption of energy and raw materials. Now 
accidents occur rather often in production. Governments at 
various levels should pay close attention to safety in 
production and do a good job in labor protection. Further 
efforts should be made to establish or improve the system of 
safety in production under which enterprises are responsible for 
safety, professional people are assigned to ensure safety, the 
state oversees it, and masses supervise it. 
  We should continue to accelerate the technical 
transformation 
of enterprises. In view of the new situations occurring with 
reform of the financial, taxation, banking, and investment 
systems, we should study such situations and adopt policy 
measures to encourage enterprises to use foreign funds for their 
technical transformation. We should protect and strengthen their 
initiative in carrying out technical transformation. Technical 
transformation projects started according to the Eighth 
Five-Year Plan are now in full swing. We should make vigorous 
efforts to carry out such projects, ensure their quality, and 
strive to have them completed, put into operation, and yield the 
desired results as early as possible. 
  We should transform conventional industries; cultivate new 
industries; improve planning for the machine-building, 
electronics, light, textile, chemical and building materials 
industries; work out detailed plans for the development of 
telecommunications equipment, transport equipment, engineering 
machinery, new, high-grade synthetic materials, new building 
materials, medicine, and iron and steel; and actively implement 
plans to accelerate the overall industrial structure. We should 
pay attention to giving play to our traditional strength in the 
building industry, improve equipment, and enhance our 
competitive power. 
  We should arouse enthusiasm in all quarters to 
accelerate the development of tertiary industry. While we 
should adhere to a unified plan, we should give different 
guidance to suit different conditions. While continuing to 
improve transport, post and telecommunications, and science and 
technology education, we should support all localities in 
broadening the area of development of tertiary industry in light 
of local resources and actual needs. In cities, we should give 
a high priority to the development of commerce, banking, 
insurance, real estate, information and consulting services 
during the course of urban transformation and construction. In 
rural areas, we should give a high priority to perfecting the 
socialized service system. In areas with rich tourism 
resources, we should accelerate the development of tourism, and 
let tourism play a leading role in developing relevant 
industries. We should encourage and guide both urban and rural 
areas to undertake more tertiary industry projects that require 
less investment, yield quick results, and directly serve 
production and people's livelihood. During the course of 
development, we should strive to broaden the fields, increase 
the categories, and upgrade tertiary industry. 
  We should take a further step to optimize the geographical 
distribution of economic undertakings and strive to cultivate 
new areas of development. While continuing to give full play to 
the leading and promoting role of urban centers, we should 
particularly do a good job in the following three respects this 
year: 
  First, we should strengthen the county economy. Village and 
town enterprises are the main bodies of the county economy. To 
bring about major development and improvement, we should 
actively guide and support village and town enterprises in 
increasing production and accumulation, stepping up technical 
updating, performing strict internal management, practicing the 
cooperative share-holding system, and raising their level of 
specialized cooperation and organization. We should help some 
selected major village and town enterprises expand, improve 
quality, and vigorously develop an open-type economy. We should 
combine the efforts to build small towns with the efforts to 
develop nonfarming undertakings of which the village and town 
enterprises are the main form; and in this way, we should 
accelerate the industrialization and urbanization of rural 
areas. We should reform the urban household registration 
system, popularize the experience of building rural towns by 
peasants, give higher priority to developing urban centers 
within counties, and promote the gathering of rural secondary 
and tertiary industries in the urban centers. The province 
should pay more attention to some economically strong counties 
and a number of economically less developed countries. The 
former should serve as a model for the latter to accelerate 
development. 
  Second, we should accelerate development of the marine 
economy. We should take full advantage of our rich marine 
resources, long coastline, and many deep-water harbors and 
seriously do a good job in planning the exploitation of marine 
resources. We should speed up the construction of the coastal 
ports Ningbo, Zhoushan, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Zhapu with more 
emphasis on the first two. For these ports, we should build 
supporting transport projects, particularly transport lines 
leading from them to inland areas. We should step up the 
construction of Beilun harbor according to the standards of a 
large international transshipment port, important trade port, 
and heavy chemical industry base. We should vigorously develop 
shipping, marine fishing and aquaculture, coastal industries, 
ocean tourism, and domestic and foreign trade. In support of 
the exploitation of the oil and gas fields in the East China 
Sea, we should build well a rear base at Wenzhou. We should 
gradually improve interisland transportation, alleviate water 
and power shortages on coastal islets, and improve the post and 
telecommunications service there. 
  Third, we should vigorously develop the economy in 
mountainous regions. We should support the mountainous regions 
in accelerating the construction of transport, water resources, 
electric power, and telecommunications projects to gradually 
improve their infrastructure. While encouraging according to 
plan the urban and coastal regions to relocate some of their 
industries to mountainous regions, we should guide and assist 
mountainous regions in using local resources to comprehensively 
develop crop cultivation, livestock breeding and aquaculture, 
and processing industries, and in developing secondary and 
tertiary industries which suit local conditions. We should 
support provincial border regions in developing border trade. 
We should adhere to the demands set in the state help-the-poor 
plan to actively support the economic development of poor 
regions, particularly the old revolutionary base areas and 
minority nationalities regions. We should broaden our concepts 
and make greater efforts to help the poor. In helping the poor, 
we should adopt measures which have proven effective through 
practice, such as cooperation between departments and 
localities, application of science and technology, financial 
assistance, and leading cadres each assuming responsibility for 
a fixed spot. We should help some localities overcome poverty 
by seeking additional income elsewhere if they can. We should 
step up the construction of economic development zones in poor 
regions and thus provide those regions with economic development 
bases. 
  (5) Give Priority to Developing Science, Technology, 
and Education and Promote the Integration of Science, 
Technology, and Education with the Economy 
  We will further put into practice the strategy of 
invigorating Zhejiang with science and education and closely 
integrate science, technology, and education with the economy. 
This is aimed at making science, technology, and education 
serve economic construction more consciously and at making 
economic construction rely on science and technology and on 
skilled labor. 
  Science and technology should serve the needs of economic 
construction. While focusing on strengthening the foundation of 
agriculture and transforming traditional industries and town and 
village enterprises, we will develop industries using high and 
new technologies; continue to implement the "problems tackling," 
"Spark," "Torch," and "bumper harvest" plans and the "Golden 
Bridge" project; and promote application of science and 
technology, development of science and technology, and research 
in basic science. We will drawn up integrated development plans 
for agriculture, science, and education; set up agriculture 
demonstration zones that stresse the use of fine strains and 
high yields; and speed up the importation and cultivation of new 
seed strains. We will earnestly implement plans for developing 
new and high technologies and for transforming traditional 
industries; and conduct experiments in the reform of the 
petro-chemical and electronic industries. We will develop new 
and high technologies and gradually build up a number of new- 
and high-tech enterprises in the fields of electronics, 
information, new materials, new energy, biological technology, 
as well as in the manufacturing of machinery and electrical 
products. We will strengthen research in basic science and do a 
good job in building the second batch of 17 provincial-level 
laboratories and experimental bases. 
  We will deepen reform of the scientific and technological 
system. In accordance with the principle of "holding fast to one 
end and leaving the whole field open," we will stabilize and 
strengthen the number of specialized personnel needed for 
research in basic science. On this basis, we will vigorously 
promote the restructuring of various scientific research 
institutions; redeploy personnel; strive to build economic 
entities embracing scientific research, production, and 
operations; or directly deploy research personnel in enterprises 
or enterprise groups, thus becoming the technical development 
centers of enterprises. We will strengthen the leading role of 
enterprises in technical progress, encourage large and medium 
enterprises to set up and improve their technological 
development centers, and encourage medium and small enterprises 
to form their own technological backing. We will vigorously 
promote technological cooperation among enterprises, schools of 
higher learning, and scientific research institutions; encourage 
and support the building of civilian-run scientific and 
technological organizations; and enhance the role of scientific 
associations and societies in promoting scientific and 
technological development. We will speed up the 
commercialization of scientific and technological results and 
promptly put them to use in production. 
  The stamina for economic and social development is more and 
more dependent on the improved quality of the work force and the 
training of talented people. To attach importance to education 
means to set great store in Zhejiang's future. We should 
further implement the "Outline on Reforming and Developing 
Education in China;" and, with a view to training qualified 
personnel and ensuring their moral, intellectual, and physical 
development for socialist modernization construction, should 
accelerate the reform and development of education, focused on 
basic education and vocational and technical education, in a bid 
to raise the quality of education and efficiency of schools in 
all fields. We should strengthen nine-year compulsory 
education, striving to enforce it on 38.7 million people in 
1,515 townships and towns this year, or 90 percent of the total 
population in 82 percent of the townships and towns. Where 
conditions permit, we should gradually expand senior middle 
school education. We should energetically develop vocational 
and technical education, increase the ratio of vocational 
schools to the total of secondary schools, and encourage more 
graduates of junior and senior middle schools to undergo 
vocational and technical training. We should support schools of 
higher learning in optimizing structure, extending scale, and 
raising overall efficiency. We should strive to manage well a 
number of key subjects and actively create the conditions for 
several institutes of higher learning to be incorporated into 
the state's "Project 2110." We should grant more managerial 
autonomy to schools of higher learning, quicken reform of the 
enrollment system of new students and the job assignment system 
for graduates, and increase the portion of enrollment under 
regulatory planning. We should actively develop adult 
education, nursery education, special education, and various 
kinds of social education; and should strive to eliminate 
illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. We should 
conduct on-the-job training, continuing education, and 
in-service diploma education in various forms so as to raise the 
ideological and cultural standards and technical skills of 
professionals at large. We should pay close attention to 
teachers' training schools and universities of various kinds, 
and should strengthen the training of competent teachers. We 
should earnestly publicize and implement the "Teachers Law" and 
protect teachers' lawful rights and interests. Delayed payments 
of teachers' wages should not be allowed; and everything should 
be done to solve housing problems for young and middle-aged 
teachers in urban areas. We should increase fiscal input into 
education, and ensure a good job in collecting the "educational 
surcharge." Meanwhile, we should actively explore other forms of 
schools run with funds raised through various channels from 
different walks of life, energetically encourage nonovernment 
sectors to set up schools, and improve the conditions for 
running schools so as to gradually change the situation in which 
the government runs all schools with a serious shortage of 
educational input. 
  We should make further efforts to create an atmosphere of 
respect for learning and for professionally trained people; 
earnestly improve the working, studying, and living conditions 
of intellectuals; and help them solve practical problems. We 
should strive to train a number of academic and technological 
leaders competent for entering the front line of the world's 
science and technology; organically integrate the training of 
personnel with rational use of talents; institute supporting 
reforms in the labor and personnel systems; promote rational 
mobility of talents; and through different forms, encourage and 
attract Chinese and foreign talents to serve Zhejiang. 
<H5>  (6) Be Concerned With People's Well-being and Continue To </H5>
Improve the Masses' Income and Living Quality 
  The purpose of deepening reform, opening wider to the 
outside 
world, and developing the economy is to improve people's living 
standards. With deepening the reform in an all-around manner 
and accelerating the readjustment of the interest pattern, 
governments at various levels across Zhejiang should acquire the 
mass viewpoint; conscientiously take the entire situation into 
consideration to stabilize the economy and society; take 
practical measures to show concern for the well-being of the 
masses; and safeguard the immediate interests of the masses of 
various classes in the urban and rural areas. 
  We should make a success of producing and supplying daily 
necessities to the masses; exercise strict control over prices; 
continue to implement the responsibility system of governors, 
mayors, and county magistrates; step up the construction of the 
"grain sack" and "vegetable basket" projects; stabilize 
production at current bases; develop new vegetable and nonstaple 
foodstuffs bases; strengthen control over grain and cooking oil 
supply; establish the market risk fund; perfect the reserve 
system for major agricultural products; and help markets in 
urban and rural areas to flourish. While carrying out price 
reform in a stable way, we should make great efforts to 
strengthen control over market prices; give full play to the 
press, public opinion, and all walks of life in society to 
supervise commodity prices; crack down on such illegal 
activities as forcing up prices, hoarding and speculation, and 
profiteering. 
  We should further improve the incomes of both urban and 
rural 
people in the light of the economic development and improved 
efficiency. We should reform the distribution system of 
enterprises and institutions and administrative organs in 
accordance with the requirements of "to each according to his 
work" as the principal mode of distribution, facilitating the 
coexistence of multiple distribution methods, and implementing 
the principle of giving priority to efficiency while taking 
fairness into account. Given that the rate of increase in the 
total amount of workers' wages is lower than that in 
enterprises' economic efficiency and the rate of increase in 
workers' average wages is lower than that in enterprises' 
productivity, we should give a free hand to state-owned 
enterprises to decide the wage level and mode of distribution 
according to changes in employment supply and demand and the 
state's relevant policies and regulations; establish regular 
promotion and wage increase mechanisms for organs and 
institutions step by step; pay attention to making adequate 
arrangements for the daily life of the retired, workers of 
loss-making enterprises, low-income workers, and peasants in 
poverty-stricken areas. We should institute and perfect the 
systems of price compensation and extra allowances for living 
expenses and thoroughly implement the regulations on workers' 
minimum wages to ensure that the increase in people's real 
incomes is greater than that in commodity prices and that the 
basic needs of low-income households and households with 
material difficulties are met. We should explore all 
possibilities for employment; rationally guide redundant 
personnel of organs and enterprises and institutions to new 
jobs; and transfer surplus labor out of agriculture. 
  We should attach great importance to and make a success of 
family planning and environmental protection; ensure better 
prenatal care and sound practices in rearing children; 
strengthen the population target responsibility system; 
strengthen control over family planning for the rural population 
and the urban floating population; continue to urge key cities 
and counties to pay attention to family planning; and ensure the 
fulfillment of Zhejiang's population target. We should continue 
to implement the environmental protection target responsibility 
system; strengthen monitoring and control over the environment; 
earnestly harness industrial pollution caused by gaseous, 
liquid, or solid wastes; control and reduce pollutants; 
strengthen management over water resources; truly protect river 
water quality; improve environmental quality in both urban and 
rural areas; and earnestly make a success of preventing and 
reducing disasters. 
  (7) Strengthen the Building of Socialist Spiritual 
Civilization, Promote All-Around Development of Social 
Undertakings 
  Spiritual civilization is an important component of 
modernization construction. We shall steadfastly implement the 
principle of "grasping two links at the same time" and earnestly 
carry out the "Outline for Building Socialist Spiritual 
Civilization in Zhejiang," persisting in arming people's mind 
with scientific theory, in guiding people with the correct 
public opinion, in portraying people with a noble spirit, and in 
inspiring people with outstanding works, thereby providing a 
powerful spiritual force, intellectual support, and ideological 
guarantee for reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
  The primary task of building socialist spiritual 
civilization 
in the new era is to study and publicize Comrade Deng Xiaoping's 
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We 
should organize cadres and the people in various ways to study 
in depth Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" in 
the light of reality, should earnestly educate them once again 
in the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines, and should help 
cadres and the people strengthen their conviction in socialism 
and enhance their awareness of implementing the party's basic 
line and development of a socialist market economy. We should 
continue to conduct extensive education on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism as well as on a pioneering spirit in 
the new era; should launch in-depth drives to emulate Lei Feng, 
Jiao Yulu, Xu Honggang, and other heroes and models; should 
actively advocate and publicize the correct ideals, belief, 
outlook on life, and concept of values; should resolutely oppose 
money worshipping, hedonism, and ultraindividualism; and should 
resist the inroads of bourgeois and feudal decadent ideas. We 
should focus attention on training a new generation of people 
with noble ideals, discipline, morality, and general knowledge 
by promoting public and professional ethics and reinforcing 
professional norms and discipline to improve service quality. 
We should strive to foster and create harmonious human 
relations by actively encouraging such healthy general conduct 
as observing discipline, respecting the old and cherishing the 
young, and readily taking up the cudgels for a just cause. We 
should work out meticulous plans on mass activities on building 
spiritual civilization by coordinating army, police, and 
civilian efforts to build civility units. We should continue to 
organize the drive to build civility cities and extend the drive 
to counties; and should gradually set up a new pattern of cities 
setting a good example for counties, rural towns for villages, 
and model units for entire trades and professions in building 
spiritual civilization. 
  In building spiritual civilization, we should have 
long-range 
objectives as well as interim requirements, striving to achieve 
marked results in improving the general mood of society in the 
following aspects: First, we should improve the work style of 
trades and professions closely related to the masses and correct 
unhealthy practices to bring about a noticeable improvement in 
the style of various trades and professions. Second, we should 
strengthen the management of cultural markets and continue to 
crack down on pornography to promote healthy development of 
cultural markets. Third, we should step up ideological and 
moral education among youngsters; and should closely coordinate 
school, family, and community in fostering sound milieus for 
education. Fourth, we should go all out to change unhealthy 
social customs and habits; and should resolutely check the 
spread of such unhealthy practices as mass gambling, feudal 
superstition, and extravagant weddings and funerals. 
  We should pay close attention to the work related to 
culture, 
public health, and physical culture. We should adhere to the 
orientation of "serving the people and socialism" and the policy 
of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of 
thought contend;" and should strive to create diversified 
artistic works reflecting the theme of our times to the delight 
of the masses. We should deepen reform of the culture 
management system, improve the quality of cultural workers, and 
go all out to launch mass cultural and recreational activities 
to satisfy growing needs in the cultural life of the masses. We 
should attach importance to the work related to cultural relics, 
archives, and annals of local history. In the press and 
publications and radio and television, we should adhere to the 
principle of unity, stability and encouragement; should persist 
in positive propaganda; should pay particular attention to 
publicizing reform, opening up, and economic construction; and 
strive to create an environment of public opinion that is 
conducive to promoting socialist modernization, reform, and 
opening up. We should step up and enliven the study of social 
sciences, putting particular emphasis on new circumstances and 
problems cropping up in building the socialist market economic 
structure. We should energetically popularize knowledge on 
health, focusing on hygiene, disease prevention, and self-care. 
We should launch an in-depth patriotic healthy campaign, and 
actively prevent and control endemic diseases, occupational 
diseases, contagious diseases, and common diseases. 
  We 
should improve medical and health care undertakings in urban and 
rural areas, comprehensively implement the primary health care 
program in rural areas, set up a sound cooperative medical 
system, and ensure a good job in improving drinking water and 
building more latrines to constantly improve the medical and 
health conditions in rural areas. We should accelerate the 
reform of hospitals, promote medical ethics, improve the work 
style of medical personnel, and raise the quality of medical 
technology and services. We should launch extensive mass sports 
activities, step up efforts to train athletes, strive to raise 
the level of competitive sports, and ensure the success of the 
10th provincial sports meet. We should gradually encourage 
communities, organizations, and industries to run sports 
undertakings. We should strive to increase the input in 
building spiritual civilization, and strengthen the construction 
of infrastructure for social undertakings. The construction of 
the new Zhejiang Library, ZHEJIANG RIBAO news building, and the 
Huanglongdong sports center should be started, and that of the 
radio production building should be basically completed this 
year. We should show concern for undertakings of the aged, 
women, children, and the disabled; and should effectively 
protect the lawful rights and interests of the old, women, 
children, and the disabled. 
<H5>  (8) Promote the construction of Socialist Democracy and the </H5>
Legal System, Consolidate and Develop Political Stability and 
Unity 
  The faster reform, opening up, and development advance, the 
more necessary it is to have a stable social environment. We 
must attach great importance to social stability and go all out 
to strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and the 
legal system. 
  Efforts must be made to continually perfect socialist 
democracy. We should promptly report our work to the people's 
congress and its standing committee, conscientiously accept 
their supervision, and earnestly implement various decisions and 
resolutions. We should support the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC] to bring into full play its role 
in political consultation and democratic supervision; should 
take the initiative to brief and solicit opinions from the 
CPPCC, various democratic parties, and the industry and commerce 
federations; and should set up a sound system for the democratic 
parties and industry and commerce federations to establish ties 
with relevant government departments. We should speed up the 
handling of motions, suggestions, and opinions from people's 
congress deputies and CPPCC members; and should improve the 
handling system and raise the quality of handling motions. We 
should earnestly implement the party and state's policies toward 
minority nationalities and religious affairs, and should 
continue to pay keen attention to work concerning foreign, 
overseas Chinese, and Taiwan affairs. We should forge close 
ties with trade unions, the Communist Youth League, women's 
federations, and other mass organizations. We should attach 
great importance to letters and visits from the people, and 
should properly handle contradictions among the people. We 
should constantly perfect the system and procedures for the 
government to make policy decisions in a democratic and 
scientific manner, and should bring into full play the role of 
experts and research and consultation institutions. We should 
establish and improve villager's and residents' committees and 
other mass self-government organizations and should further 
promote the construction of democracy at the grass roots. 
  Efforts must be stepped up to improve government legislative 
work. We should strengthen economic legislation, focusing on 
laws and regulations for standardizing market norms, for keeping 
the market in order, for improving and tightening macroeconomic 
regulation and control, and for setting up and improving the 
social security system. We should promptly formulate 
administrative rules and regulations urgently needed for 
accelerating economic development, and should amend or abolish 
those which prove ill-suited with realities. We should also 
step up efforts to draft relevant local laws and regulations. 
Efforts must be made to strictly enforce laws in administrative 
work; to establish a sound law-enforcement supervisory 
mechanism; to ensure a good job in administrative 
reconsideration work; to raise the competence of administrative 
law-enforcement personnel; to resolutely correct violations of 
the law such as failure to abide by the law, lax law 
enforcement, and letting lawbreakers go free; and to protect 
citizens' legitimate rights and interests according to the law. 
We should continue to carry out educational activities on the 
second five-year plan for popularizing legal knowledge; should 
publicize in particular laws and regulations closely related to 
the development of a socialist market economy; should enhance 
awareness of laws and the legal system among the large numbers 
of cadres and people, especially leading cadres and 
law-enforcement personnel; and should strive to formulate laws 
for work in all fields. 
  We will concentrate our efforts on comprehensive management 
of social order. We will adhere to the principle of "whoever is 
in charge will take the responsibility" and establish a 
leadership responsibility system at all levels. How well local 
governments have carried out comprehensive management of social 
order and how well they have improved security in their 
localities will be made an important critia in evaluating local 
governments' performance. We will better promote the "Fengqiao 
experience" through beefing up a collective crime-fighting 
network at the grass-roots level and through improving 
management over monitoring of the security situation. Special 
anticrime drives will be continuously launched and major 
crime-prevention measures will be adopted. We will vigorously 
crack down on serious crimes according to the law by targeting 
gang members, bandits who rob passengers travelling on buses and 
trains, those who illegally set up barricades along the highway 
to collect tolls, and those who kidnap women and children for 
sale. We will sternly deal with major corruption, bribery, and 
smuggling cases as well as with criminal activities that 
endanger the national security. We will continue to work toward 
eliminating such ugly social evils as prostitution. We will 
help mediate disputes among the people. We will improve 
management over the lawyers, notary publics and the 
reform-through-labor, and education-through-labor work. We will 
also do our best to improve social order in urban and rural 
areas. 
  We will give great support to the People's Liberation Army 
and the People's Armed Police. Well-prepared campaigns will be 
launched among the cadres and the masses to raise their 
consciousness for national defense and for fulfilling their 
national defense obligations. To build up the national defense 
reserve force, we will continue to beef up the militia. 
Management over border defense, coastal defense, and civil air 
defense will be strengthened. Military installations will be 
protected according to the law. We will do an even better job 
in conscription work, on settling demobilized servicemen and 
retired military cadres, and on taking care of military 
dependents' welfare. Preferential policies for families of 
martyred servicemen and for disabled servicemen will be 
implemented in a down-to-earth manner. We will take the 
initiative to help the military solve problems. To further 
forge unity between the military and the government and between 
the military and the people, we will concentrate building 
"double-support model cities" and "double-support model 
counties" and launch various activities among the people to 
support the servicemen and give preferential treatment to their 
families and among the servicemen to support the government and 
show concern for the people. 
<H5>  (9) Change Government Functions; Strengthen and Improve </H5>
Government Work 
  Central to strengthening and improving the government work 
in 
the new period is changing government functions, to bring about 
a change from direct government management to indirect 
management, from micromanagement to macromanagement, and from 
depending chiefly on administrative means to mainly economic and 
legal means. In changing government functions, we need to 
follow the spirit of reform to the letter. This year, we will 
chiefly devote our efforts to helping change and improve 
government work style, to embark on reform of government organs, 
and to build a clean administration. 
  Conscientious efforts should be made to improve work style 
and the government's ability to regulate and control the economy 
and to deal with various social affairs. 1. It is necessary to 
organize cadres, especially leading cadres, to investigate and 
study actual conditions. They should stress the investigation 
of difficult problems or problems indicating a trend that occurs 
in the course of establishing a socialist market economic 
structure, study them, and seeking ways to solve them. We 
should start drafting the Ninth Five-Year Plan for the province 
on the basis of investigation and study. 2. It is necessary to 
improve the system of responsibility for government work. We 
should conscientiously keep track of and supervise the 
implementation of various principles and policies. Leaders, 
especially principal leaders, should be held responsible for the 
carrying out of major tasks and the bridling of key projects. 
We should work hard to implement principles and policies. We 
should be determined to reduce meetings, documents, and social 
activities; rid ourselves of bureaucratism, subjectivism, and 
formalism; and resolutely oppose and stop the practice of fraud. 
3. We should strictly enforce government discipline and 
subordinate the interests of the part to those of the whole and 
immediate interests to long-term interests. While continuing to 
make decisions in a scientific way, we should strictly implement 
such decisions and resolutely overcome such phenomena as taking 
what one needs or going one's own way in disregard of orders and 
prohibitions to ensure the smooth implementation of government 
decrees. 
  In accordance with the unified state arrangements and the 
principles of separating government administration from 
enterprise management and achieving simplification, uniformity, 
and efficiency, we should vigorously carry out the reform of 
government organizations. While stressing transforming 
government functions, we should strengthen departments in charge 
of supervision and macroeconomic regulation and control as well 
as departments exercising social management functions; we should 
change some specialized economic departments into industrial 
management organs or economic entities. We should basically 
finish the reform of government organizations at the provincial, 
city, and prefectural levels this year. After summing up our 
experiences in experimenting with the reform of government 
organizations in Shangyu, Lanxi, and Nongquan, we should step up 
our preparations for the reform of government organizations at 
the county level. This reform involves many fields, which is 
bound to touch on the relationship of interest that has formed 
for a long time under the old system. We should carefully 
organize people to carry out the reform step by step. We should 
conscientiously do a good job in controlling the establishment 
of administrative organs and their manning quotas, and pay 
attention to the stability and continuity of our work. In 
connection with the reform of government organizations, we 
should actively promote the public service system. 
  Punishing the corrupt and strengthening the building of a 
clean and honest government are a matter of great importance 
which has a bearing on the success or failure of socialist 
modernization. So we must persist in doing this work well. We 
should strictly implement the central authorities' regulations 
on building a clean and honest government, formulate measures 
for supervising leading cadres in self-discipline and in 
practicing a clean and honest work style, and strengthen the 
mechanism of supervision over cadres, especially leading cadres. 
Particular attention should be paid to investigating and 
dealing with violations of the law and discipline in leading 
bodies, administrative law enforcement departments, economic 
management departments, and public utilities units and by their 
personnel. Cases should be dealt with in strict accordance with 
the law. Violations of the law should investigated thoroughly 
and dealt with sternly. Those who commit crimes shortly after 
being released or without regard for any danger should be 
punished more sternly, and their leaders should be investigated 
for responsibility in this regard. Special plans should be made 
for tackling problems about which the masses have a lot of 
complaints. We should continue to stop the arbitrary imposition 
of fees, and the categories of fees which have been canceled 
must remain so. Government organs are strictly forbidden to 
engage in business or run an enterprise. Government organs which 
have set up economic entities and which are to separate 
themselves from these entities under relevant regulations must 
do so promptly. Economic entities which are supposed to be 
transferred to other units should be transferred promptly. We 
should resolutely stop people from traveling abroad as tourists 
on public funds. Comprehensive measures should be taken to 
build a clean and honest government -- one the one hand, it is 
necessary to step up ideological education, to persistently 
serve the people wholeheartedly, to further enhance government 
functionaries' sense of public servants, and to do practical 
work for the grass-roots level and the masses of people; on the 
other hand, it is necessary to institute more systems as 
necessary, to uphold and improve the measures for "being open in 
two aspects and exercise supervision" [liang gong kai yi jian du 
0357 0361 7030 0001 4148 4206], to increase the transparency of 
government work; to expand the contingent of supervisors engaged 
by special arrangement, to strengthen the system of laws and 
regulations concerning supervision and restraint, and to seek 
ways to strengthen the building of a clean and honest government 
through ideological education and effective systems. 
  Fellow Deputies, the province's situation in economic and 
social development was very good last year, but we have no 
reason to feel complacent. This is because we still lag behind 
other provinces in many fields of work, and there are still many 
difficulties on the road of advance. We must make arduous 
efforts to overcome such difficulties. In the new year, the 
tasks on our shoulders are arduous yet glorious. Let us rally 
more closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade 
Jiang Zemin as the core and, under the leadership of the 
Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee, rely on people throughout the 
province to work with one heart and one mind for the prosperity 
of the country and to win fresh, ever greater victory in the 
strive for socialist

<F P=106> [Summary of interview with Li Zemin, secretary of the </F>
Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee, by CHUNG KUO SHIH PAO Chief 
Editor Huang Chao-sung, Deputy Chief Editor Yu Yu-lin, and 
reporter Pai Te-hua; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] Secretary, would you please 
begin with the overall development of Zhejiang and the problems 
that Zhejiang has encountered in the course of development? 
  [Li] Zhejiang is situated in China's southeastern coastal 
region. It has 43 million people living in an area of about 
100,000 square km. Historically speaking, Zhejiang was one of 
the areas in China that is relatively rich and well-developed in 
terms of its economy. [passage omitted on the history of 
Zhejiang's economic development] 
  Thanks to the adoption of the policy of reform and opening 
to 
the outside world following the Third Plenary Session of the 
11th CPC Central Committee, Zhejiang has achieved great economic 
development. [passage omitted on progress in the eighties and 
nineties] 
  Notwithstanding a weak industrial foundation, a lack of 
mineral resources, and limited arable land, Zhejiang developed 
rapidly. Zhejiang's rapid development can be attributed to two 
major reasons. First, Zhejiang benefited from Deng Xiaoping's 
policy of reform and opening up. Second, Zhejiang enjoys unique 
conditions for developing its economy. [passage omitted on 
Zhejiang's superiority in development] 
  [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] What about the current operations of the 
Qinshan nuclear power plant? 
  [Li] The Qinshan nuclear power plant was the first nuclear 
power plant designed and built by China. Its current 
electricity-generating capacity is 300,000 kilowatt hours [kwh]. 
A report prepared by experts from the International Atomic 
Energy Agency following their inspection of the Qinshan nuclear 
power plant in 1989 testified to the safety and reliability of 
this nuclear power plant in the areas of design, machinery 
equipment, and installation. The Qinshan nuclear power plant was 
designed with three protective layers. The operation of the 
nuclear power plant has been normal following two years of 
electricity generation. 
  [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] The Qinshan nuclear power plant is 
located at Hangzhou Bay, which is a densely populated area. Was 
this factor taken into consideration when making the decision to 
build this nuclear power plant? Were there objections from the 
masses and cadres about building this nuclear power plant? 
  [Li] The Qinshan nuclear power plant is located at Hangzhou 
Bay, which is an area between Hangzhou and Shanghai that is 
known for its economic development and for its dense population. 
At the beginning, the masses did harbor some misgivings about 
the nuclear power plant, but following our explanations, local 
cadres and the masses realized that their safety could be 
guaranteed. We also told the local cadres and the masses that 
nuclear power is a form of power generation that is relatively 
safe and that produces less pollution. Therefore, we did not 
encounter problems with the cadres and masses over the 
construction of the nuclear power plant. The state plans to go 
ahead with the second-stage project of installing another two 
power-generating units, with each of them being capable of 
generating 600,000 kwh of electricity. I have visited the 
nuclear power plant several times. It is protected on the 
outside by a layer of cement. Unlike the former USSR's 
Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which looked like a workshop at 
an ordinary factory, our nuclear power plant is enveloped by a 
very thick layer of cement. Even if an accident should occur, 
it would not endanger the safety of the staff at the nuclear 
power plant and the masses who live near it because we have 
meticulously formulated accident- prevention and safety measures. 
  Zhejiang is preparing to build an additional nuclear power 
plant. Its site has been selected at Sanmen Bay. Basically, the 
state has decided to build more nuclear power plants at the end 
of this century and in the beginning of next century by 
introducing foreign funds and by pooling domestic funds. The 
new nuclear power plants that are under consideration will be 
bigger than the Qinshan plant. Because there are many nearby 
islands, it is a rather ideal place to build several more 
nuclear power plants. [passage omitted on compulsory education, 
introduction of foreign funds, housing] 
  [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] Many people from Zhejiang went to live 
in 
Taiwan [after the communist takeover of China]. Therefore, 
there are many people in Taiwan who have relatives in Zhejiang. 
We also know that many Taiwan fishermen operate near the 
Zhoushan archipelago. Could you tell us how Zhejiang has 
developed relations with Taiwan? 
  [Li] When talking about the Zhejiang-Taiwan relationship, 
people in Zhejiang can lay claim to many top honors. For 
instance, first place goes to Zhejiang for having the most 
people in the country who emigrated to Taiwan; one estimate puts 
the number of them at 200,000. Zhejiang also tops the nation 
for having the most people with relatives in Taiwan; that number 
is estimated at 400,000. Another No. 1 rank for Zhejiang is in 
the number of well- educated people who emigrated to Taiwan. 
They were mostly people from military, political, and 
commercial circles. Of course, there are historical reasons 
behind these numbers. Zhejiang holds another top title of 
attracting the greatest number of fishermen from Taiwan to the 
East China Sea fishing zone, to Zhejiang's coastal areas, to 
receive supplies, and to seek refuge from typhoons. Over the 
years, we have received some 22,000 Taiwan fishing boats 
carrying about 150,000 people. 
  We have also taken advantage 
of our superiority to actively attract Taiwan capital to 
Zhejiang. Taiwan accounts for roughly 30 percent of all foreign 
capital invested in Zhejiang. Hong Kong still tops foreign 
investors in Zhejiang. There is a strong presence in Zhejiang of 
Hong Kong businessmen who are of Ningbo origin. Some 1,100 
Taiwan-funded enterprises have invested $2.4 billion in 
Zhejiang. Because it is difficult to identify some of the 
Taiwan-funded enterprises, we tend to consider them 
foreign-funded enterprises, not Taiwan-funded ones. 
  I have met a lot of the friends from Taiwan. I got the 
feeling that most of them, whether they are upper- or 
middle-class or businessmen, want more cooperation and exchanges 
between the two sides of the strait. Another thing that struck 
me is that most of the friends from Taiwan are very astute and 
are rather pragmatic. The younger generation is particularly 
well-educated. I should also say that most of the Taiwan-funded 
enterprises are well-managed. 
  [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] We know there are many Taiwan fishermen 
operating in the East China fishing zone and near the Zhoushan 
archipelago. Are there many fishing disputes? How do you 
handle these disputes? 
  [Li] Many Taiwan fishermen fish in the East China fishing 
zone. Many people from Zhejiang work aboard Taiwan fishing 
boats. Because Zhejiang has a good fishing foundation and 
because the labor quality of Zhejiang fishermen is rather high, 
Taiwan fishing boats like to hire fishermen from our Zhejiang. 
  Generally speaking, the relationship between Zhejiang and 
Taiwan fishermen is good. We have set up Taiwan compatriot 
reception centers along coastal areas for Taiwan fishermen who 
come to fish and who seek supplies. The greatest number of and 
the largest Taiwan compatriot reception centers can be found at 
Shaoshan Bay, near Ningbo. I have been there. The facilities 
there are quite good. There are hospitals, rest areas, and 
places that supply reasonably priced diesel oil and nonstaple 
foods. The management of the reception centers is also good. 
In recent years, Zhejiang's coastal areas have received a total 
of 150,000 Taiwan fishermen and have treated some 2,000 injured 
fishermen and some 300 seriously ill fishermen. I once visited 
injured and sick Taiwan fishermen at the hospital. There were 
also photos and newspaper reports about their treatment at the 
hospital. Taiwan fishermen are generally satisfied with their 
reception at the reception centers. 
  There have indeed been some small frictions and small 
disputes between Zhejiang and Taiwan fishermen while fishing. 
Sometimes disputes erupt following the collision of fishing 
boats and the tangling of fishing nets due to a lack of the 
clear definition of navigational rights of way. Some instances 
of small-scale trade along coastal areas also give rise to some 
banned pornographic publications and lowbrow and unhealthy audio 
and visual products and books making their way to Zhejiang. 
[passage omitted on Zhejiang's per capita income] 
  [CHUNG KUO SHI PAO] Do you see a possibility of cooperation 
between Zhejiang and Taiwan in the areas of nuclear power 
generation, the disposal of nuclear waste, and in agriculture 
and fisheries? 
  [Li] I should say there are great possibilities as well as 
bright prospects for cooperation in those areas. Because of 
overfishing, marine resources in the East China Sea fishing zone 
are gradually being depleted. But, because Zhejiang has a long 
coast, there are great potentials for developing aquaculture 
along the coast. Zhejiang fishermen sell some of their catch to 
Taiwan on the open sea, but most of their catch is exported to 
Japan and Hong Kong. If the friends from Taiwan are interested 
in nuclear power generation, we welcome their investment in 
Zhejiang. We understand that many Taiwan friends invest in 
Zhejiang's farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries. 
We welcome Taiwan investment. I believe that there are great 
prospects for cooperation.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 27 (CNS)--The Guangdong provincial 
government has decided to make 50 million kilograms of reserved 
grain available in the market in order to keep the price under 
control and to make room for storage of summer grain crop. 
  The Guangdong government has since late last year 
implemented 
the instruction given by the state to stabilize grain and oil 
prices to guarantee supply which was generally in a stablestate 
across the province. The grain stock was so abundant that the 
price was kept at about RMB [renminbi] 100 for every 50 
kilograms of rice. As now is a time when the rural grain supply 
is temporarily in short supply and the summer grain crop is 
about to be put into storage, the provincial government decided 
to fill the market with 50 million kilograms of reserved grain 
to ensure an adequate food supply while 250 million kilograms of 
grain allocated by the state to the province isalso in place in 
the market.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 26 (CNS)--The Guangzhou Municipal 
Government yesterday held a work meeting on the "vegetable 
basket" project to adopt measures to control main food prices of 
both the production and circulation sectors. 
  The measures to be taken include the following: With regard 
to the supply of vegetables, the land area for basic vegetables 
should be set up in Conghua and Zengcheng counties. Other 
vegetable bases for supplies in the slack season will be set up 
in the countries, Qingyuan, Fogang, Conghua and Fanyu. The 
authorities are striving for the total vegetable supply this 
year to be 900 million kilograms and plan to set up a 
large-scale vegetable processing plant in the city's suburbs. 
  As for the supply of meat, poultry and eggs, some 45,000 
head 
of pigs will be bred for the market, over 100 million fowls are 
expected to go to market and 8,000 tonnes of frozen meat and two 
million kilograms of fresh eggs will be made reserves for market. 
  As for the supply of aquatic products, more than 30,000 mu 
of 
fish ponds will be created on flood plains and low-yield land 
and 10,000 mu of low-yield fish ponds will be renovated. 
Fishery will be greatly developed and 2,000 tonnes of fish will 
be stored for market supply.

  [Text] Huizhou, April 26 (CNS) -- A task force comprising 
the departments of labour, public security, industry and 
commerce, and civil administration, as well as the construction 
commission in Huizhou, has recently been set up for an overhaul 
of labour employment in the city in order to safeguard the 
obeying of laws and regulations and the interests and rights of 
workers. 
  Labour disputes have recently been more and more frequent in 
Huizhou with its rapid economic development. Violation of 
labour laws and regulations has been seen in foreign-funded and 
privately- owned enterprises including failure to apply for 
labour recruitment, disregard of labour contracts and 
infringement of workers' interests and rights. Statistics show 
that the city dealt with 346 labour disputes in 1993 alone, a 
more than 16 percent rise over the year before, involving 5,800 
workers or an increase of over 100 percent. The city in response 
established a supervisory group last year to handle disputes. 
The group issued warnings and imposed punishments on 
enterprises found in breach of relevant regulations. It 
recovered for workers RMB 1.2 million, which included back pay 
as well as pay for sick leave, medical expenses and compensation 
for injuries at work totalling RMB 120,000, all of which should 
have been paid by the employers. 
  Since the labour law and regulations are yet to be improved 
in addition to unsound supervisory bodies, the labour and 
management conflict was very complicated and labour disputes 
were frequent. The Huizhou Government made great efforts in 
launching a one-month campaign for a total overhaul of labour 
employment in the city in a bid to put in order relations 
between labour and management, protect the legitimate rights of 
workers and promote improvement of enterprises. The campaign 
covered a wide variety of enterprises with the emphasis on 
township enterprises, foreign-funded enterprises, 
privately-owned enterprises and construction enterprises.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 27 (XINHUA)--The rich islands along 
the coast of Guangdong Province in south China, have attracted 
more and more domestic and foreign investors. 
  The largest investment project is a 120-billion-yuan (15 
billion U.S. dollars) iron and steel complex, in whose building 
foreign investors are allied with the Zhanjiang and Shanghai 
Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex, one of the largest and most 
up-to-date in China. 
  The project, dubbed "The Second Baoshan Iron and Steel 
Complex", will be constructed on Zhanjiang's 286 sq km Donghai 
Island, China's fifth largest. Rich in water resources for 
industrial use, the island has excellent natural conditions for 
seaports. 
  Up to now a 28 km highway has been constructed. Over 190 
joint ventures have been established with domestic and foreign 
investors. 
  Hailing Island, part of Yangjiang City, is another ideal 
place for investors. Over ten multi-million dollar projects are 
under construction or have been proposed. The island attracted 
some 700,000 tourists last year. 
  Gaolan Island and Heng Qin Island have also been listed as 
key development zones in Guangdong. Two 20,000-tonnage harbors 
have been constructed at Gaolan Island and a 50,000-tonnage 
container harbor and another 100,000-tonnage coal harbor are 
being designed. 
  Heng Qin Island, which is close to Macao, will be turned 
into 
a commercial, tourist and storage center, according to 
provincial officials. 
  Other booming islands include Nanao Island in Shantou, 
Wanshan archipelago in Zhuhai, Shanchuan Island and Xiachuan 
Island in Taishan City.

  [Text] Guangzhou's foreign-related economy and foreign 
trade have been developing in a healthy way. By the end of 
March this year, another group of 699 contracts, using foreign 
capital valued at $3.38 billion, had been signed throughout the 
city, an increase 4.6 percent over the same period last year. 
In addition, foreign capital totalling $489 million actually 
had been used, 80.8 percent more than in the same period last 
year. The city's export volume reached $820 million, 
registering a 23 percent increase over the corresponding period 
last year. 
  Last year, the development of Guangzhou's foreign-related 
economy and foreign trade were marked by the following five main 
features: 1) The actual amount of invested capital increased by 
a greater margin owing to direct investment by foreign 
businessmen; 2) The scale of investment was larger and the 
quality of investment projects was higher; 3) The areas in which 
foreign businessmen made direct investments achieved diversified 
development; 4) There was a smooth transition of foreign trade 
and export to a new system, and a faster increase in exports, 
changing the previous situation of insufficient exports at the 
beginning of the year, and excessive increases at the end of the 
year; 5) New progress was made in opening up a diversified 
market. During the first quarter, Guangzhou examined and 
approved the establishment of three enterprises from abroad, and 
six enterprises were registered.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuan Hsiu-hsien (5913 4423 6343): "Guangdong </F>
Makes Experiment on Transfer of Stock Rights of Public 
Utilities"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 8 Apr (HSIN WAN PAO)--This reporter has 
learned from departments concerned that not long ago, the 
Guangzhou Urban Administration and Guangzhou Public Utility 
Administration's Tap Water Company signed letters of intent with 
the Guotai International Group to transfer, within set time, 
some of the stock rights of bridges, tunnels, and waterworks in 
Guangzhou and to jointly run, administer, and construct new 
bridges and waterworks. It was the first time in the country 
that some of the stock rights of public utilities had been 
transferred. 
  Transferring some of the stock rights of public utilities 
will help ease the financial pressure on the city government and 
will blaze a new trail in raising funds for public utility 
construction, thus transforming existing urban public utilities 
from "immovables" into "movables," and changing "lifeless money" 
into "living money." Moreover, it also can help transform urban 
public utilities into a form of commodity so as to lift some of 
the enterprises from the predicament of operating in the red 
over a long period of time. 
  It has been learned that the main content of the letters of 
intent was that the Guotai International Group would buy the 
Guangzhou People's Bridge, the Zhuhai Bridge, the Haiyin Bridge, 
the Guangzhou Main Bridge, the Zhu Jiang Tunnel, and 60 percent 
of the property ownership rights of the waterworks in Xicun, 
Shimen, and Xintang.

  [Text] According to statistics released recently by the 
provincial statistics bureau, the living expenditure income of 
the province's urban population ranked first among the nine 
coastal provinces and cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, and 
Tianjin. In terms of [words indistinct], although city dwellers 
in the province had an average per capita net income of 4,240 
yuan or so this year, ranking first among the nine provinces and 
cities, they spent a very large portion of their income, with 
average per capita spending 71 percent higher than the average 
level among the nine provinces and cities. Overall, the living 
expenditure level of the province's urban population belongs to 
an intermediate one in the nine provinces and cities. 
  The rumor that city dwellers in Guangdong have the highest 
consumption level in the country is not a fact. It is said that 
Guangdong's relatively high price levels have to do with this 
phenomenon.

  [Text] Guangzhou, April 27 (CNS)--Guangzhou, capital of 
Guangdong Province, made sound achievements in fighting against 
fake and inferior-quality commodities in the first quarter this 
year with 203 cases of this kind being investigated and 136 of

departments have been involved in the campaign with a variety of 
goods with a face value of RMB 1.36 million including 
foodstuffs, cigarettes, wine, garments, household electrical 
appliances and compact discs being confiscated while on eight 
occasions destruction of such commodities have been held 
publicly and 18 exhibitions of such commodities have been 
staged. In addition, nearly 30 000 leaflets have been printed

<F P=106> ["Special Dispatch" by staff reporter Hu Hsiao-i (5170 2556 </F>
0308): "Guangdong Organizes Army-Police Joint Discipline Teams 
to Investigate Bogus Army, Police Vehicles"] 
  [Text] Guangzhou, 25 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--Commencing 
tomorrow, the Guangzhou Military Region, Guangdong Military 
District, and Guangdong Public Security Department will take 
joint action to crack down on the use of bogus Army and police 
vehicles. 
  The 20 joint disciplinary teams, each composed of 80 men, 
have been organized jointly by the Guangzhou Military Region, 
Guangdong Military District, and Guangdong Public Security 
Department, will leave Guangzhou tomorrow for the 
Guangzhou-Conghua, Guangzhou-Shenzhen, Guangzhou-Shantou, and 
Guangzhou-Nanhai highways to check the violation of regulations 
by military and police vehicles and crack down on the illegal 
use of bogus military and police vehicles. 
  This is the third unified action following the ones in 1991 
and 1993 against vehicles with special plates. The current 
action will be the largest in scale and will last a long 
time--until the conclusion of the struggle against the theft of 
motorcycles and vehicles. The headquarters--which will have 
Chen Shaoji, director of the Public Security Department, as its 
head and an official in charge of the Guangzhou Military Region 
as deputy head--will continue to exist and exercise management 
over special vehicle plates. 
  This reporter also learned from the Guangdong Public 
Security 
Department that since moves were taken to counter the theft of 
motorcycles and vehicles on 1 April, the number of stolen 
vehicles has dropped by two-thirds and that of motorcycles has 
dropped by 50 percent. 
  Figures provided by the Public Security Department indicated 
that, by 20 April, the province arrested a total of 1,781 
persons involved in stealing motorcycles and vehicles, cracked 
2,086 theft cases (12 of which involved murder), uncovered 396 
rings (which had 1,600 members) involved in stealing and selling 
stolen vehicles, recovered 1,560 stolen vehicles and motorcycles 
(267 vehicles and 1,293 motorcycles), smashed 120 dens which 
sold the stolen goods, and demolished 4 underground factories 
which produced counterfeit license plates. Moreover, a total of 
351 shops were ordered to close down for selling remodeled and 
stolen cars, and the licenses of 29 other shops were revoked. 
An official from the Guangdong Public Security Department said 
that, thanks to the precautions and stern measures taken against 
the criminal activities, the sharp rise in the theft of 
motorcycles and vehicles in Guangdong has been brought under 
control. In the first quarter of this year, the province lost 
an average of 16 vehicles and 72 motorcycles every day. Since 
April, the figure has dropped to 5.4 vehicles and 42 motorcycles 
a day, representing a drop of two-thirds and 50 percent 
respectively. Except for Zhuhai, where the crime rate remained 
the same, the crime rate in 19 cities throughout the province 
dropped by varying degrees. 
  Since launching the special struggle, public security organs 
have transferred large number of policemen to react promptly to 
ongoing criminal cases and investigate and crack these cases as 
quickly as possible. They have acted to intercept and examine 
vehicles, and conduct patrols, ambushes, and general check-ups. 
The taxi looting incident that took place on 3 April in Foshan, 
and the car theft and murder that took place on 10 April in 
Maomin were both cracked within the short period of 3 and 12 
hours respectively. The primary objective of the move was to 
uncover crime rings. The Zengcheng Public Security Bureau 
spotted a very large ring in early April, which had stolen 29 
vehicles and motorcycles worth 9 million yuan. The bureau has 
recovered 12 vehicles, 3 motorcycles, and over 200,000 yuan of 
ill-gotten money. 
  The work of returning recovered stolen vehicles and 
motorcycles to their owners also started recently. Shenzhen 
took the lead and returned 200 motorcycles and 78 vehicles to 
their owners on 23 April. Over the next three days, Guangzhou 
will also follow suit and set up centers at various districts to 
return stolen goods to their owners.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon [18 April], the provincial 
leading group for two-support work held its seventh plenary 
meeting, at which it was stressed that it is necessary to offer 
ever better leadership to the two-support work, continuously 
strengthen the unity between the Army and the government and 
between the Army and the people, and promote our province's 
social stability and the development of its economic 
construction. 
  In attendance at the meeting were Ruan Chongwu, secretary of 
the provincial party committee, governor, and director of the 
provincial leading group for two-support work;, Chen Suhou, vice 
governor and deputy director of the leading group;, Zhou 
Chuantong, political commissar of the Hainan Provincial Military 
District and deputy director of the leading group; and Wu 
Fenglong, deputy political commissar of the military district 
and deputy director of the leading group. 
  As for two-support work in 1994, the meeting discussed such 
issues as further enhancing understanding and offering better 
leadership to two-support work, holding a meeting to name 
provincial-level model cities and counties in two-support work, 
and recommending national-level model cities and counties in 
two-support work. The meeting stressed that party committees 
and governments at all levels must attach importance to 
two-support work from the heights of safeguarding political and 
social stability, and must place it on the agenda. They must 
genuinely ensure that they will take up the work personally, 
personally solve difficult problems with the work, personally 
examine and approve documents concerning the work, and try their 
best to attend major activities involving Army and local 
concerns. They must give wider publicity to the work and do a 
good job in propaganda and education in the work using multiple 
forms and channels. The meeting pointed out that this year's 
two-support work must face the grass-roots units, lay stress on 
practical results, open up more fields of endeavor, and enrich 
the contents of the work so that it will become 
institutionalized, standardized, and socialized. 
  Ruan Chongwu spoke at the meeting. He affirmed the 
achievements scored last year in such areas of the province's 
two-support work such as the Army, the police, and the people 
taking an active part in joint defense, safeguarding social 
stability, protecting military facilities, and rectifying 
traffic order. He hoped that in the days to come, a good job in 
the work regarding these aspects would continue to be done, that 
practical results would be stressed, that more solid work would 
be done, and that the province's two-support work would be 
carried out in a down-to-earth manner. 
  In the course of its discussions, the meeting adopted 
suggestions for Hainan Province's implementation of management 
methods for naming model two-support cities and counties, and 
for setting out the Hainan Province's standards for model 
cities, counties, and districts in supporting the Army and 
giving preferential treatment to families of soldiers, as well 
as supporting the government and cherishing the people. It also 
held a by-election for a deputy director and a member of the 
provincial leading group for two- support work. 
  The person in charge of the two-support work office reported 
to the meeting on the spirit of the national work meeting of 
two- support work office directors at the provincial level.

  [Text] A spokesman from the provincial statistics bureau 
briefed news units yesterday afternoon on Hubei's economic 
situation in the first quarter of 1994 and made suggestions for 
promoting the province's economic development. He said: On the 
whole, our province's economy operated normally in the first 
quarter of the year, and was characterized mainly by the 
following facts: spring plowing got off to a good start; 
production of grain and edible oil was stable; industrial 
production maintained a momentum of comparatively rapid growth; 
fueled by key construction projects, fixed-asset investment 
increased quite rapidly; the consumer goods market grew 
steadily; the financial situation was fairly stable; money 
lending was put under strict control; and in foreign trade, the 
volume of exports was higher than in the same period last year. 
  With regard to the problems cropping up in current economic 
operation, the spokesman said: The chief reasons are that 
commodity prices have climbed continuously; state-owned 
enterprises have been beset with difficulties in production and 
operation; and a relatively great number of enterprises has 
partially or completely suspended production. 
  The provincial statistics bureau suggested that to promote 
the development of the province's national economy and attain 
the goals set by the provincial party committee for this year: 
  1. It is necessary to develop markets, maintain rapid and 
effective economic growth, closely follow market changes and 
developments, do a good job in readjusting the product mix by 
gearing to market demand, organize production by centering on 
the market, make greater efforts to promote sales, and ensure 
that production is linked with sales and that the economy 
develops rapidly and effectively. 
  2. It is necessary to strengthen price supervision and 
inspection, and to curb excessively rapid price increases. 
Apart from strengthening price supervision and inspection, 
establishing a system under which goods are sold at the prices 
marked, and maintaining a normal price order, the province 
should focus on increasing residents' income, properly 
developing production of agricultural means of production and 
the Shopping Basket Project, and should ensure a stable supply 
of basic daily-use consumer goods so as the boost residents' 
capability to withstand the strains resulting from price reform. 
  3. It is necessary to revitalize state-owned enterprises and 
energetically help them get out of the present depressing 
situation. For this purpose: 1) We should focus our efforts on 
alleviating the problem of fund strains among enterprises, 
ensure the supply of enterprise production funds, and establish 
a normal production and operation order; 2) In order to create 
favorable conditions for state-owned enterprises to develop, we 
should study and solve the problem of essentially increased tax 
burdens resulting from the policy of regulating tax reductions 
and exemptions which was implemented among enterprises following 
the introduction of tax reform. 
  4. It is necessary to make great efforts to help loss-making 
enterprises turn losses into profits, and help enterprises that 
have partially or completely suspended production to increase 
their ability to overcome adversity through greater production; 
gradually to accumulate experience by conducting experiments in 
selling and leasing small enterprises, and introducing the 
reform of allowing state-owned enterprises to be run by the 
non-governmental sector; and to improve operational regulations 
so as to deepen enterprise reform.

  [Excerpts] In Wuchang yesterday afternoon, the provincial 
party committee and government held a meeting on the development 
of individual and private economies. [passage omitted] 
  The meeting was presided over by Governor Jia Zhijie, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee. In attendance were 
Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee 
and chairman of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's 
Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; Vice Governor Chen 
Shuiwen; and Ping Linbo, vice chairman of the CPPCC provincial 
committee. Chairman Hui Liangyu delivered an important speech 
and Chen Shuiwen [words indistinct] on the province's 
development of individual and private economies. 
  The meeting pointed out that last year, the province 
witnessed an expansion in the individual and private economies. 
[words indistinct] A number of counties and cities saw rapid 
development in their economies. Twenty-two counties, cities, 
and districts had more than 10,000 individual industrial and 
commercial businesses; 13 counties, cities, and districts had 
more than 100 privately run enterprises; and individually and 
privately run businesses in 46 counties, cities, and districts 
had an output value and business volume of more than 100 million 
yuan, and the individually and privately run businesses in 
Xiantao and Tianmen had more than 1 billion yuan in output value 
and business volume. Individually and privately run enterprises 
have become a new important force in the local economy, though 
the individual and private economies remain weak links in the 
province's economy. 
  The meeting stressed that the guiding thinking on developing 
the individual and private economies this year is to further and 
earnestly implement the party Central Committee's policy of 
encouraging and supporting the development of the individual and 
private industries, to deepen reform, to offer specific 
guidance, and to combine protection of enthusiasm with guidance 
of development, with readjustment of the industrial structure 
and the product mix, with maintenance of value and appreciation 
of state-owned assets, and with the urbanization process. 
[passage omitted] 
  1. Principal leaders of governments at all levels and 
persons in charge of the departments concerned must further 
enhance their understanding and achieve unity in thinking. The 
province's individual and private economies are inadequately, 
rather than sufficiently developed. From the experiences of 
advanced localities in our province, we can see that paying 
attention to the development of the individual and private 
economies not only will help bring opportunities for their 
growth and innovative development,but also will promote the 
development of the state-owned and collective economies. The 
key to the development of the individual and private economies 
lies in leadership, and the responsibility for their development 
lies with leadership. [passage omitted] 
  2. Policies should be further relaxed, and specific measures 
should be implemented effectively. The policies of the 
provincial party committee and government for the development of 
the individual and private economies should be implemented from 
top to bottom. [passage omitted] 
  The provincial people's congress will decide on the taxation 
policy toward the individual and private economies in the form 
of laws and regulations, and will place the task in this year's 
plan for enactment of local laws. The provincial government 
also will work out relevant laws and regulations so as to 
provide a legal guarantee for the legitimate rights and 
interests of individually or privately run enterprises. 
Localities are encouraged to formulate corresponding 
administrative regulations. 
  3. Production and operation links should be improved 
further, the principle of investors reaping the benefits from 
their investments should be upheld, and individual industrial 
and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises should 
be encouraged to invest in the construction of markets. 
[passage omitted] 
  4. It is necessary to further strengthen leadership, 
organize relevant departments to jointly manage the development 
of the individual and private economies, earnestly assign this 
year's development tasks to all sides concerned under a 
responsibility system under which tasks are assigned on a 
quarterly basis and task completion is assessed at the year's 
end. [passage omitted] 
  Present at the meeting were persons in charge of the 
provincial departments concerned; members of the provincial 
leading group for the development of the individual and private 
economies; [words indistinct]; principal leaders of the party 
committees and governments of various prefectures, autonomous 
prefectures, cities, and counties; government officials in 
charge of the development of the individual and private 
economies; members of local leading groups for the private 
economy; and persons in charge of the industrial and commercial, 
financial, personnel and labor, auditing, banking, [words 
indistinct] departments. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In the first quarter, our province's economy 
maintained its proper growth. From January to March, the GDP of 
the whole province reached 23.855 billion yuan, an increase of 
9.5 percent over same period last year, if calculated in terms 
of comparable prices. Primary industry increased by 5.2 
percent, secondary industry by 13 percent, and tertiary industry 
by 8.4 percent. Our reporter learned this from a news briefing 
held by the provincial statistics bureau. 
  During the first quarter, industrial production and sales 
maintained a faster growth. Total production output value of 
industrial enterprises at and above the township level reached 
21.183 billion yuan, registering an increase of 13.3 percent 
over same period last year. Output value of light industry was 
8.65 billion yuan, up 12.9 percent. Output value of heavy 
industry reached 12.533 billion yuan, a rise of 13.6 percent. 
  Total production output value of agriculture reached 7.51 
billion yuan, an increase of 9.2 percent over the corresponding 
period last year. During the first quarter, total production 
output value of town and township enterprises amounted to 27.324 
billion yuan, 90.1 percent more than that of the same period 
last year. The increase in fixed-asset investment rose to 2.229 
billion yuan, an increase of 50.1 percent over the same period 
last year. 
  The consumer goods market was very active. During the first 
quarter, retail sales of social consumer goods reached 13.642 
billion yuan, up 21 percent over the corresponding period last 
year. Buying and selling was down on the means-of-production 
market. 
  During the first quarter, the following problems also 
existed 
in the economic situation throughout the province: 1) 
Consumption funds grew too rapidly, causing commodity prices to 
increase by a wider margin; 2) Enterprises' economic efficiency 
dropped, the deficits of industries with poor performance 
increased, and the amount of their losses rose by a wider 
margin; 3) Contradictions between supply and demand of funds 
still existed, affecting the production and operations of some 
enterprises.

Economic Trend Scored in the First Quarter"] 
  [Text] According to the reporter's 19 April dispatch from 
the third plenum of the municipal people's government, the 
municipality maintained a good trend of sustained, rapid, and 
healthy development in the national economy in the first quarter 
of this year. 
  The gross domestic product in the first quarter continued to 
increase and reached 18.3 billion yuan that showed a 12.7 
percent increase calculated in terms of comparable prices over 
1993. Of this increase, the increased value of primary industry 
showed a 567 million yuan and 4 percent increase over 1993; that 
of secondary industry showed an 8.972 billion yuan and 13.5 
percent increase over 1993; and that of tertiary industry showed 
an 8.77 billion yuan and 13.2 percent increase over 1993 
(accounting for 47.9 percent in the gross domestic product). 
  The output of farm and sideline products further showed an

  Urban construction was accelerated and the construction of 
key projects achieved smooth progress. Funds were better and 
adequately used for the places and projects. The progress in 
rebuilding dangerous houses and building houses with healthy 
facilities was accelerated. Financial resources were 
concentrated on ensuring the demands for building the west 
passenger train station, the third northwest ring road, and the 
Beijing ethylene plant. Financial revenues showed a stable 
increase and bank deposits increased on a large scale. 
Financial revenues reached 801 million yuan and showed a 69.58 
million yuan and 9.51 percent increase calculated in terms of 
the same items over 1993. Financial expenses reached 1.84 
billion yuan and showed a 57.6 percent increase over 1993. Bank 
deposits showed an accelerated increase. At the end of March, 
the volume of bank deposits reached 186.07 billion yuan and 
showed a 21.77 billion yuan increase over 1993, topping the 
previous peak. 
  The program of opening up was further broadened. Exports in 
foreign trade reached $428 million and showed a 36.3 percent 
increase over 1993. The number of newly approved three types of 
foreign-funded enterprises reached 637 -- whose agreements 
involved $1.05 billion of foreign capital. 
  Reforms in various fields achieved smooth progress. The 
progress of conducting several important reforms successively 
assigned by the state was smooth in the municipality. Of these 
reforms progress in the tax system, which exerts the largest 
influence and involves the widest range of social circles, and 
whose procedure is complicated, was relatively smooth in the 
municipality.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA)--Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan 
today invited banks from Japan and other countries to open 
subsidiaries in China's capital. 
  In a meeting with Kuniji Miyazaki, chairman of the Daiichi 
Kangyo Bank of Japan, Li said that China was now shifting to a 
market economy, so it needed to have a variety of means to raise 
money. 
  He said that through mutual exchanges, overseas business 
people would certainly enhance their confidence in investing in 
China. 
  "I am optimistic that Japanese banks will open branches in 
Beijing," he told Miyazaki and his party. 
  Kuniji Miyazaki, who visited Beijing two years ago, said 
that 
during his current visit he wishes to discuss cooperation with 
his Chinese colleagues in banking reform. 
  He said that his bank plans to hold financial symposiums in 
Shanghai and in Dalian, Liaoning Province. 
  "I am sure that China will score even greater achievements 
in 
its economic construction," he said. 
  The Daiichi Kangyo Bank, the largest commercial bank in 
Japan, had raised a total of 1.8 billion U.S. dollars for China 
by the end of 1993. 
  It currently has a branch in Shanghai and offices in 
Beijing, 
Dalian, Xiamen and Guangzhou.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA)--A "family guidance 
program" jointly sponsored by Beijing Municipal Education 
Bureau, Beijing Federation of Women and Beijing Family Education 
Society is to be carried out in Beijing. 
  An official in charge of the program said that the aim is to 
enhance family education and improve the quality of the 
education. 
  The program will reach its climax on May 15 to mark the 
"International Family Day" which has been set by the United 
Nations. 
  Beijing has about 2.35 million children aged under 14 years. 
  Experts said that it is an important task to undertake 
family 
education among them. 
  The program will help parents to learn the physiological and 
psychological characteristics of children under the age of 14, 
and to master scientific education methods to answer children's 
questions in their growing-up process. 
  The program will also promote the idea of families improving 
their structure and becoming a favorable environment for the 
sake of children's healthy growth. 
  The program will run training schools for parents in 
communities, get special articles and programs put out in the 
media, publish books and open consultancy services to improve 
family education. 
  Beijing has now set up thousands of "schools for parents," 
and also has two special newspapers on family education. 
  In 1980, Beijing Family Education Society was set up and in 
1984, the city set up a Family Education Consultancy Center 
which has received 15,500 visits and 4,000 phone calls from 
parents.

  [Text] The national conference on the political work of 
courts was held in Tianjin on 19 April. The main tasks of this 
conference were to take the guidelines of the 14th party 
congress and the third plenary session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee as the guidance, implement the relevant plans of the 
national propaganda and ideological work conference, the third 
plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission, 
and the national conference of higher people's court presidents, 
sum up and review the political work of courts during the 
previous period, explore new methods and new ways for carrying 
out political work of courts that suit the market economic 
structure, comprehensively strengthen and improve the political 
work of courts, and actively press ahead with the building of 
court contingents. 
  Municipal leaders Gao Dezhan, Liu Fengyan, Song Pingshun, 
and 
Zhang Baifeng, president of the Tianjin Municipal Higher 
People's Court, attended the conference. 
  Gao Changli, deputy secretary of the leading party group of 
the Supreme People's Court and executive vice president; Xie 
Anshan, vice president of the Supreme People's Court and 
chairman of the political department; Liu Fahe, head of the 
discipline inspection group of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission stationed in the Supreme People's Court; and 
responsible comrades of higher people's courts of various 
provinces, cities, and autonomous regions attended the 
conference. 
  On behalf of the municipal party committee and the municipal 
government, Gao Dezhan extended warm congratulations to the 
conference and warm welcome to responsible comrades of courts 
attending the conference from all parts of the country. 
  He said: At present, China's reform, opening up, and 
modernization drive have entered a new development stage. 
Convening this conference under the new situation is of major 
and practical significance in raising the political quality of 
court contingents and strengthening political work, party style, 
and administrative honesty. During recent years, under the 
guidance of the Supreme People's court, courts at all levels 
across Tianjin acted in close connection with the central task 
of economic construction, submitted their work to and served 
this central task, and achieved great achievements in judicial 
work and building contingents. The convocation of this 
conference in Tianjin is a very good chance for this 
municipality. It is necessary to learn from comrades from all 
localities, exchange views with them, conscientiously implement 
the conference guidelines, enhance the court work of Tianjin to 
a new height, and make greater contributions to reform, 
development, and stability. 
  In his speech, Xie Anshan pointed out: At present and for 
some time to come, the major tasks of courts across the country 
in carrying out political and ideological work are to take the 
guidelines of the 14th party congress as the guidance, to arm 
the broad masses of cadres and policemen with Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the great pioneering spirit, strive to 
improve their political and professional quality, fully mobilize 
their work enthusiasm and initiative, intensify their awareness, 
steadfastness, and creativity in implementing the party's basic 
line, and ensure that laws will be strictly enforced in an 
effort to provide a strong ideological guarantee for 
comprehensively fulfilling all work tasks of courts. He 
stressed: At present, special efforts should be made to solve 
the issues on the understanding, basic ideas, and methods for 
successfully carrying out political and ideological work under 
the market economic conditions. It is necessary to create a 
brand-new situation in the political work of the people's courts 
and make new contributions to building a court contingent with 
strong fighting capacity that can be greatly trusted by the 
party and the people and guaranteeing the comprehensive 
fulfillment of all work tasks of courts. 
  At the conference, Liu Fahe worked out plans for carrying 
out 
the 1994 anticorruption tasks of courts so as to guarantee 
honesty and fairness in enforcing laws and to deeply conduct 
anticorruption struggle among courts, and proposed measures for 
courts and discipline inspection and supervisory organs to 
strengthen self- development in the course of launching 
anticorruption struggle.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 26 (XINHUA)--The first phase of 
construction of a rare-earth export center is expected to be 
completed in Tianjin port shortly. 
  Funded by Baotou Steel and the Rare Earth Corporation of the 
Baotou Iron and Steel Company, the project will turn Tianjin 
Port into the largest Chinese port to export rare-earth. 
  Three workshops and two warehouses, plus an office building, 
have already been constructed in the free trade zone near 
Tianjin Port. 
  The center will deal with all export and transport business 
of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company. 
  With the largest proportion of the deposits of rare-earth in 
the country, Baotou Iron and Steel Company in the Inner Mongolia 
Autonomous Region, exports large amounts of rare earth every 
year. 
  In 1992, the company decided to invest 30 million yuan in 
Tianjin's free trade zone to set up an industry and trade 
corporation of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, which is in charge 
of the construction of the center. 
  Huang Jianhua, deputy manager of the newly-established 
corporation, said that during the construction period, the 
corporation has exported rare-earth whose value was more than 6 
million U.S. dollars. 
  He said that by the end of 1995, about 60 million tons of 
rare- earth will have been exported to other countries through 
the center. 
  He said that his corporation will import equipment worth 170 
million U.S. dollars through the center.

  [Text] Hangzhou, April 27 (CNS) -- The Qiandao Lake 
incident in which a group of Taiwan tourists died will be dealt 
with by the Hangzhou Intermediate People's Court and the 
Zhejiang Higher People's Court, the Director of the Zhejiang 
branch of the Taiwan Affairs Office Mr. Ma Guangwu said in an 
interview with the Taiwan news media. He stressed that the case 
would go to court as scheduled no matter when the 
representatives of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) of 
Taiwan came. The three suspects will stand trial at a time the 
official has not yet disclosed, simply noting that the start of 
the trial would not be deferred for too long a period. 
  Mr. Ma said that as the case involved Taiwan compatriots as 
well as Mainland persons, the trial would in no way be conducted 
to appease the anger shown by the Taiwan side. He added that 
whether the SEF representatives came was not a factor and the 
case would go ahead as scheduled. 
  He revealed that the Zhejiang authorities had learned a 
lesson from the incident and they called departments of travel, 
transport and public security to a meeting on improvement of 
travel safety. A conference held in the province on tourist 
safety will make public its results following the arrival of the 
SEF personnel. 
  In another development, Chairman of the "Mainland Affairs 
Council" of the "Executive Yuan" of Taiwan Mr. Huang Kum-huei 
and the Secretary General of SEF Mr. Chiao Jen-ho, in response 
to a letter by the Mainland Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) inviting SEF to send personnel to Hangzhou 
to look into the case, said that the Taiwan side accepted in 
principle the invitation. The council has asked SEF to reply to 
the proposal by ARATS and held consultations today for a final 
decision on the invitation. 
  The "Minister of Economic Affairs" of Taiwan Mr. Chiang 
Pin-kung said yesterday that following the announcement 
regarding dealing with the case by the Mainland side, the true 
picture of the incident was tending to become clearer. He 
stressed that cross-strait economic exchange and trade should 
return to normal step by step.

  [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The 
relevant department in Beijing has disclosed that preparations 
for legal procedures in the Qiandao Lake robbery and murder case 
have been completed and a public trial has been scheduled for 10 
May in Hangzhou. 
  During the trial, families of the victims and Taiwan crime 
experts will be allowed to attend, and the relevant departments 
will report details of the case to the court. A few days ago, 
the mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan 
Strait invited Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation and relevant 
experts to come to Hangzhou before 4 May to listen to reports on 
the case. 
  Hong Kong's WEN WEI PO reported that Beijing's high-level 
leadership has paid close attention to the Qiandao Lake case and 
has taken it into serious account: it has meticulously attended 
to the entire investigation process. When the relevant 
department reported the verification of the suspects' 
identities, it produced particular evidence which had been 
obtained through identifying their fingerprints. Because the 
Hairui had been burned and sprayed with water and the scene had 
been seriously destroyed, it was very hard to obtain 
fingerprints. But after careful checks on the entire ship by 
experts, the suspects' fingerprints, which had been left on the 
ship when they climbed over from their motorboat, were found.

  [Text] Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing said on 26 April 
that the Chinese Government will draw a lesson from the recent 
Qiandao Hu incident, and will intensify crackdown on crime and 
strengthen the management of social order. 
  Li Lanqing made the above remark when meeting and discussing 
tourism industry with An Tong-son, chairman of the Committees on 
Commerce, Industry, and Resources of the Republic of Korea 
National Assembly. 
  He said: The Qiandao Hu case was a chance occurrence. This 
criminal case has been solved. 
  He expressed regrets and pains over the occurrence of the 
incident. However, he believed that some people in Taiwan are 
exploiting it to stir up a hue and cry and to pursue ulterior 
motives. 
  He said the incident will have little effect on China's 
tourism industry, adding that overall the safety rate of 
sightseeing in China is relatively high as compared with other 
countries in the world.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A delegation from 
the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) is to arrive 
in Hangzhou before this Saturday [30 April] to hear briefings on 
the "Qiandao Lake accident" by mainland experts, according to an 
announcement by Taiwan's "Mainland Working Committee of the 
Executive Yuan". 
  Since the cause of the Qiandao Lake boat fire has come to 
light, the mainland's Association for Relations Across the 
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) has twice invited SEF and experts 
concerned to come to Zhejiang to hear briefings by mainland 
specialists. 
  Sources from Taibei [Taipei] said that the Executive Yuan's 
mainland committee and SEF agreed on going to Hangzhou after a 
meeting last Saturday night. 
  The Qiandao Lake accident happened on March 31, when three 
armed locals robbed and burned 32 people to death, including 24 
Taiwanese tourists, on a pleasure boat which was cruising on 
Qiandao -- or Thousand Island -- Lake in central Zhejiang 
Province.

<F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 26 (CNA) -- Economic Affairs Minister 
P.K. Chiang said on Tuesday [26 April] that cross-strait 
economic and trade ties put on hold in the wake of the Qiandao 
Lake disaster are anticipated to resume as before. 
  Chiang called the incident an isolated happenstance, and 
said 
that now that Beijing has concluded its inquiry into the case, 
the barrier that has blocked cross-strait ties for more than 
three weeks should be partly removed. 
  Beijing announced last week that three suspects had been 
seized for robbing and killing 24 Taiwan tourists, two mainland 
guides and six crewmen aboard a cruise boat touring the lake, 
which is in the eastern province of Zhejiang. 
  Beijing's handling of the incident included a cover-up 
attempt and the restriction of the victims' relatives' movement, 
and prompted the government to put a brake on bilateral ties. 
  The Ministry of Economic Affairs earlier in the month 
suspended screening applications for mainland-bound investments 
and said it would not continue to raise the quotas for mainland 
raw materials and semi-finished products allowed into Taiwan. 
  Chiang said the purpose behind the ministry's decision was 
to 
call attention to the high risks Taiwan investors face on the 
mainland. Now that this has been accomplished, he said, 
mainland investment and expanded import of mainland materials 
can continue, as long as the Mainland Affairs Council approves. 
  Chiang's remarks are seen by many here as a gesture of eased 
tensions between Taipei and Beijing. Just after the disaster, 
President Li Teng-hui was indignant, saying the mainland was 
ruled by a group of "bandits" who should be overthrown by the 
people.

  [Text] Bonn, April 27 (CNA) -- The German Foreign Affairs 
Ministry said Wednesday [27 April] that the German Government 
has no plans to sell 10 submarines to Taiwan, as had been 
reported in Germany. 
  The economic daily HANDELSBLATT reported Wednesday that the 
Grman firms HDW, Vulkan, Thyssen Nordseewerke, and Blohm Und 
Voss contacted US arms contractors last year about assembling 
submarine parts made in Germany and then shipping the finished 
submarines to Taiwan. The German Government said it never gave 
permission to the companies to enter into such a deal, and that 
it was adhering to a ban on sales of weaponry to countries it 
considers to be in "high tension" areas. 
  Delivery of the submarines to Taiwan, the paper said, would 
secure for Germany another contract for high speed ice rains [as 
received] worth 30 million marks (US$17.6 billion). 
  Taiwan's efforts to purchase submarines and other weaponry 
from Germany have been stalled as Bonn does not want to damage 
its ties with Beijing. Communist China has repeatedly insisted 
that no country should sell weapons to Taiwan because it is 
under Beijing sovereignty. 
  In Taipei, German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told 
the 
press on Tuesday that his government is reviewing the present 
list of high tension areas, but did not say whether the list 
would be amended to exclude Taiwan. 
  Rexrodt, the second highest ranking official from Germany to 
visit Taiwan, is visiting Taiwan to lobby on behalf of German 
firms bidding for construction contracts related to the building 
of the proposed high speed railway.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Zhu Rongji Meets Lo Hong-sui, Talks </F>
About Strengthening Contacts Between the Central Authorities and 
Hong Kong People"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr -- A delegation of the Hong Kong 
Business and Professional Federation today paid separate visits 
to Zhu Rongji, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee 
and vice premier of the State Council; Qian Qichen, vice premier 
of the State Council and minister of foreign affairs; and Wang 
Zhaoguo, minister of united front work. The delegation also had 
dinner with Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office. During these meetings, they exchanged views on contacts 
between the mainland and Hong Kong, on the retention of Hong 
Kong civil servants, on the issuance of special administrative 
region [SAR] passports, on Hong Kong real estate prices, and on 
China's economic development and tax reform. 
  At a press conference tonight, Lo Hong-sui said he was happy 
to have had the opportunity to hold detailed discussions with 
the two vice premiers on some of Hong Kong's problems. 
  He said that delegation members suggested to the two leaders 
that methods should be worked out to strengthen contacts between 
the central authorities and Hong Kong people. They felt that on 
many issues, the central government did not seem to fully 
understand Hong Kong citizens' ideas or feelings, and that in 
general, Hong Kong citizens cannot completely understand or 
accept central government policies. Therefore they suggested 
that the central government work out methods for improvement, 
such as systematically explaining some important contents of the 
Basic Law to Hong Kong citizens and responding to Hong Kong 
Government policies and comments. 
  They expressed concern that the continued lack of contact 
between the Chinese and British Governments would affect 
economic development in Hong Kong and the Zhu Jiang delta, he 
pointed out. He cited the following example: Hong Kong's Kwai 
Chung container port basically will be saturated next year; if 
the construction of a new port is delayed time and again, this 
will affect the shipment of Hong Kong's export commodities, 
apart from causing traffic congestion in the surrounding area. 
On the other hand, Guangdong Province has started carrying out 
large-scale infrastructural construction projects, which will 
form a convergence with Hong Kong. If the two sides still lack 
contacts, certain difficulties and obstacles will crop up. 
  Delegation member Chu You-ka said that Zhu Rongji briefed 
them on the mainland's economic development, and that he 
expressed satisfaction with the present situation. Concerning 
foreign exchange, the renminbi exchange rates have remained 
stable since July last year, and the foreign exchange reserve 
has increased by more than $6 billion. In addition, money 
injection has slowed down, which will help alleviate inflation. 
The implementation of the revenue-sharing system, which started 
early this year, also has yielded results, which are manifested 
in increased central government revenue without a decrease in 
local taxes. This is beneficial to reducing deficits in central 
government revenue. The inflation rate, however, rose from 13 
percent last year to 20 percent in the first quarter of this 
year. This situation merits attention. What is gratifying is 
that the increase in the people's income is higher than the 
inflation rate. Zhu Rongji was confident that inflation would 
fall in the months to come. 
  Lo Hong-sui pointed out that the delegation members had 
expressed their concern to the two vice premiers and to Lu Ping 
over the sentencing of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, and had 
expressed their hope that Chinese leaders would help resolve 
this issue. These leaders said that they were in charge of 
administrative institutions and did not participate in judicial 
operations, so they were not familiar with the details of the 
case, nor was it convenient for them to influence or meddle in 
judicial operations. Lo Hong-sui said that after the delegation 
had returned to Hong Kong, they would write a letter to the 
relevant Chinese leaders to seek ways to resolve the case.

<F P=106> [By reporters Xu Hong (1776 3126) and Wang Huicun (3769 1920 </F>
1317): "Wu Yi Expresses Appreciation for the Efforts Made by the 
Hong Kong Authorities and Businessmen To Lobby for China's 
Most-Favored-Nation Status"] 
  [Text] Macao, 27 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Wu Yi, Minister 
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said here that she 
would like to express appreciation for the efforts made by the 
British Hong Kong Authorities and many personalities from Hong 
Kong's industrial and commercial circles to lobby for China's 
most-favored- nation (MFN) status in the United States. 
  Wu Yi said that MFN was the foundation for developing trade 
and economic cooperation between China and the United States. 
China has always maintained that MFN status is purely a trade 
issue. China has never accepted linking MFN with other issues 
which have nothing to do with trade. 
  Wu Yi said: We hoped there would not be confrontation 
between China and the United States on the MFN issue. If 
confrontation were to emerge between the two sides on the MFN 
issue, it would not be in the interest of either country. 
Besides, the impact on Hong Kong and the losses the territory 
would suffer would be even greater. Therefore, we hope that the 
U.S. Government can properly settle the MFN issue between China 
and the United States. 
  Wu Yi pointed out: We have expressed our appreciation to any 
country or stratum which has lobbied the United States to renew 
China's MFN status. The British Hong Kong Authorities and 
personalities from Hong Kong's industrial and commercial circles 
have lobbied in the United States for China's MFN statue, and we 
would like to express our appreciation for this. 
  At seven o'clock yesterday afternoon, Wu Yi arrived in Macao 
from Hong Kong for a three-day visit. She had just returned 
from a visit to the United States and had come to Macao via Hong 
Kong to attend a meeting of the Board of Directors of the 
Nanguang Holdinqs Company Limited. Wu Yi will meet Macao 
Governor Rocha Vieira and will attend a meeting of the Chinese 
Enterprises Association of Macao tomorrow morning. At noon 
tomorrow, she will attend a welcome banquet held in her honor by 
Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chinese General Chamber of 
Commerce, at the Manyuen Restaurant.

  [Text] Hong Kong, April 27 (AFP)--Governor Chris Patten 
confirmed Wednesday that Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong 
Kong, has refused to accept an invitation to see him when he 
returns to the territory this weekend for the first time in 28 
months. Patten added, however, that his door remains wide open 
for talks with Lu, who heads the Chinese government's Hong Kong 
and Macao Affairs Office, despite the shrill Sino-British row 
over greater democracy in the British colony which reverts to 
China in 1997. 
  Lu has avoided coming to Hong Kong since January 1992, in a 
pointed reminder to London of Beijing's contempt for Patten's 
decision to press ahead with pre-1997 electoral reforms without 
China's blessing. "Today, director Lu Ping has written to say 
that his schedule is so busy in Hong Kong that he won't on this 
occasion be able to visit and to have discussions," Patten told 
local reporters. However, the governor -- who last met Lu in 
Beijing in late 1992 -- added that the tone of Lu's message 
appeared to suggest that a meeting might yet be possible at some 
later date. 
  "I'm prepared to cross any street, open any door, shake any 
hand and talk to anyone if it's in the interests of Hong Kong," 
the governor added. 
  Lu will be in Hong Kong for next week's introduction of Bank 
of China banknotes in the territory, and for meetings of two 
sub-groups of the Preliminary Working Committee, a 
Beijing-appointed body that is paving the way for the resumption 
of Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Lu is also to make a major 
speech to Hong Kong businessmen next Friday.

<F P=106> [By Lulu Yu] </F>
  [Text] Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has agreed to 
sell its remaining 15.1 percent stake in South China Morning 
Post Holdings (SCMP) to Malayan United Industries (MUI) -- a 
Malaysian conglomerate controlled by reclusive tycoon Khoo Kay 
Peng -- for $1.036bn, giving Malaysian interests a 50 percent 
holding in the newspaper group. Khoo is a close friend of 
Robert Kuok, the Malaysian sugar, hotels and property magnate 
who last year bought a 34.9 percent stake from News Corporation 
and became the largest single shareholder in the SCMP group. 
  MUI's purchase prompted Hong Kong's Securities and Futures 
Commission (SFC) to consider referring the deal to Hong Kong's 
takeovers panel for inquiry into possible concert party action 
by the Malaysian tycoons. "We will look into the matter to see 
if an inquiry is warranted," Robert Nottle, the SFC chairman, 
said. Under local takeover rules, shareholders whose control 
reaches 35 percent of a company are required to make a general 
offer. 
  After the sale, SCMP will remain one of only two foreign 
controlled newspapers in the territory, the other being the 
Taiwanese-owned United Daily Chinese-language broadsheet. 
Although it was widely expected that Murdoch would divest his 
remaining stake in SCMP, his deal with Khoo came as a surprise. 
  Khoo, a born-again Christian, is believed to have had 
problems with Malaysian authorities. Late last year, his MUI 
group sold subsidiaries in MUI Bank and MUI Finance to the 
Malaysian Hong Leong group and has since then been sitting on a 
big pile of cash. In February it bought holdings in two Hong 
Kong companies -- a 52.8 percent stake in travel group Morning 
Star Holdings and a 30 percent stake in Kuok's Kerry Financial 
Services, a stockbroking and merchant bank concern. 
  MUI's interests in Malaysia include the Ming Court Hotel 
chain, cement operations and department stores. It also has a 
major stake in the revamped New Heritage USA, a large U.S. theme 
park and resort formerly linked to disgraced Christian 
television evangelist Jim Bakker. MUI's wholly owned 
subsidiary, MUI Media, signed an agreement on Wednesday to buy 
226.5 million shares at $4.575 each from News Finance (HK), MUI 
told the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange. 
  Kuok paid US$349m (about HK$2.7bn), or HK$5.16 a share, for 
his 34.9 percent stake in October. SCMP shares yesterday closed 
unchanged at $4.225. 
  Media analysts said the sale should give Murdoch much-needed 
cash to finance his loss-making Star TV operations and would 
make little difference to the running of SCMP's newspaper, 
magazine and publishing business. "The change in ownership 
should not affect SCMP. There should be some friendly 
cooperation between the two Malaysian shareholders. The 
prospects of the paper are not bad, although revenues are not 
expected to grow significantly," Brian Oung of DBS Securities 
said. 
  Fred Bowers of Nomura Research Institute said he had been 
disappointed with SCMP's revenue growth in the past two years 
and expected the company's margins to shrink. "Its performance 
has been below expectations. I'm bearish on the stock because 
of rising labour and newsprint costs," he said. 
  KM Chang of OCBC Investment Research in Kuala Lumpur said 
MUI's acquisition reflected the group's effort to diversify 
overseas.

<F P=106> [By Xiao Longlian (5135 7893 5114) ] </F>
  [Text] Chengdu 25 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Sichuan 
Province has presented a major measure for opening up to the 
world and will change the practice of selling enterprises 
suffering deficits, and it plans to sell 33 profitable state 
enterprises, including the Changzheng Pharmaceutical Factory, to 
firms outside the border. 
  Prior to this, Sichuan Province has on two occasions 
promoted 
the sale of a number of enterprises suffering serious deficits 
with poor economic results to investors outside the border. 
This time, Sichuan plans to offer its resources, and markets as 
well, so that the state-owned enterprises to be sold will yield 
sound economic results and good returns for investors. 
  In his briefing at a news conference at an international 
symposium on Sichuan's opening up to the outside world and talks 
on investment, Vice Governor Diao Jinxiang said that there were 
33 state-owned enterprises covering an area of 10 million square 
meters, with fixed assets originally valued at some 3.6 billion 
yuan, a net value of some 2.4 billion yuan, and 77,000 staff and 
workers. 
  Large and medium-sized enterprises are included in these 32 
state-owned enterprises. They are mainly distributed in 
Chengdu, Chongqing, Deyang, Mianyang, Leshan, Zigong, and 
Neijiang, where communications, transportation, and 
telecommunications are developed and which have a solid 
industrial foundation. They involve such areas as machinery, 
electronics, metallurgy, chemicals, building materials, 
pharmaceuticals, textiles, and light industry. Of these, 84.8 
percent are profitable enterprises. Although the remainder have 
some difficulties at present, they have comparatively great 
potential for development and comparatively bright market 
prospects. At the symposium, some 10 or 15 key enterprises, the 
cream of the batch, with comparatively good conditions in 
various aspects will be selected for sale. 
  While dealing with the way the sale of this batch of 
enterprises would be conducted, Diao Jinxiang said: Regarding 
the enterprises to be sold, foreign investors can purchase any 
of the enterprises in their entirety, or in part, or they can 
invest directly as shareholders. Five specific ways can be 
adopted, namely: first, selling both the enterprise's property 
and land-use rights, with local governments making arrangements 
for surplus workers and staffers; second, selling part of the 
enterprise's property and land-use rights based on the buyer's 
requirements; third, selling both the enterprise's property and 
land-use rights under the prerequisite that the buyer makes 
arrangements for the enterprise's original staff and worker; 
fourth, selling part of the enterprise's property and land-use 
rights under the prerequisite that the buyer makes arrangements 
for some of the enterprise's staff and workers; and fifth, 
transferring the state's shares and those of the legal person to 
a joint-stock company. The five ways mentioned above can be 
selected through specific negotiations based on the different 
circumstances of the enterprises.

  [Text] Chengdu, 14 April (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The 
Sichuan Provincial Government recently decided to sell some 
state-owned enterprises suffering serious deficits to legal 
persons in China and overseas in a planned way. 
  The Sichuan Provincial State-Owned Assets Administration and 
Finance Office is encouraging enterprises to dispose of assets 
in various categories that are no longer applicable for use or 
indispensable, while giving permission to sell some workshops or 
factory branches with an unreasonable product mix and poor 
economic results, as well as some state-owned enterprises 
suffering serious deficits. 
  It is stipulated that before state-owned assets are sold, 
they must be assessed by an asset-appraisal organization, which 
will set a base price for the sale to a legal person; 
alternatively, their sale must be reported to state-owned asset 
departments at the same level and gain their consent.

  [Text] A provincial rural work conference was convened in 
Kunming yesterday. 
  The conference was devoted to profoundly implementing the 
spirit of two recently concluded central rural work conferences 
in light of the provincial realities; acquiring a clear 
understanding of the province's current rural situation and 
tasks; emancipating the mind; deepening the ongoing rural 
economic structural reform; increasing comprehensive 
agricultural strength; pushing ahead with economic growth; 
increasing peasants' incomes; maintaining rural stability; and 
laying a solid foundation for smooth implementation of each and 
every major reform measure and for a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy economic growth across the province. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu and 
provincial Governor He Zhiqiang both delivered important 
speeches at meetings held yesterday morning and afternoon. 
  In his speech, Secretary Pu Chaozhu first and foremost 
analyzed the current excellent rural situation across the 
province, saying that the province is now confronted with 
another round of drastic industrial structural readjustment. He 
emphatically pointed out: Under no circumstances should we 
overlook the fundamental position and important role of 
agriculture. The basic ideology guiding rural work in the new 
historical period should be boiled down to emancipating the 
mind; grasping opportunities; deepening reforms; expanding 
opening up; promoting development; and maintaining stability. 
We should strive to work out new rural reform measures suited 
to the ongoing socialist market economic development; embark on 
a new road of rural economic development; and resolve such 
existing problems plaguing rural economic growth as insufficient 
investment in and huge debts regarding farmland capital 
construction, water conservancy, communications, electricity 
supply, and infrastructure construction. We should devote more 
energy to educational, scientific, and technological development 
and labor quality improvement in the province's rural, 
mountainous, and ethnic minority areas. The leading organs at 
and above county level should work out plans and goals aimed at 
bringing about a comfortably well-off livelihood and make a 
comfortably well-off livelihood a common goal for all. 
  Speaking of the ongoing profound rural reform, Secretary Pu 
Chaozhu pointed out in no uncertain terms: We should strive to 
readjust the existing unitary economic structure and ownership 
structure; transform the existing rural production and 
operational patterns; develop socialized production; reform the 
existing rural operational structure; and actively publicize 
successful experiences in integrating and unifying three key 
links, namely, production, operation, and marketing. 
  Speaking of the ongoing rural economic growth, Secretary Pu 
Chaozhu cautioned against overlooking grain production and 
called for continually readjusting rural industrial structure; 
fostering superior rural industries; increasing investments in 
rural infrastructure facilities construction; actively assisting 
township and town enterprises; vigorously pushing ahead with 
township and town enterprises development; maintaining the high 
development speed seen in the last few years; invigorating the 
rural economy with advanced science and technology; expanding 
opening up to the outside world; and promoting rural growth by 
incessantly opening up to the outside world. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu emphatically noted: A pressing task at 
the moment is to mobilize the whole party to make a success of 
spring plowing production in order to reap another good 
agricultural harvest this year. To this end, we should 
earnestly strengthen the party leadership over rural work. The 
party committee members with special responsibilities for 
different types of work at all levels across the province should 
show concern for, find out about, and study rural work; 
contribute more to rural development; and guide the people of 
all nationalities across Yunnan to achieve a comfortably 
well-off livelihood. 
  Provincial Governor He Zhiqiang delivered at yesterday 
afternoon's meeting an important speech in which he pointed out: 
Yunnan's rural reform tasks at the moment are as follows: 
  1. To persist in the basic rural economic operating system; 
stabilize and perfect the household-based land contract system; 
extend the prevailing land contract term by 30 years; sign land 
contracts with each and every household; and complete the 
relevant procedures in accordance with the law; 
  2. To mobilize collectives, individual operators, and 
private enterprises to jointly harness and exploit barren hills, 
slopes, valleys, and shoals across the province and allow 
individual operators and private enterprises to contract with 
compensation relevant projects for up to 50 or 70 years; 
  3. To vigorously develop the rural individual and private 
economies while consolidating and developing the rural 
collective economy; actively implement a joint-stock cooperative 
system in the rural areas; transform the enterprise property 
rights pattern; and develop commodity production as well as 
township and town enterprises; 
  4. To push ahead with operative structural reform; improve 
management methods; develop economic organizations specializing 
in simultaneous agricultural, industrial, trade, and scientific 
development; and further perfect socialized rural service 
systems. 
  Speaking on rural production structural readjustment and 
high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural 
development, Governor He Zhiqiang spelled out the following six 
specific goals: 
  1. To produce grain basically sufficient for the province's 
population; 
  2. To further develop locally based superior industries, 
including the tobacco, sugar, tea, and rubber industries, and 
comprehensively increase the province's industrial efficiency; 
  3. To develop a series of new products, including animal 
husbandry products, aquatic products, forest products, and 
forest- related chemical products; 
  4. To develop a series of new industries, including the 
vegetable industry, the flower and plant industry, the medicinal 
materials industry, and so on, whose annual output value should 
exceed 10 billion yuan, 5 billion yuan, and 1 billion yuan 
respectively; 
  5. To build a high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency 
agricultural production pattern under which agriculture, 
forestry, sideline occupations, fishery, grain production, 
economic crops production, horticulture, and forage crops 
witness comprehensive development; 
  6. To build a rural economic pattern under which the heavy 
processing industry, the breeding industry, and the marketing 
industry will enjoy coordinated development. 
  Speaking on comprehensively furthering the province's rural 
work and reaping a good agricultural harvest this year, Governor 
He Zhiqiang called for conscientiously focusing on the following 
10 aspects of work: 
  1. To unswervingly strengthen grain production and raise the 
province's total grain output to 22.5 billion jin; 
  2. To vigorously build "vegetable basket" projects and 
stabilize farm and sideline products prices; 
  3. To adopt practical and effective measures to increase 
peasants' income; 
  4. To successfully carry out comprehensive agricultural 
development and build all types of agricultural production bases; 
  5. To make continued and redoubled efforts to further 
farmland capital construction; build water conservancy works; 
improve basic agricultural production conditions; and build more 
high-yield and stable-yield farmland; 
  6. To ensure a sufficient supply of agricultural goods and 
materials; purchase sufficient farm and sideline products; and 
stop issuing IOUs to peasants; 
  7. To energetically promote scientific and technological 
progress as well as agricultural development by relying on 
advanced science and technology; 
  8. To continually and successfully provide poverty-stricken 
areas with all kinds of necessary assistance; 
  9. To make a success of family planning, improve medical and 
health work, and strengthen ecological protection in the rural 
areas in a down-to-earth manner; 
  10. To strengthen agriculture-related legislative work and 
push forward agricultural development in accordance with the law. 
  In conclusion Governor He Zhiqiang called on leading cadres 
at all levels to earnestly improve their work style; go deep 
into rural areas to carry out investigation and study; give heed 
to views, demands, and requests from the masses; guide local 
economic growth; and ensure constant rural economic growth.

  [Excerpts] Addressing yesterday's closing ceremony for the 
third term of class for Yunnan cadres at and above the country 
level to study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume 
three, provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu stressed 
that party committees at all levels must intensify and improve 
their leadership over the people's congress, the Chinese 
People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and the 
united front. The operations of the people's congress, the 
CPPCC, and the united front must be submitted to and serve the 
work of the entire party and country. In this connection, the 
focus should be on major issues, major events should be 
discussed, and practical work should be done. 
  Pu Chaozhu fully appreciated the performance of the 
third-term class for studying Deng Xiaoping's works--which 
included party members, people's congress chairmen, CPPCC 
committee chairmen, and united front work department directors 
from various prefectures, autonomous prefectures, cities, and 
counties--for in their studies, they had upheld the principle of 
applying the theory to reality and to the solution of actual 
problems. He noted that during the study class, the people's 
congress, the CPPCC committee, and the united front work 
department had called separate work meetings to discuss and 
assign tasks, thus paving the way for opening up a new situation 
in the work of the people's congress and the CPPCC committee. 
[passage omitted] 
  Pu Chaozhu pointed out that party committees at all levels 
must intensify and improve their leadership over the operation 
of the people's congress and the CPPCC committee. Politically 
speaking, party committees should show concern for members of 
the people's congresses and CPPCC committees; attach importance 
to and show respect for their opinions and suggestions; arrange 
for them to play a part in the democratic and scientific 
decision-making process; rely on them for expediting reform and 
construction; and encourage them to focus on major issues, 
discuss major issues, and do practical work. 
  In his speech, Pu Chaozhu also aired his views on such 
issues 
as deepening reform and developing the economy. 
  Linghu An, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, presided over the ceremony. Seated on the rostrum 
were Yin Jun, Liu Shusheng, (La Dazhong), (Wang Xianxi), and 
other leading comrades. Other leading comrades present at the 
ceremony were Bao Yongkang, Yang Yitang, Yang Ming, Dao Guodong, 
Li Shuji, Bai Zuoguang, (Mai Shiqiu), Zhao Tingguang, Dao 
Shixun, Li Jin, Xiang Chaozong, Li Mingde, (Su Yingzheng), (Liu 
Bangrui), Lu Bangzheng, and (Wang Zhaoming).

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Government 
should keep to its commitment on the issue of Tibet and refrain 
from doing anything that will harm the Sino-U.S. relations, 
said Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, at a news briefing here today. 
  The meeting with the Dalai Lama by an official of any 
country 
means instigation and support to the separationist activities of 
the Dalai Lama and constitutes an interference in the internal 
affairs of China, Wu said. It will be met with resolute 
opposition from the Chinese people. 
  Mr. Wu Jianmin made the statements when asked to comment on 
the report about U.S. President Clinton's meeting with the 
Dalai Lama. 
  The Dalai Lama is not only a religious leader, but also a 
political exile, Mr. Wu said. He has long been engaging in 
activities designed to split the country and undermine the 
national unity. 
  "All his activities have brought harm to the interests of 
all 
the Chinese people, including the Tibetan compatriots," Wu said. 
  "We hope that the U.S. Government will keep to its 
commitment on the Tibetan issue and refrain from doing anything 
that will harm the Sino-U.S. relations," Wu said.

  [Text] Geneva, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign Affairs 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev said here today that the Bosnian issue 
could be solved only by political means. 
  Kozyrev made these remarks at a joint press conference after 
meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the 
U.S. mission in Geneva. 
  According to Kozyrev, a military solution to the Bosnian 
conflict is an extreme solution which should not be used. 
  He also said that the warring sides in Bosnia should search 
for a compromise within the framework of negotiations over 
territorial concession by the Bosnian Serbs. 
  On economic sanctions against the Serbs, Kozyrev said this 
issue is linked to the search for a political solution, adding 
that lifting of the sanctions will be put on the agenda if a 
cease-fire is concluded. 
  Christopher said the U.S. and Russia have the same 
objectives 
in Bosnia. 
  On the situation in Goradze, the U.S. secretary of state 
said 
things are developing in a "good direction" and the Bosnian 
Serbs are withdrawing their heavy weapons some 20 kilometers 
away from the town. 
  However, Christopher added that NATO planes will monitor 
Serb 
compliance with the withdrawal. 
  Kozyrev and Christopher also discussed the Middle East, the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Russian participation 
in NATO's partnership for peace plan.

  [Text] Macao, April 27 (XINHUA) -- China is willing to 
exchange views and make research on human rights with other 
countries, however, any attempt to use human rights as a tool to 
put pressure on others would be fruitless. 
  Wu Yi, minister of the Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic 
Cooperation, made these remarks at a news conference held here 
this evening. 
  She said the question of the most favored nation (MFN) 
trading status was a core item in the trade agreement signed 
between the governments of China and the United States when the 
two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979, adding 
it is also the fundamental basis for the trade development 
between the two sides. 
  Wu said MFN is purely a question of trading, saying that 
China will absolutely not accept any attempt to connect MFN with 
matters which have nothing to do with trade, especially the 
human rights. 
  She said that at present, China has set up trade relations 
with 228 countries and regions worldwide and is not afraid of 
confrontations that would take place over MFN. 
  She expressed the hope that the United States would properly 
deal with the MFN issue, saying confrontation will be harmful to 
both China and the U.S.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- On the afternoon of 26 
April, Liu Huaqing, Standing Committee member of the CPC Central 
Committee Political Bureau and vice chairman of the Central 
Military Commission [CMC], attended a discussion with six 
military region [MR] commanders and political commissars, who 
were attending the third theoretical study class sponsored by 
the Central Party School for principal provincial and 
ministerial leading cadres. They discussed ways to deepen the 
study of Volume 3 of the "Selelected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and 
to use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and his concept of Army building in the 
new period to guide Army building in all fields. 
  CMC members Zhang Wannian, Yu Yongbo, and Fu Quanyou were 
present at the discussion. 
  At the discussion, MR leaders Li Xinliang, Liu Jingsong, 
Song 
Qingwei, Gu Hui, Li Xilin, and Li Jiulong spoke glowingly of 
their understandings gained from the intensive study of Volume 3 
of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" during a concentrated 
period of nearly 20 days. According to them, the more they 
studied the works, the deeper they realized the profound meaning 
and broad coverage of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the great 
importance of studying Volume 3 of the "Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping," especially in the light of the realities in the 
Army's leadership work. As senior leading cadres, the MR 
leaders pledged to diligently study and master this theoretical 
weapon and use it to guide Army building. 
  Liu Huaqing said: To diligently study Volume 3 of the 
Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and to use Comrade 
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics to arm the minds of all Army commanders and 
fighters is the long-term strategic task of the whole Army, 
which must be carried out without fail. He emphasized: In 
studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping and correctly handling the relationship between 
reform, development, and stability and between local and 
national interests, it is imperative to integrate theory with 
practice. Senior cadres, in particular, should conscientiously 
set a good example for rank- and-file soldiers by promoting the 
Army's work in all fields and making positive contributions to 
China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive and to the 
maintenance of social stability. We should continue to educate 
all Army commanders and fighters to bring the Army's fine 
traditions into play and to preserve Red Army veterans' true 
color. We should administer the Army strictly. Cadres at all 
level must go deep into the realities to strengthen military 
training and ensure a good job in ideological and political 
work. At present, particular attention must be paid to managing 
troops and strengthening unity between the Army and the 
government and between armymen and civilians. 
  Xu Huizi, deputy chief of general staff, and Tang Tianbiao, 
assistant to the director of the General Political Department, 
also attended the discussion.

<F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 26 April editorial: "Make Conscientious </F>
Efforts To Improve Efficiency -- on Intensively Launching 
`China's Deep-Going March Toward Economic Efficiency'"] 
  [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- "China's Deep-Going 
March Toward Economic Efficiency" -- an activity launched by 
some theoretical, propaganda, and operational departments under 
the leadership and with the support of the central authorities 
-- has been going on for a year. Although it has attracted 
widespread attention, it has yet to command adequate notice. 
This editorial, which is being issued specifically to help 
launch this massive activity of investigation, study, and 
propaganda in a more vivid and thorough manner, briefly states 
some of our viewpoints for the purpose of discussion with our 
readers. 
  As early as some 10 years ago, our country proposed the 
principle of "taking the improvement of economic efficiency as 
the central task" with regard to economic work. We can say that 
we have achieved considerable results in this regard, having 
enjoyed sustained national economic development for many years 
in a row. Enterprises are the basic units that create wealth in 
modern society. It is none other than the improvement of 
overall efficiency in enterprises that has helped our country 
gain and rapidly accumulate massive social wealth. This fact is 
obvious and palpable to everybody. Take as an example 
state-owned enterprises which constitute the most-discussed 
topic. We cannot simply characterize them with the phrase "poor 
economic efficiency." It would not be objective and fair if we 
did not adequately affirm the tremendous contributions made by 
state-owned enterprises, large and medium ones in particular, by 
overlooking their pivotal role in stabilizing and promoting the 
overall situation, their status as the main source of the 
country's financial revenue, and the many additional social 
functions they perform. 
  Nevertheless, we must note that the economic efficiency of 
our country's enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, 
is still not very ideal. Their input-output ratios remain low 
in many aspects, with some showing a downward trend. Some of 
them have failed to attain record levels in terms of the ratio 
between investment and productive capacity resulting from such 
investment, the profit rate on capital, labor productivity, and 
the index of efficiency in materials consumption. The total 
amount of losses in state-owned enterprises has increased. 
Efficiency has become a prominent issue that determines whether 
our country's economy can develop in a sustained, rapid, and 
healthy manner. 
  In evaluating the general efficiency of our country's 
economy 
and enterprises, we must, therefore, conduct an extensive, 
objective, and concrete analysis against the backdrop of reform 
and development to avoid generalizing our conclusion. This is 
the first viewpoint we want to state. 
  Perhaps people will ask: Why are our results consistently 
not ideal despite many years of calling for and working toward 
better economic efficiency? This question is not easy to answer 
because the factors affecting our efforts to improve efficiency 
are very complicated and cover a wide range of areas. Perhaps 
the answer lies here: Economic efficiency is difficult to 
improve because it is the result, as well as the general 
reflection, of many facets of the way the national economy 
functions. 
  As our country's economy is making the transition from 
planning to a socialist market economy, this structural change 
has basically hampered economic efficiency. For example, the 
old investment structure shows considerable resistance to 
change, the "credit-inflated" development model has not been 
changed completely, and investors do not assume corresponding 
responsibility for economic efficiency. Consequently, the 
chronic disease of "investment starvation" is still hard to cure 
while the stubborn ailment of duplicating construction projects 
and feverishly launching new ones strikes frequently. This has 
predestined a sizable number of enterprises to incur losses even 
before they were formally established. Also, the experiment to 
establish a modern enterprise system has just started, and 
state-owned enterprises have yet to change their operating 
mechanisms effectively. Consequently, it is still difficult 
basically to halt the phenomena of "assuming responsibility for 
profits only but not for losses," of losing state-owned assets, 
and of shifting the economic efficiency of enterprises in other 
directions. 
  Our country's economic structure also has hampered economic 
efficiency. Slow growth in peasants' incomes has inevitably 
affected the development of rural markets, curbed the sale of 
industrial goods, and left many of the products needed by 
peasants stranded in enterprises' warehouses. Naturally, it 
would be difficult to improve enterprises' efficiency. 
"Bottleneck" sectors such as communications and transportation 
also have prevented enterprises from bringing in raw materials 
and shipping their products to other places, thus affecting 
their economic efficiency. 
  Enterprises' "internal functions" have directly hampered 
their efficiency. Even if enterprises have changed their 
operating mechanisms and are capable of "operating independently 
and assuming sole responsibility for their own profits and 
losses," there are still the questions of how to "operate 
independently" and whether to "assume responsibility for profits 
or losses." Whether enterprises can ultimately improve their 
economic efficiency depends on how they reform themselves 
internally, how they upgrade their technological levels, how 
they manage themselves, and how they perform in terms of 
quality, operations, and marketing. The truth that we emphasize 
about enterprises improving their "internal functions" is 
readily apparent if we look at the disparity between different 
enterprises operating under more or less similar conditions, and 
if we analyze the "good" and "bad" fortunes of a given 
enterprise during different periods. 
  After analyzing the many factors that hamper economic 
efficiency, we understand that improving economic efficiency is 
a pressing task of the moment, as well as a long-term strategic 
task. We should vigorously carry it out over the long term by 
improving the macroeconomic environment while enlisting the 
efforts of individual enterprises. This task is the economic 
objective of our reform and development, as well as an important 
lever with which to advance reform and development. This is the 
second viewpoint we want to make. 
  How should we improve economic efficiency? General Secretary 
Jiang Zemin has called for "hatching new ideas for development." 
New ideas are also needed for improving economic efficiency. We 
should explore new ways while maintaining the original effective 
methods. It can be said that the 14th National CPC Congress and 
the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have 
basically provided such new ideas, the former by setting the 
goal of building a socialist market economy and the latter by 
adopting a corresponding "decision." 
  A fundamental way to improve enterprises' efficiency is to 
bring enterprises onto the market and turn them into the main 
competitors there. This will allow the fittest to survive, let 
new enterprises emerge from among the old, and ensure continuous 
progress. People have raised the issue of how to organically 
combine the efforts to "invigorate state-owned assets" and 
"improve state-owned enterprises" on the basis of none other 
than the theory regarding market mechanisms playing their 
fundamental role in allocating resources. The course of action 
taken by the Beijing No. 1 Light Industrial Group, whose story 
appeared in this newspaper, is a case in point. People seem to 
have suddenly found the key to unlock the door of economic 
efficiency. We should continue to explore on the basis of this 
idea. 
  The practice in 1993 has given people a newer, deeper, and 
more correct understanding of macroeconomic regulation and 
control. As a matter of fact, the market economy requires a 
closer integration of microeconomics and macroeconomics. 
Microeconomics is the foundation of macroeconomics, whereas 
macroeconomics serves as the environment for microeconomic 
activities. A great many enterprises have long understood quite 
well that this is the inherent meaning of market economics. 
Accordingly, they have always given consideration to both 
macroeconomics and microeconomics in their quest for economic 
efficiency. They not only study current market conditions but 
also forecast future trends. Rather than interpreting the 
state's macroeconomic regulation and control as an adverse 
restrictive factor, they take it as an important guide to their 
actions. Consequently, they are likely to achieve fairly good 
and steady economic efficiency while constantly coordinating the 
relations between microeconomics and macroeconomics. The Handan 
Iron and Steel Works, whose story appeared in the news media, is 
a case in point. 
  To improve economic efficiency, we should make "investments 
in both tangible and intangible aspects." Some enterprises have 
taken the lead in correcting their past mistake of paying 
attention to "tangible aspects" to the neglect of "intangible 
aspects." And they have achieved considerable economic 
efficiency. Besides input in science and technology and better 
management -- something frequently stressed in the past -- the 
so-called "investment in intangible aspects" should also include 
the exercise of intellectual property rights and the study and 
implementation of enterprise strategies for development, 
products, operations, and marketing. The experience of some 
foreign enterprises in applying the law of the market economy, 
as well as regular operational strategy, is also worth emulating. 
  It can be said that many ways and means for achieving 
economic efficiency in accordance with the law of the market 
economy are there for us to uncover, study, explore, and apply. 
This is the third point that we want to make. 
  Economic efficiency is a matter of paramount importance, as 
well as a very complicated issue. Nevertheless, we can improve 
economic efficiency in a step-by-step manner so long as we grasp 
the essentials. In carrying out "China's Deep-Going March 
Toward Economic Efficiency," we must henceforth conduct more 
thorough activities of investigation, study, and propaganda. We 
should raise issues as well as analyze causes. More important, 
we should sum up and publicize some new ideas and good methods 
for solving problems. 
  We believe that China's economy during the 21st century is 
bound to be a dynamic one that is structurally sound, rapidly 
expanding, and fairly efficient. 
  Let us work together toward achieving this goal.

<F P=106> ["The Second Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's </F>
Congress Resolution To Adopt the Government Work Report on 12 
April 1994"] 
  [Text] Governor Fu Xishou delivered a government work 
report on behalf of the provincial people's government. After 
hearing and deliberating the work report, the Second Session of 
the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress decided to adopt 
it. 
  The session held: Under the guidelines of Comrade Deng 
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics and the 14th CPC National Congress in the past 
year, various nationalities of Anhui's people have further 
liberated the mind and have united and forged ahead; the 
provincial economy has been developing rapidly; the socialist 
spiritual civilization drive has been further enhanced; the 
stable and united political situation has been consolidated; and 
a pleasant setting characterized by prosperity and progress has 
appeared across the province. Meanwhile however, we should also 
note that some difficulties and problems still exist in the 
course of our progress. We should deepen reform and 
realistically and meticulously do our work in an effort to 
resolve the problems. 
  The meeting pointed out: The national economy has been 
sustaining a favorably developing momentum in 1994 which is also 
an important year for accelerating the establishment of a 
socialist market economy. While performing various tasks, we 
should abide by and serve the overall requirements of seizing 
opportunities, deepening reform, opening up wider to the outside 
world, enhancing progress, and maintaining stability. We should 
earnestly and properly handle the relations among reform, 
development, and stability; promptly discover new circumstances 
and new problems that may pop up along the route of progress and 
resolve them accordingly. We should strive to facilitate a 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian 
kang fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of the 
national economy. 
  The meeting stressed: We should persistently adhere to the 
basic and guiding ideology that "development is the last word;" 
improve structure, raise efficiency, and promote a rapid growth 
in the national economy. We should persistently give top 
priority to agriculture and rural work; strengthen leadership in 
this regard; deepen reform; pursue consistent policies; increase 
investments; continually implement the strategy "that stresses 
steady growth first, and rapid progress later"; comprehensively 
develop the rural economy; earnestly and properly perform tasks 
to aid and cultivate the poor; realistically reduce peasants' 
burdens; strive in every possible way to raise peasants' 
incomes; and accelerate rural areas' advance toward attaining 
comparatively well-off living standards. Furthermore, we should 
improve industrial structure, accelerate technical 
transformation, make great efforts to improve large and medium 
state enterprises' performance, strive to reverse losses and 
increase profits in enterprises, raise economic benefits, and 
invigorate enterprises. Also, we should strive to develop 
markets in urban and rural areas, improve the circulation of 
commodities, reinforce supervision and inspection of commodity 
prices, properly handle the establishment of "vegetable basket" 
projects, and make efforts to ensure that the rates of increase 
in commodity prices will be below the average national level. 
Additionally, we should develop more channels to attract funds, 
and should enhance the construction of infrastructural projects 
and primary industries to boost reserves for further 
development. We should regard education as a strategic project 
to be developed on a priority basis, strive to develop various 
social undertakings including science, technology, culture, and 
health care; and improve tasks in family planning, environmental 
protection, and land management. While enhancing economic 
progress, we should continually improve people's living 
standards. In particular, we should attach great importance to, 
and take measures to resolve daily problems faced by the masses 
in poor areas and by staff and workers of enterprises in 
distress. 
  The meeting stressed, We should accelerate establishing a 
socialist market economy; continually change enterprise 
operating mechanisms; actively explore effective ways to 
establish a modern enterprise system; and make great efforts to 
promote reform in taxation, finance, investment, and foreign 
trade. We should open up wider to the outside world, ensure a 
steady increase in exports, and use more foreign funds to 
further develop the open economy. 
  The meeting pointed out: We should continually implement the 
principle "that while conducting rectification, we enhance 
economic progress and that we are strict in both tasks;" boost 
the socialist spiritual civilization drive further; assiduously 
promote patriotic, collective, and socialist ideological 
education programs; oppose money worship, extreme individualism, 
and decadent lifestyles; promulgate Lei Feng's spirit in a new 
era as represented by Xu Honggang; extensively launch education 
programs to promote social public spirit and professional 
ethics; advocate the spirit of diligence and thrift; wage hard 
struggles; and establish good social practices. 
  The meeting pointed out: We should further strengthen the 
development of socialist democracy and its legal system and 
should enhance social progress in an all-around manner. We 
should also persistently govern Anhui and enforce administrative 
procedures according to law. We should launch in-depth 
education programs on the legal system to strengthen all Anhui 
residents' concepts in this regard. Furthermore, we should 
steadfastly and unwaveringly boost honest government building 
and launch an effective anticorruption drive. We should further 
comprehensively rectify social order, strictly crack down on 
various crimes and on culprits of serious economic crimes, and 
correctly handle internal contradictions among the people. 
Additionally, we should strive to eliminate various factors 
that are detrimental to stability in an effort to create a 
favorable social environment for reform and development. 
  The meeting urged: Governments at various levels and 
relevant personnel should always remember their fundamental 
purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people; establish the 
concept of serving as public servants; and stress ideals, 
discipline, unity, and the overall situation. They should study 
further, persistently seek truth from facts, improve workstyle, 
mingle with grass-roots units and among the masses, intensify 
investigation and research, surmount bureaucracy and formalism, 
earnestly perform concrete tasks, and realistically implement 
measures. They should conscientiously and properly carry out 
organizational reform, and earnestly change government functions 
so as to raise government work performance to a higher level. 
  The meeting urged: Anhui's people of various nationalities 
should rally more closely around the party Central Committee 
with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. Under the guidance of 
Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, and under 
the leadership of the Anhui provinical party committee, we 
should be of one heart and one mind, earnestly perform concrete 
tasks, wage hard struggles, do pioneering work, open up, forge 
ahead, and strive to work hard in an effort to comprehensively 
invigorate Anhui's economy and various other undertakings.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA)--A 2,500-cu-m [cubic 
meter] blast furnace went into operation Tuesday [26 April] 
afternoon at the Maanshan Iron and Steel Co. Ltd, one of the 
country's major iron and steel producers, in east China's Anhui 
Province. 
  At 3:18 P.M. on Tuesday, the furnace successfully produced 
molten iron. 
  The total investment in the furnace reached three billion 
yuan (about 345 million U.S. dollars). 
  The designed annual output of the furnace is 1.75 million 
tons. With this furnace in production, the company will be able 
to double its annual output to four million tons of iron and 
steel. This also paves the way for it to increase its annual 
output to six million tons of iron and steel.

that propaganda and ideological work is part and parcel of 
spiritual civilization building and generalized propaganda and 
ideological work into the following three key aspects: 
  1. In conducting propaganda and ideological work, we should 
firmly grasp the key link. By grasping the key link, he said, 
we should educate the broad masses of cadres and party members 
with the theory of building socialism with Chinese 
characteristics, 
  2. In conducting propaganda and ideological work, we should 
firmly grasp all sorts of basic work, especially education of 
juveniles and propaganda, ideological, and educational work at 
the grassroots level, 
  3. In conducting propaganda and ideological work, we should 
strive to correctly guide public opinion.

  [Text] The provincial party committee held a forum in 
Nanhai City from 18 to 19 April on rural joint-stock cooperative 
system reform in the Zhu Jiang delta. Xie Fei, member of the 
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of 
the Guangdong provincial party committee, presided over the 
forum and delivered the concluding speech. 
  The forum mainly discussed the issue of using the 
joint-stock 
cooperative system for land development that is evolving in 
relatively rich rural areas of the Zhu Jiang delta. The 
participants conscientiously discussed the important 
significance, basic requirements, guiding ideas, working 
principles, and policies of the reform. 
  Participants held that reforms related to the joint-stock 
cooperative system for land development which have been 
initiated in the developed areas of the Zhu Jiang delta are 
worth being introduced into other localities in the delta with a 
relatively developed economy and where there is a large, 
redundant rural labor force available, where secondary and 
tertiary industries, especially township and town enterprises, 
account for a great portion of the economy, and where the system 
is readily accepted by the peasants. It is necessary to 
gradually implement this system under strong leadership on the 
basis of pilot projects and in accordance with the principle 
that reform should give full play to the peasants' initiative 
and help to stabilize and promote agricultural production, 
promote economic returns, and increase peasants' incomes.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS)--In order to ease the tense 
state of the rice supply to residents in Beijing, the municipal 
grain administration has decided to put 10 million kilograms of 
rice onto the market in the capital. 
  It is reported that the main reasons for the rice shortage 
in 
the city are first, most of the grain shops there have been 
leased out and they are being used for selling other commodities 
while those with grain storage are refusing to sell grain to 
urban dwellers. Second, the fair markets there are either short 
of a rice supply or the prices of rice in such markets are too 
high or their quality is too low. In addition, some rice shops 
are running at a loss because the rice they sell is shipped from 
their original places of production resulting in the rice retail 
price being much higher than the price limitation set by the 
state with the highest price set at RMB 1.7 [renminbi] per 
kilogram. 
  The municipal grain bureau has allocated 10 million 
kilograms 
of rice to the state-run grain shops with the highest price set 
at RMB 1.6 per kilogram.

  [Text] Taipei, April 28 (CNA) -- Taiwan will not attend 
the convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
(CITES) Animals Committee meeting in Beijing, according to the 
Council of Agriculture (COA). 
  A COA official confirmed Thursday [28 April] that Beijing 
has 
rejected Taiwan's application to attend the CITES Asian regional 
meeting on the grounds that Taiwan is not a CITES member. 
  However, local conservation groups, including the Beautiful 
Taiwan Foundation and Green Consumer Foundation said they will 
contact Animal Committee Chairman Robert Jenkins to lobby for 
Taiwan's attendance. 
  A three-member civilian delegation was originally set to 
represent the COA at the meeting which Beijing said is an 
official meeting of CITES member countries. Taiwan is not a 
CITES member. 
  The delegation included Professor Li Ling-ling of National 
Taiwan University's Zoology Department, Professor Wang Ing of 
National Normal University's Biology Department, and Professor 
Chang Hsien- che of the China Medical College. 
  The biennial CITES Animals Committee meeting is a warm-up 
for 
the 1994 CITES meeting, which is scheduled to open in Florida 
this November. 
  Both the COA and local conservation groups hope to attend 
the 
committee meeting since it will discuss the future direction of 
international wildlife management.

  [Text] Guiyang, April 28 (XINHUA)--A massive survey into 
the habitations of 12 minor ethnic groups in Southwest China's 
Guizhou Province has been very fruitful, sources here said. 
  Yu Hongmo, a scholar of minor ethnic origin who has been 
taking part in the survey, said the 12-year survey acquired a 
huge amount of precious first-hand materials about the ethnic 
peoples in the province and their natural surroundings, and 
provided a further insight into their life, customs, economics 
and culture. 
  The 12 ethnic peoples, namely Miao, Buyi, Yi, Tong, Tujia, 
Yao and others, account for one-third of the province's 
population. And most of them live in remote mountainous areas. 
  More than 300 scholars, mainly from the Guizhou Minority 
Ethnics Institute, the provincial academy of social sciences, 
the Guizhou Museum and other research bodies, participated in 
the survey, the second of its kind since the 1950s. 
  Yu, who is director of the Guizhou Minority Ethnics 
Institute, said most of the surveyors are of ethnic background. 
Their knowledge of the languages and customs of the people 
surveyed is critical to the success of the survey. 
  The survey shows that the province's ethnic areas hold more 
than 8,000 kinds of plants and 300 kinds of animals of important 
economic value. 
  Among them, 67 sorts of plants are rare and endangered 
species under government protection, and 68 sorts of animals are 
either near-extinct or special to the region. 
  The survey also found that the ethnic regions, though 
underdeveloped, possess rich resources of coal, antimony, 
phosphorus and mercury that are easy to exploit. 
  Based on their survey, scholars have set forth many 
suggestions on developing local economies, tourism, ethnic 
language education, and protection of ethnic cultural heritage 
which have been widely adopted by the provincial and local 
government, yu said. 
  Since 1983, scholars have published 11 treatises on their 
survey findings and studies, which provide a precious reference 
to ethnic researchers at home and abroad. 
  Yu disclosed that the survey would continue in the future, 
as 
the provincial government has agreed to provide further 
financial support.

<F P=106> [By Gansu Province Governor Zhang Wule: "Province Strives </F>
to Be Corridor of Industrial Power"] 
  [Text] Gansu, a province of northwest China with huge 
economic potential has already attracted many domestic and 
international investors. 
  After years of hard work, the province now has a booming 
economic construction drive in progress and a pattern of opening 
to the outside world in all sectors has been formed. 
  By the end of last March, there were 870 foreign investment 
enterprises in Gansu, with a total investment of $1.11 billion. 
Last year alone, more than 500 enterprises opened in the 
province. 
  Moreover, 87 offices from various foreign economic 
organizations have been established in Lanzhou, capital of the 
province, acting in close co-operation with developments 
throughout the province. 
  Gansu is a landlocked area. 
  Renowned both at home and abroad, the Silk Road passes for 
1,655 kilometres through the whole length of the province. This 
accounts for one-fifth of the ancient trading route's total 
length. Traditionally therefore, Gansu has always been an 
important region to China for its cultural and trade exchanges 
with other countries. 
  Over 2,000 mining sites have been discovered. Among these, 
there are 115 useful minerals. The proven reserves of nickel 
rank the mine second in the world, while reserves of 23 other 
minerals take fifth place in China, and those of 10 more 
deposits take first place in China. Nonferrous and rare metals 
such as nickel, copper, zinc, antimony, cobalt, platinum, 
rhodium, and iridium have realistic and potential advantages for 
extraction. 
  Gansu is one of China's five major pastoral areas. Meat, 
hide, wool, and milk are the main products. There are over 
4,000 kinds of wild plants, of which 950 are sources of Chinese 
medicinal herbs. Particularly important is the production of 
Chinese angelica, dangshen, licorice root, red and yellow vetch, 
Chinese rhubarb, safflowers, the bulb of fritillary, elevated 
gastrodia, and glossy ganoderma. It is especially famous for 
Minggui (angelica root) and wendan (root of baily asiabell) both 
in Ghina and abroad. 
  Besides grain production, the province produces huge 
quantities of honeydew melons, black melon seeds, dongguo pears, 
rose oil, black moss, garlic, dates, apples, day lily, and lily 
flower. 
  Many of China's important industry bases have been set up in 
the province. Of particular note are the Jiuquan Satellite 
Town, Baiyin Copper Town, Jinchan Nickel Town, and Jiayuguan 
Iron and Steel Town. 
  Gansu has a complete network of railways, highways, and 
airlines, taking Lanzhou as the geographical centre. It also 
has an important section of the continental bridge, the 
international railway between Europe and Asia, from Lianyungang 
in Jiangsu province to Amsterdam in Holland. Gansu has over 20 
airlines connecting it with cities at home and abroad. 
  Telecommunications and telephone calls to every city in 
China 
and 152 countries and regions are available. 
  In the educational field, there are over 130 research 
institutes and 18 universities and colleges with 310,000 
technical personnel of various specialities. All of these have 
formed a synthetical study base in science and technology and 
such an impressive capacity in science and technology ranks 
Gansu ninth in the country. 
  Approved by the state government, Gansu enjoys preferential 
policies on a par with the opening eastern coastal cities. The 
province introduced preferential measures to encourage foreign 
investment in August 1992. According to the measures, all 
overseas investors and investors from Hong Kong, Macao, and 
Taiwan can enjoy the following preferential policies: 
  -- Enterprises run outside downtown areas can operate free 
of 
charge in land usage during their construction and five years 
after they become operative. 
  -- Enterprises involved in cultural, educational, scientific 
research, medicine, social welfare, traffic, mining, farming and 
forestry, animal husbandry, municipal infrastructure, and others 
operative in remote areas will have no land use charges levied 
upon them during their operation. 
  -- Investors who develop land can do so free of charge from 
land usage tax during their period of development. 
  -- Enterprises can enjoy priority of supplies of water, 
electricity, gas, coal, oil, loan provision, raw materials, 
communication priority, traffic dispatch, and personnel hire. 
  -- Investors can enjoy a whole range of preferential 
treatment in creating foreign exchange, depreciation of fixed 
assets, balance of foreign exchange, visa issuance, and living 
conditions.

<F P=106> ["Newsletter" by Wu Guoqing (0702 0948 3237): "Ningxia Curbs </F>
Drug Trafficking"] 
<H5>  txt}[Text] Yinchuan, 8 Apr (XINHUA) -- International drug </H5>
trafficking rings have gone all out in recent years in an 
attempt to open up a so-called "China passageway." Drug 
traffickers who ply their trade from their provinces emerged 
even in remote, outlying places in the north. These drug 
trafficking activities were quickly held back. 
<H5>  Beacon-Fire Rose in the North </H5>
  In the late 1980s, some self-employed traders from Ningxia 
region who transported goods to Yunnan and Guangzhou or dealt in 
native and special products there became addicted to drugs. 
Lured by the promises of gain from international drug 
trafficking rings, they gradually joined the business of drug 
trafficking. With money raised in Ningxia, they went to Yunnan 
to buy narcotics from the "Golden Triangle" and took them to 
Guangzhou for sale, playing the role of "mazai" [ma zai 7456 
0098 -- drug runner] for the international drug trafficking 
rings. Thanks to the extraordinary profits of drug trafficking, 
some of these lawbreakers became very rich overnight. More and 
more people from Tongxin County and neighboring mountainous 
areas in southern Ningxia joined the drug trade. 
  For many, trading in drugs outside Ningxia became a 
"shortcut" to wealth. They either provided capital, services, 
or both, and sometimes hired help to traffic in narcotics. 
People with no money joined in the action with borrowed capital 
or worked as a "mazai" for others. Also emerged were big-time 
drug kingpins like Ma Shixin, Zhou Yanji, and Hai Zongru whose 
drug-trafficking activities even had some nationwide impact. 
  They had well-organized, clandestine drug-trafficking 
set-ups 
to handle everything from purchasing, transportation, to 
marketing, and they organized frequent transregional drug 
trafficking. 
  These outbound drug traffickers also brought narcotics back 
to Ningxia, resulting in drug taking in many parts of Ningxia. 
  All circles of society--including the broad mass of Hui and 
Han nationalities--called for cracking down on outbound drug 
trafficking and strictly enforcing the ban on narcotics to make 
the north clean again. 
<H5>  The Capture of Drug kingpins </H5>
  As the saying goes: To catch bandits, first catch the 
ringleader. Ningxia's public security departments launched an 
aggressive crackdown to hold in check the evil trend of outbound 
drug trafficking. Their first targets were the ringleaders. 
  Target No. 1 was drug kingpin Zhou Yanji. A native of 
Weizhou Town in Tongxin County, he goes by the nickname of "Zhou 
Da," as he is the first child of the family. Weizhou is the 
birth place of outbound drug trafficking. For a time, Zhou was 
the ringleader of outbound drug trafficking in Ningxia and the 
northwest. Daring and cunning, the 30-year-old Zhou Yanji 
established a drug trafficking ring with over 100 people that 
carried out its dirty trade over half of China. He was wanted 
by public security organs in Yunnan, Guangdong, Sichuan, and 
Ningxia, and the Ministry of Public Security. Many times he was 
able to successfully escape the net that was cast to catch him. 
During one narcotics transaction in Yunnan, drug-enforcement 
policemen suddenly forced open the door and Zhou jumped out of 
the window and ran away injured, leaving behind 15.9 kg of 
heroin and 450,000 yuan in cash. 
  The cloven hoof eventually gave the devil away. In early 
December 1991, Ningxia's public security departments got 
information that Zhou had sneaked back and was hiding out in his 
home town with his armed bodyguards. After careful 
investigation and planning, the Ningxia Autonomous Regional 
Public Security Department issued an order to the Yinnan 
Prefectural Public Security Department for the drug kingpin's 
arrest. 
  In the early hours of 14 December, a special motorcade with 
scores of public security and armed policemen in full battle 
array quietly left Wuzhong City and headed directly for Weizhou 
Town in Tongxin County. Policemen assigned to the assault, road 
checks, or encircling the site quickly took their positions and 
began to quietly close in on their target. 
  After taking their combat positions, the assault squad, at 
the sound of the command, sprang toward the target and forced 
open the door. They didn't find Zhou in his house or at three 
of his hideouts. As the assault squad was about to enlarge the 
scope of search, a window of Zhou's neighbor's house suddenly 
opened and a dark shadow jumped out. Policemen who were lying 
in ambush close by quickly released a police dog to chase him. 
With a guileful dodge, the dark shadow tricked the police dog 
to fall into a deep pit nearby. As he started to run, two 
policemen jumped out and sprang on the dark shadow and subdued 
him in no time at all. At this time, search lights from all 
directions converged on the dark shadow to reveal what it was: 
What they saw is the sorry sight of the big-time drug kingpin 
Zhou Yanji, barefoot and wearing only a vest and pants, 
shivering in the cold winds. Zhou's bodyguards were also 
captured in the operation. According to Zhou's confessions, he 
took part in the transaction of as much as 200 kg of heroin. 
  The second target was Ma Shixin, known as "the top drug 
kingpin in Ningxia." He was a big-time ringleader from Ningxia 
who was engaged in the drug trade the longest--hiding out mostly 
in Yunnan--and had a big "herd" of followers and hangers-on. 
Confident that Yunnan's public security organs did not have 
anything on him because his activities were so well concealed 
and that he was also beyond the reach of Ningxia's public 
security organs, he married again in Dali, Yunnan, and was seen 
blatently swaggering through the streets of Dali city from time 
to time. On 2 April, as he was again swaggering leisurely in 
the streets of Dali, several police officers from Ningxia 
suddenly emerged in front of his face. Before he knew what 
happened, shiny handcuffs were already on his wrists. It turned 
out that the police officers were part of an antidrug brigade 
set up by Ningxia's public security department who had travelled 
thousands of kilometers to Yunnan to arrest Ma and bring him to 
justice. 
  Hai Zongru and many other drug ringleaders were also 
captured 
one after another, thereby frightening Ningxia drug dealers and 
restraining their criminals activities. 
<H5>  Block the Sources of Narcotics and Deal With Both the </H5>
Symptoms and the Root Cause of Drug Trafficking 
  In mid-August 1992, the State Antinarcotics Office and the 
Ministry of Public Security, summoned Ningxia's relevant 
personnel to Beijing for an exclusive briefing on antinarcotics 
efforts and to work out plans for a special crackdown on 
Ningxia's drug dealers operating out of the region. 
  Pursuant to the policy of "blocking the sources of 
narcotics, 
enforcing the ban of growing, taking, and selling of narcotics, 
and dealing with both the symptoms and the root cause," the 
regional CPC committee and government have spread a mammoth 
dragnet to enforce the drug ban all over the land of the north. 
  In late October, task forces made up of dozens of Ningxia 
public security police left for Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong 
to capture drug dealers and take into custody drug suspects. 
With help from public security departments in the three 
provinces, in two months the expedition forces cracked six 
exceptionally large cases involving Ningxia dealers, arrested 59 
Ningxia drug dealers, confiscated over 40 kg of heroin, and sent 
back to Ningxia a large number of drug suspects. 
  Meanwhile, in cooperation with public security units, 
government at all levels in Ningxia also cracked down on the 
offensive launched by drug traffickers operating outside the 
region. They sent work teams to counties and villages with 
serious drug problems to publicize the drug ban, and to educate 
and mobilize the masses to combat drug trafficking. 
  According to the regional antinacortics office, Ningxia has 
made great headway in its war on drug trafficking. As of the 
end of 1993, the region had smashed 55 drug rings, arrested 776 
drug criminals, and confiscated a large amount of narcotics, and 
destroyed a number of underground opium dens. Under the impact 
of the severe crackdown of public security departments and the 
influence of the party's lenient policy, many drug dealers 
returned home to surrender themselves. Ningxia's outbound drug 
trafficking has been restrained somewhat.

  [Excerpts] The provincial government called a meeting 
yesterday to analyze the province's economic situation. During 
the meeting, the participants reviewed the province's economic 
operation in the first quarter this year. The objectives and 
primary tasks were set forth for the second quarter. 
  Tian Chengping, Wang Hanmin, Ma Yuanbiao, Bai Ma, and the 
principal officials in charge of all the commissions, 
committees, offices, departments, and bureaus of the provincial 
government attended the meeting. 
  The leading officials of the provincial planning commission, 
the financial and economic commission, the financial department, 
the commercial department, the economic and trade department, 
the statistical bureau, the agricultural and animal husbandry 
office, and the provincial People's Bank briefed the meeting 
participants on the conditions in industry, agriculture, capital 
construction, foreign trade, and implementation of the financial 
budget in the first quarter of this year. 
  Statistics show that the province's GDP for the first 
quarter 
this year totaled more than 1,722 million yuan, which means a 
5.7 percent increase over the same period last year in terms of 
comparable prices. Industry has maintained a 5.6 percent growth 
rate, and agriculture and animal husbandry have exhibited 
satisfactory performance. Foreign trade has been developing 
steadily and the banking sector has been operating smoothly. 
The economic operation as a whole remained basically stable in 
the first quarter, but some fairly serious problems have yet to 
be resolved. The main problems are as follows: with regard to 
agriculture, slow progress has been made in spring sowing; the 
peasants' investment in agricultural production has decreased; 
and, with regard to industry, production has been affected by 
various factors and has dropped by 10.9 percentage points as 
compared with the same period last year; a larger portion of 
enterprises have suffered losses, with an increasing amount of 
losses set against decreasing economic returns. 
  To cope with the existing problems and difficulties, 
Governor 
Tian Chengping urged the departments in charge of comprehensive 
economic management, competent departments, and banking and 
taxation sectors to work together more closely to ensure steady 
economic growth this year. [passage omitted] 
  Tian Chengping said: Deepening reform is an effective 
approach to invigorating the economy, especially large- and 
medium-sized enterprises. Enterprises must devote efforts to 
transform the enterprise operational mechanism, while government 
agencies, in the process of functional transformation, must not 
slacken their guidance and assistance to enterprises, but must 
instead strive to solve more practical problems and serve the 
enterprises. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] The provincial party committee held a monthly 
meeting yesterday morning [6 April] to relay the spirit of the 
Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC]. 
Governor Tian Chengping, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee, presided over the meeting, at which Huanjue 
Cenam, chairman of the provincial people's congress standing 
committee, relayed the spirit of the Second Session of the 
Eighth NPC. [passage omitted] 
  Governor Tian Chengping, deputy secretary of the provincial 
party committee, delivered a speech in which he called for 
implementing comprehensively the spirit of the Second Session of 
the Eighth NPC. He stated: It is necessary to organize the 
broad masses of cadres, and especially leading cadres, to 
continually and profoundly study the 'Selected Works of Deng 
Xiaoping," volume three; the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics; the basic theory of the socialist 
market economy; and the relevant state principles, policies, 
laws, and decrees; as well as to firmly master the principal 
spirit of each and every major reform; unify ideology; work for, 
submit to, and serve the overall interests; strive to 
successfully push ahead with reforms; work out new reform 
measures; gradually resolve the province's in-depth 
contradictions; and deepen reforms. 
  Governor Tian Chengping pointed out: With the central 
financial strength becoming stronger with each passing day, the 
state gradually will make more investment in and accelerate the 
economic exploitation of central and west China. Therefore, we 
should firmly grasp the current excellent opportunity to quicken 
the pace of resource exploitation and economic development; 
bring into full play Qinghai's superior resources; take full 
advantage of the fact that Qinghai has a relatively small 
population; make redoubled efforts to build each and every 
locally based small and medium-sized resource exploitation 
project; secure more state investment in the locally based large 
and medium-sized construction projects; and strive to accelerate 
resource exploitation by developing lateral economic 
associations with neighboring provinces and regions, inviting 
more foreign and domestic funds; and developing compensation 
trade. 
  Governor Tian Chengping maintained: It is also necessary to 
energetically and simultaneously build both the spiritual and 
material civilizations; to vigorously strengthen and improve 
ideological and propaganda work; to rely on the broad masses of 
people; to enhance solidarity; to vigorously push ahead with all 
types of work; to implement to the letter each and every basic 
party and state principle, as well as the spirit of the current 
meeting; to unify ideology; to strengthen confidence; to make 
concerted efforts; and to make greater contributions to building 
a stronger and more prosperous Qinghai.

  [Excerpts] At a provincial discussion on family planning 
work, held on 16 April, Governor Tian Chengping, deputy 
secretary of the provincial party committee, pointed out: The 
population problem is a social, as well as an economic problem. 
He added: Pursuing the population and family planning 
goal-directed responsibility system is a key measure for 
ensuring that principal party and government leaders grasp 
family planning work in person, and that they are wholly 
responsible for this work. Practice over the past years has 
shown that such measures have played an important role in 
enhancing the sense of responsibility of leaders at all levels 
for family planning work, enabling them to grasp two kinds of 
production simultaneously, and exercising control over 
population growth. [passage omitted] 
  Tian Chengping emphasized: The focal point and difficulties 
facing family planning work in our province lie in rural and 
pastoral areas. From now on, we must gradually change the 
previous practice of relying on administrative order, taking 
remedial measures, and carrying out shock work to promote family 
planning. We must guide and help the masses to take the road of 
linking family planning with developing the rural commodity 
economy, working hard to become rich and advance toward 
small-scale prosperity, and establishing civilized and happy 
families. Party and government leaders at all levels must make 
great efforts to establish a service network for family 
planning, and to do practical work for the family planning 
drive. Financial departments at all levels must increase their 
investment in family planning work so as to ensure the necessary 
working conditions. It is necessary to establish a family 
planning work contingent in rural areas as soon as possible so 
as to ensure that work at the grass-roots level is taken care of 
and grasped. 
  Tian Chengping stressed: Family planning work is a very 
difficult job of a mass nature. It is impossible to do it well 
simply by relying on family planning departments. He urged 
various government departments and all of society to make 
concerted efforts to participate in family planning work. He 
also urged fully arousing and relying on the masses to carry out 
family planning work in a deep-going, meticulous, and solid 
manner.

  [Text] The 1993 task of democratically assessing party 
members has been completed. A number of outstanding party 
members have emerged as the times require and a very small 
number of party members have been organizationally disciplined. 
  This year, in accordance with the characteristics of the 
ideological work in their own localities, departments, and 
trades and with existing problems, party organizations have 
stressed the main points of the specific fields of assessment 
work. Offices laid stress on gaining the forgiveness of the 
masses, forming close ties with the masses, and providing 
warm-hearted service to the grass-roots units; enterprises laid 
stress on supporting reform and fostering the spirit of being 
the masters of their own affairs; and the agricultural and 
animal husbandry areas laid stress on being in the forefront of 
guiding the masses in taking the road of common prosperity. 
Moreover, various localities and units paid special attention 
to national unity and universally conducted education among 
party members in safeguarding social stability, strengthening 
the unity of the various nationalities, and correctly 
approaching the issue of religion, thus enhancing the thinking 
and understanding of the broad masses of party members. 
  To ensure both quality and [words indistinct], many units 
made their own specific arrangements. Party organizations at 
all levels in many localities combined the assessment work with 
anticorruption work, encouraging honesty, self-examination, and 
self-correction, with the goals of party branches and party 
members; with year-end summarizing of party work and the 
election of outstanding party members; with socialist 
ideological education and education in the party's nationality 
and religious policies; with day-to-day education and the 
centralized training of party members; and with peasant party 
members' efforts to take the lead in taking the road to 
prosperity using science and technology. 
  Thanks to well organized arrangements, regular guidance 
given 
and the inspection of work done during holidays, and the 
adoption of rectification and correction measures, the work 
committee for organs under the provincial government, Hainan and 
Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Regions, and other localities have 
achieved quite good results.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (AFP)--The Chinese government 
said Thursday that the release of famed dissident Wang Juntao, 
sent at the weekend to the United States for medical treatment, 
has nothing to do with renewing most favored nation (MFN) 
trading status. 
  The United States is due to rule on renewing China's MFN in 
June. 
  "The MFN status is a reciprocal and mutual beneficial 
arrangement between China and the USA and should not be linked 
to any issue irrelevant to it," Chinese Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Wu Jianmin said in response to a question about 
sending Wang to the United States. 
  "Because of the sickness of prisoner Wang Juntao, Chinese 
judicial departments in accordance with Chinese law, permitted 
him to receive medical treatment," he said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton had asked for significant 
progress on human rights issues in China before renewing MFN, 
which allows Chinese products easier access to US markets. The 
dissident, one of the primary leaders of the crushed democracy 
movement of 1989, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in 1991. 
During detention, he contracted hepatitis and his health in 
general deteriorated in recent years. 
  Wu refused to say whether Wang would be allowed to return to 
China after recovering, saying it was up to judicial 
authorities. He also said a recent visit to the United States by 
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi was a 
"success and will help enhance the mutual understanding between 
the two countries and promote the bilateral trade and economic 
ties."

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS) -- Spokesman of China's 
Ministry of Foreign affairs, Mr. Wu Jianmin, replying to a 
question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held here today 
asking for his comments on and China's hopes regarding the 
forming of the Japanese cabinet by the new Prime Minister, Mr. 
Tsutomu Hata, said that the Chinese Premier Mr. Li Peng had sent 
a congratulatory message to Mr. Hata on his election as prime 
minister of Japan and he added that Mr. Hata was a well-known 
statesman to the Chinese people. China appreciated his zeal and 
farsightedness as well as his contribution to the strengthening 
of Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation. All Japanese political 
parties both in power or not had the same stance on the 
development of mutual cooperation in various fields between the 
two countries. China believed that after the establishment of 
the new Japanese government, the two countries would continue 
their close coordination and cooperation and make joint efforts 
to promote the development of Sino-Japanese ties in a long-term 
and steady way. 
  In answering a question on who China will send to take part 
in the inauguration ceremony of the new president of South 
Africa, Mr. Wu said that the inauguration of the new presient of 
South Africa signaled the end of racist rule and the start of 
national equality in the country. China had all along firmly 
supported the just struggle of the people of South Africa. 
China was glad to see the historical victory won by them and 
would like to express its congratulations to the inauguration 
ceremony of the new president of South Africa. 
  In a separate development, the spokesman announced that at 
the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li 
Peng, the President of the Republic of Kenya, Mr. Daniel Arap 
Moi, would pay a state visit to China from May 3 to 7 and the 
Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohammed would pay a 
working visit to China from May 11 to 13.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- China resolutely 
opposes [jian jue fan dui 1017 0414 0646 1417] the "Murkowski 
Amendment" approved by the U.S. Congress recently, stressed a 
spokesman of the Foreign Ministry. 
  The remark was made by the spokesman while answering a 
question at a news conference this afternoon. 
  The reporter's question was: The joint conference of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States on 
19 April adopted the modified Murkowski Amendment, which asserts 
that the "Taiwan Relations Act" takes primacy over the Sino-U.S. 
17 August Joint Communique. What is your comment on this? 
  The spokesman said: The Murkowski Amendment, which asserts 
that sections 2 and 3 of the "Taiwan Relations Act" take primacy 
over statements of U.S. policy, including communiques, 
regulations, directives, and policies based thereon, is 
designed, in essence, to negate the Sino-U.S. 17 August Joint 
Communique, undermine [po huai 4275 0975] Sino-U.S. relations 
and erect obstacles to the great cause of the peaceful 
reunification of the Chinese people. It is absolutely 
unacceptable [jue dui bu neng jie shou 4815 1417 0008 5174 2234 
0649] and the Chinese Government and people are firmly against 
it [jian jue fan dui 1017 0414 0646 1417]. 
  He said: "We demand [yao qiu 6008 3061] that the U.S. 
Government take this case seriously, abide by the principles 
guiding Sino-U.S. relations as set forth in their three joint 
communiques, live up to its promises, and immediately take 
effective [qie shi you xiao 0434 1395 2589 2400] measures to 
avoid bringing serious harm [yan zhong sun hai 0917 6850 2275 
1364] to Sino-U.S. relations.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) proposed today to continue 
consultations with the United States over the establishment of a 
new peace safeguard system on the Korean peninsula. 
  The new system is intended to prevent the increase of 
military forces and a reoccurrence of war in the region so as to 
guarantee peace and security. 
  DPRK's Deputy Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong said at a press 
conference here that recently the United States, in defiance of 
the armistice agreement of Korea, has continuously increased its 
military presence and massed troops on the Korean peninsula and 
in surrounding areas. 
  "This has actually turned the armistice agreement into empty 
words that cannot guarantee peace on the peninsula and the 
Korean Military Armistice Commission exists in name only," he 
said. 
  Song stressed that in order to eliminate the hostility 
between the United States and the DPRK, to realize 
reconciliation and guarantee genuine peace and security on the 
peninsula, the armistice agreement should be turned into a peace 
agreement and a new peace safeguard system be established to 
replace the armistice institution. 
  In reply to questions from reporters, Song said that before 
the DPRK and the United States reach agreement on establishing 
the new peace safeguard system, the dprk would continue to 
faithfully abide by the armistice agreement. 
  But he said the DPRK would not deal with the United Nations 
forces who were a party to signing the armistice agreement, but 
would prefer to continue dealing with the United States. 
  Song appealed to the United States to respond to the DPRK's 
proposal and hold consultations with it on establishing the new 
peace safeguard system to ease the tension on the Korean 
peninsula.

  [Text] United Nations, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Thursday [28 April] 
proposed that a new peace agreement be made with the U.S. to 
replace a 40-year old armistice agreement. 
  The proposal was declared by Pak Kil-yon, DPRK permanent 
representative to the UN, when reading out an official statement 
of the DPRK Foreign Ministry. 
  The statement said the recent move by the U.S. to ship 
"Patriot" missiles and a squadron of "Apache" helicopters 
constitute severe violation of the Korean armistice, which 
required non-introduction of any operational material from 
abroad and cessation of arms buildup on the Korean peninsula. 
  "Now that they have failed to live up to their 
responsibility 
for stabilizing the situation on the Korean peninsula and 
curbing military buildup there and they have been used for 
covering up the United States' policy of strangling DPRK," the 
statement said, "there is an absolute necessity for establishing 
a peace arrangment." 
  The statement added that such a new agreement could "prevent 
arms buildup or recurrence of war, stabilize the situation and 
reliably guarantee durable peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula on a practical basis." It called on the UN to respond 
to the proposal.

  [Text] United Nations, April 26 (XINHUA) -- 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today reiterated U.N.'s 
determination to use NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
Forces if they do not withdraw from Gorazde by midnight. 
  "I am hoping that the Serbs will comply with the different 
resolutions which have been adopted by the United Nations (and 
NATO) and that they will withdraw from Gorazde to a perimeter of 
20 kilometers, and that we will not be compelled to use air 
strikes tonight at 8 o'clock New York time," said the 
secretary-general in a press conference in Bridgetown, Barbados 
today. 
  "But if they will not withdraw... [ellipses as received]," 
said the secretary-general, "Then we will use air strikes 
against them without any hesitation," according to a U.N. news 
release today. 
  The NATO April-22 decision said all Bosnian Serb heavy 
weapons must be withdrawn by 0001 GMT on April 27 (0800 New York 
time). Otherwise, "These weapons and other Bosnian Serb military 
assets, as well as their direct and essential military support 
facilities, including but not limited to fuel installations and 
munitions sites, will be subject to NATO air strikes."

  [Text] Moscow, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin told visiting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on 
Tuesday [26 April] that Russia will take a further active part 
in Mideast affairs. 
  The Russian president met Rabin this morning and the two 
leaders discussed the situation in the Middle East and the state 
of and prospects for bilateral relations, according to a 
statement issued by the Russian president's press service. 
  "When discussing the Mideast peace process, Yeltsin stressed 
Russia will take a further active part in Mideast affairs in 
order to achieve the soonest results in the peace process and 
create a zone of good neighborliness and stability near its 
southern borders," the statement said. 
  In his turn, Rabin thanked Moscow for its active efforts to 
help the gradual development of the Arab-Israeli negotiations 
and stressed Israel's interest in expanding broad cooperation 
with Russia in regional and international affairs. 
  "The sides positively estimated bilateral relations and 
stressed that the signing of important inter-governmental 
documents during the visit creates a solid basis for their 
further development," the statement said. 
  Rabin arrived in Moscow on Sunday for his first official 
visit to Russia, only four days after Palestinian leader Yasir 
'Arafat left Moscow. 
  On Monday, Rabin held talks with his Russian counterpart 
Viktor Chernomyrdin and signed six documents on bilateral 
cooperation in trade-economic, scientific-technical, cultural 
and other fields. 
  He met with two speakers of the Russian parliament's lower 
and upper houses, Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko. 
  On Tuesday morning, the Israeli prime minister met with 
Yeltsin, and then with foreign minister Andrey Kozyrev and 
Defense Minister Pavel Grachev respectively. 
  In a brief speech before the meeting for talks with Rabin, 
Grachev stressed that Moscow "attaches special importance to the 
achievement of peace in the Middle East, a region strategically 
important for Russia."

  [Text] Bonn, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Moscow and Bonn today 
suggested a meeting of foreign ministers from the United States, 
Britain, Russia, France and Germany to push for an end to the 
war in Bosnia. 
  The meeting would also include representatives from the 
three 
warring sides, according to the proposal put forward here by 
visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his German 
counterpart Klaus Kinkel. 
  Such a meeting would help iron out differences in policy 
among the consulting countries and, if successful, would pave 
the way for a summit on the conflict between the five nations, 
said Kozyrev. 
  Kinkel stressed Russia's participation in peaceful efforts 
to 
end the civil war in the former Yugoslavia. He also demanded 
that Russia exert pressure on the Bosnian serbs. 
  Kozyrev's meeting with Kinkel followed talks earlier this 
week with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, as well as 
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, aimed at finding ways to 
promote an end to the war in Bosnia.

  [Text] Brussels, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Western Europe, the 
United States and Russia need to map out and implement a "common 
strategy" in resolving the Bosnian crisis, a former U.N. 
commander in Bosnia said today. 
  The crisis is being prolonged because of a lack of unity in 
the world community, Francis Briquemont, former commander of the 
U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, said in the local media. 
  Earlier this month, NATO issued two ultimatums to the 
Bosnian 
serbs but did not imposed the same pressure on the other two 
warring sides, Muslims and Croats, he explained. 
  General Briquemont, who retired from the post in January, 
stressed that the "game of two against one" can only deepen the 
crisis. 
  Differences on Bosnia among the big powers has led the 
warring sides to have a "wrong vision" and to make "wrong 
judgements", the general added. 
  Along with a common strategy, Briquemont indicated, the 
world 
community must make it clear to the warring parties that "the 
use of arms will not resolve any problems, but will only hurt 
each nationality". 
  Referring to NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions, the 
general said that representatives of the United Nations should 
not give in to "political pressure" by asking for such action. 
  The general further stated that air strikes against the 
Bosnian Serbs will not resolve the crisis.

  [Text] Brussels, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Military chiefs from 
NATO countries, Eastern Europe and former Soviet republics met 
here today over cooperation including joint exercises and 
training. 
  Chiefs of staff from more than 30 countries gathered for the 
third time since the end of the Cold War to discuss the 
"Partnership for Peace" plan and peacekeeping in Europe. 
  About 14 countries from Eastern Europe and former Soviet 
republics have signed up for the plan. Angered by NATO's recent 
military action in Bosnia, Russia has postponed the signing. 
  Under the Partnership scheme, there were plans for one 
military exercise on land and one at sea this year, Sir Richard 
Vincent, the chairman of NATO's military committee told a news 
conference. 
  Earlier today, speaking at the meeting, Vincent said 
valuable 
progress had been made in "helping safeguard peace through 
active cooperation on defence matters and military contacts." 
  "It is increasingly evident that this cooperative 
approach...is a practical and useful element in our attempts to 
provide stability and peace," Vincent added.

  [Text] Nicosia, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The U.N. secretary 
General's special representative on Cyprus Joe Clark has tried 
to change the U.N. document of March 21 concerning the 
implementation of the confidence-building measures (CBM), a 
senior government official said here today. 
  Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said in his daily 
briefing that the Greek Cypriot side had accepted the March 21 
paper regarding the U.N.-proposed measures. 
  The document provides only for the unmanning of the area 
south of the fenced part of the Turkish-held town of Varosha 
(Famagusta) to allow access from the government-controlled area 
to this part of the coastal town. 
  According to the document, the Turkish troops should 
withdraw 
from this particular area although the area would remain under 
Turkish control. The road linking the government-controlled 
area with the fenced part of Famagusta would be under U.N. 
control. 
  According to the spokesman, in a speech Saturday [16 April] 
in Washington, the U.N. envoy said this area could be used for 
civilian purposes, something which is not provided for by the 
March 21 document. 
  Clark was quoted as saying that because of the lack of 
confidence between the two communities on the island, "We have 
proposed that access to Varosha be under United Nations 
protection. 
  "This would imply that the Turkish Cypriot side would not 
station military or police personnel on the access route to 
Varosha or in the immediately adjacent area, even though it 
would retain formal control of the area and obviously could go 
on using it for civilian purposes," the U.N. envoy reportedly 
said. 
  Clark added, "in fact, the access route stays Turkish. There 
is no surrender of land. The United Nations would have an 
obligation to protect passage, and, in effect, to guarantee the 
safety of those using the road, but there is no transfer of 
land." 
  The CBM, put forward by the U.N. chief last May, provides 
for 
the transfer of the Turkish-held fenced area of Varosha to the 
U.N. administration to allow some 16,000 Greek Cypriot refugees 
to reclaim their properties, and the reopening of the now 
defunct Nicosia International Airport, again under U.N. control. 
  The island's two communities, the Greek and Turkish 
Cypriots, 
have been engaged in proximity talks aimed at implementing the 
CBM since February 17. 
  On March 21, the U.N. representatives presented to the two 
sides a document regarding the implementation of the peace plan, 
which was accepted by the Greek Cypriot side, but rejected by 
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, thus leading to the 
failure of the U.N. efforts to reach an agreement by the end of 
March, the deadline set by the U.N. Security Council. 
  In order to save the U.N. peace package, the U.N. chief 
decided earlier this month to extend the deadline to allow the 
parties concerned to conclude an agreement before the end of 
April. 
  Joe Clark and his deputy representative Gustave Feissel are 
currently visiting Ankara in an effort to persuade the Turkish 
side to accept the U.N. document of March 21. 
  The Greek Cypriot has repeatedly declared it would not 
accept 
a revised version of the document. 
  Clark and Feissel are expected in Cyprus Wednesday to 
discuss 
the CBM with President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot 
leader Denktash. 
  The Cyprus problem started in 1974 when Turkey sent troops 
to 
seize one third of its territory following a Greek Cypriot coup 
seeking union with Greece. 
  Repeated U.N.-sponsored peace talks, aimed at reuniting the 
island under a bizonal and bicommunal federal system, have so 
far failed to yield any results.

  [Text] Geneva, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The needs of the 
developing countries should be fully considered in the 
implementation of the final agreement of the Uruguay Round 
talks, Chinese delegate Tang Yufeng said here today. 
  He made the remarks at the 40th session of the Trade and 
Development Board of the U.N. Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD). 
  Tang pointed out that the conclusion of the Uruguay Round 
talks and the creation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) will 
undoubtedly have an impact on the world trade structure and the 
economic development of different countries till the early next 
century. 
  The agreement in a whole, however, hasn't reached an 
expected 
overall balance and in particular hasn't given a full 
consideration to the interests and demands of the developing 
countries, said Tang. 
  For example, tariff cuts on some largely-exported products 
of 
the developing countries didn't achieve the desired objective, 
he said. 
  Besides, reduction of subsidies to agricultural products 
failed to give due consideration to those developing countries 
which are net grain importers, he added. 
  The Chinese delegate stressed that the developing countries 
have played an active role in the GATT negotiations and they 
should be given full and equal chances to participate in the 
establishment of WTO and a future multilateral trade system. 
  Representatives from other countries also called for much 
more attention to the interests of the developing countries 
during the implementation of the agreement, especially in the 
areas of primary products, grain subsidies and intellectual 
properties.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai has become a 
center for international airlines with direct flights to 27 
cities in 16 countries and regions in the world. 
  At present, one in every five airplanes leaving Shanghai, 
one 
of the most rapidly developing areas in the world, flies outside 
China. In 1993, the airport handled 11,913 international 
flights, an increase of 42 percent over the same period of the 
previous year, 26 percent higher than the growth rate of 
domestic flights. 
  Both Chinese and foreign air companies have shown great 
interest in the market, which had its first international 
flight, from Dhaka to Shanghai via Guangzhou, on April 29, 1964. 
  Over the past 30 years, Shanghai's international air 
services 
have developed rapidly. 
  At the beginning of air service between China and Japan, 
Shanghai had only four flights every week with less than 400 
passengers. Now it has 30 Tokyo-bound flights every week. Air 
China, China Eastern Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Japan 
Airlines, Northwest Airlines and United Airlines all have 
business in Shanghai. 
  In 1993, Philippine Airlines, Thai Airways and Lufthansa 
Airlines opened international flights to Shanghai, pushing the 
number of air companies in Shanghai up to thirteen. 
  Of the 30 international flights originating in Shanghai, the 
longest ends in Madrid of Spain, via a dozen or so countries. 
The total distance is 14,326 km and the flight lasts 19 hours.

  [Text] Bangkok, April 29 (XINHUA) -- China joined today the 
Association of Tin Producing Countries, becoming the eighth 
member of the organization. 
  On behalf of the Chinese Government, Chinese ambassador to 
Thailand, Jin Guihua, signed the "agreement establishing the 
Association of Tin Producing Countries" at the Foreign Ministry 
of Thailand, the depository country of the document. 
  Chinese Embassy sources said that China had laid three pre- 
conditions for joining the tin body, which had been accepted by 
the association. 
  As China's tin production is mainly for its domestic market, 
its export is only secondary. China will report its tin exports 
to the association on a quarterly basis. 
  China will pay its membership dues in proportion to its 
actual exports. 
  China shall not be invited to join the tin research body of 
the association. 
  Other members of the association, which was founded in 1983, 
are Australia, Bolivia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nigeria and Zaire.

  [Text] Cairo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, now on a visit to Egypt, said today that the 
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of 
Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho have achieved some 
progress. 
  At a press conference given jointly by Christopher and 
Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat following their meeting with 
Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, Christopher pointed out 
that the two sides are proceeding on the road of reaching an 
agreement on the implementation of the PLO-Israeli peace accord. 
  The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Israel 
signed 
the peace accord in Washington on last September 13, which 
provides for Palestinian autonomy in the occupied obt bank's [as 
received] Jericho area. 
  Christopher said this was a chance "for the people of Gaza 
and Jericho to experience for the first time an opportunity to 
manage their own lives, something comparable to the thrilling 
experience we're seeing today in South Africa." 
  He underlined the need to end this phase and start 
implementing the peace accord. 
  Those who want to hinder the peace process will have no 
better alternatives, he added. 
  Christopher said that during his meeting with 'Arafat he 
found a common ground to move forward. 
  He said progress in the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks has 
been furthered by the arrival Wednesday [27 April] of the first 
batch of the cars offered as a grant by the U.S. to the 
Palestinian police. 
  The cars are only part of the assistance pledged by donor 
countries to the Palestinians, he added. 
  Christopher reiterated the importance of further moving 
forward. He said he was heartened by the reports he had received 
from the peace negotiating parties over the past six months. 
  The U.S. official affirmed his country's keenness on 
encouraging all parties to move on toward a more advanced stage. 
  'Arafat said he hoped that an agreement would be reached 
within an overall settlement of the Middle East dispute on all 
tracks. 
  "We hope to overcome the obstacles still hindering reaching 
a 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement," he added. 
  'Arafat emphasized that the Palestinians are well prepared 
to 
sign an agreement on enforcing the PLO-Israeli peace accord as 
soon as the obstacles are eliminated.

<F P=106> ["Special article" by He Chong (6320 3095) ] </F>
  [Text] Hong Kong, 28 Apr (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Former 
U.S. President Richard Nixon has already been laid in his final 
resting place. At the state funeral, President Clinton and 
former Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush, as well as 
many other dignitaries were present. It was an occasion of 
glory and of mourning. 
  Nevertheless, Americans at home and abroad have varying 
opinions about Nixon's historical achievements and faults. 
Although Watergate disgraced him, his three major diplomatic 
achievements were visible for all to see, namely that he ended 
the Vietnam War through talks, opened the door to the 
establishment of Sino-U.S. relations by his personal visit to 
China, and defrosted the Cold War by reaching an arms reduction 
agreement with the Soviet Union. These three major events have 
had worldwide influence and will surely be recorded in the 
history books. Moreover, today, U.S. China policy, which he 
designed himself, continues to influence the White House and has 
a positive part in Sino-U.S. relations. 
  Nixon always viewed Sino-U.S. relations from a strategic 
plane and with foresight. Since stepping down, he has always 
opposed pressuring China by linking most-favored-nation [MFN] 
trading status with the human rights question. In his last book 
"Beyond Peace" he wrote: "Today, China's economic power makes 
U.S. lectures about human rights imprudent. Within a decade, it 
will make them irrelevant. Within two decades, it will make 
them laughable. By then, the Chinese may threaten to withhold 
MFN status from the United States unless we do more to improve 
living conditions (of the poor) in Detroit, Harlem, and South 
Central Los Angeles." 
  Obviously, Nixon predicted from the historical angle that 
China would become a first-rate power within two decades and 
that it would be so strong as to get tough with the United 
States over human rights issues. However, he may have forgotten 
that China has repeatedly declared that it "will never seek 
hegemony." Even though China may become strong, it is certainly 
not going to pressure others using human rights or any other 
issues. 
  In all events, Nixon never changed his view of China's world 
status and international role even when Sino-U.S. relations were 
at a stalemate and going through the most difficult of times. 
For example, in the wake of the "4 June Incident" in Beijing in 
1989, the U.S. administration and other Western countries 
jointly imposed "economic sanctions" on China, leading to the 
possible crisis of renewed confrontation in Sino-U.S. relations. 
In response to this, Nixon, who had stayed out of public life 
for a long time, publicly stood up to show his disapproval of 
"sanctions against China" and energetically urged maintaining a 
channel of dialogue between China and the United States. In 
late October that same year, despite criticisms from the 
government and the public, he paid a visit to Beijing, bringing 
a message from former President Bush to Deng Xiaoping and acting 
as a broker between them. Afterward, he paid another three 
visits to China, contributing to the restoration of normal 
relations between China and the United States. 
  Nixon's firm stance on maintaining Sino-U.S. friendly and 
cooperative relations was derived from his profound analysis of 
the international situation. In the 1960's, he was vice 
president in the Eisenhower administration and was a prominent 
anticommunist figure. Later, after touring all over the world, 
his horizons were broadened and he began to realize that it was 
impossible for the United States to solely dominate the world 
and nor was it possible to control the world in collaboration 
with the Soviet Union. At that time the Soviet Union had a 
wilder ambition to solely dominate the world than the United 
States. In the meantime, China had already broken through U.S. 
encirclement and had stood up in the East. In 1968, Nixon won 
the presidential election. He appointed Henry Kissinger as 
White House security adviser, revised the foreign policy 
strategy together with him, pursued the "world triangular 
balance strategy," and admitted that the world had not only two 
poles but a third one, namely China. In 1971, he resolved to 
establish diplomatic relations with China and China also wished 
to usher in new diplomatic prospects and expand economic and 
trade exchanges with the West, thus it was high time they 
established diplomatic relations. The Chinese top leadership 
pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations were founded on common 
interests, not on ideologies or social systems. Nixon agreed 
with this viewpoint. 
  As the 1990's unfolded, drastic changes took place in 
Eastern 
Europe and the Soviet Union disintegrated. Some Americans said 
that "China's role has weakened" and the "CPC will not stand" 
and that the world has only one pole, the United States. 
Therefore, they were publicly exerting pressure on China using 
the human rights issue in an attempt to bring about the 
"peaceful evolution" of China. This is the root cause of the 
numerous disputes between China and the United States in recent 
years. 
  Because whoever starts the trouble should end it, so the 
Clinton administration should act on Nixon's China policy, face 
China's speedy economic development squarely, and separate the 
MFN status issue from the human rights question. Only by doing 
so can Sino- U.S. relations further develop.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Nineteen Chinese 
universities and institutes were awarded 25 scientific research 
grants today, which were provided under the Ford China Research 
and Development Fund. 
  About 40 percent of the projects are categorized as 
fundamental or basic research, and all of them will be supported 
for a period of up to three years. 
  The research areas to be funded include new and improved 
materials, manufacturing technology, advanced automotive 
components, computer science and engineering and automotive 
technology. 
  The 1.6 million U.S. dollar fund was set up last October by 
the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and the 
Ford Company of the United States. 
  A technical advisory committee with representatives from 
both 
the Chinese and U.S. sides made the final selection from more 
than 90 grant proposals received since the program was created. 
  "The establishment of the fund opens a new chapter in 
China's 
cooperation with foreign corporations in fundamental research," 
said Song Jian, State Councillor and minister of the State 
Science and Technology Commission, at the presentation ceremony 
held at the Great Hall of the People today. "China appreciates 
Ford's decision to sponsor this form of cooperation." 
  He described the cooperation between Ford and NSFC as a very 
meaningful one. 
  Ford has contributed 800,000 U.S. dollars for the project, 
and the NSFC provided an in-kind contribution of equivalent 
value. 
  James Paulsen, president of Ford China Operations, called 
the 
project an excellent example of cooperation between U.S. and 
Chinese interests, and China, Ford and the worldwide scientific 
community would all benefit from these projects.

  [Text] The United States has refused to grant political 
asylum to the prominent dissident Wang Jiaqi, forcing the 
British government to bundle him off to London, according to 
sources in the U.S. in direct contact with the case. 
  After escaping from public security detention in Tangshan in 
March, Wang secretly travelled to Hong Kong earlier this month. 
He is believed to have sought political asylum in the U.S. 
  But eager to avoid becoming the exclusive destination for 
mainland dissidents, Washington has apparently rejected the 
request. 
  News of Wang's arrival in the territory broke last Saturday 
while the Hong Kong-funded underground railway that helped him 
escape was still seeking third countries to accept the former 
Beijing University student. 
  This prompted the Hong Kong British government to order him 
to leave the territory in order to avoid political embarrassment 
with China at a sensitive time in Sino-British relations. 
  It remained unclear last night whether Wang had already 
arrived in Britain, but London is "his final destination", one 
source said. British Foreign Office officials said last night 
they had no information about the case. 
  The source said that if the U.S. government had been willing 
to grant Wang political asylum, it would have been announced 
shortly after his arrival in Hong Kong, reportedly on April 15. 
  "The U.S. has been trying hard to get other countries to 
admit political refugees from China and this is another case," 
the source said. They want to spread it around." 
  Earlier this year, the U.S. rejected requests for political 
asylum from four mainland refugees in Taiwan who were eventually 
resettled in Sweden. 
  There has been no public statement from Wang or the 
organisations assisting him because "the case is still in 
process", the source said, adding: "He won't remain silent for 
long. He has things to say." 
  While the U.S. would have been Wang's preferred destination, 
he will have to wait for "some time" before he can travel to the 
U.S. on a visa. 
  "Only then could he re-apply for U.S. political asylum," the 
source said. 
  Wang, a postgraduate law student at Beijing University and 
former public security officer, escaped from police detention in 
Tangshan, Hebei province, on March 27. He is believed to have 
arrived in Hong Kong on April 15 and been sheltered in a remote 
part of the territory while negotiations commenced to find a 
third country to accept him. 
  Wang and a Beijing University law professor, Yuan Hongbing, 
were detained in Beijing on March 2, apparently for being 
leading figures behind a petition in support of workers' rights. 
  China's national Public Security Ministry said the two were 
being held on suspicion of "being involved in unlawful acts 
inciting turmoil and disrupting social order" as well as other 
unspecified "criminal acts". 
  The use of Hong Kong as a sanctuary and transit point for 
mainland dissidents could cause Sino-British relations to 
deteriorate further. 
  This is not the first time that the territory's underground 
railway for mainland dissidents -- which became known as 
"Operation Yellow Bird" after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 
June 1989 -- has been derailed by a U.S. refusal to proffer 
political asylum to refugees who managed to reach Hong Kong. A 
group of political refugees from Hunan province living in Hong 
Kong with government knowledge were packed off to London after 
being discovered in 1992.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Five Chinese companies 
will be listed this year on the American stock market, making 
the United States the second market after Hong Kong to accept 
Chinese firms seeking direct overseas listings. 
  A memorandum of understanding [MOU] was signed here today by 
Arthur Levitt, chairman of the United States Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC), and Liu Hongru, chairman of the China 
Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), on behalf of the two 
countries' securities authorities. 
  The five Chinese firms, selected from a group of 22 
candidate 
companies for overseas listings this year, include the China 
Eastern Airline Company, China Southern Airline Company, Huaneng 
International Power Company, Huaneng Dezhou Power Company and 
Tianjin Steel Pipe Factory. 
  At a press conference after the signing ceremony of the MOU, 
CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru said the five companies are in top gear 
making preparations and have finalized agreements with law, 
auditing and accounting firms to represent them as well as 
investment banks. 
  Liu did not give the timetable for the listings and insisted 
that CSRC will stick to the standards to ensure the success of 
the listings, despite the eagerness of the companies. 
  He predicted that the earliest possible listing might be 
made 
after June. 
  According to Liu, the remaining 17 Chinese firms will all be 
listed on the Hong Kong market, though a small proportion of the 
shares might be listed in the U.S. after the global offering and 
first trading in Hong Kong. 
  Stock exchanges of other countries, including Singapore, 
Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have also expressed 
hopes for Chinese listings, said Liu. 
  "Our market is young and we lack experience in direct 
overseas listing," said Liu. "It (the overseas listing) is a 
step-by-step process. At present, we are in no haste to go to 
other foreign markets." 
  The Sino-U.S. memorandum of understanding also embraces the 
SEC's technical assistance for its Chinese counterparts, which 
features consultancy on a regulatory framework including 
drafting laws and regulations, personnel training and internship 
programs for CSRC staff at the SEC and with U.S. financial 
institutions as well.

  [Text] Shanghai, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai Foxboro Co. 
Ltd, the first hi-tech joint venture in China, is ready to 
increase investment and extend the term of cooperation, Wang 
Zhenfeng, general manager of the Sino-U.S. company announced 
yesterday. 
  He said this after the first briefing by the American

systems. 
  Established in Shanghai in April, 1983, the Sino-U.S. 
high-tech joint venture is mainly engaged in the production of 
advanced automatic meters, instruments, and automation control 
systems. Its products have passed the quality control from the 
authoritative international committee and been granted 
permission from the U.S. Government to sell their products used 
in nuclear power stations in the United States market. 
  As a result, the company has been cited as "excellent Sino- 
foreign joint-venture" for four successive years. The American 
partner has also reported four million dollars in dividends over 
the past two years. 
  According to company sources, the joint venture registered 
109 million U.S. dollars in sales last year, and was rated 
"no.1" in per capita labor productivity and profits among 
similar enterprises in China.

  [Text] Jinan, April 26 (XINHUA) -- A robot paint-spray 
processing line was last week formally set in motion in the 
Weifang Diesel Engine Plant in east China's Shandong Province. 
  The plant is understood to be the first Chinese enterprise 
in 
that industry to employ robots on its production line. 
  The line, imported from the United States, can automatically 
wash, paint-spray and dry a diesel engine in ten minutes, and 
can handle 20,000 a year. 
  Plant officials said the line would greatly enhance its 
working efficiency and improve its employees' working conditions. 
  The plant, a major diesel engine manufacturer in China, 
produced 10,080 diesel engines, and a sales income of 775 
million yuan, in 1993. 
  In another development, Weifang, where the plant is located, 
has become one of the biggest manufacturing centers of diesel 
engines and farm machinery in China. 
  The city now produces 100,000 farm tractors, 30,000 farm 
trucks and 200,000 three-wheelers for farms in a year, local 
sources said. 
  Weifang is also known for its long tradition of kite art and 
annual international kite fairs.

  [Text] Washington, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Members of the 
California business and agricultural communities today called 
for unconditional renewal of most-favored-nation [MFN] trade 
status for China and urged President Clinton to establish 
"stable and predictable U.S. trade relations" with it. 
  In a letter to President Clinton this morning, the 
California 
business and farm leaders said that California exports more than 
1.7 billion U.S. dollars to China [as received], which support 
about 35,000 California jobs. 
  With California's economic outlook still grim, "We are 
deeply 
concerned that revocation of MFN tariff treatment would have a 
disastrous effect on the economy of our state and jeopardize 
thousands of high-wage, high-skill jobs, which are vital to 
economic recovery in California." 
  The letter said, "We agree with you that America's 
prosperity 
in the next century rests on expanding our trade and economic 
ties with the Pacific Rim. Accordingly, our companies strongly 
supported your path-breaking initiative to refocus U.S. foreign 
policy on this dynamic and expanding region of the world." 
  They expressed the fear that revocation of MFN or other 
trade 
sanctions against China would trigger retaliation by the Chinese 
Government, damaging U.S. exports and investment, and 
endangering hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs. 
  The letter was signed by representatives of over 440 
business 
organizations ranging from high-tech manufacturing and light 
industry to agriculture, financial and entertainment services, 
and toy, footwear and apparel retailing and importing. 
  While these companies are engaged in different sectors of 
the 
U.S. economy, "they are united in their conviction that 
continued U.S. trade with China is vital for America's future 
and that revoking or conditioning MFN trade would have a 
disastrous act on American jobs, economic growth, and national 
security," the Washington-based Business Coalition for 
U.S.-China Trade noted in a press release on the letter.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- A U.S. expert on data 
networking, today described China's "Golden Bridge" project to 
build up an information superhighway as a powerful tool for 
promoting administrative efficiency, fostering improved 
communications and co- ordination between the government, 
companies and people of the whole country. Concurrently 
chairman of the American Electronics Association's National 
Information Infrastructure (NII) task force. 
  At a seminar on building information superhighway for the 
next century, Eric Benhamou, president of the U.S. 3COM 
Corporation, delivered a keynote speech to Chinese officials and 
engineers drawn from relevant ministries and research institutes. 
  "A golden bridge that spans both government and private 
sector will elevate China to a major economic player on the 
world stage," said Benhamou, who is concurrently chairman of the 
American Electronics Association's National Information 
Infrastructure (NII) task force. 
  He added that as information increasingly becomes the 
currency of international trade, the golden bridge will enable 
China to tap into global information flows, further integrating 
China into the global economy. 
  Benhamou believes that by using the golden bridge to provide 
database access and facilitating electronic data interchange, 
China's society will rapidly enter the information age. It can 
also inform and educate by liberating resources and bring 
healthcare, scientific, commercial and financial data to the 
individual. 
  He suggested that China should choose the best scheme in 
constructing an information project, so as to avert the setbacks 
that have been experienced by Western countries. At the same 
time, China should rationally balance the rules for 
informational market competition -- allow competition while 
maintaining macro control. 
  He revealed that the 3COM Corporation will shortly set up a 
representative office in Beijing, in a bid to help develop a 
pool of networking expertise in China.

  [Text] Washington, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Aldrich Ames, a 
veteran employee of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 
pleaded guilty today to espionage charges and was sentenced to 
life imprisonment. 
  Ames' wife, Rosario, pleaded guilty to lesser charges of 
espionage and tax evasion conspiracy, but her sentencing was 
delayed until August 28th, reports said. 
  In a brief statement released after his sentencing in 
Alexandria, Virginia, Ames said "I bitterly regret the 
catastrophe which my betrayal of trust has brought upon my wife 
and son." 
  Ames, who had been chief to CIA counter-intelligence 
center's 
Soviet section, said his wife knew of his spying activities 
seven- and-a-half years after the beginning of his "criminal 
activity." 
  He said his wife had "pleaded with me to break off the 
relationship with the Russians." 
  Before today's sentencing, the Ames signed an agreement with 
the federal government under which both would plead guilty and 
thereby avoid a trial. 
  Although Ames' wife Rosario's sentencing is delayed until 
August, reports said she would serve some five years in prison, 
after which she would be able to take care of her five-year-old 
son, Paul. 
  Paul is now staying with relatives of Ames' wife in her 
native Colombia. 
  Under the agreement, Ames also agreed to cooperate with the 
government in assessing the damage done to the U.S. during his 
years spying for the Soviet Union and then Russia from 1985 
until 1993. 
  Prosecutors accused Ames of selling intelligence about CIA 
personnel and operations to the Soviets and later the Russians 
in return for as much as 2.7 million dollars.

<F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhenhua (3769 2182 5478): "New Changes in </F>
Anglo-American Special Relationship"] 
  [Text] Britain is situated in Europe, but over the years 
it has been "emotionally" closer to the other side of the 
Atlantic--the United States. In particular, the two countries 
forged special ties during and after World War II, thus making 
Britain an "exception" to its European partners, which simply 
called it the Atlantic faction (as opposed to the European 
faction). Since the end of the Cold War, Anglo-American 
relations have undergone profound changes along with the changes 
in the macroscopic climate. Some people hold that the special 
ties between Britain and the United States will "inevitably 
disappear," and others even say that the so-called special ties 
between the two countries do not exist any longer. Some Western 
media said: Ever since Clinton assumed power, the special ties 
between Britain and the United States have deteriorated to a 
"worrying extent." This is because the Conservatives did not 
support Clinton in the U.S. election. Therefore, how should the 
changes in Anglo-American relations in the post-Cold War period 
be assessed, and what are the reasons for these changes? 
<H5>  State Interests At the Roots </H5>
  Generally speaking, personal friendships between leaders of 
different countries certainly have importance in relations 
between the countries concerned. People always equated the 
special ties between Britain and the United States with close 
wartime cooperation between Churchill and Roosevelt, the 
partnership between Macmillan and Eisenhower and Kennedy, and 
the close personal relationship between Mrs. Thatcher and 
Reagan. Hence, when Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher stepped down and a 
generation of people influenced by World War II left the 
political arena with Bush, people were very naturally inclined 
to think that the special ties between Britain and the United 
States "were scaling down." They also predicted that the 
special ties "would inevitably disappear." Some British 
newspapers played up the event in late 1992 when Major failed to 
meet Clinton, then president-elect, during his visit to 
Washington, saying that Clinton had deliberately given the cold 
shoulder to Major. Similarly, Downing Street officials wanted 
Major to receive an invitation to visit the White House on the 
eve of the NATO summit, which was held in Brussels earlier this 
year. During the Reagan and Bush presidencies, such a visit was 
merely routine for the leaders of the two countries to consult 
with each other before making decisions on major issues. 
However, the United States did not show due respect, and the 
White House did not send any invitation to Major. It was 
alleged that Major had professed that he could never build close 
ties with Clinton. 
  However, state and national interests are, in the final 
analysis, the basis for deciding state relations. Personal 
relationships between leaders ultimately hinge on state and 
national interests. It is true that a series of conflicts and 
frictions have arisen between Britain and the United States 
since the advent of the Clinton presidency. In his election 
campaign, Clinton proposed dispatching a peace envoy to Northern 
Ireland and reconsidering the membership composition of the 
Security Council. Britain was very unhappy and doubtful about 
this, holding that the former amounted to interference in 
Britain's internal affairs and the latter was intended to expand 
the permanent membership of the Security Council (with the 
accession of Germany and Japan to the council), which would 
weaken and undermine its power status (permanent membership of 
the Security Council being one of the important symbols which 
props up the status of Great Britain). On intervening in the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia, the two countries also 
disagreed and argued with each other. Britain was against a 
U.S. proposal for NATO's direct intervention in an ethnic 
conflict, worrying that this move would endanger the lives of 
British soldiers performing humanitarian duties in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the United States did not possess 
such misgivings as there were no U.S. troops there. 
  During the Cold War years, it was common for Britain and the 
United States to have conflicts and policy differences on some 
concrete issues. However, under the then prerequisite of 
jointly dealing with the Soviet "threat," the two countries 
usually consulted with each other and made appropriate 
concessions and compromises to settle conflicts. In general, 
Britain avoided openly criticizing U.S. policy, whereas the 
United States paid heed to Britain's views and took Britain's 
demands and interests into consideration. However, with the end 
of the Cold War, the two countries lost their common enemy and 
the historical conditions and foundation on which their special 
relationship relied. Hence, their conflicts have become 
outstanding and the system of consultation has weakened. The 
role of Anglo-American relations in the diplomacy of the two 
countries is faced with a problem of reorientation. The U.S. 
ambassador to Britain frankly admitted that "because of the 
changes in Europe and in the world, U.S.-British relations must 
obviously change," but the question lies in "whether or not the 
United States and Britain still have similar interests. In this 
regard, I am not sure." 
  Have No Alternative But To Face Reality 
  In recent years, Anglo-American relations have become cooler 
and cooler, which is inseparable from the fact that Britain's 
international status and influence has declined since the end of 
the Cold War. In a certain sense, Britain was a beneficiary of 
the Cold War. As one of the major victor countries in World War 
II and the second power of the capitalist world during the 
initial post-war stage, Britain played an important role, along 
with the United States, in the process of forming and developing 
the post-war political and economic order. Later, Britain 
gradually declined and became a second-class, moderately 
developed country. However, it enjoyed certain prerogatives and 
superiority in defense in the West and in high-level global 
diplomacy under the Cold War situation, particularly due to its 
long-standing status as the closest ally of the United States. 
Therefore, it could play a larger role and exert greater 
influence than its strength allowed and played a certain 
mediating role in U.S.-Soviet dialogue, in East-West relations, 
and in relations between Europe and the United States. With the 
end of the Cold War, Britain's position has been weakened. 
Today, a country's international status is directly affected by 
its economic strength, and thus, Britain is weak. At present, 
Britain's population accounts for 1 percent of the world 
population, its GDP accounts for 4 percent, and its volume of 
trade accounts for 5 percent. Britain's economic strength ranks 
fourth in Europe (after Germany, France, and Italy). In 
addition, as NATO becomes less important as a military 
organization, Britain's military strength and political 
superiority due to its contribution to NATO's defense is 
gradually becoming less valuable. In short, at present, the 
importance of Britain to U.S. diplomatic and global strategy is 
obviously weakening. 
  A sharp contrast with Britain is Germany. After shaking off 
various restrictions and fetters imposed on it under the Cold 
War system, Germany has appeared in the international arena as a 
leading or dominant power and has superseded Britain as the 
United States' key partner for cooperation. In particular, the 
drastic changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's 
disintegration have given Germany much room for maneuver. Now, 
the United States treats Britain coldly and sets the focus of 
its Europe policy in striving for Germany's support and 
cooperation, saying that its relations with Germany is a kind of 
leading partnership. 
  The fact that Anglo-American relations have weakened is also 
closely related to the eastward shift of the U.S. diplomatic 
focus. As pointed out by certain western scholars, the United 
States, in a certain sense, was also a loser in the Cold War. 
The Cold War caused a heavy burden to the United States and led 
to a relative decline in its power. At present, the United 
States is perplexed by domestic economic problems, and it is 
gradually shifting its attention and international interests 
from Europe to America as well as to the East Asia and Pacific 
regions, where rapid economic development is in sight. The 
United States has drastically reduced and will continue to cut 
its forces stationed in Europe, and its influence in Europe has 
already shrunk and will continue to shrink. Meanwhile, the fact 
that Britain and the United States are becoming estranged from 
each other also reflects the Clinton administration's declining 
interest in and attention to Western Europe. 
<H5>  Mutual Support Still Counts </H5>
  As a European country with a moderate level of strength, 
Britain is focussing its key national interests and policies on 
Europe. It is irreversibly involved in the process of European 
integration. However, the former Great Britain is not willing to 
confine its role and influence to Europe. The ruling clique in 
Britain will not easily give up its special relationship with 
the United States and still wants to rely on residual close ties 
with the latter to continue to "punch above its weight" in the 
world (a remark made by Douglas Hurd). In fact, special 
Anglo-American ties and British's membership of the EC may not 
necessarily be incompatible with each other. Close 
Anglo-American historical and cultural ties enable it to better 
understand the U.S. way of thinking and exert influence on the 
United States more easily. On the other hand, Britain is also a 
member of the EC and its pragmatic tradition, balanced thinking, 
and broad field of vision from a global viewpoint can contribute 
to the formation of a united and sound "European choice," thus 
playing a certain unique role in coordinating European-American 
relations. 
  It seems that even after the Cold War, the United States 
still needs Britain, its faithful ally. Although the United 
States won the Cold War, its relative strength has been much 
weakened. In order to ensure its leading position in the new 
post-Cold War global order, Washington needs the support and 
help of its allies. With the disappearance of the Soviet 
threat, internal conflicts between Western countries are 
becoming outstanding. Some original U.S. allies have, to a 
different extent and in different respects, become open or 
potential enemies. Under these circumstances, Britain's support 
and help seems to be more valuable and important. In the post 
Cold War process of readjusting its European policy and its 
relations with Europe, the United States obviously needs 
Britain's support. Whether the question is about 
European-American economic and trade relations or about NATO's 
reorganization and restructuring, Britain's position and 
attitude is close to that of the United States. When the United 
States utilizes the United Nations and other multilateral 
organizations to forcibly implement its own concepts of human 
rights and values in the name of keeping international peace and 
maintaining the new world order, Britain often plays the role of 
the most faithful U.S. ally. 
  However, this writer should point out that as far as the 
readjustment of British foreign policy is concerned, close 
Anglo- American ties do not only have positive significance and 
effects. If such ties are handled well, Britain can definitely 
have greater weight and influence in the international arena, 
but if they are not handled properly, other European countries 
may treat such ties as a "Trojan horse" of the United States, 
which will become a constraint on Britain's further integration 
into Europe.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Wang Nan: "What's the True Picture of </F>
U.S.-China Trade?"] 
  [Text] Washington, April 27 (XINHUA) -- A long list of 
trade disputes, a widening trade gap, and the battle over 
China's most favored nation status, which, every year at this 
time, makes people worry and sigh. 
  Is this what the U.S.-China trade is all about? Observers 
here said no, arguing that America's commercial interests are at 
stake if the Clinton administration misunderstands the real 
nature of trade scene. 
  While U.S. officials, in discussions with the Chinese, 
assumed that the U.S. trade deficit with China is largely the 
result of an insufficiently open Chinese market, many observers 
thought otherwise. 
  "The U.S. should abandon using the bilateral imbalance in 
its 
trade with China as a meaningful indicator of the state of their 
relations," the University of Washington scholar Nicholas Lardy 
said. 
  When introducing his new book "China in the New World 
Economy", Lardy argued that China is "fundamentally different" 
with Japan, and this should be the starting point for decisions 
at the White House. 
  Last year, Washington's trade deficit with Beijing was 22.8 
billion dollars, according to the Commerce Department. The 
Treasury Department predicted in November that China will 
surpass Japan as America's largest deficit trading partner by 
the year 2000. 
  It seems certain that America's absolute trade imbalances 
with China, as measured by the U.S., will widen significantly 
for several years, but this is not the whole picture, observers 
here noted. 
  China's trade, they said, is following a pattern 
increasingly 
consistent with the principle of "comparative advantage", 
supplying more of the U.S. demand for garments, textiles, toys, 
footwear and sporting goods. 
  Meanwhile, the country's imports accounted for industrial 
products which embody higher levels of technologies have risen 
sharply and by 1993 accounted for almost 90 percent of total 
imports. 
  On economic openness, according to a recent World Bank 
report, China is "significantly more open" than the U.S., Japan 
and other East Asian countries, with "extremely high" import 
penetration in some sectors. 
  As an obvious contrast with Japan, China is the only country 
with which the U.S. has run a trade deficit that has not been a 
global trade surplus country as well. 
  "China has run a systematic global trade and current account 
deficit since reform began, its external debt has grown 
continuously," Lardy said. "I believe China is likely to be a 
net borrower over the mid-term." 
  According to the U.S. Government, U.S. exports to China grew 
54 percent in 1991-92 and 21.5 percent in the first three 
quarter of 1993, roughly twice the speed of that to Mexico, 
Singapore, Hong Kong and China's Taiwan. 
  China's position in U.S. exports has been underestimated, 
observers said, since U.S. goods re-exported to China from Hong 
Kong were not treated as exports to China. If accounted 
otherwise, as they should be, China is the fifth largest export 
market for the United States. 
  David Richardson, author of "U.S. Export Disincentives", 
estimated that U.S. exports to China in 1989 would have been 
five to 10 billion dollars higher in the absence of national 
security controls on the U.S. side. 
  Most of the shortfall in exports to China, exceeded only by 
exports foregone to the Soviet Union, was in chemicals, 
industrial machinery, electronic and electrical equipment, 
transportation equipment, instrument and related products. 
  "The U.S. cannot afford economically costly symbolism, 
especially when the costs are borne by its most dynamic, 
technologically competitive sectors," wrote Richardson, 
professor at Syracuse University. 
  As to export credits, observers said, American firms seeking 
to sell in China are provided with far less export credits by 
the administration than those provided to European and Japanese 
firms by their governments. 
  The U.S., the only industrial country without a concessional 
loan or mixed credit programs for China, has only a few modest 
trade promotion programs to China. Washington, for example, 
does not guarantee the investment involving transfer of 
resources to China. 
  Concessional finance and export credits, observers here 
noted, will be unusually effective sales tools for American 
companies if they are willing to be involved in China's 
infrastructure projects like electric power generation, 
telecommunications and transportation. 
  "U.S. policy towards China," Lardy said in his book, 
"ignores 
the factors that contribute to China's unique combination of a 
global trade deficit and a bilateral surplus in trade with the 
U.S.."

Peng, premier of the State Council, left Almaty for Mongolia on 
the morning of 28 April. 
  Kazakh President Nazarbayev hosted a grand send-off ceremony

Nazarbayev stressed that Premier Li Peng's visit to Kazakhstan 
had deepened mutual understanding and Kazakh-Chinese friendship. 
He was very satisfied with that. Nazarbayev added: The 
signing of the Kazakh-Chinese border agreement by the two 
countries is the most important result of the visit. 
  Also leaving on the same airplane were Zhu Lin, wife of Li

<F P=106> ["Reporters' Jottings: The Common Feeling of Invigorating </F>
the `Silk Road' -- Written at the Moment When Premier Li Peng Is 
Ending his Four-Nation Central Asian Tour;" by XINHUA reporters 
Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) 
and RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Hongzhi (6079 1347 3112)] 
  [Text] Almaty, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng, on 
board a Boeing 767 special plane, has flown more than 7,000 
kilometers over the winding, rugged ancient Silk Road. Today, 
as the special plane carries a full load of Central Asian 
(?friendship) [ha ba de 0761 1572 1795 -- language unknown], the 
"Silk Road" has all along been the delightful topic of 
conversation for both the hosts and the guests -- from the 
mountain city of (Bishikaike)[3024 0087 0418 0344] at the foot 
of the Tianshan Mountain to the "Apple City" of Almaty at the 
fringe of the (Yilialatao) [0122 3680 7093 2139 1152] Mountain. 
  At various functions during his tour, Premier Li Peng has 
repeatedly made clear to leaders and people from all sectors of 
the four nations the sincerity of the Chinese people, saying: 
We would like to reinvigorate the ancient "Silk Road" with the 
Central Asian people, and let friendship endure as the universe. 
In speeches delivered in both Tashkent and Almaty, where he 
expounded on China's four basic policies in developing relations 
and its six-point advocation in developing economic cooperation 
with Central Asia, Li Peng has expressed the common feeling to 
invigorate the "Silk Road." 
  There were even more praises from the enthusiastic hosts on 
this passageway that symbolized traditional friendship. Uzbek 
President Karimov said that today we have all the reasons to 
rejuvenate the "Silk Road" which linked the Uzbek and the 
Chinese people as early as 2,000 years ago. Turkmen President 
Niyazov also said: It is time to invigorate the great "Silk 
Road" which has tied together the Turkmen and the Chinese people 
over the past few centuries. Kyrgyz President Akayev wanted to 
make the new "Silk Road" a "Road of Friendship and Cooperation." 
Kazakh President Nazarbayev said the "Silk Road" was historic 
evidence of Kazakh-Chinese friendship. If promoting 
good-neighborly relations and developing cooperation of mutual 
benefit has been the objective of Premier Li Peng's four-nation 
Central Asian tour, the "Silk Road" has covered it all. 
  Today, the opportunity facing us, topographical advantage, 
and support of the peoples have put us in a superior position to 
rejuvenate the "Silk Road." Because of the important 
contributions made through Premier Li Peng's trip, we have an 
entirely new time and space concept of the "Silk Road" and it 
has given the route a richer content. The premier said: "China 
will forever be the good friend and good neighbor of Central 
Asian nations." 
  Premier Li Peng repeatedly stressed that the Eurasian 
Continental Bridge should remain open and unblocked. 
Improvement in transportation has become an issue of common 
concern to people. In view of this, China and Kazakhstan 
reached an understanding on developing rail through-traffic 
during Premier Li Peng's trip, and China and Turkmenistan 
indicated they would strive to achieve Beijing-Ashkhabad direct 
flights as soon as possible. The ancient Silk Road which once 
resounded with the ringing of camel bells is changing into a 
thoroughfare which travels through time and space. 
  Premier Li Peng's trip will load the "Silk Road" up with 
more 
fruits of exchanges and cooperation. In addition, 
government-to-government economic and trade cooperation, Chinese 
entrepreneurs who accompanied the premier on his trip signed 
over 20 agreements involving cooperation in many fields with 
enterprise circles from various nations. If we carry out our 
tentative plan to build the Turkmenistan-China-Japan natural gas 
pipeline, 10 to 20 billion cubic meters of Turkmen natural gas 
will be transported through more than 6,000 km of pipelines to 
our country and Japan. 
  As Li Peng said: The contemporary "Silk Road" is not only a 
glory path of friendship, it is also a broad road of cooperation.

  [Text] Moscow, April 28 (XINHUA) -- President Boris Yeltsin 
today urged Russians to restore accord in Russia and called the 
signing of the civil accord treaty "an event of historical 
importance." 
  Opening the signing ceremony held in the Kremlin, the 
Russian 
president stressed the need to stop the bloody events, to remove 
the shadow of civil war from Russia and to put an end to civil 
confrontation. 
  He noted any party, organization and mass movement can join 
the treaty, proposed by him in late February immediately after 
the State Duma (the lower house of the parliament) declared the 
political amnesty for his main opponents including former 
Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and former parliament Speaker 
Ruslan Khasbulatov. 
  This can be done by all who are ready to assume 
responsibility for civil peace in the country, Yeltsin said. 
"The key idea of this document is non-violence in achieving 
political goals," he added. 
  Present at the signing ceremony were the president, Prime 
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin, chairman 
of the federation council (the upper house of the parliament) 
Vladimir Shumeyko, leaders of local regions, and heads of 
parliamentary groups, political parties, mass movements, trade 
unions and religious denominations. 
  The president urged participants in the ceremony for 
reconciliation, "Let us help Russia to get rid of civil war 
forever for the sake of preserving the fatherland and calm of 
our children. Let our joint efforts be crowned with success," 
Yeltsin stated. 
  Speaking at the ceremony, Shumeyko expressed the hope that 
"this treaty is not for politicians and public figures but for 
the whole people." 
  Rybkin noted in his speech that all the participants had 
proclaimed "the need to ease social tension, develop normal 
relations between the branches of power and deepen economic 
reforms in the interests of the entire people." 
  At the ceremony, Patriarch Alexiy II of Moscow stressed the 
need to "continue and deepen our (Russians) accord and, finally 
realize that we are responsible for Russia and its future."

  [Text] Accompanied by Li Chengren, deputy head of the 
International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee, 
Hong Ha, secretary of the Secretariat of the Vietnamese 
Communist Party, arrived in Tianjin on 19 April for a visit. At 
noon at the Lishunde Hotel, Gao Dezhan, member of the CPC 
Central Committee and secretary of the municipal party 
committee, met with Secretary Hong Ha and his party. 
  At the meeting, on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal party 
committee, Gao Dezhan first expressed his welcome to the 
delegation. He said: We are very glad to know that Vietnam is 
conducting innovations to speed up the pace of economic 
construction. The cooperative ties between our two parties and 
between our two countries are developing smoothly. Now, our 
country is further carrying out reform in an all-around manner, 
opening itself to the outside world, and promoting the progress 
of the modernization drive. Under these circumstances, it is of 
extreme importance to strengthen the cooperation between the two 
parties and between the two countries. He introduced to the 
delegation the basic situation of Tianjin. According to the 
guidelines of the central authorities and the actual conditions 
of the municipality, Tianjin is further speeding up the pace of 
reform and construction and further expanding the scale of 
opening itself to all directions. Our goal is to build Tianjin 
into a technologically advanced industrial base; a north China 
commercial, trade, and monetary center; and a large 
international port city opening itself in all directions. The 
work in various spheres of Tianjin is very good. However, there 
are many difficulties. The municipal party committee, the 
municipal government, and all people of the municipality are 
carrying forward the spirit of waging an arduous struggle and 
blazing new trails and making efforts to elevate economic 
construction, as well the spiritual civilization, to a new 
height. We experienced that the key to achieving this is to 
improve the leadership of the party, to strengthen party 
building, and to promote the work in various spheres. The 
Vietnamese Communist Party and the personages of the enterprise 
circles in Vietnam are welcomed to visit Tianjin, to hold 
economic and trade cooperation talks with us, and to extensively 
establish contacts. He wished that the cooperative ties between 
the two parties and between the two countries would further be 
developed. 
  Secretary Hong Ha said: I used to understand Tianjin from 
papers, periodicals, and books. This is my first visit to 
Tianjin. I am very glad. The Vietnamese are very fond of 
Tianjin's products. Some Vietnamese students and technical 
cadres have studied in Tianjin. The Tianjin steel tube company, 
which I visited today, left a deep impression on me. He said: 
At the time of developing the cooperative ties with the Chinese 
party and China, Vietnam is extremely willing to develop the 
cooperative ties in the economic sphere with Tianjin. Tianjin 
has great potential. With many enterprises and famous products, 
Tianjin can develop cooperation with Vietnam. He is willing to 
promote the cooperation between all localities in Vietnam and 
Tianjin. 
  Zheng Zhiying, standing committee member and secretary 
general of the municipal party committee; Geng Jianhua, chairman 
of the municipal foreign affairs office; and Dang Nghiem Hoang, 
Vietnamese ambassador to China, were present at the meeting.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA) -- A two-month Indian 
culture festival is expected to be held in 16 Chinese cities 
from May 9. 
  The Indian Government will dispatch seven cultural 
delegations to China at that time, and Indian performances, 
exhibitions and a movie festival will be hosted by these cities, 
including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and Guangzhou. 
  This is the first time for China to sponsor such a 
large-scale foreign culture festival since the founding of the 
country in 1949, Vice-Minister of Culture Liu Deyou told a press 
conference here today. 
  The premiers of the two countries decided to exchange 
culture 
festivals when Chinese Premier Li Peng visited India in 1991, 
Liu said, adding that the decision was contained in the 
Sino-Indian joint communique issued at that time. 
  A 45-day Chinese culture festival was successfully held in 
11 
Indian cities in late 1992, Liu said. 
  "The culture festivals will help to improve the bilateral 
good- neighborly ties, and provide the two sides with 
opportunities to learn from each other," Liu said.

  [Text] Nairobi, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Kenya President Daniel 
arap Moi has said that relations between Kenya and China are 
excellent. 
  In a exclusive interview with XINHUA and China Radio 
International before his third state visit to China scheduled 
for next Tuesday [3 May], President arap Moi said Kenya and 
China are cooperating very well with each other in domains such 
as politics, education, culture, economy and trade. 
  He highly commended the Chinese personnel in various 
projects 
in Kenya for their hard but enthusiastic work. 
  President arap Moi said that Kenya in Africa is far from 
China in Asia, but they are both developing countries, and are 
facing the common tasks that all developing countries are facing. 
  He rapped the press in Western developed countries over 
ignoring to report various development in Third World countries. 
Instead, he said, they attack them on the so-called 
human-rights issue which was a gross distortion of facts. 
  He warned the Western media not to create unrest in 
developing countries by using the stick of human-rights. 
  Referring to the problems the developing countries are 
facing, President arap Moi said that the main issues in the 
present world are peace and development, adding that where there 
is no peace, there is no development. He said that the big 
threat to peace in Third World countries is poverty which is the 
main root to cause turmoil in those countries. 
  He appeal to the developing countries, particularly African 
countries to intensify the South-South cooperation and exploit 
their own resources for development. 
  Recalling the previous visits in 1980 and 1988, he said he 
was very much impressed by the Chinese economic development. He 
hoped that the coming visit would further promote friendly 
cooperation between Kenya and China in various domains.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Mongolian Prime 
Minister P. Jasray said today that developing a good-neighborly 
relationship with China continues to be a priority of his 
country's foreign policy. 
  He made the remarks during a banquet in honor of Chinese 
Premier Li Peng who arrived in Ulaanbaatar on Thursday [28 
April] for a two-day official visit. 
  Jasray voiced satisfaction with what he described as the 
increasingly vigorous bilateral relations between the two 
nations, as they currently experience a firmer legal basis and 
wider scope of cooperation. 
  Referring to late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to 
Mongolia 34 years ago, when the two countries signed a treaty to 
establish friendship and mutual help, Jasray revealed that 
tomorrow the two modern-day leaders would sign an historic, 
fundamental document that is of an equally important political 
significance for the long-term and stable development of 
bilateral ties. 
  He added that the two sides will also sign several 
agreements 
to consolidate the legal basis for bilateral ties. 
  Li's visit is a continuation of regular high-level summit 
meetings between the two countries and Jasray said it plays an 
important part in the development of Mongolia-China relations. 
  Commenting on China's achievements, Jasray said he hoped the 
country would remain stable, prosperous and enjoy further 
development in the future. He described China's peaceful 
foreign policy as an important factor for safeguarding the peace 
and stability in the Asia-Pacific and the world in general. 
  Li Peng said that the increasing exchanges between the two 
countries have brought important benefits, deepened mutual 
understanding and trust, as well as satisfying progress in 
cooperation in all fields. 
  "We should cherish today's Sino-Mongolian relations," he 
said, in a reference to "set-backs" that had occurred in the 
past because of what he described as historical reasons. 
  He commented that the earlier Sino-Mongolian Treaty on 
Friendship and Mutual Help had played an important role in the 
growth of bilateral relations and declared that the new treaty 
will turn a new page in history by further advancing 
Sino-Mongolian relations and opening up a broader prospect for 
friendly cooperation. 
  "The Chinese Government attaches great importance to Sino- 
Mongolian relations and is ready to work together with the 
Mongolian Government to build a long-term friendly relationship 
of cooperation that is oriented to the next century," said Li. 
  According to Li the two major issues facing mankind today 
were peace and development and he said China will, along with 
Mongolia and all other peace loving peoples in the world, work 
for the establishment of a new order of peace, stability, 
cooperation and development in Asia and the world. 
  The Chinese premier went on: "We respect the Mongolian 
people's choice of path for future development, and sincerely 
hope and believe that they will overcome their temporary 
difficulties, revitalize the economy and build up the country." 
  Attending the banquet with Li were his tour entourage, which 
includes his wife Zhu Lin, Ismail Amat, state councillor and 
minister in charge of the State Nationalities Affairs 
Commission, Han Zhubin, minister of railways, Qi Huaiyuan, 
director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council, 
and Ulgi, chairman of the People's Government of the 
Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region.

"Mongolian Prime Minister Jasray Fetes Premier Li Peng"] 
  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 28 Apr (XINHUA)--Tonight, Mongolian 
Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray arranged a grand state banquet 
in honor of Chinese Premier Li Peng, who is paying an official 
visit to Mongolia. 
  The magnificent banquet hall was ablaze with lights and 
filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere to welcome the guests. 
  Prime Minister Jasray first made a welcoming speech and 
proposed a toast. He said: "Mongolia and China are friendly 
neighbors. In recent years, through both sides making joint 
efforts, bilateral relations have become more active, the legal 
foundation has been consolidated, and the scope of cooperation 
has been expanded. I am satisfied by this." 
  Jasray pointed out that developing good-neighborly and 
friendly relations with China was, and will continue to be, one 
of the primary principles of Mongolia's foreign policy. 
  He said: In 1960, Premier Zhou Enlai, China's famous 
statesman, paid an official visit to our country and signed the 
Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty between the two 
countries; 34 years later, Premier Li Peng makes an official 
visit to Mongolia again. He said: "Your Excellency Mr Premier, 
your visit to our country is the continuation of the established 
regular senior and summit meetings between Mongolia and China 
and I deeply believe that your visit will hold an important 
position in the history of Mongolian-Chinese relations." 
  Talking about the domestic situation, Jasray said that 
Mongolia is undergoing a difficult period of transition to the 
new market economic structure. He deeply believes that, with 
the positive efforts of our people and the support of the 
international community, the country will certainly succeed. 
  He said that he was glad to see that China had made great 
achievements in carrying out reforms in line with China's own 
national conditions. He said: "We sincerely hope that the PRC, 
which has worldwide influence, will continue to be stable and 
prosperous and will continue to develop. China's peaceful 
foreign policy is an important factor for guaranteeing peace, 
stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region and in the 
world as a whole." 
  In his speech of thanks, Premier Li Peng said: In the 45 
years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between 
China and Mongolia, although there have been twists and turns 
for certain historical reasons, we were still glad to see that 
the leaders of the two countries have continued to exchange 
visits in recent years. Personnel exchanges at various levels 
have been frequent and mutual understanding and trust have been 
deepened, while gratifying progress has been made in exchanges 
and cooperation in various fields. This has brought major 
benefits to both countries and both peoples. The present state 
of Sino-Mongolian relations did not come easily and we should 
treasure it dearly. 
  Li Peng said: Thirty-four years ago, Premier Zhou Enlai 
visited Mongolia and signed the Friendly and Mutual Assistance 
Treaty. This treaty has played an important role in the 
development of bilateral relations between the two countries. 
He said: "Tomorrow, we shall sign a new treaty on 
Sino-Mongolian friendship and cooperative relations. I believe 
the signing of the treaty will open a new page in the annals of 
Sino-Mongolian relations, will further advance the development 
of bilateral relations, and will bring about broader and 
brighter prospects for friendly cooperation between the two 
countries. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to 
relations with Mongolia and is willing to join hands with the 
Mongolian Government in creating a long-term, friendly, and 
cooperative relationship extending beyond the 21st century. 
  Li Peng said: Both China and Mongolia are now striving for 
the development of their own national economies. A stable and 
developed China will make contributions to peace and prosperity 
in Asia and in the world. 
  He said: "We respect the Mongolian people's choice of their 
own development course and sincerely hope and believe that the 
Mongolian people will overcome the temporary difficulties, 
restore the economy, and effect national regeneration." 
  Li Peng pointed out: Peace and development remain two major 
themes facing contemporary human society. The Chinese 
Government and the Chinese people are willing to join all 
peace-loving states and peoples, including Mongolia, in making 
unremitting efforts to build the new order of peace, stability, 
cooperation, and development in Asia and in the world. 
  Premier Li Peng's wife Zhu Lin; Ismail Amat, state 
councillor 
and minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission; Han 
Shubin, minister of railroads; Qi Huaiyuan, director of the 
State Council's Foreign Affairs Office; and Wuliji, chairman of 
the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Regional People's Government, who 
are accompanying Premier Li Peng on his visit to Mongolia, were 
also invited to the banquet. On the Mongolian side, those 
attending the banquet included Prime Minister Jasray's wife, 
Dulemasulun, Deputy Prime Minister Purebdorj, Minister of

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li 
Peng, during formal talks with Mongolian Premier Puntsagiyn 
Jasray here today, annunciated five principles for developing 
relations with Mongolia. 
  During the meeting, described by a Chinese spokesman as 
"friendly and warm", Li spoke highly of Sino-Mongolian exchanges 
and cooperation in political, economic, cultural, military, 
scientific and technological fields. 
  Calling Mongolia "an important neighbor," Li said China 
attaches great importance to friendly and good-neighborly ties 
with Mongolia. 
  On developing relations with Mongolia, Li said, the Chinese 
Government will abide by the following five basic points: 
  First, adherence to the five principles of peaceful 
coexistence as a basis for the development of friendly 
cooperation with Mongolia, which looks toward the 21st century. 
  Second, respect for Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, as well as the Mongolian people's choice 
of their own path of development. 
  Third, developing trade and economic cooperation on the 
basis 
of equality and mutual benefit, in an effort to promote common 
development and prosperity. 
  Fourth, the hope of maintaining peace and stability in East 
Asia, appreciation for Mongolia's positive efforts to safeguard 
regional peace and stability, and support of Mongolia's policy 
to become a nuclear-free zone, not allowing foreign troops or 
the deployment or transportation of nuclear weapons, or other 
weapons of mass destruction, in or through its territory. 
  Fifth, a willingness to see Mongolia develop friendly 
relations with other countries. 
  "The consolidation and development of Sino-Mongolian 
friendly 
relations is not only in keeping with the fundamental interests 
of the two peoples, but also will be conducive to regional 
peace, stability and development, as well," Li said. 
  Referring to the Sino-Mongolian treaty on friendship and 
mutual help which was signed in 1960 and "laid a good foundation 
for bilateral ties", Li said that since both the domestic and 
international situations have undergone vast changes, "we have 
amended and perfected the treaty", in line with the wishes of 
Mongolia. 
  Li said that signing the new treaty on Sino-Mongolian 
friendship and cooperation was "an epoch-making event" in the 
history of bilateral ties, and will be formulated into legal 
form as a new political basis for future growth. 
  "This treaty will make China and Mongolia even better 
friends 
and neighbors," he said. 
  Agreeing with Li's assessment of bilateral ties, Jasray said 
that Li's significant visit coincides with the 45th anniversary 
of the establishment of diplomatic ties between Mongolia and 
China. 
  He said that Mongolia's foreign policy was based on the 
principle of equality and mutual benefit regardless of the 
beliefs or size of a country. 
  The development of friendly relations with China and Russia, 
two large neighbors, is a priority of Mongolian foreign policy, 
he said. 
  Mongolia will not only develop relations with the Western 
and 
developed nations, it also will strive to expand ties with Asian 
countries, in particular those of East Asia, Jasray said. 
  Li welcomed Mongolia lending priority to its ties with China 
and Russia, a spokesman said. 
  Jasray noted that China's respect for Mongolia's chosen 
method of development is very important for the further 
expansion of bilateral ties. 
  The signing of the new treaty will serve to form a legal 
basis for developing long-term friendly cooperation, he said. 
  Jasray predicted "smooth growth of Mongolia-China 
relations," 
which, he said, is in keeping with the fundamental interests of 
the two peoples. 
  Li, turning to bilateral trade and economic cooperation, 
said 
that China, Mongolia's second largest trading partner, is ready 
to continue developing mutually beneficial cooperation with 
Mongolia. 
  He also called for expansion of such cooperation in 
diversified areas, particularly between business circles in the 
two countries, which will supplement inter-governmental ties. 
  Jasray said that trade and economic cooperation with China 
are important to Mongolia, adding that great potential exist in 
this area. 
  He also stressed the importance of border trade, saying he 
expects to see further exploration along these lines. 
  Mongolia hopes to strengthen cooperation in terms of 
investment with China, as well, so as to allow cooperation 
between enterprises and localities to produce better economic 
results, he added. 
  Calling transportation "another important factor" for 
developing cooperation, he said Mongolia would continue to work 
for further improvement in this field. 
  Furthermore, Jasray expressed appreciation for China's 
support of Mongolia becoming a nuclear-free zone. 
  He reiterated that the Government of the People's Republic 
of 
China is the sole legitimate government of China, and that 
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. Jasray said 
that the Mongolian Government will have no official ties of any 
kind with Taiwan, a position for which Li expressed appreciation.

two countries here today.

friendship and mutual help signed in 1960 played an important 
role in developing bilateral relations. 
  The two sides are willing to consolidate the traditional 
friendship between the Chinese and Mongolian peoples, believe

of cooperation not only conforms with the fundamental interests 
of the two peoples, but will also benefit peace, stability and 
development in the Asia-Pacific region. Also, they pledged to

Nations. 
  For all these reasons, China and Mongolia have decided to 
revise the previous treaty on friendship and mutual help and

relations of cooperation on the basis of the principles of 
mutual respect for each other's independence, sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each

the Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole, the treaty 
says. 
  Besides, the two sides will cooperate in the scope of the 
United Nations and other international organizations so as to 
promote cooperation among all nations and to push for the 
resolution of regional and international issues that ask for an 
urgent settlement. 
  The two sides will not participate in any military or 
political alliance directed against the other side; nor will 
they sign any treaty that will hurt the sovereignty or security 
of the other side, according to the treaty.

territory to harm the sovereignty and security of the other, the 
document says. 
  However, this treaty will not affect the obligations either 
side is required to undertake according to bilateral or 
multilateral treaties signed with other countries.

  [Text] Ulaabaatar, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- After holding talks 
at the State Palace, visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng and 
Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray told the press on the morning 
of 29 April that they highly appraised the results of the talks 
and the Sino- Mongolian Treaty of Friendly Relations and 
Cooperation to be signed soon. 
  The two premiers agreed that the talks proceeded in a 
friendly and cordial atmosphere. Both sides exchanged views on 
bilateral relations and on international issues of common 
interest. When the late Premier Zhou Enlai visited Mongolia 34 
years ago, he concluded the Sino-Mongolian Friendship and Mutual 
Aid Treaty. The new Sino- Mongolian Treaty of Friendly 
Relations and Cooperation to be signed soon will lay the legal 
foundation for bilateral relations. Both sides will also sign a 
series of bilateral documents on specific cooperation issues. 
The talks were fruitful.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Hata Cabinet Sets Sail in </F>
Story Waters"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The minority coalition 
cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata announced today seems 
destined to be short-lived and basically unable to push any 
policies through Parliament, given the fact that the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) has vowed to cooperate with the largest 
opposition party. 
  It appears that Hata, Japan's 51st prime minister who was 
elected by the Diet (Parliament) Monday [25 April], will have no 
choice but to dissolve the House of Representatives and call a 
general election once he gains Diet approval of the long-delayed 
fiscal 1994 budget, political observers say. 
  There is little doubt that the Hata administration, the 
fifth 
minority government in Japan since the end of World War II, will 
achieve its goal of enacting the state budget since the SDP, 
once the largest contingent in the former ruling coalition, has 
promised to assist in securing its approval. 
  But Hata will stumble over ways to address key policy issues 
such as the proposed consumer tax hike, trade friction with the 
United States and the country's stance on the suspected nuclear 
development program on the Korean peninsula. 
  He is fully aware that coordinating policies within the 
ruling parties on those issues is crucial before the summit 
meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrialized nations 
meet in Naples, Italy in July. 
  Given the SDP's withdrawal from the nine-month-old alliance, 
however, the shaky minority government is unlikely to be capable 
of making effective decisions as the SDP is no longer bound by a 
coalition policy platform it earlier signed with the other 
parties. 
  Japan needs to hammer out substantial and specific 
macro-economic steps to improve its ties with the United States, 
over which a shadow has been cast since the breakdown of 
bilateral trade "framework" talks in February. The steps which 
have to be taken by the end of June include concrete measures on 
Japan's tax system reform and deregulation. 
  Japan's market-opening package compiled by the coalition 
government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in late 
March was rebuffed by the United States as a "half-finished 
work." 
  The SDP, meanwhile, is strongly opposed to an increase in 
the 
3 percent consumer tax, which essentially is inevitable if the 
government is to finance multiple-year income tax cuts. The 
SDP's opposition means that Hata's government may fail to enact 
necessary legislation by the end of the year and the party's 
defection from the coalition has even made the settlement of the 
tax matter before the July G-7 summit meeting more difficult and 
unlikely. 
  The SDP quit the coalition immediately after the ruling 
parties struck a deal on policy issues, including the tax hike, 
to protest the sudden setting up of a 130-strong parliamentary 
group by Hata's Shinseito (the Japan Renewal Party) and other 
partners which excluded it. 
  Now the Hata government even seems unable to tide over 
difficulties in its handling of the alleged nuclear issue with 
the DPRK. 
  The SDP is also opposed to revising Japan's self-defense 
forces law to allow it to provide logistical support to U.S. 
warships in the event of a contingency demanding such action. 
It argues that such an extension of logistical support would 
run counter to Japan's constitution of renouncing war-like 
activities, which is generally interpreted to mean that is 
opposes collective security measures. 
  Hosokawa's government was riven by cracks and mutual 
distrust 
after the coalition achieved the shared goal of passing 
political reform bills. Earlier this year, some analysts 
predicted that the coalition was filled with internal 
contradictions which could topple it if those conflicts 
escalated into open hostilities. 
  The SDP's withdrawal from the coalition has opened a new 
chapter in Japan's political realignment but should Hata lose 
his sense of proportion for which he is acclaimed, his 
government is expected to collapse, even if there is no strong 
opposition from outside.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese and Japanese 
agricultural experts today gathered at a seminar in Beijing to 
probe into the prospects of the two countries' agricultural 
development. 
  The co-sponsored symposium covered subjects including 
sustained agricultural growth, the development of the rural 
workforce, China's strategy on agro-science and technologies, 
Sino-Japanese agricultural trade, global grain supply and demand 
in the 21st century and world environment and resources. 
  Lu Liangshu, director of the China Agriculture Society, said 
that the seminar was of great value for the two governments in 
macro policy-making, as well as in bolstering China's efforts to 
develop high-yield, good-quality and highly-efficient 
agriculture and for promoting sustained growth of Japan's 
agriculture. 
  Deputy director of the society Xiang Chongyang said that 
agriculture is the basis for China's economic progress, social 
stability and national self-independence. 
  Xiang, who is a former vice-minister in agriculture, noted 
that the Chinese Government has always attached great importance 
to agriculture and has always put agriculture in the first place 
of all economic work, adding that agriculture will maintain its 
position in the national economy in the next century. 
  He cited that one of China's agricultural development 
objectives is that by the year 2000 the country will be able to 
produce 500 million tons of grain and 5.25 million tons of 
cotton, the per capita net income for farmers will reach 1,200 
yuan and the food shortages in poverty-ridden rural areas can be 
resolved. 
  The symposium is expected to play a very positive role in 
promoting Sino-Japanese agricultural cooperation and 
agro-produce trade, Xiang said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Japan's new prime 
minister Tsutomu Hata pledged today to strive for Diet 
(Parliament) passage of a tax system reform bill by the year-end 
aimed at increasing the current three percent consumption tax. 
  He told a nationally televised news conference at his 
official residence this evening that the government should 
introduce higher indirect taxes to extend this year's income tax 
cuts into years ahead. 
  Without a hike in indirect taxes, he said, the government 
"cannot finance the income tax cut with the issuance of 
deficit-covering bonds, since the accumulated budget deficit 
will exceed 200 trillion yen (1.9 trillion U.S. dollars). 
  Hata also said his government will abide by any United 
Nations resolutions in seeking a solution to the suspected 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula under the constraints of 
Japan's war-renouncing constitution. 
  Asked how his administration would try to overcome 
difficulties of a shaky minority coalition cabinet, Hata said he 
will ask the opposition Liberal Democratic Party and Social 
Democratic Party to cooperate "on whatever policies they can, 
such as the legislation of the budget bills." 
  He dismissed suggestions that he would have no choice but to 
dissolve the 511-seat House of Representatives and call a 
general election in the face of a possible submission of a 
no-confidence motion by the opposition.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Japan's business 
leaders showed mixed reaction to the formation of the minority 
coalition cabinet today of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. 
  Some expressed relief at the move that ended 20 days of 
political unrest following Morihiro Hosokawa's April 8 
announcement to resign as prime minister, while others expressed 
concern over political uncertainties stemming from the weak 
foundation of the second coalition cabinet, KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
reported. 
  It quoted Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation 
of Employers Associations (Nikkeiron), and Osamu Uno, chairman 
of the Japan Department Stores Associations, as commenting on 
the Hata government with different reactions.

<F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Tan Jianrong: "Bumpy Road Ahead for Hata </F>
Cabinet"] 
  [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (XINHUA) -- The new cabinet to be 
formed by Tsutomu Hata later today will have a rough sailing as 
attainment of policy consensus may not be easy despite the 
policy platform they have agreed on for a new government, 
political analysts here said. 
  Hata, 58, will formally succeed Morihiro Hosokawa as Japan's 
51st prime minister and inaugurate his own cabinet, the second 
coalition cabinet since last August, this evening. 
  The leader of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party) faces mounting political and economic problems 
both at home and abroad. He will have to undertake the tax 
system reform, pass the overdue fiscal 1994 budget, reactivate 
the sluggish economy, intensify deregulation, and ease Japan's 
trade friction with the United States and the suspected nuclear 
issue on the korean peninsula. 
  Policies on two key issues -- the tax system reform and 
Japan's response to the alleged nuclear development program in 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- had been the focus 
of heated negotiations among the coalition partners over the 
past two weeks, causing turmoil in Japanese politics and 
delaying the inauguration of a new government. 
  Analyst Jiro Yamaguchi said it is very likely that fighting 
within the coalition will emerge and political confusion 
reappear in June, when the Hata administration has to hammer out 
an agreement on the tax system reform centering around an 
increase in consumption tax. 
  "If this (intro-coalition battle) happens... an early 
general 
election will seem necessary in order to let the people judge 
over tax and foreign policy," the professor of political science 
at Hokkaido University wrote in the mass-circulated ASAHI 
SHIMBUN newspaper. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP), the coalition's largest 
contingent, had first demanded the abolition of the current 
three percent consumption tax and then insisted on the inclusion 
of the need for "national consensus" in the platform as a 
prerequisite for the hike. The coalition agreement, which was 
reached after the party made a compromise, calls on the 
coalition to carry out full- scale tax system reform "while 
seeking people's understanding." 
  Shinseito co-leader Ichiro Ozawa, touted as the 
behind-the-scene strategist for the coalition's agenda-setting, 
has warned that the new cabinet may face future crises as the 
policy platform does not adequately address upcoming problems. 
  Columnist Minoru Morita also voiced skepticism about Hata's 
ability to tide over difficulties when political uncertainties 
arise, although the "good man" who has few enemies has vowed to 
strive for the unity of the coalition and "serve as glue for the 
coalition." 
  "He is a very likable person indeed," Morita said. "But even 
so, frankly, I still doubt that Mr. Hata is a person who can go 
through a very tough, cold-blooded battle (to push through a tax 
increase)." 
  The eight-month-old seven-party alliance is poised to split 
into two camps -- one led by Shinseito and the other by the SDP. 
The past two weeks has seen intense internal bickering over 
policy following Hosokawa's bombshell resignation announcement 
on April 8. 
  Coupled with the increasing polarization of the political 
parties, some analysts have feared that the rifts over policy 
revealed during the hard bargaining might make Hata's cabinet 
short-lived. 
  Although the coalition finally managed to paper over 
disputes 
over the major issues, the all-night, on-and-off policy meetings 
became a bitter reminder of immense difficulties awaiting the 
new cabinet, they said. 
  "The coalition's framework has been maintained and the Hata 
administration is going to be formed at the end of the 
turbulence, but moves towards political realignment won't come 
to an end," said political commentator Kotaro Akiyama. 
  Unlike hosokawa, who formed an administration last August 
with a pledge to achieve political reform, Hata is not able to 
find such a common and foremost goal to bind the coalition, 
which had been on the brink of collapse during the past two 
weeks, the commentator said. 
  "Therefore, the coalition parties will be soon flung into 
political realignment and another political turmoil will 
follow," he added. 
  The new party Sakigake (Harbinger), whose head Masayoshi 
Takemura served in the key post of chief cabinet secretary in 
the Hosokawa administration, left the governing alliance to 
"cooperate from outside." 
  Public attention is now focused on when and how the rifts 
over coalition composition within the coalition will widen again 
-- a permanent division of the alliance that will eventually 
change Japan's political structure. 
  "A power struggle structure has already surfaced to take the 
place of the one featuring confrontation between the LDP and 
non-LDP camp," Akiyama said.

  [Text] Beijing, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of 
the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC], and who will visit Finland, 
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Belgium soon, met with ambassadors 
and ministers from the five countries in the Great Hall of the 
People this afternoon. During the meeting, Li and the diplomats 
exchanged views on furthering China's ties with these five 
countries. 
  Li Ruihuan first thanked the Governments of Finland, Sweden, 
Norway, and Denmark and the Chamber of Representatives and the 
Senate of Belgium for inviting him to visit, and he expressed 
his satisfaction over their careful arrangements for the visits. 
He said: This will be my first trip to Europe in the capacity 
of CPPCC chairman. It will also be a trip to fulfill the late 
Chairman Li Xiannian's unfulfilled wish to visit northwest 
Europe. I am looking forward to visiting your beautiful 
countries and establishing wide contacts with the leaders of the 
governments and parliaments, as well as the peoples from all 
walks of life, of your countries. I hope that the visits will 
achieve the goal of enhancing mutual understanding, expanding 
exchanges, and strengthening cooperation between China and your 
countries. 
  Li Ruihuan said: China and your five countries maintain good 
ties, which have been furthered in the past few years. 
High-level contacts have been constantly on the increase, and 
economic, trade, scientific, and technological cooperation and 
cultural exchanges have borne new fruit. The volume of two-way 
trade between China and your five countries has increased by a 
fairly big margin. [The preceding sentence is omitted in the 
variant version] Your countries have plenty of advanced science 
and technology and management expertise that China should draw 
on. The economies of the two sides are mutually complementary 
to a great extent, and there exist good conditions for the two 
sides to further develop their relations. I hope that the two 
sides will tap potentials and actively promote trade and 
economic cooperation and exchanges. [variant version reads: 
...two sides will make concerted efforts, tap potentials, and 
... (adding "make concerted efforts")] 
  Li Ruihuan said: China is deepening reforms, opening itself 
up wider, and promoting development. It needs not only a stable 
and harmonious domestic environment but also a peaceful and 
friendly international environment. China is in Asia while your 
countries are in Europe. Our national conditions and social 
system are different from yours, but China and your five 
countries have no conflicts of fundamental interests and share 
much common ground on the maintenance of world peace and 
promoting common development. This is a very good basis for our 
friendship and cooperation. China is ready to further develop 
its ties with your five countries on the principles of seeking 
common ground while reserving differences and of mutual respect, 
noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and equality 
and mutual benefit. 
  Li Ruihuan briefed the diplomatic envoys of the five 
countries on the CPPCC. He expressed the belief that the CPPCC 
will make new contributions to promoting the existing friendly 
ties between China and the five countries. 
  Danish Ambassador to China William Friis-Moller expressed 
his 
welcome of Chairman Li Ruihuan's visit on behalf of the five 
countries' diplomats. He said that the governments and peoples 
of the five countries attach great importance to Chairman Li 
Ruihuan's visit. He expressed the hope that the visit will 
deepen mutual understanding, promote the development of 
bilateral ties, and provide a chance for the five governments 
and parliaments to learn more about China. 
  Present at the meeting were Zhu Xun, deputy secretary 
general 
of the CPPCC National Committee, and Vice Foreign Minister Jiang 
Enzhu.

<F P=106> ["International Commentary" by Li Changjiu (2621 7022 0036): </F>
"Broad Prospects for Economic Cooperation between China and 
Western Europe"] 
  [Text] In early April, Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, 
French Prime Minister Edward Balladur, and Portuguese Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva arrived on different occasions in Beijing 
for formal visits. The media pointed out that "China fever" is 
raging again in West European countries. 
  The PRC has experienced some twists and turns in its 
relations with some West European countries in the 40-odd years 
following its founding, though on the whole bilateral relations 
with Western Europe have developed continuously. In recent 
years, there has been a marked increase in visits between 
Chinese and West European state leaders, key officials, and 
entrepreneurs, and traditional friendly cooperation is being 
restored and developed, especially in trade and economic 
cooperation, where the trend has been one of accelerated 
development. Both Chinese and West European leaders and 
entrepreneurs see many favorable conditions for developing 
bilateral relations and expanding economic cooperation and trade. 
  First, China and Western Europe share the same or similar 
views on many key international issues and have a good basis for 
cooperation. 
  China has consistently supported the integration, 
cooperation, and development of West European countries, which 
have supported China's reform and opening up and its effort to 
integrate its economy with the world economy. In mid-March this 
year, the GATT China Working Unit held its 16th meeting in 
Geneva to continue scrutinizing the issue of restoring China's 
GATT signatory status. EC representatives reiterated that they 
want to conclude the work of the unit swiftly so that China can 
resume its GATT's signatory status as soon as possible. French 
Prime Minister Balladur said during his talks with the Chinese 
premier that France supported the restoration of China's 
signatory status and allowing China to be a founding member of 
the World Trade Organization. 
  China has much common ground with West European countries in 
safeguarding world peace and promoting world economic 
development, which is a good basis for developing bilateral ties 
and expanding trade ties and cooperation. 
  Second, there is strong complementary economic and trade 
cooperation between China and West European countries. 
  West European countries are stronger in capital, technology, 
and equipment, while China, in its pursuit of modernization, 
requires huge amounts of capital, technology, and equipment and 
is a potentially enormous market. The achievements scored by 
Germany's Chancellor Kohl during his China visit in mid-November 
last year have caught the attention of West European political 
and business sectors. During Kohl's visit, China and Germany 
signed 7 billion German marks of contracts and letters of intent 
in a wide range of sectors such as steel, transport, energy, 
chemicals, machinery, electronics, telecommunications, and 
environmental protection; over 3 billion marks were contracts. 
  French industry and the foreign trade ministry officially 
unveiled this February "France's new Asia policy," its general 
spirit "firmly shifting toward Asia," and its direction of 
expansion being the East Asian and South East Asian counties, 
with China as its main target. Prime Minister Balladur said in 
talks with Premier Li Peng that there was great room for further 
cooperation between France and China. Longuet, the French 
minister of posts, telecommunications, and foreign trade, will 
later head a delegation visiting China to promote trade ties and 
economic cooperation with China. 
  Statistics from Finnish customs show that trade with China 
jumped from 341 million markkas in 1992 to 2.935 markkas in 
1993, with China Finland's largest trading partner among the 
developing countries. Finland has a great deal of experience in 
forestry, logging, and environmental protection. There are many 
opportunities for cooperation in these areas. 
  Third, China has great potential for trade and economic 
cooperation with West European countries. 
  Last year, Sino-Japanese trade hit $37.8 billion, 32 times 
the trade value recorded in 1972 when the two countries 
normalized their relations. Up to last September, Japan had 
invested $5.17 billion, one-third after 1992. Sino-U.S. trade 
last year amounted to $27.65 billion, 10.3 times the amount in 
1979 when China established diplomatic relations with the United 
States. By the end of last year, the United States had begun 
12,000 investment projects in China, worth $10.6 billion in 
agreed capital investment. Over 6,700 of these projects, 
commanding $6.8 billion in agreed capital investment, started 
only last year. Despite the high volume, there is still much 
room for growth in trade between China and Japan and the United 
States. 
  The markets, investments, and export scale of the 12 EC 
nations greatly exceed that of the United States and Japan. 
China's trade with the EC in the first quarter of this year 
already exceeds its trade with the United States. The EC has 
become China's third largest trading partner. The EC has very 
great potential for trade and economic cooperation with China. 
  There are broad prospects for trade and economic cooperation 
between China and West European countries. Cotti, chief of the 
Swiss Foreign Affairs Department, said at the annual convention 
of the Swiss-China Economic Society in Zurich this February that 
China's economy had become an important part of the world 
economy, "Chinese shareholders" were on the move, and the rapid 
rise of China's economy provided "enormous development 
opportunities for Swiss business." When talking with Chinese 
premier, Finnish Prime Minister Aho said that since economic 
growth in Europe is slow, Finland would like to strengthen 
economic cooperation with China. Equal, complementary, and 
mutually beneficial economic cooperation and trade between China 
and the West European countries helps economic and trade 
development in both China and the West European countries, but 
also global peace, stability, and development.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President 
Rong Yiren met with Jean Matteoli, chairman of the Economic and 
Social Council of France, and his party here this morning. 
  Rong welcomed Matteoli to China on behalf of the Chinese 
Government. 
  Being here for the first time, Matteoli said that through 
the 
current visit, he hoped he could establish connections with the 
Chinese leaders so as to serve the development of the friendly 
relations between France and China. 
  Matteoli said that developing such relations was in the 
interests of the two countries. 
  Rong said that generally, Sino-French cooperation and 
exchanges in politics, economy, culture, science and technology 
have made progress since the two set up diplomatic ties 30 years 
ago, though there were twists and turns during the period. 
  The recent visit to China by Prime Minister Balladur had 
contributed a lot to the promotion of bilateral relations, Rong 
said. 
  China and France suffered tremendous losses in World War Two 
and therefore both cherish and work for world peace. 
  The present world is not so peaceful, said Rong, and the 
situation requires different nations, on the basis of the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence, to enhance exchanges and 
deepen understandings, so as to make joint efforts to safeguard 
peace in the world. 
  The Chinese vice-president stressed that as China and France 
are both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, their 
friendly cooperative relations have significant meanings for 
international peace. 
  Matteoli agreed with Rong's views. 
  The Economic and Social Council is a legislation 
consultation 
institution in France. Matteoli and his party are here on a 
friendly visit as guests of the National Committee of the 
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), said he was glad to see the new 
development of Sino-French relations when meeting with a group 
of French visitors here this evening. 
  Li was talking with Jean Matteoli, chairman of the Economic 
and Social Council of France, and his party. 
  Extending his warm welcome to French friends, Li said that 
China and France are two great countries making important 
contributions to civilization. 
  He continued that the two countries, sharing many identical 
points, should strengthen exchanges and maintain and develop 
friendly relations of cooperation. 
  He said that "during the 30 years of diplomatic relations 
between the two countries, bilateral relations have been built 
up in general. 
  "A few years ago, due to various reasons, bilateral 
relations 
witnessed difficulties, but we are pleased to see that recently 
such relations have returned to normal and are in unbroken 
development," he added 
  He noted that comprehensive contacts between China and 
France 
constitute an important link in developing bilateral relations. 
  He said that "We know the French Economic and Social 
Council's important role and its experiences in various 
aspects," voicing that constant contacts between CPPCC and the 
council are of great significance in consolidating and 
developing bilateral friendly relations. 
  He hoped that such contacts can be continuously 
strengthened. 
  Matteoli expressed his thanks for Li's warm and friendly 
talks and said that there is no problem which can lead to 
difficulties between the two countries. 
  He noted that "France and China had the same experiences 
during the Second World War, which can never be forgotten by the 
two countries." 
  He said, "I believe that bilateral relations full of mutual 
trust will continue to develop and I will make my own efforts to 
this end." 
  Qian Zhengying, vice-chairperson of the CPPCC, was present 
at 
the meeting. 
  After the meeting, Li hosted a banquet in honor of the 
French 
guests.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-Premier 
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met here this afternoon with 
Jean Matteoli, chairman of the Economic and Social Council of 
France. 
  They expressed hopes that bilateral relations will 
experience 
better development. 
  Matteoli and his party arrived here on April 26 on a 
goodwill 
visit to China at the invitation of the National Committee of 
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). 
  At the meeting, Matteoli said that he is deeply moved by the 
warm reception by the Chinese side after he arrived here, which 
has proved that bilateral relations are on a positive 
development track after the China visit by the French Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur. 
  He said that French personages from political and economic 
circles spoke highly of the reception of Balladur by China and 
they also hope to further bilateral relations. 
  Matteoli said that his talks with Chinese leaders during the 
past days show that conditions are ready for the harmonious 
development of bilateral relations in the fields of politics, 
economy, culture, science and technology. 
  Qian expressed his appreciation for the active evaluation of 
Sino-French relations, saying that this year is very important 
for their development. 
  He recalled that he was warmly received when he visited 
France in January this year, adding that not long ago, 
Balladur's visit to China was successful. 
  He announced that Gerard Longuet, French minister of 
industry, posts, telecommunications and foreign trade will soon 
visit China, claiming that Sino-French economic and trade 
relations have a new prospect. 
  He pointed out that "we are very pleased to see that the 
development of Sino-French relations has returned to the time 
when the two countries established diplomatic relations." 
  He noted that the tasks facing the leaders of the two 
countries are to carry forward the Sino-French friendly 
relations of cooperation initiated by General Charles de Gaulle,

  [Text] Bonn, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Germany today refuted 
news reports that Bonn will export submarines to Taiwan through 
the United States. 
  The German Government will continue to abide by the decision 
made by the Federal Security Council to ban submarine export to 
Taiwan, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said today on behalf of 
Minister Claus Kinkel. 
  Meanwhile, an Economic Ministry spokesman told reporters 
that 
the German Government had ruled out the possibility of exporting 
submarines to Taiwan via the United States a year before, adding 
that no German shipyards are currently applying for such exports. 
  The denials followed reports in HANDELSBLATT and some other 
German papers that Germany may ship parts of submarines to the 
United States to be assembled there for sale to Taiwan. 
  The reports said the deal is related to Germany's export of 
high- speed trains to Taiwan. 
  On January 28, 1993, the German Federal Security Council had 
rejected requests from business circles for exporting submarines 
and corvettes to Taiwan.

RIBAO Reporter Guan Yanzhong (4619 1750 1813)] 
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- The autumn sun in 
the Argentine capital was genial and charming. After 1500 
[local time] on the afternoon of 22 April, Hu Jintao and his 
party arrived by car in San Nicolas, a town located 30 km to the 
south of Buenos Aires. They enthusiastically visited the town's 
community training center. 
  Hu Jintao came to the training center warden Cuellar's house 
first. Cuellar was about 50 years old and strong. He and his 
whole family happily welcomed the visiting CPC delegation. 
Touching the shoulder of Miguel, Cuellar's young son, Hu Jintao 
cordially asked: "How old are you?" The child bashfully 
answered: "Eight years old." His mother Naomi interrupted: 
"He was working at the vegetable farm just now." Hu Jintao 
praised him: "You really are a good boy." After hearing this, 
his parents smiled happily. 
  Hu Jintao presented gifts of embroidered table cloth, a 
Chinese painting, and colorful velvet birds to Cuellar's family. 
Holding a velvet bird, young Miguel innocently asked: "Where 
did the bird come from?" Hu Jintao humorously said: "It flew 
over here from China." The answer made everyone laugh. 
  Community training centers are a type of nongovernment 
educational organization that has appeared in Argentina in 
recent years. Their objectives are to train youngsters from 
poor areas to master certain skills to earn a living or get 
jobs. The government has affirmed the project and supplied 
partial subsidies. The San Nicolas Community Training Center 
has 17 teachers and nearly 100 students. It mainly teaches 
techniques for carpenters, bricklayers, blacksmiths, and 
vegetable farmers. 
  Hu Jintao asked detailed questions on the course system, 
curricula, the number of students, and the source of funds. 
Personnel in charge of the training center answered all his 
questions in succession. 
  Hu Jintao visited the training center's vegetable farm and 
noticed that sprinkling irrigation facilities -- made by 
students out of plastic bottles and plastic pipes -- were 
sprinkling water evenly on the young plants. He said happily: 
"These are home-made sprinkling irrigation facilities. The 
kids are very smart." It has been learned that the vegetable 
farm has been converted from a garbage dump. Vegetables growing 
in the farm include green lettuce, unripened tomatoes, big 
cabbages, eggplants, onions, and greens. Hu Jintao asked 
Orlando, a student working at the farm, how long he has been 
training. Orlando answered: "Two years." Hu Jintao asked 
again: "Can you properly handle a vegetable farm if one is 
handed over to you?" The student nodded and said: "Yes." The 
Chinese guest wished him success. 
  Hu Jintao said to the teachers, students, and residents who 
gathered at the edge of the vegetable farm: "On behalf of the 
Chinese people, I am extending cordial greetings to you. The 
community conducts technical training classes to help youths get 
jobs in an effort to improve everyone's living standards. We 
are very interested in the project. Some people in China are 
still poor and the government is taking measures to help them 
shake off poverty. We have come to learn from your 
experiences." As soon as he finished, everyone energetically 
clapped their hands.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA)--The Chinese Government 
still hopes that the Dalai Lama will abandon his idea of 
"Tibetan independence," stop living in exile and return to China 
for his remaining years, a spokesman said. 
  The spokesman for the United Front Work Department of the 
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee said that negotiation 
is the "only appropriate" method for making arrangements to 
resolve this question. 
  "We hope that the Dalai Lama will size up the situation, go 
with the tide of historical development and make a correct 
choice," he said in a recent interview with XINHUA in the run-up 
to the 43rd anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, 
which falls on May 23. 
  The spokesman answered questions about development and 
construction in the Tibet Autonomous Region and the policies of 
China's central government regarding the Dalai Lama. 
  Question [Q]: What profound changes have taken place in 
Tibet 
over the past 43 years? 
  Answer [A]: On May 23, 1951, the central government and the 
Tibetan local government signed a 17-article agreement on the 
peaceful liberation of Tibet, realizing the liberation of Tibet 
by peaceful means. 
  The peaceful liberation of Tibet is an important component 
of 
the Chinese people's liberation cause. Since then, as other 
nationalities in China, the Tibetan people have fully enjoyed 
all rights of equality among all nationalities and have embarked 
on the road of freedom and happiness. 
  Over the past 43 years Tibet has undergone sweeping changes, 
from the extremely backward serf system to modernization. 
Millions of serfs have become masters of their fate, while 
large numbers of Tibetan workers, intellectuals and officials 
have taken up the task of building and managing Tibet. 
  With the assistance and support from the central government 
and other parts of China, and through the common efforts of the 
Tibetan people, Tibet has scored great achievements in 
construction in various fields. 
  In 1993, Tibet harvested a record 620,000 tons of grain; the 
number of large domestic animals in Tibet rose to 23.2 million; 
its modern industry, which started from scratch, manufactured 
470 million yuan worth of goods; and its energy, transportation 
and telecommunications conditions improved markedly. 
  Meanwhile, the fine traditional Tibetan culture has been 
inherited and developed, and big strides were made in education, 
science, culture, public health and other undertakings. The 
Tibetan people's living standards have improved markedly, with 
the Tibetan population soaring to two million from one million 
in the 1950s. 
  The policies of the Communist Party and the government on 
nationality and religious affairs enjoy wholehearted support of 
the Tibetan people and all patriotic persons in Tibet. All 
parts of Tibet are now a picture of vitality and prosperity. 
  The Tibetan people have made great contributions to 
maintaining the motherland's unity, the unity among the people 
of various nationalities and the country's modernization drive. 
  In the future, in the course of reforms, opening up and 
establishing a socialist market economic structure, the central 
government will continue to pursue policies conducive to Tibet's 
economic growth and the improvement in living standards of the 
Tibetan people. 
  It will continue to mobilize people of various nationalities 
in China to assist Tibet in speeding up its development. It 
will also combine its assistance with Tibet's self-development 
efforts and gear its economic assistance with the great 
environment of reforms in order to lay the groundwork for 
sustained economic development in Tibet so as to achieve common 
prosperity. 
  Q: It is a historical fact that Tibet is an inseparable part 
of China. However, even today, the Dalai Lama is still in exile 
and engaged in activities to split the motherland. What are the 
policies of the central government concerning the Dalai Lama? 
Have there been any changes in these policies? 
  A: The principled stand and basic attitude of the central 
government regarding the Dalai Lama and his followers have been 
consistent and clear, with no changes at all. 
  As long as the Dalai Lama recognizes the fact that Tibet is 
an inseparable part of China, totally abandons his idea of 
"Tibetan independence" and stops engaging in activities to split 
the motherland, the central government would welcome his 
stopping to live in exile as soon as possible, returning to 
China to contribute to upholding the unification of the 
motherland, national unity and economic development and do 
something good for the prosperity and happiness of the Tibetan 
people. 
  In 1979 Deng Xiaoping made it clear to a private 
representative of the Dalai Lama that the question of overriding 
importance is that Tibet is part of China, and this should be 
the criterion to judge what is right and what is not. 
  In answering a question from a XINHUA reporter on May 19, 
1991, Premier Li Peng reiterated the policies of the central 
government, saying that there is only one fundamental principle 
-- that Tibet is an inseparable part of China. 
  On that question there is no room at all for bargaining, Li 
said, adding that the central government is always ready to 
contact the Dalai Lama, provided that he must stop engaging in 
activities to split the motherland and change his position of 
"Tibetan independence." 
  Negotiations can be held on any questions, but definitely 
not 
on "Tibetan independence," the premier stressed. 
  The above policies of the central government remain 
unchanged. 
  Tibetan affairs are China's internal affairs. Any attempts 
to "internationalize the Tibet question" will never succeed and 
will be opposed resolutely by the Chinese people. 
  Q: According to reports by foreign wire services, the 
Dalai Lama has claimed on different occasions that he has made 
"maximum concessions in a series of initiatives and proposals 
which clearly lie within the framework for negotiations" in 
which all questions except the independence of Tibet can be 
negotiated. Is that true? 
  A: It would be the Dalai Lama's maximum progress if he has 
genuinely abandoned his stand for "the independence of Tibet". 
But it is regrettable that we have seen no signs of such 
progress up to now. The Dalai Lama has never admitted that 
Tibet is an inseparable part of China since he went into exile, 
neither has he stopped the activities to split the motherland. 
  His various claims or proposals have always centered on the 
"independence of Tibet". Recently, he referred to Tibet as a 
"captive nation," saying that "I firmly believe ... will 
eventually lead our captive nation to freedom and peace in 
dignity" [as received]. His so-called "concessions" are nothing 
but an adjustment in tactics, essentially still sticking to his 
claims of "independence of Tibet." 
  Q: It is said that the central government has made 
painstaking efforts for negotiations with the Dalai Lama. But 
the Dalai Lama has alleged on many occasions that the central 
government is unwilling to negotiate with him. What are the 
actual facts? 
  A: Up to now the Dalai Lama has not abandoned his stand for 
the "independence of Tibet." This is the largest obstacle to 
negotiations. The central government has worked hard to bring 
about the result that through negotiations, the Dalai Lama and 
his followers are reunited with the motherland after they 
abandon their independence stand. This has demonstrated the 
sincerity and patience of the central government. 
  Since 1979, the central government departments have agreed 
and actually received the Dalai Lama's private representatives 
back in the motherland and listened attentively to their reports 
of the Dalai Lama's intentions. Some representatives have been 
greeted by leading members of the central government. 
  Early in 1989, the Panchen Lama died. Zhao Puchu, president 
of the China Buddhist Association, personally handed a letter of 
invitation to the private representatives of the Dalai Lama, 
inviting him back home to attend the funeral ceremonies. 
  Such a solely religious invitation provided an excellent 
opportunity for the Dalai Lama to meet with people in Buddhist 
circles at home after spending over 30 years in exile. However, 
the Dalai Lama turned down this invitation. 
  After the changes in the international situation in the 
later 
half of 1989, the Dalai Lama suspended contacts with the central 
government. In the same year, the Dalai Lama brazenly split 
China into several parts, like "Tibet, Xinjiang, Mongolia, 
Manchu," etc, in maps in his book "Freedom in Exile". 
  In 1992, as China's domestic situation had not turned in the 
direction which the Dalai Lama had anticipated, he asked to 
resume the contacts with the central government. On two 
occasions in 1992 and 1993, central government departments 
received the Dalai Lama's private representatives. 
  The reason that the central government did not publicize the 
over a dozen years' talks with the Dalai Lama's private 
representatives was that the central government departments 
explained on various occasions during the talks with the Dalai 
Lama's private representatives that the contacts were secret and 
should not be publicized. The Dalai Lama's private 
representatives made the same promises. We regret that the 
Dalai Lama's side has broken its promises. It not only 
publicized such contacts, but distorted the talks so as to 
mislead the public. 
  Q: Why have the bilateral contacts not produced any results? 
  A: The reason that the contacts have not produced any 
results and we cannot start our negotiations is that the Dalai 
Lama's side has not reached a common understanding with us on 
the fundamental issue that "Tibet is an inseparable part of 
China." 
  They have even referred to the fundamental principles held 
by 
the central government as "preconditions and obstacles to 
negotiations". We think that the fundamental principle is not a 
so-called precondition and obstacle to hinder negotiations, but 
the basis and guarantee for successful negotiations. 
  Q: It is clear that the responsibility for not being able to 
hold negotiations lies with the Dalai Lama's side. But is there 
any possibility for progress as the situation stands now? 
  A: In China, we have a saying: "When the melon is ripe it 
falls off its stem; when the water flows, a channel is formed," 
which means that when conditions are ripe, success will come. 
  Everything has its own laws of development. But some things 
will not be obvious or widely perceived as long as they have not 
developed to a certain stage. The central government will 
continue its efforts with sincerity and patience. After all the 
Dalai Lama is a Chinese citizen. We still hope that he will 
abandon his idea of "independence of Tibet", stop living in 
exile and return to China for his remaining years. Negotiation 
is the only appropriate method for making arrangements to 
resolve this question. We hope that the Dalai Lama will size up 
the situation, go with the tide of historical development and 
make a correct choice.

<F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F>
"Chinese Central Authorities Wait Patiently for Talks With Dalai 
Lama"] 
  [Text] XINHUA yesterday dispatched a report about the 
comment by a spokesman for the CPC Central United Front Work 
Department, who described the situation of economic construction 
in Tibet Autonomous Region and also expounded on the Central 
Government's policy toward the Dalai Lama. The spokesman 
revealed, for the first time, the details of the contacts 
between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama's personal 
representatives in order to pave the way for the talks between 
the two sides. 
  The Chinese Government's willingness to hold talks with the 
Dalai Lama because it hopes that he and his followers will 
return to the motherland, terminate their lives of exile, and do 
something beneficial to the motherland's unification and the 
well-being of the Tibetan people. For the past more than 40 
years, substantial progress has been made in the economic 
development of Tibet Autonomous Region, which has not be 
obstructed by the Dalai Lama's fleeing and the separatist 
activities he has plotted abroad. Tibet previously pursued the 
backward feudal serf-owning system but great social and economic 
changes have already occurred. The Tibetan population has 
increased from some 1 million in the 1950's to over 2 million 
today. The fine cultural tradition of the Tibetan Nationality 
has been maintained and developed. 
  In the past, Beijing has not revealed anything about 
contacts 
with the Dalai Lama's personal representatives because there was 
a mutual promise to keep such things confidential and not 
publicize the contacts. However, the Dalai Lama's side has 
violated the promise many times, not only making public such 
contacts but also distorting the contents of the talks. Thus, 
Beijing could not but come out and make a clarification. 
  According to the spokesman for the CPC Central United Front 
Work Department, since 1979, the departments concerned in the 
central government agreed to allow the Dalai Lama's personal 
representatives to return to China and have also received them 
many times, seriously listening to the Dalai Lama's opinions 
conveyed by his envoys. The central leaders also attended the 
meetings personally. Deng Xiaoping was present at one such 
meeting in 1979. The contacts were suspended for a certain 
period for reasons concerning the Dalai Lama's side. In 1992 
and 1993, the central departments concerned again received the 
Dalai Lama's personal representatives on two occasions. 
  Although contacts were made many times, they did not 
successfully lead to holding talks. The crux of the problem was 
obvious: The Dalai Lama refused to acknowledge that Tibet is an 
inalienable part of China. The central government insisted that 
the principle was the foundation for the talks and the guarantee 
for achieving results but the Dalai Lama denounced this as 
setting "a precondition and obstacle" to the talks. 
  When receiving the Dalai Lama's personal envoy in 1979, Deng 
Xiaoping said: "The fundamental issue is that Tibet is part of 
China. The rights and wrongs should be judged according to this 
criterion." This is a major issue of principle. All Chinese 
people, no matter what political position they may hold and no 
matter whether they are Hans or Tibetans or other national 
minorities, they all share the same sacred responsibility to 
safeguard the country's unification and territorial integrity. 
  The Dalai Lama must acknowledge that Tibet is an inalienable 
part of China. If he is willing to do this, the talks on 
anything else will be easy. If he refuses to acknowledge this, 
how can talks be possible? However, the Dalai Lama was only 
keen to advocate "Tibetan independence" and even described Tibet 
as an "occupied country." Even so, the central government is 
still waiting patiently for the Dalai Lama to come around. 
  The international community generally acknowledges that 
Tibet 
is China's territory but some people in the West, such as some 
of the British mass media, are still unwilling to "lose" Tibet 
and continue to assert the "Chinese people's occupation of 
Tibet" in their news reports. Some other people in the West 
have tried to seek mental comfort, taking it as chic to discuss 
Tibet's Lama religion and to worship the Dalai Lama. The Dalai 
Lama is not a purely religious figure. Over a long period of 
time, he has been a political exile engaged in the activities of 
splitting the motherland. Therefore, the Chinese Government and 
the Chinese people resolutely oppose audiences granted to the 
Dalai Lama by any officials of foreign governments.

  [Text] Fuzhou, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- A national meeting on 
civil aviation security was held in Fuzhou today. Vice Premier 
Zou Jiahua of the State Council wrote a letter to all delegates 
attending the meeting, stressing that the civil aviation 
institution should continue to adhere to the policy of "safety 
first, precaution vital" and should step up civil aviation 
security work. 
  Zou Jiahua pointed out in his letter: Civil aviation 
security 
is extremely important to upholding the nation's reputation, 
ensuring the safety of state property and people's lives, and 
advancing economic construction. Since the beginning of this 
year, the civil aviation institution has endeavored to improve 
management, and good progress has been made in work in all 
areas. A string of effective measures also have been taken to 
reinforce aviation security. Nevertheless, we must not be lax 
for a moment. The civil aviation institution must continue to 
conscientiously carry out the State Council's "Circular on 
Strengthening Civil Aviation Security" and "Measures on Stepping 
Up Anti-Aircraft-Hijacking Work," adhere to the policy of 
"safety first, precaution vital," and step up aviation security 
work. 
  In his speech at the meeting, Chen Guangyi, director-general 
of the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC], pointed 
out: Ensuring safety is the primary task of the civil aviation 
institution. Leaders at all levels and all workers engaging in 
civil aviation security work should ensure civil aviation 
security with a strong sense of being highly responsible to the 
party and the people. Since last year, the CAAC has endeavored 
to carry out the instructions and guidelines provided by the 
party Central Committee and the State Council; issued a series 
of regulations, decisions, orders, and circulars concerning 
reinforcing civil aviation security; built up and improved the 
training of the civil aviation security work force; increased 
aviation security personnel; improved air safety facilities and 
equipment; tightened security inspection; stepped up 
precautionary work; and launched an anti-aircraft-hijiacking 
struggle, and good results have been achieved. 
  Chen Gguangyi said: The civil aviation institution should 
bear in mind that the whole institution is a single entity. 
Personnel at all posts should work strictly according to 
relevant laws, regulations, and orders. We should avert 
aircraft hijacking if we can, absolutely assuring the safety of 
the aircraft and passengers. All aircraft hijackers and 
attempted hijackers should be severely punished according to 
law. Major civil aviation leaders at all levels should 
personally take charge of security work; assurance of civil 
aviation security must be considered as important as assurance 
of flight safety. 
  On the two sides of the Taiwan Strait joining forces in 
cracking down on aircraft hijacking and on repatriating aircraft 
hijackers to the mainland, Chen Guangyi pointed out: Illegal 
hijacking of civil airliners poses a serious threat to the 
safety of passengers' lives and property -- it is a grave crime. 
Over the last two years, we have taken a series of tight 
precautionary measures to prevent aircraft hijacking, and we ask 
the Taiwan authorities to repatriate aircraft hijackers to the 
mainland according to the "Jinmen Agreement" of September 1990. 
In the spirit of being highly responsible for the safety of the 
lives and property of passengers, including those of Taiwan 
compatriots, and with the good wish of promoting cross-strait 
exchange and economic cooperation, we hope the Taiwan 
authorities will take positive steps to support our efforts to 
crack down on aircraft hijacking. We have noted that concerned 
authorities of Taiwan have pledged "not to grant political 
asylum" to aircraft hijackers and that they will severely punish 
them. We also have noted that the Association for Relations 
Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange 
Foundation have reached a common understanding that in principle 
all aircraft hijackers will be repatriated, and have agreed on 
the basic framework for the agreement on repatriating aircraft 
hijackers. We thank people from all sectors of Taiwan for 
giving forceful support to the demand that aircraft hijackers be 
repatriated to the mainland as quickly as possible. We believe 
that, as long as concerned departments of the two sides of the 
strait work hand-in-hand in resolutely and forcefully cracking 
down on aircraft hijacking and as long as hijackers are 
repatriated immediately, we will be able to fundamentally 
prevent aircraft hijacking from taking place and to provide 
reliable assurance for the safety of passengers' lives and 
property as well as for flight safety. 
  Li Jizhou, assistant to the minister of public security, 
urged public security organs across the country to regard 
ensuring civil aviation security as a part of their jobs and to 
give full support to civil aviation departments in ensuring 
security work. He said public security organs of civil aviation 
departments should step up inspection of and supervision over 
the implementation of regulations and systems on civil aviation 
security. 
  At today's meeting, Chen Guangyi, on behalf of the 
mainland's 
aviation idustry, expressed his condolences for the Taiwan 
compatriots, other passengers, and crew members of an airliner 
of Taiwan's "China Airlines" who were killed after it crashed at 
Japan's Nagoya Airport on 26 April, and gave his regards to the 
relatives of the victims.

  [Text] Fuzhou, April 28 (CNS) -- At a meeting on national 
civil air safety being held here today, the Director-General of 
the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Mr. Chen 
Guangyi repeatedly asked representatives from CAAC branches 
across the country for strengthened awareness of anti-hijacking 
and said that they must not loosen, in the slightest degree, 
their efforts in achieving this end. 
  Mr. Chen stressed that air safety work undertaken by CAAC 
had 
to be done in accordance with the law and regulations covering 
various items including the sale of tickets, checking of 
tickets, inspection of luggage and passengers, examination on 
board the plane and the handling of hijacking. Responsibility 
had to be clearly defined and to be held by officials on duty. 
The practice of safety coming first with the emphasis on 
precautions had to be employed. Possible hijackers and 
incidents likely to pose a threat to air safety have to be dealt 
with on the ground and not let them develop to the airborne 
stage. 
  As for hijacking incidents, they have to be fully 
investigated right to their end. Responsibilities for hijacking 
have to be distinguished clearly while effective measures to 
preventing hijacking have to be sought after. Hijacking 
incidents have to be seriously handled, the director said. 
  Since the beginning of last year, CAAC has issued a 
succession of rules, regulations, decisions, instructions and 
notices for strengthened air safety while at the same time 
greatly increasing the number of air security personnel, 
equipment, and facilities for the strict implementation of 
safety inspections and precautions. Mr Chen said that such 
measures had achieved success to some extent in countering 
hijacking. The authorities uncovered six hijacking attempts, 
arrested 45 suspects who hid firearms and weapons restricted 
according to law and seized a number of dangerous items and 
contraband articles.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS) -- The Ministry of Public 
Security recently invited relevant experts and professors to 
study the issue of training of forensic medical experts and 
propose concrete ideas on how to strengthen the training of such 
people. 
  According to the ministry's statistics, in various criminal 
cases in recent years, those perpetrated with a high degree of 
intelligence and murder cases had greatly increased, posing new 
requirements as to the quality and number of forensic medical 
experts. 
  At present, departments and units needing such experts are 
all short of these talents. Therefore, the education and 
training of such personnel has been highlighted by the ministry 
with some concrete schemes and measures being already worked 
out. The ministry has decided to give further support to 
running the forensic medicine departments in the six medical 
universities of Shanghai, Zhongshan, China, West China, Tongji 
and Xian in order to train more such experts for the public 
security sector. Its support includes the offering of practice 
bases for students of the six universities, the construction of 
teaching facilities, a heavy input into the discipline of 
medical jurisprudence of the Criminal Police Officers Institute 
of China and the retraining of the existing forensic medical 
personnel. The ministry will strengthen management over and 
construction of the forensic medical personnel ranks through 
legislation in a bid to build up a contingent of forensic 
medical experts as soon as possible to meet the needs of legal 
construction in the country.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Governments at all 
levels should support trade unions to allow them to work 
independently within the framework of laws and related 
regulations so as to fulfill their role of bridging the general 
masses. 
  This was aired here today by Wei Jianxing, chairman of the 
All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). 
  Speaking at a meeting celebrating International Labor Day, 
the official said that "relying on the working class is a 
fundamental guideline that our party has firmly adhered to. 
  "And it is even more important to do so now that the country 
is fully engaged in boosting development, expanding reform and 
maintaining stability. Any thinking or action that goes astray 
from the guideline is wrong." 
  Wei, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that the 
working class is a decisive force in maintaining and 
safeguarding social stability. 
  The working class should hold the cause of reform as its 
sacred duty and support it unswervingly. It is obliged to 
contribute to the deepening of reform, the establishment of a 
modern enterprise system and the improvement of the large- and 
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, he said. 
  He noted that democratic management is an important symbol 
of 
the modern enterprise system. Workers are the masters of the 
country, whether they are with the public sector or with the 
non-public sector, and their legitimate rights and interests 
must be secured and protected. 
  Currently, more care and help should be extended to the 
workers in loss-making enterprises and enterprises operating at 
less than capacity, as well as to the retired or those with 
living difficulties. Measures should be taken to help them 
weather the difficulties, the union chairman said. 
  Also at the meeting, ACFTU called on workers nationwide to 
learn form the ten "'94 national outstanding workers", who were 
selected on the 11th of this month. 
  Official sources said that the ten, all national model 
workers or winners of the "May 1 Medal", have made nationally or 
internationally remarkable achievements in their work. 
  Today Wei also met with a group of representatives from Hong 
Kong and Macao who will participate May Day celebrations with 
Beijing workers. The visitors will also tour east China's 
Zhejiang Province.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- The State Development 
Bank (SDB), born two weeks ago, declared here today the success 
of its first bond issue of 20 billion yuan. 
  "By the 25th of this month, the first batch of bonds worth 
20 
billion yuan had been purchased by state commercial banks and 
non-banking financial institutions," said SDB President Yao 
Zhengya. 
  "The sell-out of the bonds marks a good start for key state 
projects in obtaining enough capital funds this year," said Yao. 
  According to the usual practice, these projects should 
obtain 
40 percent of the yearly financing during the first six months 
of the year. 
  However, the planned capital demand was only met by 19 
percent of the projects during the January-June period of 1993 
due to a national financial squeeze. 
  The State Development Bank, the country's first policy bank, 
was established to ensure the smooth channeling of funds to 
major construction projects, mostly in the basic industries and 
infrastructure sectors, and technical renovation of "pillar" 
state firms. 
  According to Yao, the bank will issue a total of 65 billion 
yuan in bonds this year. The other issues will be made in May, 
July, August and October, with amounts of 8 billion, 13 billion, 
12.5 billion and 11.5 billion yuan respectively. 
  The bonds, which include 45.5 three-year maturity bonds and 
19.5 five-year maturity bonds, will be bought by banks and other 
financial bodies under quotas set by the People's Bank of China, 
the central bank. 
  The interest rates are 12.5 percent for the three-year bonds 
and 14 percent for the five-year ones. 
  The national treasury provided the bank with one billion 
yuan 
as a discount this year to make up for the gap caused by the low 
interest loans extended by the bank to the projects.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS) -- The financial bonds 
valued at RMB 65 billion by the State Development Bank are being 
issued smoothly. As of April 25, various financial institutions 
have deposited RMB 20 billion specially for subscription of the 
first batch of bonds into the bank. 
  The Development Bank founded last March with a registered 
capital of RMB 50 billion is directly under the State Council 
and is a policy-oriented bank for the raising of funds and for 
the directing of capital for the construction of basic industry, 
infrastructural facilities and pillar industries. 
  President of the bank Mr. Yao Zhenyan said that capital 
raised from the bonds would go totally on basic items and 
technological renovation under state planning. Of the funds 
collected, RMB 60 billion will be for basic construction while 
the remaining RMB 5 billion will be used for technological 
renovation. The bonds are divided into two kinds with one for a 
three-year term bonds are valued at RMB 45.5 billion with an 
annual yield of 12.5 percent and the five-year term bonds at RMB 
19.5 billion with an annual yield of 14 percent. The 
Development Bank will pay principal and interest calculated on 
simple interest rate on maturity. 
  The funds raised on this occasion will mainly be for state 
key items such as the Three Gorges Project and the 
Beijing-Kowloon railway line. Subscribers are restricted to 
state-owned commercial banks and non-banking financial 
institutions, all of which have been selected by the People's 
Bank of China. They receive an invoice issued by the 
Development Bank for the subscription of bonds instead of bonds 
themselves. 
  Mr. Yao said that as the subscription was only confined to 
financial institutions, it would have no impact on the financial 
market. He noted that the Development Bank would also issue 
bonds overseas to raise foreign funds in a bid to broaden the 
source and channels of capital to serve the economic build-up at 
home.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (CNS) -- According to recent 
statistics, by the end of March this year, China had approved 
186,062 foreign-funded items with the contracted foreign capital 
being U.S.$241.5 billion and actual utilization of U.S.$67.2 
billion. 
  In the first quarter of this year, a good developing trend 
was seen in China's absorption of foreign capital with a new 
increase in foreign-funded items of 11,800 and actual 
utilization of foreign capital of U.S.$5.4 billion. 
  With the development of ten or more years, the three type 
foreign-funded enterprises in China constitute an important part 
of China's economy. The important roles they play in China's 
economy include the following: 
  They have speeded up the development of China's economy with 
foreign capital being an important source of money collection 
for construction and an important factor promoting the economic 
development in the country. 
  They have promoted industrial progress and development with 
the main part of foreign capital introduced being used for the 
export of advanced technology and equipment to fill some 
technological blanks and to bring many Chinese products closer 
to world standard. 
  Foreign-funded enterprises have become an important force in 
China's foreign trade with their total import and export value 
making up 34 percent of the country's total. 
  The establishment of foreign-funded enterprises have brought 
into China the market-based idea, new forms and ways of 
operation of enterprises, competitive mechanism and a scientific 
management system. They have also trained a large number of 
talented people in operations and management, setting examples 
for the transfer of the operational mechanism of state-owned 
enterprises and the establishment of modern enterprises.

<F P=106> [By Xi Mi: "New Decree To Try and Brace Curbs on Illicit </F>
Profiteering"] 
  [Text] The Chinese Government has been making painstaking 
efforts to stabilize prices and check illegal profiteering. 
  The latest measure to keep the market in order will be the 
promulgation of a decree aimed at curbing excessive profits 
gained through unfair means. 
  This would add to the existing laws and codes aimed at 
consumer protection. 
  "But these existing laws were not easily enforced because 
they are far too general and abstract. What's more, few of them 
address the new realities of the market economy because they 
were made when the State controlled the prices of most 
commodities," said Kuai Ming, of the State Planning Commission, 
which drafted the decree. 
  "The decree will be one that suits the market economy. The 
first draft of the regulation has been completed and the formal 
version is expected to go into effect around July." 
  The decree is being prepared against a background of 
continuous price hikes. 
  In February, the price index of consumer goods in 35 cities 
rose 25.9 per cent over the same period last year. 
  And in January and February, growth of the retail sales 
index 
across the country was 3 per cent higher than over the same 
period last year. 
  Such rapid price rises have lowered the living standards of 
workers in loss-making firms, as well as hitting retired people, 
students and farmers in poverty-stricken areas. 
  The imminent decree is just the latest in a series of 
government moves to regulate market prices. 
  The State Council has previously urged strict control of the 
scale and growth of investment in fixed assets. It has also 
sought increased commodity supply, strengthened price management 
and the establishment of a risk fund for growing grain and other 
foods. 
  A watchdog will be established to monitor the prices of over 
20 daily necessities and basic services. 
  Regulations on labelling have also been issued. 
  "The government has decided to relax controls on consumer 
goods, allowing them to be priced according to market demands. 
But this does not mean the government should let prices go 
adrift," said Jiang Runyu, from the former State Administration 
of Commodity Prices, which was recently merged with the State 
Planning Commission. 
  The government needs to maintain overall macro-control of 
the 
market, he said. 
  Speaking at a meeting earlier this month, Chen Jinhua, 
Minister of the State Planning Commission, said the government 
should adopt new measures to prevent unlimited price rises and 
drastic fluctuations, while at the same time preserving the 
vitality of the market. 
  "The State should take legislative, economic and if 
necessary, administrative measures to stabilize market prices," 
said Jiang. 
  The socialist market economy now taking shape is far from 
perfect and the market pricing system needs standardizing. 
  Besides, the consumers themselves are not mature and don't 
know how to protect their interests. 
  Dealers often arbitrarily and unreasonably raise their 
prices-- and that seldom occurs in a mature market economy, he 
said. 
  In February, vegetable prices in 35 cities rocketed by 53.5 
per cent. In Beijing, the price rise was even higher. 
  Many former State-subsidized vegetable stores in the city 
turned to other businesses when their subsidies were abolished. 
  The business volume of the State-run vegetable shops now 
only 
accounts for 10 to 15 per cent of the total market. 
  The market has now been collared by private traders. 
  According to the PEOPLE's DAILY, the retail price of 
vegetables used to be only 10 to 20 per cent higher than the 
wholesale price. But in spring this year, vegetables were 
selling on the street for twice the wholesale price. 
  In many cases, the prices hikes were due to vegetables being 
sold by one retailer to another before reaching customers. 
  Vegetable producers and transporters benefited little from 
the price hike, while vegetable wholesalers and retailers gained 
and the customers suffered. 
  "In the West, a profit margin of 30 per cent is considered 
very high," said Kuai. 
  To further illustrate arbitrary pricing, Kuai cited an 
example from the fashion business. 
  Some new and renovated department stores in downtown areas 
sell 100-yuan ($11.5) garments at 1,000 yuan ($115). Stores 
also charge high fees for renting their counters. 
  They set a bad example to other stores, inciting them to 
also 
impose high prices, which results in an inflated market. 
  "They expect to recover their investment in too short a time 
and they shift the burden to customers--it's not right," Kuai 
said. 
  Kuai said he once spotted a book priced at 180 yuan ($21) in 
the Lufthansa Shopping Centre. Yet in State-run bookstores, the 
same book could be bought for only 45 yuan ($5). Kuai dismissed 
such arbitrary pricing as incomprehensible and deemed the 
practice as rank profiteering. 
  The excessive profits gained through unethical measures will 
be curtailed when the new decree comes into effect, he said. 
  "At present, we are soliciting opinions on the draft from 
localities so the decree can reflect the demands of different 
regions," Kuai said. 
  He hopes the decree will help the healthy development of the 
market economy and that it will be improved by amendments. 
  According to Kuai, the forthcoming decree is in many ways 
similar to "the Temporary Code against Price Cheating and 
Excessive Profits" that was issued in Shanghai earlier this 
month. 
  The Shanghai code stipulates that dealers should not sell 
shoddy products, short-measure, or cheat customers through 
dishonest advertising and deceptive labelling. 
  Neither should dealers spread false market information or 
force customers into buying. 
  According to the decree, profit margins must be in line with 
general price standards on any given commodity. The "proper" 
standards are decided by the local price administration 
departments. 
  Those who violate the decree face fines. And their illegal 
profits must be returned to customers or confiscated.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (CNS) -- A survey shows that the 
number of millionaire enterprises has considerably increased in 
the mainland. 
  A sample survey of 1,432 privately-run enterprises has 
revealed that four percent of such enterprises, each with 
registered capital of over RMB 1 million at the very beginning 
of their business and those with registered capital of over RMB 
1 million, grew to become 23.8 percent of the total number by 
late 1992. The actual involvement of capital, put at more than 
RMB 1 million, made up 33.7 percent of the total, a phenomenon 
showing a rapid gain of assets owned by privately-operated 
enterprises. 
  Dramatic changes have been seen in recent years in the 
privately-owned business sector and limited liability companies 
have grown quickly in number. The survey indicated that by late 
June in 1993 there were 41,549 individual limited liability 
companies, accounting for 23 percent of the total number of 
privately-run enterprises, or a rise of 380 percent over the 
same period in the year before. 
  The pattern of privately-run enterprises has tended to be 
reasonable with involvement in the high technology industry. 
The survey revealed that the number of individual enterprises 
specializing in science and technology consultation rose from 
1,209 by late June, 1992 to 3,871 by June, 1993. 
  There were 184,000 privately-owned enterprises by late June, 
1993, 66 percent up over the same period in the previous year 
with employment of 2.94 million workers, a rise of 57 percent 
while the registered capital was put at RMB 45.2 billion, 200 
percent up over the year before.

<F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>
  [Text] China has claimed victory in curbing inflation, 
arguing that economic data recorded in March show signs of a 
slowdown of the price surge in the first two months of this year. 
  "We have achieved initial success in curbing price rises, 
mainly as a result of the greater controls over prices and the 
market at the central and local level," the State Statistics 
Bureau's spokesman Ye Zhen said. He said the momentum of rising 
prices had been effectively curbed in March and the rate of 
increase in prices of services, industrial raw materials and 
consumer products had gone down "remarkably". 
  Official figures showed that retail price inflation in 
China's 35 major cities was 24.5 per cent in March, compared 
with 25.9 per cent m February. Rural inflation dropped by a 
10th of a percentage point from 20.9 per cent recorded in 
February, Mr Ye said. 
  However, a Western diplomat said it "was too early" to 
declare victory, pointing out that a slight drop in prices could 
be attributed to a number of factors, even minor seasonal 
differences. "Inflation is still a major problem in China this 
year. We are keeping a close watch on it. "It remains unclear 
whether prices will continue to go down in April," he said. 
  A mainland economist argued that bringing inflation under 
control was an "uphill battle". "It's been clear that many 
localities are unable to keep inflation within the levels set by 
the central Government. The only positive indication is that 
the central Government has really attached significance to 
tackling the problem and is determined to control it. The crux 
will still be the tightening of money supply. It depends on 
whether China can curb fixed-assets investments and stop bailing 
out those state firms who are facing heavy losses," he said. 
  The retail price index rose by 20.1 per cent across the 
nation in the first quarter of this year. Last year's annual 
inflation was 13 per cent. Mr Ye said the rate of increase was 
still far ahead of the official target of keeping annual 
inflation within 10 per cent this year. He blamed the rapid 
rise of prices at the beginning of this year on the lack of 
effective macro-economic control and supervision over prices. 
Others had taken advantage of new tax reforms to increase 
prices illegally, said the official. He called on all sectors 
to maintain strict control over prices, adding that there should 
never be complacency. 
  The price surge in food, clothing and other necessities had 
already provoked fierce reaction from the public, he said. 
  Mr Ye's optimism was shared in a forecast by the China 
Materials Information Centre, carried in yesterday's China 
Business Daily. It cited reasons such as a balance in supply 
and demand of most goods as well as curbs on hoarding and 
speculative activities.

<F P=106> [Article by Hou Jie (0186 2638): "One Must Be Realistic in </F>
Resolving the Housing Problem"] 
  [Text] Practice over many years has demonstrated that it 
not feasible to negate the commodity attributes of residential 
housing, to keep it outside the market economy, and to let the 
government undertake the task of supplying housing to all 
workers. To actually solve the issue of urban residential 
housing supply, we should implement the principle of having the 
government, the employing institutions, and the individual 
workers jointly bear the costs of housing, should extensively 
raise housing construction funds, and should commercialize 
residential housing. 
  An analysis of the relevant data shows that, in many 
developed countries, people spend over 30 percent of their 
income on housing consumption, but in our country -- before the 
adjustment of the rental policy -- housing consumption accounted 
for only 1 percent of people's income. Of course, the average 
income and consumption level in our country is far lower than 
that in the developed countries, and it is unadvisable to 
unrealistically assess individuals' housing expenditures 
according to the level of those countries. The level of 
people's expenditure on housing is still too low in our country, 
however, and this is unfavorable to the settlement of the 
housing problem. We should soberly note that housing, being a 
special type of high-cost durable consumer goods, is an 
essential item of consumption. It has the common attributes of 
ordinary commodities as well as special characteristics which 
are unlike those of ordinary commodities. In the current 
conditions of our country, it is hardly possible to completely 
push housing onto the market. We should thus make arrangements 
according to the actual conditions and build different types of 
residential housing to meet the needs of people in different 
income categories. That is, there should be commodity houses, 
slightly profitable houses [wei li fang 1792 0116 2075], 
low-priced houses [ping jia fang 1627 0116 2075], and 
standard-priced houses [biao zhun fang 2871 0402 2075]. For a 
small number of people who earn a high income and who have 
strong psychological and economic tolerance, there should be 
special regulations on purchasing commodity housing, and the 
prices should be fixed according to the market conditions. A 
large number of people in the intermediate and low income 
brackets obviously cannot afford housing at the current prices, 
so our policies should arrange the construction of slightly 
profitable houses, low-priced housing, and standard-priced 
housing to meet their needs. At present, the greatest 
difficulty lies in finding a scientific way to define different 
income categories, because it is now not easy to find out 
people's actual income level. With the establishment of the 
system for people's income tax returns, this problem may be 
solved gradually. At the same time, we should also allow 
various localities to formulate their own standards for defining 
income categories according to the local people's actual income 
and consumption levels.

  [Text] Beijing is to launch a nationwide campaign next 
month to educate workers on the importance of industrial safety. 
  According to official statistics, at least 19 people were 
killed in 17 industrial accidents in the first quarter of this 
year in Beijing. The death toll was, however, significantly 
lower than the 27 recorded during the corresponding period last 
year. Officials said many of this year's victims were 
inexperienced workers under the age of 35. 
  Last year, Shanghai witnessed a 50 percent surge in 
industrial casualties, despite repeated cautions from the 
Government. Labour officials said industrial accidents were 
expected to soar as a result of the increase in the number of 
migrant workers from rural areas arriving in big cities such as 
Beijing and Shanghai. Many of these migrants were farmers who 
had no experience in carrying out industrial work. 
  The lack of safety measures at building sites was a major 
cause of concern. In Shanghai, three workers were buried alive 
while working on an underground drainage project. Government 
officials said that most migrant workers were not aware of their 
legal rights with regard to a safe work environment. Many 
employers failed to comply with safety requirements laid down by 
the Government. 
  The officials said although the Beijing Municipal Government 
had issued regulations four years ago requiring enterprises to 
provide a seven-day course on industrial safety for new workers, 
this was seldom carried out. A study in Shanghai found that 
only two out of 17 township enterprises surveyed had set aside 
special funds -- as the law requires for improving safety 
measures. Some enterprises preferred investing in office 
modernisation to improving safety.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (XINHUA) -- China produced 240 
million tons of coal in the first three months of this year, up 
6.5 percent over the corresponding period last year. 
  An official from the Ministry of Coal Industry said that in 
the first quarter of this year, state-owned key coal mines 
yielded 110 million tons, whereas local and township mines 
turned out 130 million tons, 12 percent more than in the same 
period last year. 
  He said that in general, the overall coal production of 
state- owned mines remained at the same level as last year; 
however, the developments of these mines varied in different 
regions. 
  The coal output went up in the regions with relatively 
developed industries and advantageous transport, but showed a 
downward trend wherever the railways were clogged, he explained. 
  He said the output of the local and township mines continued 
to grow, but there remained a lot to be done to "rectify, 
transform, unite and upgrade" the township mines. 
  Coal has been the main energy in China, accounting for over 
70 percent of the country's consumption of primary energy 
sources. Fierce competition in the coal markets has been waged 
by producers since the government lifted price controls at the 
beginning of this year. 
  It is expected that the total output of coal will reach 1.16 
billion tons this year. 
  The coal ministry said that it would exercise control over 
the aggregate production, restructure coal products and raise 
the economic efficiency of the industry.

  [Text] Jinan, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The best-equipped soda 
ash plant in China went into operation today in Weifang, in east 
China's Shandong Province, marking China's step up to the 
advanced world level in the field. 
  It has a planned annual production capacity of 600,000 tons 
of soda ash. 
  The plant, a key construction project of China's Seventh 
Five-Year Plan (1986-1990), involved an investment of 710 
million yuan and is scheduled to produce 400,000 tons of light 
soda ash and 200,000 tons of heavy soda ash annually. 
  Its main equipment has been imported from Germany, Japan and 
the United States. 
  The project, which was started in April 1986 and completed 
in 
June 1989, was built on the largest salt production base in 
China -- Yangkou Salt Farm of Shandong along the Bohai Sea. 
  Since it was put into production on a trial basis, it has 
produced more than 2.4 million tons of 100 percent pure soda 
ash, which has been sold in more than 20 provinces and regions 
in China and exported to 11 countries and regions. 
  In 1993, it produced 640,000 tons of soda ash, 80,000 tons 
of 
which were sold abroad, accounting for one-eighth of the 
nation's total production and more than one-fifth of the 
country's soda ash exports. 
  It has ranked among China's 500 largest industrial 
enterprises for three consecutive years.

<F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Committee Clamps Down on Drug Sector"] </F>
  [Text] The State is clamping down on its medicine 
standards with quality control inspections so that Chinese 
pharmaceuticals can enter the world market. 
  Pharmaceutical firms and their products must pass 
evaluations 
by a national committee called State Pharmaceutical 
Authentication Committee (SPAC). 
  The policy urges medicine enterprises to update their 
techniques and facilities to keep up with the world development 
trend. This will improve the quality of medicines and protect 
public health, said Zhang Wenkang, vice-minister of Public 
Health and also director of SPAC. 
  The administration has received many reports of fake and 
substandard medicines in recent years, as well as deaths caused 
by bogus products, said Liu Yonggang, former deputy director of 
State Pharmaceutical Administration and a member of SPAC. 
  Some pharmaceutical factories have not reached State 
requirements on production management. That severely hinders 
product quality improvement. 
  SPAC will inspect pharmaceutical enterprises in line with 
international principles of "Good Manufactory Practice for Drugs 
(GMP)." 
  GMP is common practice in many advanced countries. It 
stipulates production facilities, techniques and sanitation and 
also product quality inspections. 
  And all the medicines must be certificated by the committee 
in accord with the State Pharmaceutical Law.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Zhu Baoxia: "Small Town Model for </F>
Immunizing Children"] 
  [Text] The small town of Zhaohegou in Hebei has turned 
into a national model for vaccinating children against epidemic 
diseases through its immunization insurance effort, now in its 
10th year. 
  For several years, the town outside Sanhe City has not 
reported a single epidemic disease in its 2,800 children under 7. 
  It has one township hospital and 20 village clinics to 
support a population of 19,000. 
  In 1984 the town adopted a contracted responsibility system 
for preventive health care, a policy to supervise and urge 
village doctors to rededicate their efforts. 
  Each child is registered immediately after birth to ensure 
that no one misses the vaccinations. 
  Every household is charged 7 yuan ($0.8) a year for 
immunization insurance. If an insured child gets an epidemic 
disease, the village clinic will be fined and is responsible for 
paying all medical fees. 
  The system has won over the town farmers. 
  "Seven yuan a month [as published] is not too much and most 
important we don't have to worry about our child's health," said 
Zhao Yuhua, 30, the mother of a 2-year-old girl in Zhaotuzhuang 
Village. 
  The town has attracted attention from the central government 
and some international organizations. 
  Representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO) and 
the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) called for the rest 
of China and other developing nations to follow Zhaohegou's lead 
by immunizing their children. 
  "Wiping out children's epidemic diseases like polio in China 
would be a great contribution toward the Asian and Western 
Pacific Region and the whole world as well," said Dr R.W.K. Gee 
of WHO. 
  State Councilor Peng Peiyun and Public Health Minister Chen 
Minzhang also want to spread the small town's success to other 
rural areas, where about 900 million Chinese live. Immunizing 
these areas is the critical portion of the national immunization 
programme. 
  If all the rural areas succeed like Zhaohegou, Peng said, 
China could wipe out polio next year. 
  Peng and Chen visited the town on Monday. 
  The ministry said its expanded immunization programme has 
dramatically reduced incidence and death rates of children's 
epidemic diseases by 89.93 and 88.78 percent. 
  Last year just 653 polio cases were reported, the lowest 
figure in Chinese history. 
  Measles cases dropped from more than 1 million in 1981 to 
last year's 117,800, and the incidence of whooping cough and 
diphtheria also dropped by 98.2 and 98.5 percent respectively. 
  But experts warned that each year there are 20 million 
newborns, requiring an astronomical number of vaccinations. 
Methods must be worked out to guarantee that all those children 
are immunized on time. 
  The ministry wants rural areas given top priority, and 
extensive publicity campaigns should be launched to educate 
farmers about disease prevention.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (CNS)--According to the latest 
information from the Mainland authorities, China now has nearly 
300 million smokers, 30 million of them female. The annual 
consumption of over 150 billion cigarettes accounts for 30 
percent of the world's total. 
  Because many of them are closet smokers, the actual number 
of 
the female smokers may be much bigger. According to surveys, 33 
percent of female smokers said they smoked as a way of asserting 
their equality with men while 40 percent of them said they 
smoked because of the influence of other smokers. A middle 
school class in Beijing saw 32 percent of its students smoking 
because of fun. Other reasons for the bad habit by women 
include the failures in love, novelty-seeking and a way to kill 
time. 
  Women smoking in recent years has not only become a problem 
harmful to health but also an increasingly serious social 
problem, creating new obstacles for the anti-smoking campaign in 
the country.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- At a time when China 
is beset by a fast unemployment growth, the country's booming 
collective sector is considered by experts to be the best 
channel for the promotion of employment. 
  According to official forecasts, the workforce employed in 
China's collectively-owned enterprises will reach 65 million by 
the turn of this century. They will then make up 33 percent of 
all people employed, compared with 23 percent now. 
  In the last fifteen years, since the start of the 
reform-and-opening up policy, one third of the country's 100 
million newly-employed urban workforce have found jobs in the 
collective sector. 
  More significantly, in the township and village-run 
enterprises, over 90 percent of the 110 million working staff 
have been employed in the collective sector. 
  "It is an inevitable tendency to resort to the 
non-state-owned sector to promote employment," said Zhang 
Xiaojian, head of the Employment Department of the Labor 
Ministry, in an interview with XINHUA here today. 
  Zhang noted that the state-owned enterprises are at present 
weak in their ability to absorb workers, due to the ongoing 
transformation of these enterprises' whole set-up. 
  Now the national unemployment rate stands at 2.6 percent, he 
said, adding that he expects the number of unemployed to reach 5 
million by the end of this year. 
  "The best way to curb the jobless growth is to give full 
play 
to the collective sector," said Zhang, the leading official 
charged with resolving China's unemployment problem. 
  He explained that the collective enterprises have the 
advantages of public ownership and the adaptability to the 
market economy. There is huge employment potential hidden in the 
collective sector, he said. 
  Experts expect that the proportion of the employed 
population 
in the state-owned enterprises will drop from 70 percent to 55 
percent by the year 2000, to the tune of 110 million people. 
  While in the collective and other non-state sector, the 
employed population will double to 90 million, with the 
proportion in the state's total employed figure rising from 30 
to 45 percent.

  [Text] Tianjin, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Over 40 overseas 
insurance companies had opened representative offices in China 
by the end of February this year, according to a spokesman for 
the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC). 
  He added that a U.S. company has been given permission to 
open a hard-currency insurance business in China. 
  Addressing the annual conference on overseas insurance 
business, which opened here this week, the deputy general 
manager of the picc's international department said his company 
made 732 million U.S. dollars-worth of premiums last year, an 
increase of 29.8 percent over the previous year, and paid out 
356 million U.S. dollars-worth in compensation, accounting for 
48.76 percent of the total premiums. 
  He told the conference that the PICC's overseas business now 
ranges from general insurance to some high-risk areas such as 
aeronautics, oil exploitation and construction of nuclear power 
stations. 
  He said all the fields available in the international market 
are covered by the PICC, among which property insurance for 
foreign-funded enterprises and insurance for short-term credit 
and the buyer's contract responsibility are the most popular. 
  So far, the PICC has established two regional companies in 
Hong Kong and Europe, respectively, and over 70 branches and 
offices worldwide.

<F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Airports Need Renovating To Fuel Industry </F>
Growth"] 
  [Text] Equipping airports with modern facilities is a 
priority for China's booming airline industry, said a senior 
aviation official. 
  Advanced airport equipment, know-how and management skills 
are needed to boost the sector's handling capacity, said Shen 
Yuankang, deputy head of the Civil Aviation Administration of 
China (CAAC), on Wednesday. 
  And this will provide foreign manufacturers with 
opportunities to enter China's rapidly growing market, he said. 
  Shen also announced that CAAC and China's Association for 
Science and Technology will host an international airport 
technology fair in Beijing from October 6-10. 
  "We want to improve aviation ground facilities by drawing 
from the experience of the international airline market and by 
absorbing advanced know-how and equipment," he said. 
  The fair, the first of its kind in China, has been warmly 
welcomed both at home and abroad. Germany has already set up a 
delegation to take part in the event. 
  China's aviation turnover is expected to grow 18 per cent by 
the turn of the century, double the estimated growth of the 
national economy. More than 50 airports have been built or 
renovated across the country over the past few years, but many 
still lack the necessary facilities, Shen said. 
  CAAC plans to renovate and expand the nation's three largest 
airports in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to satisfy the 
increased volume predicted for 2000. 
  At the same time, a dozen smaller airports will be upgraded 
and another 20 airports with a handling capacity of 100,000 
passengers will be provided with quality equipment. 
  The projects all require special vehicles, ground facilities 
and manufacturing technology. 
  Telecommunications, navigation, air traffic control and 
meteorological facilities will also get a major boost in a bid 
to improve safety standards and efficiency. 
  Between 1995 and 2000, the government will focus on these 
areas and routes as key points to completely or partially renew 
communications, navigation, radar and air traffic control 
facilities, while experimenting with the satellite orientation 
system.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- In the coming ten 
years China will construct more than 70 local railways, with a 
total length of over 7,000 km. 
  Xu Dakun, an official of the Local Railway Association of 
China, said here today that these projects, distributed over 12 
provinces, have already been listed in the Ninth Five-Year Plan 
(1996-2000) of various localities. 
  Xu said that by the end of 1993, China had 81 operating 
local 
railways in 17 provinces and autonomous regions, with a total 
length of over 4,800 km. 
  At present some 20 local railways are being constructed, 
with 
a length of more than 2,000 km. 
  China's local railways experienced a golden development time 
in the past ten years, with over 2,460 km of track laid. The 
total investment during this period was nearly 4.6 billion yuan, 
of which more than 4.1 billion yuan was raised by the local 
governments, while the Ministry of Railways put in 440 million 
yuan. 
  China's local railways are differentiated from state-run 
railways by the characteristics that the construction cost is 
mainly raised by local governments, and the local governments 
have partial or complete management rights. Local railways have 
now become an organic part of China's transport network. 
  To ease the present strained condition of railway transport, 
the Chinese Government has in recent years drafted a series of 
significant policies to promote railway development, which 
include preferential policies encouraging local governments to 
construct railways with self-raised funds. 
  In addition, the Chinese Government also encourages local 
governments to construct railways with overseas funds. So far 
the world bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Japanese 
Government and Taiwan have provided money for local railway 
construction. 
  Xu revealed that six new local railways are prepared to 
introduce overseas construction funds. 
  He said that since the founding of New China in 1949, 
China's 
railways have developed from 22,000 km to more than 54,000 km, 
of which 41 lines, or over 3,100 km, have been constructed by 
local governments and transferred to the state. Some of them 
have now become an important part of the national railway 
network. 
  By the year 2000, China's operating railways will exceed 
8,000 km, with a freight transport volume of 100 million tons, 
Xu added.

  [Text] Chongqing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- A forum was 
recently held in Chongqing to tackle navigation problems during 
the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on the Chang Jiang 
River. 
  Nearly 30 experts in hydropower and navigation took part in 
the forum, sponsored by the office of the Three Gorges project 
of the State Council and the Ministry of Communications. 
  Experts from the South-West Marine Transport Institute 
reported their latest research on the navigation channel, 
silting and other issues that have to be solved during the 
17-year construction of the dam. 
  The institute suggests that instead of building a temporary 
ship lock and a ship lift, vessels could pass through a channel 
during the construction. 
  The institute has since early 1992 been doing lab research.

<F P=106> [Article by Li Shiyi (2621 0013 5030): "Why It Is Necessary </F>
To Pay Special Attention to Agriculture and Rural Stability"] 
  [Text] Shortly after the conclusion of the annual National 
People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, the CPC Central Committee and the State 
Council invited party and government leaders of various 
provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to a forum to 
discuss agricultural production and rural work. The forum made 
it clear from the beginning that stabilizing agriculture and 
rural areas is viewed as a basic condition for the smooth 
implementation of various major reform measures; for the 
sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national 
economy; and for creating a good economic environment and a 
stable social environment. 
<H5>  Agriculture and Rural Areas Affect Overall Situation </H5>
  Five months ago, in October 1993, the central leadership 
convened a rural work meeting and announced 12 major policies, 
which were widely welcomed by millions of peasants and 
grass-roots cadres. The meeting played an important role in 
stabilizing agriculture and rural areas. But problems in 
agriculture were not totally solved. Shortly after the important 
meeting, something happened: Prices of grain and oil increased 
in the south, and the tendency spread from the south to the 
north and to the whole country. Increases in grain and oil 
prices triggered increases in the price of foodstuffs, 
vegetables, daily necessities, services, and industrial goods, 
thus, causing a sense of uneasiness among urban and rural 
residents. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council 
detected the situation promptly and adopted decisive measures. 
Various localities swiftly transferred grain and oil to check 
rising prices, quickly stabilizing the situation and ushering in 
a safe and sound Spring Festival. 
  This increase in grain and oil prices occurred after a 
bumper 
harvest. Outsiders were puzzled, and insiders viewed it as an 
alarm. 
  So what is the warning given by the alarm? The warning, in 
the final analysis, is that we should never "despise 
agriculture." 
  The CPC Central Committee attaches great importance to 
agriculture and stability in the rural areas. In early March, a 
national meeting on development and helping the poor was 
convened in Beijing, and General Secretary Jiang Zemin delivered 
a speech. When he came to the importance of agriculture, he 
frankly said that grain must maintain three kinds of stability 
and two kinds of balance: stability of farmland under grain, 
stability of output, and stability of stock, and a balance of 
total quantity and balance among the regions. 
  General Secretary Jiang stressed: Grain is a special 
commodity which has a bearing on the national economy and the 
people's livelihood, as well as being a strategic material which 
affects social stability. Party committees and governments of 
various levels must always pay close attention to grain, which 
is a big issue that has a bearing on the overall situation. His 
speech revealed the importance attached by the party and the 
country to stabilizing the overall situation, while stable grain 
production and supplies are a guarantee for stabilizing the 
overall situation. This is a long way from just talking 
generally about the status and role of grain. 
  Before this, at the end of January, the central leadership 
held a national work meeting on the "shopping basket" and grain 
and oil to unify understanding, sum up lessons and experiences, 
and adopt measures to increase supplies of farm and sideline 
products to ensure market supplies and price stability. 
  At present, the central leadership has convened a work 
meeting on rural areas once again, as well as many other 
meetings to repeatedly stress the stability of agriculture and 
the rural areas. Some people ask: Is there a problem in this 
area? But it does not seem so, for the overall economic 
situation is quite good! 
  The CPC Central Committee and the State Council are 
displaying great foresight and are proceeding from the overall 
situation; they see a big problem in economic operations. 
<H5>  Regarding Industry as Superior to Agriculture Is Indeed a </H5>
Cause for Worry 
  It is true that we have had bumper harvests over the past 
several years. Last year was another year of bumper harvests, a 
year in which, except for cotton and sugar, output of grain, 
oil, meat, eggs, and aquatic products all increased. The annual 
grain output exceeded 900 billion jin, a historical record. The 
bumper harvests and economic prosperity in rural areas have 
created conducive conditions for the sustained development of 
the whole national economy, and this is visible to all. 
  Why must we worry about such good conditions? 
  Is it because of the panic buying of grain and oil and price 
increases last winter? But they have subsided since then! 
  Outsiders have calmed down, but insiders have not been able 
to do so. There are indeed some agricultural production 
problems in our country's rural areas that cannot be neglected, 
and among them some are very acute: First, paddy rice output in 
the south has decreased; second, cotton output in the north 
keeps dropping; and third, peasants' incomes are increasing 
slowly while food prices are increasing rather rapidly. 
  Through the phenomenon of decreasing grain and cotton 
output, we may see that new conditions and new problems have 
arisen in agricultural production, the rural economy, and social 
development, and if they are not solved promptly, they could 
affect the overall situation. Farmland under grain and cotton 
in some provinces and regions has decreased, and output has 
dropped. Growing grain is not as good as running industry and 
commerce, economic returns are low, peasants' enthusiasm for 
growing grain and cotton has decreased, and farmland has become 
idle. In particular, some developed regions in the south have 
developed their economies, but their grain output has dropped, 
and people in some "lands of plenty" have no rice to eat. The 
economic pattern where historically "grain is transferred from 
the south to the north" is being replaced by a pattern where 
"grain is transferred from the north to the south." 
  Heaven is not to blame for shrinking cotton production in 
the 
north and grain in the south: it is a problem caused by humans. 
And this human problem is manifested mainly by "regarding 
industry as superior to agriculture" in many localities. "It 
takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet 
deep." They offer lip service when they say they attach 
importance to agriculture; they take action when they say they 
attach importance to industry and commerce. Good farmland has 
been used to build factories or has been closed for 
"development." The eating away of agricultural resources, 
inadequate agricultural inputs, and so on are not individual 
phenomena. We may say that looking down on agriculture has 
already become a very acute and general phenomenon in current 
social and economic life. 
  A certain viewpoint has become very popular in many 
economically developed regions, that is, in the market economy, 
so long as they become rich first and have money in their hands, 
they do not have to worry about a lack of grain. At a national 
grain trading fair last year, a majority of the grain was bought 
and taken away by provinces in the south, and 80 percent of the 
grain was corn. People in the south mainly eat rice, and corn 
can only serve as feed when they buy it and bring it back and 
cannot alleviate the shortage of badly needed "cooking rice." 
This is a lesson for people who dream about "transferring grain 
from the north to the south" and relying on others to grow grain 
for them. 
  There are also some people who think that if the domestic 
market is unreliable, we can rely on the international market, 
and that so long as we have hard currency in our hands, we do 
not have to worry about having nowhere to buy grain. Experts 
warn that this is not a way out either. Last year, rice exports 
worldwide were about 28 billion jin, which is 80 percent of the 
annual rice output of Jiangsu Province. Can this small quantity 
of rice meet the urgent needs of a big country such as China? 
Also, we have to consider that grain is an international 
strategic material and relying on foreign countries means being 
controlled by others. 
  Grain is a problem which must be solved by our own efforts! 
<H5>  One Magic Weapon To Stabilize Prices </H5>
  Decreasing cotton output in the north and grain output in 
the 
south have taken place against a background of consistently high 
inflation, and the two phenomena have a mutual cause and results 
and intensify each other. This situation once again reminds the 
people of the country that agriculture is the basis of the 
national economy, that stability in the rural areas is the basis 
of the stability of society in the whole country, and that the 
status of agriculture, the rural areas, and the peasants has a 
bearing on the national economy, the people's livelihood, and 
the stability of the overall situation. 
  This year is a crucial year of reform, and both reform and 
development need a more relaxed environment. But the price 
index has stayed at a relatively high level for two consecutive 
years and this is not a relaxed environment. In light of this 
situation, Premier Li Peng made a speech at the national work 
meeting on the "shopping basket" and grain and oil, expressing 
the party and government's concern. Premier Li Peng said that 
large price increases are not good for either reform or 
development. Maintaining social stability is a prerequisite for 
deepening reform and promoting development, whereas properly 
doing "shopping basket" work and grain, cotton, and oil work is 
of great significance to maintaining social stability. This 
year is a year in which our country's economic system reform 
will take an important step forward. Smoothly carrying out the 
reform requires social stability and stability in the minds of 
the people. Big price increases will disturb the people's minds 
and cause social instability, affect the smooth process of 
reform, and have an adverse impact on the overall development 
situation of the national economy. Therefore, controlling 
inflation has become an important duty for the government this 
year and has been written into the Government Work Report. 
  How can inflation be controlled? Economists think that 
first, we must strictly control the scale of investment in fixed 
assets, and second, implement tight financial and monetary 
policies. These two measures have already been implemented, but 
it will not be easy to control this year's price index within 10 
percent. 
  Is there any other good measure. Yes. One good measure is 
to steadily develop agriculture and increase supplies of farm 
products. At the end of the 1970's, we began reform in the rural 
areas; as a result, agricultural output increased year after 
year, rural and urban markets were extremely busy, and reform in 
the urban areas became imminent. In the second half of 1989, in 
order to curb inflation, the national economy entered a 
three-year period of rectification and improvement; because of 
bumper harvests in consecutive years, the sustained development 
of the rural economy was possible, and the national economy then 
changed to a pattern of rapid growth, with the growth rate 
exceeding 13 percent for two consecutive years. 
  Historical experience shows that in a populous country as 
big 
as ours, the supply of farm products always has a bearing on the 
overall situation. For example, 70 percent of the light 
industrial products in our country need farm products as raw 
materials. When there is a shortage in the supply of farm 
products, and thus a rapid increase in their prices, this 
triggers inflation. Therefore, to stabilize prices in the 
market, we must proceed from grasping the supply of farm 
products. A majority of people in our country's rural and urban 
areas have relatively low incomes, and they spend most of their 
money on daily consumer goods. Prices of grain, oil, and 
foodstuffs directly affect their lives. Therefore, grasping the 
"rice bag" and "shopping basket" are effective measures to check 
inflation. When there is an abundant supply of farm products, 
people feel at ease, and the country is then peaceful.

Economics Department, edited by Lu Yang (6424 7122): "Three 
Stages of China's Reform of Prices of Agricultural Products"] 
  [Text] I. First Step in Agricultural Products Price 
Reform Is To Reform Their Formation Mechanism and Change From 
Setting Prices By Administration to the Market Price System 
  The success of microeconomic structural reform in China's 
rural areas greatly promotes them in changing from the 
self-sufficient and semi-self-sufficient economy to the 
commodity economy and the dominant role of market mechanism over 
the behavior of contractors is increasingly strengthened. The 
peasants are paying increased attention to weighing and 
comparing the high and low amounts of interests. With such a 
background, the growth in the market for agricultural products 
and the improvement of their market mechanism will inevitably 
become principal contradictions which must be overcome. 
  The microeconomic structural reform in China's rural areas 
has enabled the peasants to obtain the right of operation and 
use of land that belongs to the collective but it takes as 
prerequisites the identity of land ownership by the collective 
and the guarantee of land ownership in achieving economically 
residual recourse; moreover, it must also identify itself with 
the governmental privilege of compulsory fixed quota purchases 
of agricultural products at low cost. Under such an economic 
operational mechanism, the peasant families cannot always accept 
regulation by market price signals but must also accept, on many 
occasions, regulation by quantity signals transmitted by the 
government to the lower levels. This makes the reform of the 
traditional purchasing and marketing system and pricing system 
for agricultural products the central link in building a normal 
socialist market economy system and in improving the market 
mechanism. 
  The agricultural products price reform carried out by China 
for more than 10 years was aimed at reforming the pricing 
system, i.e., changing the pricing structure, which was 
originally seriously twisted, into a rational pricing structure 
which truly reflects values and supply and demand relations and 
to build price parity and price difference relations which have 
and economic basis, so that various trades and industries can 
get more or less the same level of profit rate from funds. On 
the other hand, it was also aimed at reforming the pricing 
formation mechanism, achieving the transition from setting 
prices by administration to a market price system, and letting 
prices give play to their functions under an open, unified, and 
competitive market system. In reforms in these two aspects, the 
reform of the latter aspect is the more important and essential. 
Only by reforming the price formation mechanism, and by letting 
prices build up by themselves in market exchanges, can prices 
truly reflect the extent of deficiency of resources and the 
market supply and demand relations, to make relative price 
changes beneficial to the rationalization of the pricing 
structure. 
  The basic functions of prices are mainly manifested in two 
respects, resources allocation and exchanges. Under the state 
monopoly for purchasing and marketing agricultural products and 
the old microeconomic organization, compulsory purchase (or 
monopoly imposed purchase) added the functions of regulating 
income and distribution into the prices of agricultural 
products, which mixed up the functions of income and 
distribution with those of exchanges. The functions of resources 
allocation were completely replaced by mandatory plans, which 
led to the twisting of price functions and seriously inhibited 
the growth of the agricultural products market. The starting 
point for price setting and price regulation of agricultural 
products by administration lay in carrying out the functions of 
income and distribution and in stimulating the initiatives of 
the producers of agricultural products by raising their 
purchasing prices which had remained low over a long period of 
time. When purchasing prices were raised and selling prices 
remained unchanged, financial burdens increased. Price 
subsidies which the state spent on domestic purchases and sales 
of agricultural products and on the purchases and sales of 
imported products rose from 6.995 billion yuan in 1978 to 36.262 
billion yuan in 1984, an annual average progressive increase of 
31.5 percent, greatly exceeding the rate of annual progressive 
increase of 4.6 percent in total revenue during this period. 
The proportion of revenue it accounted for also rose from 6.24 
percent in 1978 to 24.8 percent in 1984. The accumulative total 
spent on these subsidies in six years reached 167.439 billion 
yuan, equivalent to 24.3 percent of the revenue during the 
corresponding period. It was inevitable that it would bring 
about a serious imbalance between revenue and expenditure. In 
the traditional purchases and sales system for agricultural 
products, which was linked with prices regulation by 
administration, there were no equal market relations between 
purchases and sales. Because of low prices, purchases had 
partly the nature of paying taxes and, because of low prices, 
sales had partly the nature of welfare. Administrative price 
regulations linking income and distribution with product 
exchanges could only acquire supply prosperity by increases in 
hidden subsidies without fundamentally solving the problem of 
the price formation mechanism. 
  Practical experience in China's rural reforms shows that 
certain conditions are required to completely restore the 
resources allocation and exchange functions which prices should 
have, enable the product market to grow fully, and to finally 
achieve the transformation from the system of setting prices by 
the state to the market price system. These functions require 
that both exchanging parties should be built on the basis of 
voluntariness, mutual benefit, and true equality. The income 
and distribution functions embodied in such prices would be 
separate from exchange functions. On that basis, the functions 
of resources allocation by prices can be truly brought into play 
by the producers' reorientation of production and promotion of 
the flow of productive factors. 
  After the mid-1980's, China released, by stages and in 
groups, the purchases and sales as well as the prices of 
agricultural products, thus bringing essential changes in the 
generating mechanism for agricultural products prices. More 
than 10 years have elapsed since the first step in China's 
agricultural prices reform which started in 1979 and has lasted 
up till now and the guiding position of market prices in the 
sphere of agricultural products has been basically established, 
with market mechanism playing a dominant role in price formation. 
<H5>  II. The Second Step in Agricultural Products Prices Reform </H5>
Is To Achieve Merchandization and Marketization of the 
Productive Factors 
  Practical experience tells us that: To enable the peasants 
to achieve the goal of increasing income through increased 
production, we must release the purchases and sales, as well as 
the prices of agricultural products, and let supply and demand, 
production, and sales meet face to face, so that the peasants 
can produce more products with a large market demand and whose 
prices are expected to rise according to the information of 
changes in social demand structure. However, the readjustment 
of rural industries or product mix with the market as guidance 
presupposes changes in factor structure. It thus requires that 
various productive factors should be allowed to flow freely 
among various peasant households and, therefore a flexible and 
developed factor market is the basic guarantee for the 
industries or product mix to make rapid readjustment according 
to market demand. 
  The essence of the reform of factor prices lies in a 
developed factor market. Viewed from the angle of economic 
development, this is more important than a developed product 
market because: 1) without resources allocation of the factor 
market, only the relative comparative superiority of the 
allocation subject, that is, each individual peasant household 
itself can be brought into play but the relative comparative 
superiority among peasant households and between various areas 
cannot be used, nor can the factor compensation rate be raised 
with the aid of factor flow. The extent of optimization of such 
resources allocation mechanism is extremely limited; 2) By 
re-composition of land, labor, funds, and technology between 
areas, a developed factor market can help the economy of 
developed areas to promote the economic development of backward 
areas, thus gradually minimizing the gap in the economic 
development level between areas. 
  The purchases and sales, as well as the agricultural product 
prices, in China at present have been basically released and the 
agricultural products market has developed on a preliminary 
basis. However, the market prices of labor, funds, land, and 
other factors are still far from being built up and, therefore, 
greatly restrict the market from bringing its role of resources 
allocation into full play. This is an extremely important 
reason why the second stage reform (reform of the circulation 
system and the industrial structure) in China's rural areas, 
which started in 1985, could not achieve a fundamental essential 
breakthrough. It should be fully realized that the difficulties 
and risks in agricultural factors price reform are far greater 
than those in agricultural products price reforms. First, this 
reform is incompatible with traditional theories and concepts. 
If the market and prices of agricultural products remain 
incompatible with traditional theories and concepts, then the 
market and prices of agricultural productive factors (such as 
funds, labor, land, etc.) will seriously deviate from the 
standards and criteria of traditional theories and concepts. 
Secondly, before China's economic structural reform, there was 
neither a market nor prices of agricultural productive factors. 
Therefore, after economic structural reform in the rural areas, 
the growth of the market for agricultural productive factors was 
extremely slow, and the phenomena of the absence of their 
prices, were quite serious, not to mention the possibility of 
building up their normal supply and demand relations. 
  The allocation of agricultural productive factors is 
generally first expressed in the allocation of funds. The 
readjustment of the agricultural production structure, in the 
final analysis, is the readjustment of the structure of funds. 
This requires opening up the fund market to meet the needs of 
the merchandization and marketization of the rural economy. 
Essentially speaking, it is aimed at developing various kinds 
of financial activities according to the requirements of the law 
of market economy. 
  Besides relying on its own slow accumulation of funds, 
China's agriculture also relies on indirect merging of funds as 
its major source. Unitary banking assets and shortage of bank 
funds inevitably require breaking the unitary finance channel 
and building many kinds of optional credit forms and finance 
channels to solve the problems of fund shortages for production 
and construction. 
  To develop fund markets in the rural areas, we should attach 
importance to developing nonsystematized banking, that is, 
borrowing among the people. However, its limitations are 
enormous and requires further developing transregional 
systematized banking. Fund prices are the outcome of the 
marketization of funds. The development of fund market will 
inevitably be followed by corresponding reforms in fund prices, 
that is, in the interest rate system. China's traditional 
interest rate system was the outcome of the planned economy and 
its major problem was to inhibit, or even repel, the 
marketization of fund prices, making the price of funds as 
deficient resources excessively low. This requires changing the 
current interest rate system, readjusting the irrational 
interest rate structure, and gradually building a floating 
interest rate system with the central bank's loan interest rates 
as hte standards, to bring into play the regulatory role of the 
interest rate lever over the supply and demand of funds. Once 
the conditions are ripe for building the market economy system, 
interest rates will then immediately follow up and become 
marketized and compete freely. 
  China's agricultural labor factor is quite abundant and in 
the rural areas there is no such thing as a labor employment 
system, with state responsibility and overall assignment as in 
cities, which is favorable to promoting the building of rural 
labor market and reducing the difficulty in reform of prices of 
rural labor. Under the circumstances of the unlimited supply of 
labor in China's rural areas at present, labor market and the 
prices of labor related to it can only grow gradually in the 
course of economic development. The method is to readjust the 
rural employment structure and increase the number of jobs in 
the course of speeding up rural industrialization and promoting 
urbanization. When the market economy in the rural areas 
develops, it will inevitably open up new economic spheres, 
provide ever-developing employment opportunities, and create 
conditions for the building of labor market prices. 
  The building of a land market in China's rural areas was a 
fairly difficult process. The initial growth started from the 
contract- based land management responsibility system carried 
out in the late 1970's and early 1980's. For the nearly 30 
years before that, because land ownership and the right of 
operation of land were highly centralized, a land market had 
always been strictly prohibited by the government. However, 
after land was operated on a contract basis by peasant 
households, land transfer and subcontracting exchanges between 
peasant households increased daily. As regards government 
policies, in 1984 it was clearly put forward that it was 
necessary to encourage the transfer and concentration of 
farmland in good farming hands; in 1985 peasant households were 
allowed to transfer and subcontract land with pay and a 
contract- based system of land with pay was encouraged; in 1987 
subcontracting of land in legal forms was allowed; and in 1988 
legal provisions on prohibiting buying and selling, leasing, or 
transferring land were revised by the government. These were 
favorable to the building and growth of the rural land market 
and land prices. 
  The major problems hindering the growth of China's land 
market and land prices at present are: 1) in the great majority 
of areas, land contracts are still based on low compensation or 
even gratis. In economically developed areas, there is still the 
situation wherein subsidies are given to the peasants for 
growing grain and sugar cane instead of putting into effect the 
use of land for payment. Land ceases to be a commodity and 
actually becomes pure welfare with no value at all; 2) land has 
not yet truly become a commodity and is still prohibited by law 
from entering the circulation market. In particular, it is 
still impossible for land ownership to be bought and sold 
through the market and to flow rationally. For example, in 
requisitioning collective land for use, the state generally 
compensates for agricultural loss alone without recognizing that 
land has value. However, after land requisition, the unit that 
uses the land changes hands and sells it, reaping staggering 
profits from the real estate operation and making the value of 
collective land flow in large amounts into the unit engaged in 
real estate operation. In light of the abovementioned problems, 
it is necessary to recognize, in theory and practice and even in 
law, that land is a commodity (a special kind of commodity), and 
that collective land should be allowed to enter the market to be 
bought, sold, transferred, mortgaged, and leased under 
leadership and in a planned way under strict supervision and 
management by various levels of state land departments and 
within the scope of the use and plan for land. Of course, to 
prevent privatization of land, it must be clearly stipulated 
that the buying, selling, and transferral of land ownership can 
only be conducted between units of public ownership. As for 
leasing, buying, and selling the rights to use land within a 
given period of time, these should not be subject to this kind 
of restriction. 
  Whether land market operations are normal or not, the key 
lies in the rationality of land prices. If land prices can 
accurately reflect the supply and demand situation for land, 
they will stimulate and guide the flow and use of land in 
conformity with demand. No particular system has yet been set 
up as to how to decide the prices in China's rural land market 
at present; there is no standardization and scientific methods 
are lacking. Such a situation must be changed. Scientific 
price setting should be based on land appraisal and land market 
forecasts. The fixing of land prices should include land 
contract fees, transferral fees, and buying and selling prices. 
We should gradually accomplish regulated land prices and rent 
by the market competition mechanism and the transparency of 
market transactions should be improved. When a state unit 
requisitions collective land, both parties should discuss and 
negotiate a price according to the local market situation and 
must not adopt the method of requisition at low cost or without 
pay. With the development of the commodity economy and the 
secondary and tertiary industries in the rural areas, it is 
necessary to introduce a market competition mechanism gradually 
into the land contract-based system and recognize the 
merchandization and valuation of land, to gradually build up a 
land resources allocation system regulated by the market 
mechanism. 
<H5>  III. The Third Step in Agricultural Products Price Reform </H5>
Will Be To Build a Mechanism Which Fits in With the Requirements 
of the Development of Market Economy and Avoids the Risks of 
Price Fluctuation 
  At present, transactions for most agricultural products are 
made in a primitive markets of a primary nature and those done 
in wholesale markets are extremely limited. Due to the lack of 
a unified market system, the markets which have been built are 
not just separate in space, the problems of regional blockades 
and departmental monopolies have not yet been overcome, let 
alone the possibility of building a mechanism for macroeconomic 
regulation and control which effectively avoids the risks of 
price fluctuation. Under such an undeveloped and constrained 
market system, when there are crop failures or when prices are 
expected to rise, individual, collective, or state-run 
businesses will all try to force up prices and rush to make 
purchases; conversely, there will be less purchases or no 
purchases. There is now difficulty in selling, then in buying; 
sometimes there appears to be a steep fall in market prices, 
sometimes soaring prices appear and such a posture is often 
expressed in a relationship of cause and effect emerging 
alternately. The extent ofthe risks in circulation and prices 
of agricultural products is extremely high, causing the 
producers and consumers of agricultural products to suffer 
serious losses. What requires pointing out especially is that, 
in the industrial replacement of the national economy, 
agriculture belongs to an industry with a weak nature and bears 
the characteristics of low price elasticity in supply, low 
income, and low price elasticity in demand, making the problem 
extremely conspicuous. 
  In view of the above, the building a unified domestic market 
for agricultural products on the basis of full market 
development is needed That is, a market in which agricultural 
products can flow freely on a nationwide basis and in which the 
state can intervene by means of macroeconomic regulation and 
control, thus placing the trade of major agricultural products 
throughout China under government supervision, guidance, and 
control. In a modern market economy there are two main methods 
of avoiding the risks of price fluctuation: One is that the 
government bears a part or all of the price risks. For 
important agricultural products, the government carries out a 
price guarantee or a price support system. At present, to 
prevent agricultural products producers from suffering huge 
economic losses due to steep falls in price, and to prevent 
having a negative impact on the national economy, it is a basic 
policy in most countries to carry out a general price protection 
policy or price support policy for purchasing important 
agricultural products. 
  The grain purchase and price policy implemented by the 
Chinese Government in 1990 meant that, in essence, the 
government bore all the risks in grain prices. The grain 
protection prices or support prices formulated by the state that 
year was generally 20 percent higher than market prices. Under 
such circumstances, the grain peasants vied with each other to 
sell grain to the state and were unwilling to sell it through 
the grain trade market, thus abruptly depressing grain market 
transactions. The result was that the problem whereby the 
peasants had difficulty selling grain could in no way be 
fundamentally overcome due to the extremely limited amount of 
funds, bad circulation facilities, and insufficient storage 
capacity on the part of the state. The government then worked 
out guide or target prices and price risks (minor risks), within 
a certain range, were borne by the producers and operators of 
agricultural products, and price risks (major risks) beyond the 
ceiling and lower limit of guide or target prices were borne by 
the government. Whether or not the government bears all or a 
part of the abovementioned risks in the prices of agricultural 
products, it requires the setting up of equalization funds at 
the levels of the central authorities and provinces 
(municipalities), to regulate the market and to play the role of 
storage ponds. It should be clearly pointed out that such 
regulation comes under government behavior and the greater part 
of the equalization funds should be included in the central and 
provincial financial budgets. Of course, the income built up by 
using the equalization funds in the course of buying and selling 
agricultural products and in curbing market prices should also 
serve as supplementary sources of equalization funds. 
  It is obvious from the above that it is impractical and 
impossible for the Chinese Government to bear all the price 
risks of agricultural products because government financial 
resources in China up to the present stage have always been 
quite tense. Moreover, such a way of doing things would be 
unfavorable to the growth and maturity of the market economy in 
China. Therefore, we should have our eyes on another method to 
reform the mechanism for avoiding the risk of price fluctuations 
in agricultural products, i.e., with the aid of self-regulation, 
compensation, and balance functions peculiar to the market 
economy, we should break down and shift the price risks of 
agricultural products and let them be borne by risk investors. 
Such a method meets the objective requirements for the 
development of market economy and is an intrinsic mechanism and 
function which is developing and improving in the modern market 
economy. Its role is realized by a modern futures market. 
  The so-called modern futures market refers to one in which 
special transactions of standardized futures contracts are made 
and which has the special functions of index-linked arbitrage 
futures and of avoiding the risks of price fluctuation. The 
futures and spot markets complement each other and together 
constitute a complete modern market system. A modern futures 
market is an indispensable part of a modern market economy and 
has the following two most basic and important functions: 
  The first function is that a modern futures market can avoid 
the risks of price fluctuation. That is, the risks of price 
fluctuation which appear on the spot market can be effectively 
broken down and transferred by index-linked arbitrage futures 
onto the futures market. The forms of futures transactions for 
agricultural products are many and varied but can be divided 
into two types according to the purpose of the transactions: 
One is a transaction involving index-linked arbitrage futures 
with the purpose of shifting the price risks of agricultural 
products; the other is a speculative transaction with the 
purpose of making profits. Under such circumstances, the 
bearers of price fluctuation of agricultural products are the 
investors seeking risk profits or risk income on the futures 
market and it is unnecessary for the production operators and 
consumers of agricultural products to pay the price. For those 
engaged in index-linked arbitage futures, it is for the purpose 
of avoiding the risks of prices of agricultural products by 
giving up possible maximum profits. As for the risk investors, 
they dare to bear the greatest risks for the purpose of possibly 
gaining the greatest profits. 
  The second function is that a modern futures market can 
provide quite correct and stable price signals, which is 
favorable to reducing blindness in action and the short-term 
nature of resources allocation. As the futures market of 
agricultural products makes long-term transactions, the supply 
and demand relations they reflect are also long-term and the 
prices built up are relatively stable. Moreover, the building of 
futures prices of agricultural products is the outcome of full 
competition among the numerous market participants, representing 
the expectations of all market participants for future prices 
and can therefore, quite correctly, reflect the supply and 
demand relations of the market in the future. Thus, the prices 
of futures transactions of agricultural products are not only of 
a stronger expected nature than spot transaction prices but also 
of a stronger expected nature than forward contract transaction 
prices. On this basis, the rationality of decisionmaking in 
production and operation by producers and operators of 
agricultural products can also be strengthened. This explains 
why the futures market and futures prices of agricultural 
products are the highest forms of operation of market mechanism 
of agricultural products. It thus decides that the third step 
of the reform of China's agricultural prices should be one of 
building a mechanism which avoids the risks of price fluctuation 
of agricultural products. It should be carried out around the 
center of building and developing a socialist futures market, to 
make full use of and bring into full play the intrinsic 
self-regulation and balance functions of the market economy 
itself and to enable price signals to play their proper role to 
the maximum in agricultural resources allocation.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Song Ning: "Agriculture Needs Overseas </F>
Cash"] 
  [Text] Agricultural technology is the most favoured form 
of overseas investment sought by the government. 
  Technology is required for high yield seeds, animal feed, 
low-poison pesticides, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery, 
said Lin Kun, deputy director general of the Foreign Investment 
Administration under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic 
Co-operation. 
  Lin revealed the government's list of overseas investment 
priorities on Tuesday. 
  Other areas which need foreign cash include infrastructure, 
high technology development, export production, and know-how to 
recycle industrial waste. 
  So far, China has approved 186,062 foreign-funded 
enterprises, with an accumulated contractual investment of 
$241.5 billion. The actual foreign investment amounted to $67.2 
billion since 1978, Lin said. 
  In the first three months of this year, overseas investors 
pledged $19.6 billion in 11,834 projects. And more than $5.4 
billion flooded into the country during this period. 
  Foreign companies have been keen to enter the vast and 
rapidly developing Chinese market. 
  And numerous multinationals have made long-term investment 
plans in China. They include General Electric, American 
Telephone and Telegraph Corporation and Ford of the United 
States; Northern Telecom of Canada; Matsushita, Nippon Electric 
Corporation, Mitsui and Company Limited, and C. Itoh of Japan; 
Citroen of France; Volkswagen and Siemens of Germany; Royal 
Dutch Shell of Britain; Philips of Holland; and Ciba-Geigy of 
Switzerland. 
  Eighty of the top 500 companies ranked by Fortune magazine, 
have invested in China. 
  "We will encourage foreign businessmen to invest in sectors 
like infrastructure, basic industries, technical renovation, and 
capital and technology-intensive industries," Lin said. 
  Special government approval is needed to invest in banking, 
insurance, securities, retail sales, foreign trade, audio-visual 
products, printing and publication, and air cargo service. 
  And overseas firms are barred from running enterprises which 
affect social security and national economic development, those 
that pollute the environment, as well as those which mine 
radioactive minerals. They are also prohibited from running 
posts and telecommunications services, radio and television 
stations, newspapers, and enterprises producing military goods. 
  "We encourage foreigners to invest in existing Chinese 
enterprises and produce goods for Chinese and foreign markets," 
Lin said. 
  "The vast Chinese market is open for foreign-funded 
enterprises provided they can balance their foreign exchange 
earnings and expenditure." 
  Besides agricultural technology, China also needs overseas 
funds for projects like energy, transport, and raw material 
production. 
  It will invite foreign firms to take part in the 
construction 
and management of power plants, highways, bridges, ports the 
development of coal products and coal mining equipment.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Gao Anming: "Experts Look to the Farm </F>
Future"] 
  [Text] Chinese agricultural experts predict a possible 
grain output decline this year unless the weather is extremely 
good. 
  The drop, however, would not greatly affect food supply. 
  But there is concern about the further damage it would do to 
farmers income levels, which have increasingly fallen behind 
those of their urban counterparts. 
  The disparity between rural and urban incomes will last at 
least another 10 years. 
  And experts at an economic Green Paper launched last 
Saturday 
urged authorities to increase investment in agriculture, improve 
the government-controlled marketing of farm products and abandon 
the existing household registration system that prevents labour 
flow. 
  The Green Paper, co-authored by the Institute of Rural 
Development of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the 
Division of Rural Society of State Statistics Bureau, reviews 
the country's agricultural performance over the past year and 
outlines a plan for this year. 
  Two dozen officials and experts from various government 
departments and research bodies exchanged views on agricultural 
conditions. Although they differed on specific issues, a 
general consensus was that the sector is confronting tougher 
challenges than ever before. 
  Luo Yousheng, head of the Policy and Law Division of the 
Ministry of Agriculture, said the summer grain harvest would 
probably be less than last year. 
  The acreage of winter wheat, which makes up one quarter of 
the year's grain harvest, is 600,000 hectares less than it was 
last year. 
  Worse, 27 percent of the sown area, or more than 6.7 million 
hectares, was damaged by the freezing winter. Rainy weather in 
the South, drought in the North and inadequate investment by 
farmers have all resulted in weak seedlings, Luo said. 
  Miao Jianping, director of the Research Centre of Rural 
Economy of the Agricultural Ministry, said 109 million hectares 
of cereals have been sown, 1.3 million hectares less than the 
ministry-set minimum. Alarm bells are starting to ring. 
  Farmers have planted 5.4 million hectares of cotton, a mild 
increase over last year but still substantially less than the 
government-planned 6 million hectares, Miao said. 
  And the country produced only 3.76 million tons of cotton 
last year, down 17 percent from the previous year, causing 
nationwide concern. 
  To ensure enough grain and cotton planting, local 
administrators have adopted a carrot-and-stick approach -- harsh 
administrative measures combined with economic incentives. 
  But, even so, Miao suspects output will still fall short of 
target. 
<H5>  Worries </H5>
  Wang Xiyu, vice-director of the Agricultural Division of the 
State Council Development and Research Centre, shared Miao's 
worries. He said administrative measures ran contrary to the 
demands of a market economy and went against the will of central 
government. 
  But at least the fall in grain yield will not prove too 
serious, according to most of the experts at the launch. 
  It should not affect food supply much. Although, they 
anticipated food price hikes because of entrepreneurial 
speculation and the inflationary pressures. 
  Rural industry, one of the country's most dynamic sectors, 
will continue its rapid growth, Miao said. Latest figures show 
enterprises at the township and village levels manufactured 474 
billion yuan ($54 billion) worth of products in the first 
quarter. An increase of 47 percent over the same period last 
year. 
  Miao said rural enterprises growth would slow to 20 percent 
from 30 percent by the end of the year due to reduced monetary 
supply. 
  Luo said rural firms had been burdened with heavy taxes 
since 
central government introduced its tax reforms at the beginning 
of the year. 
  The State coffers now take 33 percent of profits, which is 
more than was previously taken. The taxes are likely to block 
investment in farming and rural infrastructure . 
  Luo reckoned the reforms will cost rural businesses an extra 
45 billion yuan ($5.2 billion) and will send more and more firms 
into the red. Last year, rural firms paid 95 billion yuan ($11 
billion) in taxes. 
  The output of vegetables, domestic animals and aquatic 
products would continue to increase Luo said. 
  The experts said the income gaps between rural and urban 
residents, and between the more affluent coast and the 
hinterland, would further widen. And no effective way of 
reversing the trend had so far been found. 
  Chinese farmers, who make up 70 percent of the population, 
earned an average of 921 yuan ($106) last year, an increase of 
3.2 percent after inflation. By contrast, city dwellers made an 
average 2,337 yuan ($269) each, a rise of 10.2 percent over the 
previous year. Urbanites now earn almost two and a half times 
as much as their country cousins. 
  A meagre 3 percent growth in farmers incomes is forecast for 
this year, which is half that prescribed in the official Eighth 
Five Year Plan (1991-95). 
  Deng Yingtao, vice-director of the Rural Development 
Institute, blamed the slow increase of farmers' incomes on 
falling farm profits and lack of new labour opportunities among 
rural enterprises. Declining consumer demand for farm products 
has hit the agricultural sector hard, said Deng, chief editor of 
the Green Paper. 
  And the rising price of agricultural materials and equipment 
has virtually ruled out the cutting production costs as a way of 
increasing profits. 
  And the government is financially incapable of subsidizing 
cereal production, Deng said. 
  A logical way out was to cut the number of farmers and 
transfer them to non-agricultural businesses, he said. 
<H5>  Orientation </H5>
  Unfortunately, an increasing number of rural industrial 
firms 
have ended their labour-intensive strategies and gone for 
capital-intensive policies instead. So job opportunities have 
been reduced. 
  And China's relative dearth of cities has blocked the 
development of the service industry, a major job market in any 
country. 
  The service sector made up only 14 percent of rural output 
last year, half the national average. 
  Building and expanding cities to create efficient industry 
and services could be the only solution. Although this would 
take a long time considering the huge population base. 
  The experts concluded that Chinese farmers were unlikely to 
see their income grow significantly for a long time. 
  Deng advocated the developing environmentally friendly 
agriculture, accelerating urbanization, expanding the service 
sector and boosting value-added farm product processing. 
  Other experts said that the government should immediately 
reform the household registration system, which is a 
planned-economy practice, and open the cities to farmers. 
  Most government departments now agree that the old system 
must be abolished, it's just a question of how fast. 
  And the Ministry of Public Security is drafting a decree on 
changing the registration system in counties and towns, which 
will be publicized soon.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Senior economists 
predicted this week that China's agricultural growth will exceed 
four percent this year, the target set by Premier Li Peng in his 
government work report in spring this year. 
  Economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and 
the State Statistics Bureau said that if there are no serious 
disasters agriculture will grow by five percent -- and possibly 
by 6.5 percent. 
  They noted that the output of cereals and cotton will see a 
stable growth. For cereals, the rise is expected to be 6.5 
billion kg over last year. 
  Sufficient cereal stockpiles in both state and farmers' 
granaries will maintain a balance between supply and demand, the 
experts said. 
  The per capita income of rural people will increase by three 
percent to four percent, to reach about 1,032 yuan. And the 
total output of rural and township enterprises will grow by 25 
percent to 30 percent. 
  The economists said the expansion of the rural economy is 
backed by a set of government policies and measures to protect 
farmers' interests, increasing investment in agriculture by the 
state, measures to stabilize the planted grain and cotton 
acreages, and special government loans to support key counties 
producing grain and cotton.

<F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Lingling: "State Tightens Control </F>
of Land Use"] 
  [Text] The State land administration department is taking 
action to bring China's vast land resources under control. 
  Top land administration officials pledged that by the end of 
next year every piece of urban land will be issued an "ID card." 
  "All the land will be registered and all land users will be 
given certificates that define their rights to exploit the 
properties within State regulations," said Lu Xinshe, top tax 
registrar with the State Land Administration (SLA). 
  In 1986 local land administrators were instructed to 
strengthen land registration procedures. And so far, half the 
users of State land have got certificates . 
  A nationwide land inspection will also be completed soon, 
according to Lu. For years, no accurate figures have been 
available on the rural areas under cultivation. 
  After nearly 10 years of investigation, a full picture of 
local land use patterns is starting to appear, said Lu. And 
statistics on the country's land reserves will be obtained by 
June, he added. 
  The survey shows that the country's cultivated land area is 
30 percent greater than was originally estimated, said Ma Kewei, 
deputy director of the SLA. 
  While this may come as a relief to a populous and land 
hungry 
country like China, it also reveals just how inefficient the 
agricultural sector is. 
  In other words, the survey shows that average output per 
unit 
of farmland was smaller than reported. 
  And it is now crucial for the central government to adjust 
its economic development blueprint and draft new plans in 
accordance with the reality. 
  While the land in all rural areas is collectively-owned, 
that 
in urban areas belongs to the State. 
  The government used to distribute urban land to State work 
units free of charge, and without land-use certificates. 
Loopholes in the practice started to surface in the early 1980s 
when land was first traded as a commodity. 
  But, in 1987, the first land-use auction took place in 
Shenzhen, ending the era when State land could be used free of 
charge and without time limits. The market began to play its 
role. 
  And people realized that land can bring in profits. 
  But the commercialization of land brought another set of 
problems. Disputes over land-use transactions and black markets 
became rampant, said Lu. 
  In one case, a dispute erupted when a factory refused to 
give 
back a piece of land it "borrowed" from an institution -- free 
of charge -- in the 1950s. The factory argued that since the 
institution didn't have any documents to prove its land 
ownership, it had no property rights. 
  In other cases, poor management of the land tax registration 
system lost the State a lot of money. 
  China loses about 30 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) annually 
through illegal State land property deals, said Lu. 
  One of the main leaks is in the land leasing sector. Many 
parcels of State land were rented at below face value rates. 
  A recent land inspection in 43 cities shows that the average 
rent for a square metre of land is about 188 yuan ($22), some 40 
percent lower than the official SLA rate. And only 15 of the 
cities surveyed collect a standard charge on their leases. 
  Over 93 percent of land exploitation rights were sold 
through 
negotiations rather than public bidding. This often means that 
personal relations and private interests can come before State 
interests, which, of course, results in unfair land deals, said 
Lu. 
  Another problem is that the lion's share of land leasing 
revenue ends up in the pockets of local work units instead of 
being handed over to local governments, despite the stipulation 
that work units should only take 2-5 percent of the earnings. 
  And most local governments failed to hand over the mandatory 
32 percent of land revenues to the State coffers. 
  The irregularities in State land leasing were a major factor 
leading to the overheated real estate profiteering of 1992 to 
1993, economists say. 
  And the SLA has had to take some tough measures to check the 
malpractice and throttle the drain on State property purse, Lu 
said. 
  Local governments and land administrators must now auction 
land- use rights and put a stop to negotiated land deals. 
  And, in a bid to curb speculation on value-added land. 
regulations on collecting land-added tax have come into effect 
this year. 
  Local land administrations have to make sure that land 
traders follow the legal procedures and remit the appropriate 
charges. 
  The management now also requires strict land valuation. More 
than 400 cities and towns have finished rating their land. And 
it is expected that by the middle of next year, price tags will 
be attached to every piece of land in the country's cities and 
towns. 
  But State land management is now facing a new challenge from 
get- aheads, reform-driven State enterprises. Different firms 
across the country are coming up with different land use 
proposals and solutions. 
  The Beijing No 1 Light Industrial Corporation, for example, 
moved one of its loss-making factories to the suburbs and 
converted the downtown factory space into a residential 
development, for which shares were issued. 
  The apartment blocks are run by a company under the 
corporation. 
  A radical solution to land-use problems. And, perhaps, one 
with only limited benefits. 
  "It is controversial that the country benefits nothing 
through the exchange of State land rights, though the enterprise 
revitalized its ailing properties," said Lu.

  [Text] Beijing, April 27 (CNS) -- According to an annual 
report on rural economic development (1993-1994) prepared by the 
Rural Development Institute under the Chinese Academy of Social 
Sciences and the Rural Department of the State Statistical 
Bureau, despite the increase in the labour-receiving capacity of 
rural industries including construction, transportation, 
industrial and commercial industries in 1993, the surplus labour 
in rural areas in the country was still large in number. 
  The report shows that the employment structure in rural 
areas 
further improved last year with the scale of township 
enterprises further enlarged and eight million farmers being 
transferred into non-agricultural industries. The newly 
increased working force in the rural areas for the year was, 
however, still put at over seven million resulting in the 
agricultural sector still being overcrowded with 340 million 
labourers involved in it. 
  On how to solve the problem of transferring the surplus 
labour in rural areas to non-agricultural industries, experts in 
this field held that in the coming ten years, China must speed 
up the development of fine-quality and high-efficiency 
agriculture, tertiary industry and the agricultural product 
processing industry as well as the process of urbanization in 
rural areas, realizing the goal of large-scale and consistent 
reduction of surplus labour in rural areas starting from 2010.

  [Text] Shandong Province has planned to devote three to 
five years to cultivate and develop 16 competitive brand name 
industrial products through technological transformation. This 
is one of the important strategic moves for readjusting 
Shandong's industrial product mix determined by the provincial 
technological transformation leading group. 
  The 16 competitive products to be developed on a priority 
basis are motorcycles, vehicle parts, engineering machinery, 
microcomputers, telecommunications equipment, household electric 
appliances, garments, beverage, ceramics, numerical-controlled 
machine tools, electric cables, communications electric cables, 
medicines, radial tires, elevators, ships for special use, and 
petrochemical products. 
  It is planned that 9.3 billion yuan will be invested in the 
technological transformation projects for cultivating and 
developing competitive products and that over 60 enterprises 
will undertake these projects. Upon completion, these projects 
may form a production capacity of 1 million motorcycles, spare 
parts for 300,000 cars, 10,000 engineering machines, 100,000 
microcomputers, 200,000 fax machines, 1.5 million shirts, 3,000 
numerical-controlled machine tools and some processing centers, 
and 20,000 sanitary wares. By that time, the largest 
antibiotics and febrifuge producing enterprise, the largest 
engineering machinery group, and the largest brewery and 
sanitary ceramic wares manufacturing plant of China will emerge 
in the vast land of Shandong. Because the production capacity 
of these products are mainly concentrated on key enterprises, 
the annual sales income of 15 enterprises producing these 
products will exceed 1 billion yuan and 11 will reach 500 
million yuan. 
  In order to successfully carry out the technological 
transformation items of these 16 competitive products, the 
provincial authorities have decided to attach prime importance 
to arranging for the development of technological items of 
competitive products while determining the province's 100 key 
transformation projects every year, give priority to making 
investments in this aspect, and regard some supporting projects 
as the major items of various cities and prefectures. At 
present, the relevant provincial departments are stepping up 
their efforts to formulate implementation plans and supporting 
preferential policies for developing competitive products. 
Thirty-eight items have been arranged in the province's 100 
major technological transformation projects, and have been 
initiated.

  [Excerpts] A four-day provincial work meeting on rural 
diversified economy, which was held by the provincial party 
committee and government, ended in Yingshan County on 23 April. 
The meeting stressed: Making a breakthrough in developing a 
diversified economy is an important content of the guiding 
thought of the provincial party committee and government for 
developing agriculture and the rural economy. It is an 
important aspect of the five breakthrough points in the economic 
work of the whole province this year. It is an important 
measure for fulfilling the entire strategic plan for economic 
development of the whole province, and for attaining the target 
of small-scale prosperity. Proceeding from the high plane of 
reform, development and stability, and ensuring the sustained, 
rapid, and healthy development of the national economy, the 
party committees and governments at all levels must fully 
understand the importance of developing a diversified economy. 
They must further enhance their sense of urgency. While 
stabilizing the development of the production of grain, cotton 
and edible oil, they must treat the diversified economy as a key 
undertaking in agriculture and the rural economy. They must 
grasp it as a strategic focal point for attaining small-scale 
prosperity in rural areas. They must make great efforts to 
organize the masses to make a breakthrough in the development of 
a diversified economy. 
  Those who attended the meeting included Governor Jia Zhijie, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee; Hui Liangyu, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and chairman 
of the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; Vice Governor Wang Shengtie, 
member of the provincial party committee standing committee; 
(Song Guozheng), member of the provincial party committee 
standing committee; Zhou Zibai, vice chairman of the provincial 
CPPCC committee; Zhang Hongxiang, secretary general of the 
provincial party committee; and responsible persons of the 
relevant departments directly under provincial authorities, 
prefectures, cities, autonomous prefectures, and Shennongjia 
forest zone; as well as responsible comrades of some counties 
and cities. 
  At a preparatory meeting, Jia Zhijie said: The present 
provincial work meeting on diversified economy in rural areas is 
the first high-standard meeting in our province's history of 
developing a diversified economy. It is necessary to build up 
momentum, make a big issue of, and greatly promote the drive to 
make a breakthrough in developing a diversified economy. 
[passage omitted] 
  The meeting clearly pointed out: It is necessary to fully 
understand the great strategic importance of developing a 
diversified economy, and to enhance our sense of urgency in 
making a breakthrough in the development of a diversified 
economy. Since reform and opening up, the diversified economy 
in our province has been greatly developed. However, the 
development was uneven in different localities, trades, and 
spheres. Compared with other advanced areas throughout the 
country, our pace of development is slow. As a whole, we have 
not yet assigned the diversified economy a proper position. 
Under such circumstances, our top-priority task is to guide our 
cadres and masses to enhance their understanding, and further 
realize that developing a diversified economy is an important 
breakthrough point for optimizing the agricultural structure; 
enhancing economic efficiency; and promoting the sustained, 
rapid and healthy development of the rural economy. It is an 
important channel for absorbing the surplus labor force, 
increasing peasants' income, and ensuring rural stability and 
social progress. It is also a hope for speeding up the 
development of town and township enterprises, promoting county 
and township finances, ensuring good results of collectives and 
villages, expanding exports, and earning more foreign exchange. 
  The meeting urged a correct analysis of the new situation 
facing the rural areas, earnestly summing up new experiences 
achieved by various localities, and making still more clear the 
idea of developing a diversified economy. With regard to 
coordination work, we must persist in the principle of 
integrating the stable production of grain, cotton and edible 
oil with a breakthrough in the development of a diversified 
economy. With regard to the guideline for production, we must 
persist in integrating the stable development of major crops 
with the efforts to assail weak links. With regard to the 
decision on what kinds of crops to plant, we must persist in 
integrating market demand with the strong points of local 
natural resources. [passage omitted) 
  The meeting emphasized: To speed up the development of a 
diversified economy, we must grasp the principal contradictions, 
mainly assail the weak links, and effect a breakthrough in terms 
of strategic measures. First, we must make a breakthrough in 
developing the market and enlivening the commodity flow. We 
must promote development through stimulating the commodity flow. 
Second, We must make a breakthrough in developing key 
processing industries so as to vigorously promote the 
industrialization process. Third, we must make a breakthrough 
in input. We must ensure the development of a diversified 
economy in terms of funds. Fourth, we must make a breakthrough 
in terms of science and technology so as to upgrade the level 
and increase the efficiency of our diversified economy.

  [Text] The people's armed forces committee of the 
provincial party committee called a plenary session in Changsha 
on 19 April. During the meeting, the gist of the decision by the 
CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on the 
development of reserve forces for national defense was conveyed 
and studied, and some arrangements were made to assign tasks 
related to the operation of the militia as reserve forces in the 
province. 
  Provincial party, government, and Army leading comrades Chen 
Bangzhu, Pang Weiqiang, (Luo Haifan), Wang Keying, and Deng 
Hanmin attended the meeting. Comrade (Luo Xueting), chief of 
staff of the provincial military district, gave a report on the 
present state of the militia as reserve forces in the province. 
Governor Chen Bangzhu presided over and addressed the meeting. 
  Chen Bangzhu said: In recent years, the vast number of 
militiamen in our province as reserve forces have played a 
positive role in economic construction; in fighting floods and 
other natural disasters; in safeguarding public security; in 
undertaking urgent, difficult, dangerous, and heavy tasks; and 
in promoting a new socialist civilization and fashion. 
  He pointed out: Given the new situation, party committees 
and governments at all levels must carry forward the fine 
tradition of the party maintaining control over the armed 
forces, and must further intensify leadership over the operation 
of militia as military reserve forces. It is necessary to give 
full play to the role of the militia as reserve forces in 
carrying our in-depth reform, in promoting economic development, 
and particularly in safeguarding public security and preserving 
political stability, so that militiamen can make new 
contributions to the economic prosperity and social stability in 
this province.

  [Text] The provincial symposium on the training and 
selection of minority cadres was held in Guiyang yesterday 
afternoon, presided over by Wang Shouqin, Standing committee 
member and director of the provincial party committee's 
organization department. Attending the meeting were party and 
government leaders, including [Guizhou CPC Secretary] Liu 
Fangren, [Guizhou Congress head] Long Zhiyi, Wang Siqi, Yuan 
Ronggui, Hu Tiansheng, Liang Wenkui, and Li Yuandong. 
  The current meeting, which was jointly held by the 
provincial 
party committee organization and united front work departments 
and the provincial government's nationalities affairs commission 
and personnel department, was to convey and implement the spirit 
of the national symposium on the training and selection of 
minority cadres and of central leaders' important speeches; sum 
up and exchange our province's experience in the work; and 
discuss how to do a good job of training and selecting minority 
cadres in the 1990's. Addressing the symposium, Liu Fangren, 
secretary of provincial party committee said: Guizhou is a 
multinational province. Minority nationalities constitute 34.7 
percent of the province's total population. Training and 
selecting minority cadres has a bearing on the province's 
reform, development, and stability and the realization of the 
strategic goal of shaking off poverty, gaining prosperity, and 
achieving a well-to-do standard of living. We should have a 
full understanding of the importance and necessity of training 
and selecting minority cadres, sum up experience, consolidate 
what has been achieved in the work, do an ever better job of 
ideological work, and provide a solid and liable organizational 
guarantee for the province's reform, development, and stability 
and the realization of the second-step strategic goal. Liu 
Fangren stated: To meet the needs of the new situation of 
developing the socialist market economy, we should elevate the 
work of training and selecting minority cadres to new heights, 
place greater stress on improving the quality of minority cadres 
while expanding their ranks, give better training to minority 
cadres while doing a good job in the training and selection 
work, and strengthen the building of the ranks of minority 
cadres at the gross-roots units of the minority nationality 
areas while optimizing the leading bodies at all levels. In this 
regard, first of all, we should conduct education in the "two 
indispensables" and strengthen unity and cooperation between 
cadres of minority nationalities and those of the Han 
nationality. He also urged party localities and governments at 
all levels to put the work of training and selecting minority 
cadres on the agenda as an important task, personally take up 
the work, and continue to strengthen leadership over the work.

  [Text] Sichuan's outspoken governor, Xiao Yang, has 
criticised Beijing's handling of the resettlement of 1 million 
people in the province who will be forced to move because of the 
massive Three Gorges Dam project. 
  Xiao said Beijing's failure to put forward a resettlement 
plan for Sichuan had caused uncertainty among those slated to 
leave. 
  "Objectively speaking, we should admit the people have a 
feeling of leaving home and being utterly in the dark about the 
future," he said. 
  "This is related to the fact that the state has not put 
forward a proposal to handle the 1 million resettlers." 
  Xiao said too much attention was being paid to initiating 
large-scale engineering projects on the 95.4 billion renminbi 
[Rmb] (HK84.7bn) dam, which resettlement could not keep up with. 
  "The resettlement work cannot be carried out in such a big 
way yet. There is a noticeable lack of enthusiasm," he said. 
  He took particular aim at the policy of relying on 
agriculture to provide a living for the resettled people. 
  "If there is only land cultivation, these places will remain 
poor," he said. 
  The controversial dam project is closely associated with the 
Chinese Premier, Li Peng, who pushed it through against stiff 
opposition in 1992. Xiao's forthright statements on the 
problems of the dam project came only weeks after Sichuan's 
vice-governor, Gan Yuping, said some state funds earmarked for 
resettlement had been diverted to other uses, adding fuel to 
widespread suspicions of embezzlement and misuse of the funds by 
companies set up in Beijing to promote development in the dam 
area. 
  Sichuan has been promised Rmb1.3bn from Beijing for 
resettlement work this year out of a total budget over the next 
17 years of Rmb30bn.

  [Text] The autonomous regional discipline inspection and 
supervisory work conference held its second plenary session at 
the Tibet Great Hall of the People on the morning of 28 April. 
Autonomous Regional Party Committee Secretary Chen Kuiyuan 
delivered an important speech at the meeting. Autonomous party, 
government, and military leaders including Guo Jinlong, Basang, 
(Hu Yongchu), Yang Chuantang, Lieque, (Buqung), (Lu Huimin), 
Puqung, Pudoje, (Tian Fujing), Baima Duoji, (Cui Jiguo), Cering 
Sangzhub, (Chai Dan Zhuo Ma), and (Zhou Qishun), and Zhang Zhu, 
political commissar of the Tibet People's Armed Police Force, 
attended the meeting. All cadres attending the autonomous 
regional discipline inspection and supervisory work conference, 
and leading member cadres from organs at regional, prefectural, 
and city levels attended the conference. 
  Comrade Chen Kuiyuan's speech consisted of three parts: 1) 
basic evaluation of the anticorruption drive carried out at an 
earlier stage, 2) strengthening of anticorruption awareness and 
further enhancing self-consciousness of the anticorruption 
struggle, and 3) some opinions on furthering the anticorruption 
drive this year. 
  Touching on conditions of the anticorruption drive carried 
out at an earlier stage, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan said: Since the 
autonomous regional party committee and government launched the 
anticorruption drive, overall, the attitude of party committees 
and governments at various levels has been resolute, and their 
actions have been positive with certain results being achieved. 
The trend of the anticorruption struggle has been favorable and 
its development has been healthy. Judging from the present 
conditions, corrupt phenomena remain very serious. The 
anticorruption mission has been formidable and should never be 
allowed to slacken. We should continue to soberly keep track of 
the situation and unswervingly deepen the fight against 
corruption so that the party's basic line can be thoroughly 
carried out in Tibet. 
  Comrade Chen Kuiyuan pointed out: Anticorruption is the 
fundamental requirement for upholding socialism, the objective 
demand for developing a socialist market economy, the basic 
guarantee for making the party the firm leading core in 
socialist undertakings, and an important aspect in stabilizing 
the situation. All our work should proceed from reality. When 
we talk about anticorruption, we should direct ourselves to 
problems actually existing within the party and among cadres in 
the region, and firmly oppose them. Corrupt elements, no matter 
where they are, must be investigated and handled according to 
law and discipline. 
  On ways to deepen the anticorruption drive this year, 
Comrade 
Chen Kuiyuan emphatically pointed out: First, we should uphold 
the principle of firmness, solidity, and sustainability. In 
carrying out the anticorruption struggle, party committees, and 
governments at various levels should be firm in enforcing law 
and discipline in their investigations and handling of party 
members and cadres found to be violating law and discipline. 
Corrupt elements should be penalized seriously. The 
anticorruption drive should not remain as empty talk and 
arrangements that have been decided in meetings and entered into 
documents must all be solidly translated into concrete action. 
Second, in unfolding anticorruption drive, we should start with 
the investigations and handling of law and discipline 
violations. Law and discipline violations committed by leading 
organs and cadres--which tend to cause more harm, carry 
far-reaching effects, and are difficult to investigate and 
handle--have seriously discredited the party and damaged 
party-masses relations. We should continue to focus the 
anticorruption drive on investigating and handling law and 
discipline violations committed by leading organs, cadres, and 
law enforcement, supervisory, and economic management 
departments, and their work personnel. Third, we should tighten 
political discipline and consolidate stability and unity. All 
members and cadres, particularly leading cadres, must thoroughly 
implement the party's basic line of "one center and two basic 
points" and resolutely safeguard the motherland's unification 
and nationality solidarity. Cadres who oppose the four cardinal 
principles, promote bourgeois liberalization, and collude with 
splittist forces in carrying out activities designed to split 
the motherland should be resolutely investigated and handled one 
after another. Fourth, we must exercise comprehensive control 
over the anticorruption drive; constantly educate the broad 
members and cadres in the party's guiding principles, 
objectives, ideals, disciplines, and fine work style as well as 
the correct outlook on life, values, and morality; strengthen 
their ability in resisting the trend of decadent ideologies, 
including money worship, hedonism, and ultra individualism; sum 
up, popularize, and strengthen fine experiences in intensifying 
building of party work style and clean government; and 
incessantly carry on the party's fine tradition and style. 
  Fifth, we must effectively strengthen leadership over the 
anticorruption struggle, making it an important item on the 
agenda. The principal party and government leaders should 
personally assume leadership in solving major issues, especially 
deep-seated ones. Henceforth, leaders shall be made accountable 
for failures to advance economic work. Likewise, they shall be 
made responsible for failure to advance anticorruption work, and 
to bring corruption and unhealthy tendencies under effective 
control. Organizations, discipline inspection and supervisory 
organs, and public security, procuratorial, and judicial 
departments at all levels should coordinate their work in 
addition to assuming their respective responsibilities. Party 
committees and governments at all levels must support the work 
of discipline inspection and supervisory departments. At the 
same time, these departments should constantly strive to improve 
themselves, play the key role in the anticorruption drive, and 
serve Tibet's reform, development, and stability by doing their 
work outstandingly. 
  At the meeting, Puqung, member of the Standing Committee of 
the regional party committee and deputy secretary of the 
regional discipline inspection commission, delivered a report 
entitled "Unremittingly Combat Corruption, Encourage Honesty, 
and Implement the Three Tasks in an All-Round Way in Order To 
Serve Reform, Opening to the Outside World, Economic 
Development, and Stability."

  [Text] A provincial propaganda and ideological work 
conference was convened in Kunming's People's Victory Auditorium 
this morning. The conference was devoted mainly to relaying and 
implementing the spirit of a recently concluded national 
propaganda and ideological work conference, studying a new train 
of thought for the province's propaganda and ideological work, 
formulating relevant propaganda and ideological work measures, 
opening up new vistas for the province's reform and development, 
and pressing ahead with the province's economic growth. 
  Provincial party committee Secretary Pu Chaozhu delivered an 
important speech at this morning's conference in which he 
stated: Giving full scope to propaganda and ideological work has 
remained one of the party's basic experiences and one of its 
traditional superiorities. Now that Yunnan's reform, opening 
up, and economic development have entered a new historical 
period, we are confronted with a new round of strategic 
transformation. Should we fail to strengthen the party's 
propaganda and ideological work; enable the broad masses of the 
people to comprehend and master the party's line, theories, 
principles, and policies in the new historical period; and 
consciously join hands with the broad masses of the people in 
deepening the on-going reforms; we will find it impossible to 
complete the second-round strategic transformation successfully. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu noted: In carrying out the party's 
propaganda and ideological work, we should adhere unswervingly 
to Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics as a basic guiding principle; should 
submit to and serve the overall interests of emancipating the 
mind, grasping opportunities, deepening reforms, expanding 
opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability; 
should subject propaganda and ideological work to these overall 
interests; and should secure a correct political orientation for 
propaganda and ideological work. In addition, we should make 
unreserved efforts to publicize the theory of building socialism 
with Chinese characteristics, as well as the overall interests 
of the entire party and country, with a view to turning 
spiritual strength into material strength and to pressing ahead 
with reform, construction, and development. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu maintained: Arming the whole party with 
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is 
now a basic task of the party's ideological and theoretical 
building and of its propaganda and ideological work. In order 
to accomplish this basic task, in the near future the provincial 
party committee should directly and successfully organize four 
clases for principal leading cadres at and above the county 
level to study the 'Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume 
three. Various areas across the province should effectively 
organize more than 0.9 million office and enterprise cadres to 
study the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," volume three, and 
should continue to successfully carry out annual rotational 
training of grass-roots party members. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu said: An important task facing the 
party's propaganda and ideological work at the moment is to 
guide public opinion correctly. We should firmly grasp key 
links, such as the mass media; make redoubled efforts to 
correctly guide the mass media; make the mass media contribute 
to continued reform, opening up, socialist spiritual 
civilization, democracy, and legal system building; and make the 
mass media more capable of encouraging and mobilizing people to 
contribute to national prosperity, nationality solidarity, and 
social stability. To this end, we should energetically further 
reform in news and the mass media; strengthen news and mass 
media management; keep a firm grip on the mass media; give full 
scope to the principal mass media; make continued efforts to 
develop modern mass media; and step up foreign-related 
propaganda work. 
  Secretary Pu Chaozhu asserted: At present, we should orient 
the party's propaganda and ideological work to training a new 
generation of socialist people with lofty ideals, moral 
integrity, cultural accomplishments, and sense of discipline; 
step up ideological and ethical education on patriotism, 
collectivism, and socialism; further prosper socialist culture; 
work harder to meet the growing cultural demands of the broad 
masses of people; produce more healthy, beneficial, rich, 
varied, and strongly appealing spiritual products for the broad 
masses of the people. The propaganda, culture, and radio and 
television departments; literature and art federations; writers' 
associations; and social sciences academies at all levels across 
the province should meticulously organize the production of 
cultural products that reflect the theme of the times so as to 
enable the broad masses of the people to enjoy lots of excellent 
movies; television programs; plays; and musical, dance, fine 
arts, literary, and theoretical works every year. 
  In conclusion, Secretary Pu Chaozhu stated: Propaganda and 
ideological work has remained a crucial component of party 
building work. Party committees at all levels across the 
province should attach great importance to and earnestly enhance 
leadership over propaganda and ideological work; place 
propaganda and ideological work high on the agenda; acquire a 
profound understanding of the importance of propaganda and 
ideological work from the high strategic plane of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and of implementing and 
carrying out the party's basic line; provide this year's reforms 
with ideological guarantees; and energetically promote two 
civilizations in a coordinated fashion. 
  This morning's conference was presided over by Liang 
Jinquan, 
deputy secretary of the provincial party committee, and attended 
by a number of provincial leaders, including Zhao Shumin, Li 
Jiating, Zhang Baoshan, Meng Jiyao, Wang Tianxi, Bao Yongkang, 
Zhao Tingguang, Li Jing, Li Linge, Qiu Chuangjiao, and others. 
  More than 2,000 people attended this morning's conference, 
including the leaders and propaganda department directors of 
autonomous prefectural, prefectural, city, and county party 
committees; leaders of provincial departments, commissions, 
offices, bureaus, people's organizations and leading party 
groups; party committee leaders from institutions of higher 
learning; leaders of enterprises party committees; and

<F P=106> [By reporter Sun Yushan (1327 3768 1472): "Resolutely and </F>
Enduringly Conduct Anticorruption Struggle"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the municipal party committee and the 
municipal government held a meeting of party-member leading 
cadres of districts, counties, and bureaus to relay the 
important speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin at the third plenary 
session of the central discipline inspection commission and the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the central 
discipline inspection commission, and to work out plans for 
conducting anticorruption struggle this year. Chen Xitong, 
secretary of the municipal party committee, gave a speech. He 
called on leaders at all levels to use practical experience and 
to resolutely attend to anticorruption struggle in line with the 
central demands. 
  Mayor Li Qiyan presided over the meeting. Chen Guangwen, 
deputy secretary of the municipal party committee, relayed the 
important speech of Comrade Jiang Zemin. On behalf of the 
municipal party committee and the municipal government, Li 
Yongan, member of the standing committee of the municipal party 
committee and secretary of the municipal discipline inspection 
committee, gave a report "on the opinions for implementing the 
guidelines of the third plenary session of the central 
discipline inspection and deeply conducting the next stage of 
anticorruption struggle." 
  Li Yongan said: Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, 
expanding opening up, promoting development, and maintaining 
stability is the overall situation of the whole party's work. 
Anticorruption and the building of party style and 
administrative honesty must obey and serve this overall 
situation. The overall demands of this year's Beijing municipal 
anticorruption struggle are to continuously and resolutely 
implement the central plan on anticorruption struggle, uphold 
the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and be tough with 
both," proceed from the reality of the work of the entire 
municipality, and on the basis of consolidating the 
achievements, grasp the prominent problems that hamper and 
affect reform, development, and stability, define this year's 
anticorruption specific tasks and objectives, and integrate 
anticorruption with the work of comprehensively promoting party 
style and administrative honesty; combine the establishment and 
perfection of rules and regulations with the strengthening of 
ideological and political work and professional ethics; combine 
administrative honesty with diligent administration, deepen 
reform, firmly grasp education, improve systems, strengthen 
supervision, strictly enforce law and discipline, integrate 
honesty with diligence, deeply, enduringly and effectively carry 
out anticorruption struggle, and serve Beijing Municipality's 
reform, development, and stability. 
  He said: It is necessary to resolutely implement the 
"opinions for implementing the five stipulations on keeping 
leading cadres of party and government organs at and above the 
county (section) level clean and self-disciplined," "on the 
method of handling in line with party discipline the acts of 
violating the five stipulations on honesty and self-discipline 
of party and government leading cadres at and above the county 
(section) level; and continue to attend to supervision, 
inspection, and implementation. The central authorities have 
issued another "five stipulations" on keeping leading cadres 
clean and self-disciplined this year. The problems involving in 
these "five stipulations" have existed at varying degrees and 
within a certain scope in Beijing Municipality. The masses have 
expressed comments on and criticism of the phenomena that a 
small number of party and government leading cadres have ridden 
on "black plate" cars used by foreign enterprises; arbitrarily 
misappropriated the cars of subordinate units for a long time 
under the pretext of borrowing them; and replaced their old cars 
with imported luxurious cars. The problems as reflected by the 
masses, were concentrated on the using of public funds for 
furnishing one's own house above the set standards, which should 
be listed as a priority for investigation and rectification. In 
addition, cases on holding lavish weddings and funerals have 
frequently occurred in some cadres; and cases on borrowing and 
misappropriating public funds (articles) or delaying the payment 
of public funds have also existed at varying degrees in some 
departments and units. Although these two problems have not yet 
become a common practice, we should conscientiously resolve them 
by proceeding from reality. Regarding the aforementioned 
problems, party committees and governments at all levels should 
proceed from reality and resolutely carry out their work in 
accordance with the stipulations of the central authorities and 
the municipal party committee and government. 
  He said: Continued efforts should be made to investigate and 
handle major and appalling cases. We should continue to persist 
in regarding investigation and handling of cases on law and 
discipline violations involving party and government leading 
organs, leading cadres and judicial department, administrative 
law-enforcing departments, economic management departments, and 
other functionaries as the priorities. 
  Priorities should be 
given to investigating and handling cases on leading cadres who 
engage in corruption and bribe-taking and abuse their powers to 
seek personal gain and cases on law and discipline enforcing 
personnel who practice favoritism and engage in malpractice, who 
take bribes and bend the law, and who violate law and 
discipline, and cases on law and discipline violations involving 
legal entities. It is necessary to attend to the handling and 
punishment for typical cases. 
  He said: Continued efforts should be made to check unhealthy 
trends in various trades. While checking the random collection 
of fees, fines, and forced donations this year, we should put 
special emphasis on strengthening supervision and inspection and 
firmly carry out this work. On the one hand, we should pursue 
the responsibility of relevant leaders who continue to collect 
funds which are formally ordered to be abolished by the 
municipal party committee and give them necessary punishment in 
line with party and administrative discipline; on the other 
hand, we should organize inspection activities, experiment with 
the method of "using cadres to supervise the collection of 
funds," implement the stipulations and other measures on 
separating the management of the collection of administrative 
funds from the collection of fines, and consolidate and expand 
the achievements in checking the random of collection of fees, 
fines, and forced donations. Meanwhile, we should continue to 
grasp the work of reducing the burdens of peasants. 
  Li Yongan said: The demands of the party Central Committee, 
the State Council, and the municipal party committee and 
government on strengthening party style and administrative 
honesty are also applicable to enterprises and units. The party 
committee and administrative leaders of enterprises and units 
should proceed from the reality of their own units, set forth 
explicit demands on self- discipline for party and government 
cadres of enterprises, institutions, and units in line with a 
series of relevant demands of the central authorities, and 
supervise the implementation of these demands. 
  In his speech, Chen Xitong pointed out: Last year, in line 
with the decision and plans of the central authorities, all 
sectors in the municipality made common efforts, resolutely 
conducted anticorruption struggle, strengthened administrative 
honesty, and achieved expected results. Most units made 
achievements of varying degrees, units with good performance 
made more obvious achievements, and some units that were slack 
in their work went through the motions. This year the whole 
municipality should act in accordance with the central demand on 
deeply, enduringly, and more effectively conducting 
anticorruption struggle, and the plans and tasks of the central 
discipline inspection commission, launch the struggle in line 
with Beijing's reality, apply the experience of the previous 
stage, and continue to exert strenuous efforts to make the 
anticorruption work a greater success. 
  Chen Xitong stressed: To fight corruption, we must first be 
resolute. If we fail to be resolute, we will not have fighting 
strength, will not be able to fight corruption, will depart from 
the masses, and will not be qualified to be a leader. We should 
soberly recognize that some systems, laws, and regulations are 
not perfect under the new situation, leaving loopholes for the 
people to exploit. Therefore, anticorruption struggle has 
become more important, and must be grasped resolutely. At 
present, the idea of "that is good enough" and the worries that 
anticorruption work may affect reform, development, and 
stability which hamper our efforts to fight corruption are all 
wrong. Actually, we still have disparities in anticorruption 
work. Only by resolutely carrying out anticorruption struggle 
can we facilitate reform and opening up, win support from the 
people, and bring about stability. Leaders at all levels should 
persist in taking a two-handed approach and be tough with both, 
and combine anticorruption with deepening reform, expanding 
opening up, promoting development, and maintaining stability. 
Only by resolutely grasping anticorruption work can we 
consolidate the ruling status of our party, and better undertake 
the historical heavy task of leading reform, opening up, and 
modernization. 
  Chen Xitong said: Anticorruption work must be constantly 
carried out. We must guard against impetuous. Some people inside 
the party will be contaminated by things of the old society. It 
is impossible to be absolutely perfect. 
  For many reasons, including the "mosquitoes and flies" 
brought in by history, society, class, ideology, and opening up, 
anticorruption is a long-term struggle. It is impossible to 
finish a work at one go and accomplish one task at one stroke. 
We must fight a long war. It is not right to be rash, not right 
not to grasp this work conscientiously, and not right to do it 
slowly. 
  Chen Xitong said: To fight corruption, we must grasp a 
portion of the expected achievements because this is the 
manifestation of the principle of being resolute and enduring, 
carry out this work stage by stage, and sum up every portion of 
the expected achievements to form an overall achievement. In 
this way, we may reduce the corrupt phenomena to the minimum. 
  He said: We should strengthen both self supervision and mass 
supervision. Party organizations should do a good job in 
holding democratic life activities, conduct self supervision, 
use criticism and self-criticism as a weapon, and help one 
another, and should not establish vulgar relations or engage in 
hypocritical work style. Last year, we persisted in holding 
democratic life activities, promoted honesty and 
self-discipline, encouraged people to exchange views, and then 
reported the results to the masses of each specific unit and to 
the democratic parties to listen to their opinions, and 
gradually form them into a system, which was welcomed by the 
masses. This good experience should be upheld. 
  He said: It is necessary to strengthen education and deal 
strict blows to criminals and combine the two together. We 
should conscientiously investigate and handle major and 
appalling cases, resolutely deal strict blows to serious crimes, 
and never be soft-handed. Regarding those who are contaminated 
by bourgeois work style and commit mistakes which should not be 
punished in line with the criminal law, we should educate them, 
and encourage them to find out the reasons for their mistakes, 
to absorb lessons, and to make corrections. Some should be 
punished in line with party and administrative discipline, which 
is also an education for them. We should make full use of 
negative examples to enhance the understanding of the people, 
and must not neglect everything after ending a case without 
noticing its educational role. The core of education is to 
cultivate the communist outlook on life and the world outlook. 
Struggling to fulfill the communist ideals is a lofty move, and 
letting the Chinese people reach common prosperity and lead a 
happy life is of great significance in life. 
  He said: We should combine diligent administration with 
honest administration, attend to administrative honesty and 
promote diligent administration, attach importance to both, do 
a better job in this aspect, work for the well-being of the 
people, and do more practical and good things for them. 
Practice has proved that we will achieve good results in 
promoting diligent administration by always introducing the 
achievements of anticorruption and administrative honesty to it. 
  Chen Xitong said: We should concentrate efforts on grasping 
administrative honesty and grasp it regularly. Leaders should 
concentrate their energy and time on solving problems. For 
example, last year we universally held democratic life 
activities. However, concentrating efforts on grasping this 
work does not mean that we should turn it into a movement. We 
should attend to it regularly and should have systems and 
inspection to support this work. He called on leaders at all 
levels to uphold these experiences which have been proved by 
practice and apply them this year's work so as to achieve 
greater achievements in anticorruption struggle. 
  In his speech, Li Qiyan said: Anticorruption work is one 
which has a vital bearing on the overall situation. It should 
be carried out under the party committee's unified leadership 
and plans and with the joint efforts of the party and government 
organs. Administrative leaders should not neglect anticorruption 
struggle even under the situation of having numerous economic 
work and heavy tasks. A success in this work will help develop 
our various undertakings. It is necessary to conscientiously 
relay the conference guidelines, form a momentum, adopt 
practical measures, and realistically achieve a portion of the 
expected results in anticorruption struggle. 
  Municipal leaders Wang Baosen, Ouyang Wenan, Yang Chaoshi, 
Duan Bingren, Qiang Wei, Meng Zhiyuan, Xia Qinlin, Tao Xiping, 
Xue Bingzhong, Lu Yucheng, Hu Zhaoguang, Duan Qiang, Feng 
Mingwei, and Fan Yuanmou attended the conference.

  [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA)--The customs authorities 
of North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have taken 
steps to strengthen inspection of commodities to prevent exports 
of goods with fake brand names. 
  All personal luggages are strictly examined and inspected, 
and the quantity of luggage a traveller may take is strictly 
limited. No unqualified product is allowed to be taken out of 
the country. 
  Last year the three entry and exit ports of Manzhouli, 
Labudalin and Erlian alone seized fake brand-name products worth 
10 million yuan. 
  The Manzhouli Tourism Bureau provides foreign tourists with 
a 
shopping guide in the Russian language, which reminds tourists 
to demand receipts from Chinese shops. If a commodity can not 
pass customs inspection the buyer can claim compensation from 
the shop. If any travel agent does not provide a tourist with 
the shopping guide and the tourist buys a fake, the travel agent 
is responsible for paying any compensation. 
  These measures are aimed at safeguarding the reputation of 
Chinese-made products and ensuring that cross-border trade 
develops in a healthy way, according to a local official.

<F P=106> [Article by Zhang Guangheng (1728 1639 5899) and Li Minghuan </F>
(2621 2494 3562): "The Necessity and Possibility of Establishing 
Sino-Russian Transnational Economic Cooperation Zones"] 
  [Text] Regionalization of the national economy and 
internationalization of the regional economy are the two 
important characteristics of the current economic development of 
the world, which run parallel and supplement each other. In the 
process of its economic development, China has failed to take 
these two essential elements into account for a long period, 
making many regional issues related to national economic 
development unable to proceed and issues related to 
transnational regional cooperation still difficult to be truly 
resolved. 
  Transnational economic cooperation zones are the product 
which has emerged in the long development process of the world's 
economic special zones following the continuous strengthening of 
the tendencies of transnationalizing and diversifying the major 
participators of the activities. Building transnational 
economic special zones by two countries and even three countries 
together can be deemed as a new trend in the current development 
of the economic special zones of the world. During the post-war 
development of the world economy and international economy, 
regional conglomeration of the economy is the major form of 
international organizations that suits the internationalization 
of economic activities. It is usually reflected in four 
development layers, namely tariff union, common market, alliance 
in economy and currency, and economic integration, which is also 
called "economic community" or "economic ring." However, 
regional conglomeration of the economy faces great limitations. 
Contrary to this, transnational economic cooperation zones have 
many characteristics and advantages that the regional 
conglomeration cannot compare with. Judging from the current 
conditions, they may be regarded as the best choice of the 
organizations suitable to regional economy. First, the form of 
transnational economic cooperation zones is not limited by the 
difference in the economic development levels of the various 
sides concerned because, due to their different economic 
development levels, they can learn from each other's advantages 
to make up their deficiencies and supplement each other to 
achieve common development. Second, transnational economic 
cooperation zones are free zones opened to the whole world, 
which, instead of being exclusive, welcome and actively draw in 
the countries and regions other than those in the regional 
conglomeration to participate and invest in building plants and 
to conduct international trade and other forms of economic 
cooperation to promote economic development. Third, 
transnational economic cooperation zones reflect the relations 
between the local interests of a country and the interests of 
other countries. Through the transfer of some rights and 
interests, they enable some localities of a country to achieve 
economic development and also promote the economic development 
of the entire country. Transnational economic cooperation zones 
are easier to establish because they do not influence the nature 
and the overall situation of the countries which build the zones 
and are restricted less by political and other noneconomic 
factors. This has also been proven by history. 
  Theoretically speaking, transnational economic cooperation 
zones are very feasible. Heilongjiang's transnational economic 
cooperation zones, which are being planned, have been provided 
with some necessary and also basic conditions. 
  1. The superior geographical condition. Heilongjiang and 
Russia share a border as long as 3,026 km and have groups of 
ports that have convenient transport facilities and 
corresponding counterpart ports in each other's side. Among 
them, the pair of Heihe and Blagoveshchensk cities and the pair 
of Suifenhe city and Pogranichnyy possess the best conditions 
and strength and can exert the widest influence. They are 
regarded as the ideal places to build transnational economic 
cooperation zones. 
  2. China and Russia strongly need each other economically. 
This is reflected in the complementation of their industrial 
compositions and structures of essential elements. Such a high 
degree of complementation and mutual need are bound to lead to 
the large-scale circulation of the manpower and material 
resources and even funds of both sides. The emergence of 
transnational economic cooperation zones, which epitomize such 
circulation, then becomes natural and necessary. 
  3. With border trade as the channel, the economic ties 
between some localities of China and Russia have become 
increasingly closer, and border trade has tremendously 
influenced and even promoted the economic development of both 
sides. Such increasingly closer economic ties have laid a 
foundation for the localities of China and Russia to establish 
certain types of economic associations and transnational 
economic cooperation zones. 
  4. Heilongjiang and the Far East Region of Russia constitute 
an important component of the northeast Asian economic region. 
Not only are they famous for their abundant resources and 
tremendous economic development potential, but also they possess 
the geographical advantages as areas in the development region 
and areas linking with international transportation lines. 
Building transnational economic cooperation zones in 
Heilongjiang and Russia will draw the great interest and active 
participation of northeast Asian countries and other relevant 
countries and regions. 
  5. A most direct effect of transnational economic 
cooperation 
zones is that they help bring in international advanced 
technology, managerial expertise, funds, and trained personnel. 
The very purpose of building Sino-Russian transnational 
economic cooperation zones is to bring the largest possible 
number of commodities, equipment, raw materials, technology, and 
trained personnel of China, Russia, and other countries into the 
zones by creating a more relaxed, stable, and advantageous 
regional and international market, so that the zones will become 
the centers and hot spots of northeast Asian international 
economic cooperation, more effectively realize the large-scale 
circulation and overall coordination of the essential elements 
of production, and then promote the development of Sino-Russian 
economic and trade relations to a still higher level and sphere. 
  Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we maintain that it 
is 
not only necessary but also possible to set aside certain areas 
in Heilongjiang's Heihe and Suifenhe cities and Russia's 
Blagoveshchensk and Pogranichnyy for the establishment of 
transnational economic cooperation zones. The tentative pattern 
of the development of the zones may be as follows. Starting 
with the areas set aside, developed, and managed by China and 
Russia independently, China and Russia, aimed at their common 
prosperity, based on their natural economic ties, and backed by 
the active participation and support of the international 
community, gradually build relatively independent, complete, and 
integrated markets in these areas, establish joint organizations 
and managerial institutions in the process of developing 
infrastructural facilities, establish a coordinated system for 
division of work and cooperation based on commodity trade, and 
enable the areas to establish natural economic ties through 
division of work and cooperation, so that the economy of the 
areas set aside by both sides will be integrated, and the areas 
will ultimately become unified and complete transnational 
economic cooperation zones in the true sense.

  [Text] Harbin, April 27 (XINHUA)--Expansion of Harbin 
Airport will soon be started to prepare for the 1996 Asian 
Winter Games, official sources here said. 
  Preliminary designs for the expansion had been completed and 
approved, the sources said. Other preparations are either 
finished or under way. 
  The present airport of the capital of northeast China's 
Heilongjiang Province started operating in 1979. As the number 
of tourists has risen drastically, the sources said, it could no 
longer meet all the needs, and the opening of new routes has had 
to be delayed. 
  The airport lounges are to be enlarged to 60,000 sq.m. 
[square meters]. The plans also include building 155,000 sq.m. 
of parking lots, a new air traffic control center and support 
facilities. 
  The remodelled airport will be able to handle 6.6 million 
tourists a year by the year 2005. Destinations will be 
increased from 38 to 53 cities, including 11 cities in Canada, 
the United States, Japan, the Republic of korea, Russia and Hong 
Kong. 
  The 1.1-billion-yuan expansion work will be jointly financed 
by the central and local governments. 
  Major expansion work will be completed by February 1996, 
when 
the Asian Winter Games will be staged, the sources said.

  [Text] The provincial party school work conference ended 
this afternoon. At the conference, Gu Jinchi, secretary of the 
provincial party committee, gave an important speech on 
strengthening cadres' study and party school work. 
  Gu Jinchi pointed out: It is necessary to fully understand 
the extremely importance of strengthening cadres' study during 
the crucial period of reform and development. He said: At 
present, China is in a crucial period of reform, opening up, and 
the modernization drive. The new situation has set forth new 
study tasks for us. In the process of implementing the 
strategic objective of carrying out the second pioneering 
program, we have come across with a series of new situations and 
new problems. All cadres must exert efforts to study and 
unceasing improve themselves so as to meet the new demands and 
to undertake new tasks. 
  Gu Jinchi stressed: It is necessary to deeply implement the 
principle of integrating theory with practice and raise the work 
of party schools to a new height. He said: We must make 
painstaking efforts to properly solve the issue of integrating 
theory with practice, realistically combine theoretical study 
with Liaoning's reality, and guarantee substantial results in 
the study. At present, special efforts should be made to study 
volume no. 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and 
realistically clarify what is socialism and how to build 
socialism. 
  Gu Jinchi also stressed: Party committees at all levels 
should further strengthen leadership over party school work. He 
expressed hope that party committees at all levels and party 
schools will further recognize the situation, clearly define the 
tasks, deepen reform, work in a down-to-earth manner, push 
Liaoning's party school educational undertakings to a new stage, 
and make greater contributions to promoting reform, opening up, 
and the second pioneering program in the province.

  [Text] Shenyang, April 29 (XINHUA)--Northeast China's 
Liaoning Province has channeled billions of renminbi yuan toward 
fighting against air and water pollution. 
  As one of China's major heavy industry bases, Liaoning has 
many industries that cause serious pollution, including the 
metallurgy, chemical, paper-making and mining sectors. 
  To raise sewage disposal capacity, Liaoning plans to invest 
two billion yuan to launch the "clean water" project, which was 
initiated in 1992. 
  A pollution control program was framed to tackle industrial 
pollutants in the province's main rivers and all reservoirs. 
According to the program, some 157 enterprises in the province 
would put about one billion yuan into building 218 sewage 
treatment projects. 
  When they go into operation, these projects will be able to 
handle additional 300 million tons of waste water every year. 
  Early in 1988, the province carried out a "Blue Sky" project 
to curb air pollution in the region, which involved 14 cities, 
35 counties and 3,800 enterprises, with a total investment of 
770 million yuan. 
  All aspects of the project were completed and went into 
operation in June 1990. During the ensuing three-year period, 
nearly 20,000 boilers and furnaces were upgraded and 200 
projects for industrial pollution control were completed. 
  Shenyang city, once labelled by the world environmental 
protection organization as one of the ten most seriously 
polluted cities in the world, began to issue licenses for 
airborne emissions in 1991. 
  So far, air pollution in the city has been brought under 
control. Ash and smoke content in the air has dropped remarkably.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Zhide (2612 3112 1795)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 21 Apr (XINHUA)--In the wake of last 
year's frequent exchanges, the trend of development of 
cross-strait academic and cultural exchanges was good in the 
first quarter of this year. Both sides quickened the pace of 
exchange, expanded the number of areas of cooperation, and 
diversified the forms of exchange and cooperation. 
  So far, over 30 activities involving cross-strait academic 
and cultural exchange have been reported by newspapers and, more 
often than not, a variety of activities were conducted at the 
same time. Early this year, the China Beijing Opera Theater was 
invited to stage performances in Taiwan and a delegation of the 
Taiwan Cross-Strait Business Development Foundation visited 
Shanghai; the two events took place on both sides of the Taiwan 
Strait at the same time. In mid-January, mainland, Taiwan, and 
Hong Kong writers met in Taibei [Taipei] for a "symposium on 
Chinese novels"; meanwhile, mainland aeronautics and 
astronautics scholars arrived in Taiwan to attend a 
"cross-strait aeronautics and astronautics symposium." After 
that, a delegation of persons in charge of the central 
authorities' news units, a delegation of mainland writers, and a 
delegation of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY visited Taiwan at the same 
time. Such a situation--"good plays are successively staged one 
after another"--emerging from among cross-strait exchange 
activities reflects the ardent desire of the peoples on both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait for contact with each other and for 
mutual understanding. 
  As a result, the spheres of cross-strait academic and 
cultural exchanges have expanded. They involve scores of fields 
of endeavor, including the film and TV industry, publication, 
painting, sports, folk art, public health, environmental 
protection, and other sectors. A number of "first" exchange 
program activities appeared; a cross-strait aeronautics and 
astronautics symposium, a cross- strait insurance symposium, a 
cross-strait environmental protection symposium, a cross-strait 
operation and management symposium, and a cross-strait symposium 
on archives management and microphotography were held for the 
first time. In mid-February, famous mainland and Taiwan actors 
and actresses of Henan opera gave a performance on the same 
stage for the first time and, at the end of March, a Taiwan 
delegation of machine tool manufacturers arrived in the mainland 
for an exhibition for the first time. 
  As the spheres of cross-strait exchanges expanded, the forms 
of exchange gradually diversified. Mainland and Taiwan folk 
artists gave performances on the same stage; the mainland and 
Taiwan cooperated with each other in producing special albums 
for vocalists and in selling them concurrently in both places; 
the Taiwan Television Enterprise invited mainland actors and 
actresses to cooperate in shooting films; mainland publications 
were on display in Taiwan; and mainland and Taiwan Red Cross 
societies jointly organized winter camping activities for 
youngsters. Symposiums and exhibitions accounted for most of 
the various forms of activities because both sides could learn 
from each other by exchanging views, use each other's 
experiences for reference, learn from the others' strong points 
to offset one's weaknesses, and jointly make improvements 
through these forms of exchange. 
  Two-way exchanges in a number of spheres between the 
mainland 
and Taiwan also enjoyed new developments. Despite the fact that 
the mainland and Taiwan have conducted exchanges of news for 
several years, the visit to Taiwan by a delegation of persons in 
charge of the central authorities' press units signified a 
breakthrough. It is a consensus among scientists and 
technologists on the mainland and in Taiwan to strengthen 
cross-strait scientific and technological exchanges and 
cooperation. The visit to Taiwan made by Zhou Guangzhao, 
president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ouyang 
Zhongmou, president of the China National Electronics Import and 
Export Corporation, this year promoted cross-strait scientific 
and technological exchanges and cooperation to a new level. 
  However, the Taiwan authorities are still setting up 
obstacles to cross-strait exchange. Recently, the Taiwan 
authorities attempted to use the "Qiandao Lake Incident" as an 
excuse to suspend cross-strait cultural exchanges and to boycott 
tourists' travel to the mainland and economic exchanges. This 
entirely runs counter to the interests and desire of the peoples 
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. It is hoped that the Taiwan 
authorities will lift unreasonable restrictions and promote more 
rapid development of cross-strait academic and cultural 
exchanges.

<F P=106> ["Special report" by staff reporter: "A Clear Picture of </F>
the Qiandaohu Case"] 
  [Text] Hangzhou, 21 Apr (WEN WEI PO)--According to 
informed sources on the Qiandao Lake incident, Wu Lihong and Hu 
Zhihan, the two suspects arrested so far, used to be classmates 
in middle school and, upon graduation, returned to the 
countryside as peasants. They started plotting to rob a 
pleasure boat as early as last August. Because the lake abounds 
with overseas tourists, they made a target of those from Taiwan, 
thinking that they had more money. 
  After the Spring Festival this year, Wu and Hu stepped up 
their planning and preparation for the robbery. They bought a 
motorboat and then cruised on the lake many times to make 
observations. They discovered that between 1800 and 1900 every 
evening, there were about three tour boats traveling from Anhui 
to Chunan County Town. 
  Yu Aijun was drawn into the gang by these two a little 
later. 
After repeated observation and plotting, they decided to rob the 
last tour boat because, they thought, if they robbed the first 
or second boat, the boat in distress might call for help from 
the others. They also scheduled their action for late March and 
early April, the season of misty spring rain which would shroud 
the lake and cover their actions. 
  On 31 March, it happened to be raining and the lake was 
covered with the misty rain. At the hour which they had tested 
many times beforehand, the culprits drove their motorboat into 
the area where they were to take action. When the pleasure boat 
"Hairui" came into sight, they trailed close behind it, watching 
for their chance. Because there were a few fishing boats passing 
by or working in the vicinity, the three suspects kept putting 
off their action. As "Hairui" approached a narrow islet in the 
middle of the lake, the suspects decided to intercept it once it 
came away from the islet. 
  After they intercepted "Hairui," Wu and Hu, carrying a 
shotgun, adagger, and an axe, went aboard, while Yu stayed 
behind to control the motorboat. Wu and Hu quickly subdued the 
chief mate with their weapons. One of them took the chief 
mate's place and piloted the pleasure boat to an open area of 
the lake. When the suspects boarded the pleasure boat, a tour 
guide came over to ask what they were doing but was quickly 
subdued with the weapons. 
  As soon as the pleasure boat reached the open space, looting 
began. Weapons in hand, they forced each and every tourist to 
put all their belongings on a tea table. There was no 
resistance from the tourists. After the looting, the two 
suspects brandished the shotgun and the other weapons and herded 
the 32 tourists, tour guides, and crew members into the Hairui's 
lower crew cabin was only 17 square m in size. They then 
removed the staircase and closed the iron door to the cabin, 
locking it with twisted wire. After that, they set fire to the 
boat. Up to this point, the suspects had not fired once. 
  When the fire flared up under the influence of the wind, the 
tourists started screaming and trying desperately to break down 
the door and force their way out. Thereupon, Wu and Hu started 
firing but they did not hit anyone. Then Wu and Hu fetched the 
petroleum which they had prepared and poured it over the boat, 
aggravating the blaze. When the conflagration was devouring the 
Hairui, the frenzied suspects dived under water to look for a 
water inlet, hoping to unplug it and sink the boat but they 
could not find one. After this failed, the suspects carried 37 
kg of explosive, which they had bought beforehand, onto the 
boat, trying to blast the whole boat into splinters. However, 
they failed to detonate the explosive, so they ran away with 
their loot on their motorboat. That evening, the Chunan County 
Travel Bureau personnel waited for the Hairui on the pier till 
very late but it never came, so they informed the relevant 
authorities. The local government analyzed the situation and 
suspected that the pleasure boat might have had a breakdown on 
the lake, so they immediately appealed to the local army for 
help. The army at once sent a helicopter to search this body of 
water, which is 500 square km in area and has over 1,000 islets. 
The helicopter found the Hairui and a boat was immediately sent 
to the spot. When the rescue boat arrived at the scene, they 
found that the hull of the boat was very hot. Fearful of an 
explosion, they did not board the boat right away. Instead, 
they hosed down the Hairui to lower its temperature. Up to this 
point, because they had not seen a single body, they thought 
that at least some tourists had escaped. It was not until about 
1700 on 1 April when the Hairui was towed alongside for 
examination that the shocking scene of a corpse-packed lower 
cabin was revealed and this enormous case of robbery, arson, and 
homicide exposed. 
  It is learned that the preliminary investigation results of 
the enormous case of arson, robbery, and homicide on the Hairui 
will be publicized to the whole country by the Central 
Television Station shortly.

<F P=106> ["Letter from Beijing" by Bao Xin (7637 0207): "Reflections </F>
on the Qiandao Pleasure Boat Fire Incident"] 
  [Text] My dear brother, 
  I heard an unfortunate piece of news from Chunan County, 
Zhejiang Province, that on the afternoon of 31 March, a fire 
started on a pleasure boat when cruising Qiandao Lake with 24 
Taiwan compatriots, two local tour guides, and six crew members 
aboard, killing everyone on board. Like Taiwan people, we were 
shocked and grief-stricken when the bad news arrived. We hoped 
sincerely that there would be full cooperation between 
authorities on both sides of the strait in handling this 
unfortunate incident and dealing properly with its aftermath, 
making sure that this tourist misadventure would not affect 
relations across the straits. 
  After the incident, from what information I could gather, I 
think that concerned mainland authorities are handling this 
matter seriously. The State Council persons-in-charge, its 
Taiwan Affairs Office, National Tourism Administration, and 
Zhejiang Provincial Government and concerned departments, have 
taken the tourist accident very seriously. Luo Gan, State 
Council General Office secretary general, instructed Zhejiang 
Province officials on the morning of 2 April to quickly find out 
the cause of the fire, ascertain the number of deaths, organize 
salvage operations, and deal with the aftermath of the fire. 
The Zhejiang Province officials put together a top team to 
direct the rescue effort and begin investigations at the scene, 
search for bodies, and provide every possible convenience for 
relatives of the victims. Concerned mainland departments are 
continuing their work to settle problems arising from the 
incident, and their work has won the understanding of relatives 
of the victims. Now, the bodies of victims have all gone 
through funeral rites and have been cremated and the ashes 
brought back to Taiwan by victims' relatives. 
  Concerned departments are investigating causes behind the 
Qiandao pleasure boat fire incident and will release the results 
as soon as possible. Concerned departments will learn from the 
experience of this extraordinarily serious incident, heighten 
safety awareness, tighten safety measures, plug all loopholes, 
take preventive measures, and create good tourist conditions and 
environment in order to better serve overseas and domestic 
tourists. 
  Taiwan people were grieved by the unfortunate incident 
befalling on the 24 Taiwan compatriots. Media on the island 
over the last few days have given extensive coverage to the 
responses by Taiwan society, the strong objections of the 
island's ruling force, and speculations on the causes of the 
incident. Many Taiwan newspapers ran dispatches sent by 
reporters from the scene of the incident. I think Taiwan's 
enormous reaction to the serious incident was perfectly 
understandable. Human lives are a serious matter; and mainland 
tourist, transport, public security departments should listen 
seriously to criticisms and views and meet the reasonable 
demands of victims's relatives in order to ease their minds. 
  The Qiandao pleasure boat fire was a tourist accident of 
rarely seen seriousness and complication. This is precisely the 
reason we should remain objective and calm in our approach and 
should not be emotional, much less politicize the incident and 
make moves detrimental to cross-strait relations. Recent 
speeches and actions by some leaders of Taiwan have caused 
concern among people on the island. A Taiwanese writer pointed 
out in a newspaper article that tourist accidents are social, 
not political matters. If both officials and society wanted to 
cut down cross-strait mutual help because of the incident, it 
would be like refraining from eating for fear of choking and 
would revert the situation to before the "lifting of martial 
law." Tourist accidents can happen at Qiandao Lake as easily as 
anywhere else. 
  A high-level Taiwan "economic ministry" official asked 
Taiwan 
businessmen to temporarily suspend mainland investment in the 
aftermath of Qiandao incident. The demand was opposed by 
high-level personnel with the "Society for Taiwan Economic 
Building," who believed Qiandao to be an "isolated incident," 
and cross-strait economic ties and trade are the trend of the 
times. He also said that it was too early to make the 
conclusion that the Qiandao incident would affect cross-strait 
economic ties and trade. The trend shows that cross-strait 
economic ties and trade should continue to develop on the basis 
of mutual benefits, and authorities can only play a facilitating 
role. 
  I believe that the views of the above-mentioned two Taiwan 
personnel are quite perceptive and wise observations on the 
Qiandao incident. 
  My wish is to see concerted efforts from both shores to 
increase mutual trust, so that the shadow cast by the 
unfortunate Qiandao incident on cross-strait relations will 
disappear, the benevolent dynamic between the two shores can be 
maintained, and cross-strait relations can continue to develop.

  [Text] Beijing, April 28 (CNS)--Director-General of the 
Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC] Mr. Chen Guangyi, 
speaking at a national civil aviation security meeting here 
today, said he hoped that the Taiwan authorities would 
coordinate with the Mainland in cracking down on airline 
hijacking. 
  Airline hijacking, Mr. Chen said, was a commonly recognized 
serious crime. CAAC had adopted a series of security measures 
to prevent airline hijacking in the past two years. It required 
the Taiwan authorities to repatriate Mainland hijackers in line 
with the "Quemoy Agreement" signed in September, 1990. The 
Taiwan authorities, however, practised a policy of separating 
hijackers from the airlines and refused to repatriate them 
immediately, resulting in hijackers feeling confident of 
escaping punishment and was in fact a form of connivance with 
the hijackers. 
  Mr. Chen said that in view of the responsibility for the 
safety of life and property of passengers including Taiwan 
compatriots and the desire to promote personnel and economic 
exchange between the two sides of the strait, the Mainland 
sincerely hoped that the Taiwan authorities would positively 
coordinate with the Mainland in jointly cracking down on plane 
hijacking and that the Mainland-based ARATS and Taiwan-based SEF 
would reach an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers as 
soon as possible. 
  Mr. Chen also said that the Mainland had noted the promise 
made by the Taiwan authorities that they would not grant 
political asylum to hijackers and would punish them severely. 
It also noted the consensus achieved by ARATS and SEF on the 
repatriation of all hijackers in principle and reached a basic 
framework for the agreement regarding such repatriation. The 
Mainland thanked figures from various sectors in Taiwan for 
their support for repatriation of hijackers as soon as possible. 
Mr. Chen said he believed that so long as the two sides 
cooperated and made joint efforts to seriously crack down on the 
crime of hijacking and made immediate repatriation of hijackers, 
such crime would be halted and the safety of passengers and 
property guaranteed.

  [Text] The Seventh Security Police Group under the 
National Political Administration has completed its first patrol 
mission in the South China Sea. Minister of the Interior Wu 
Po-hsiung said: We will carry out such missions irregularly in 
the future, which is of great significance for claiming our 
sovereignty in the South China Sea. This will also focus 
international attention on the fact of our presence in the 
Nansha Islands [Spratlys]. 
  Two 400-ton patrol boats of the Seventh Security Police 
Group 
have completed their first 12-day patrol mission in the South 
China Sea. This is the first time that our country has 
exercised its police power in the South China Sea. 
  Minister Wu Po-hsiung said: The construction of satellite 
communication facilities on Taiping Island will soon be 
completed. With that island as a base, we will serve various 
countries with weather reports. We will build wharves there. 
But for the time being, we have no plans to build an airport 
there. 
  Minister Wu Po-hsiung said: What is most important is that 
we want the international community to know the fact of our 
presence in the Nansha Islands. Having legally occupied Taiping 
Island for a long time, we have a legal claim on its territory. 
  The two patrol boats were commanded by Chang Chen-chung of 
the Seventh Security Police Group. He said: During the patrol, 
his boats did not clash with any vessels of the Chinese 
communist Navy or the Vietnamese Navy, but discovered that 
Vietnam was building in a way on [name of island indistinct), 
one of the Nansha Islands. This shows that Vietnam attaches 
increasing importance to its right to exploit resources in the 
South China Sea. This cannot but cause our government to pay 
close attention to our rights there. 
  However, Wu Po-hsiung stressed: We do not want to cause any 
confrontation or tensions in the South China Sea, but hope to 
exploit various resources there along with other countries.

  [Text] Taipei, April 28 KYODO--Taiwan's Transportation and 
Communications Minister Liu Chao-shiun on Thursday [28 April] 
said that the government will instruct China Airlines to 
sufficiently improve its safety measures in the wake of its 
jetliner crash at Nagoya airport in central Japan, which killed 
263 people. 
  Liu, speaking at a cabinet meeting, said if the national 
flag 
carrier fails to implement the instruction demand within a 
specific period, the government may suspend some of its routes. 
  Li also said the government will take some disciplinary 
measures against China Airlines in connection with the Tuesday 
crash. 
  Earlier in the day, President Li Teng-hui reportedly told a 
meeting of the Central Committee of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist 
Party (Kuomintang) that a special committee has been set up 
within the Transportation and Communications Ministry to 
supervise corrective measures to be undertaken by China Airlines 
in the aftermath of the crash. 
  All but eight of the aircraft's 271 passengers and crew, 
mostly Japanese and Taiwanese, were killed in the crash of the 
Airbus A300- 600R, arriving in Nagoya from Taipei. Two of the 
survivors are Taiwanese. 
  It was the fifth China Airlines crash since 1986 and the 
11th 
since 1969, giving the airline a significantly higher ratio of 
crashes per flight hours than the world average. 
  Many of the crashes, in which a total of 410 people have 
died, involved human error.

  [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--Vice Economic Affairs 
Minister Sheu Ke-sheng will lead a delegation to the United 
States next month to attend the second round of tariff talks 
between Taipei and Washington under the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) framework. 
  At the top of the agenda during the May 12-13 talks will be 
the size or Taiwan's tariff cuts, revisions to Taiwan's alcohol 
and tobacco monopoly system, government procurement agreements, 
and the opening of Taiwan's agricultural markets. 
  In addition, sources said that the United States will soon 
submit a list of tariff requests for Taiwan's service industry. 
The U.S. is expected to ask Taiwan to open its transportation, 
telecommunications, banking, stock and futures markets. 
  Economics Ministry officials said they hope the two sides 
will reach an agreement during the talks, which will then 
encourage other countries to hold bilateral tariff talks with 
Taiwan. 
  The successful conclusion of Taipei-Washington talks will 
also facilitate Taiwan's bid to enter the world trade body, the 
officials said. 
  After the first round of talks in Taipei, Taiwan agreed to 
reduce tariffs on some of the 699 farm and industrial products 
on a U.S. list within the near future. Other reductions will 
come later after revisions of related laws and regulations, 
according to the Board of Foreign Trade. 
  Sheu will leave for the United States May 9. After the 
talks, he will travel to Geneva where he will attend the fifth 
meeting of the GATT working party responsible for reviewing 
Taiwan's bid to enter into the world trade body. 
  Sheu is expected to hold tariff talks with Mexico and Canada 
during the meeting. 
  Taiwan was granted GATT observer status in September 1992 
and 
hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.

<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--The exodus of 
labor-intensive industries to Mainland China and Southeast Asia 
has taken its toll on Taiwan's export business, the Council for 
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday [29 April]. 
  Exports grew a marginal 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 
this year, far lower than the originally targeted 4.6 percent 
growth. Outbound shipments in the first two weeks of April also 
dropped 8.1 percent as compared with the same period last year. 
  Responding to the lackluster trend, the CEPD said it has 
decided to lower the export growth target for this year to 5 
percent from the previously-set 7.2 percent. 
  K.C. Li, director of the CEPD's Economic Research 
Department, 
attributed the slow export growth to several factors: 
  -- The exodus of labor-intensive industries to Mainland 
China 
and Southeast Asian countries has curtailed Taiwan's exports of 
furniture, toys, textiles and footwear. 
  -- Growth in exports of high-technology or high value-added 
products is too slow to make up for decreases in labor-intensive 
exports. 
  -- Sales to the mainland have declined since Beijing 
implemented economic austerity programs in the second half of 
last year. Moreover, many Taiwan-owned companies on the mainland 
have opted to purchase needed raw materials there instead of 
Taiwan to save transport costs. Growth in mainland-bound 
shipments slid from last year's 28 percent to only 9.5 percent 
in the first quarter of this year. 
  However, Li said further study is needed before concluding 
that Taiwan's export trade faces the threat of recession as a 
result of the exodus of labor-intensive industries. 
  Li pointed out that despite a slowdown in exports, other 
major economic indicators showed signs of improvement in the 
January-March period. For example, overall industrial 
production rose 5.9 percent from the year-earlier level. 
Textile production increased 5.93 percent, chemical output 
climbed 16.4 percent, petrochemical production advanced 8.25 
percent, electronics and computer output also registered gains. 
  Li said domestic demand accounted for 54 percent of total 
sales in the first quarter, while foreign demand made up 46 
percent. 
  As export orders received in the first quarter rose 5.39 
percent from the year-earlier level, Li said outbound shipments 
will gradually regain momentum in the coming months. 
  With domestic and foreign demand increasing and industrial 
output growing, Li said, the country will still be able to 
register at least 6 percent economic growth this year.

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Francis Deron: "Statement </F>
by Taiwanese Foreign Minister--Taiwan Unruffled by French 
Reconciliation With Beijing"] 
  [Text] Taipei--One would have expected more bitterness from 
Taiwan following Paris' recent political turnabout with respect 
to China and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's trip to Beijing. 
After all, when General de Gaulle had the French Embassy in 
China transferred to the mainland in 1964, it was Taipei that 
severed relations. 
  How things change! While Taipei still claims, as does 
Beijing, that it is the "only legitimate government" of the 
whole Chinese territory, pragmatism prevails in the capital of 
the non-Communist island, whose government is urging France to 
remain "realistic." In essence, the Taiwanese regime wants to 
put an end to the Manichean tradition of many Western countries, 
which in their relations with the Chinese world tend to choose 
either for Taiwan or for mainland China . 
  Such is the underlying message of the statements to LE MONDE 
by Taiwanese Foreign Minister Frederick Chien, who appeared 
surprisingly serene following the first concerns after the 
normalization of Franco-Chinese relations. "The aim of the 
(French) prime minister's visit (to mainland China) was not to 
damage relations between France and Taiwan. Accordingly, I 
think that we shall maintain the same relationship as we did 
before Mr. Balladur's trip," he said. 
  However, Taiwanese feelings were hurt by two aspects of 
France's new policy. First, in its 12 January joint communique 
with Beijing, France acknowledged for the first time the PRC 
point of view that Taiwan "is an integral part of China." The 
joint communique of 1964 on the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between Paris and Beijing had been more restrained, 
leaving Communist China free to interpret it the way it saw fit, 
but expressing no agreement on the part of France. Only in a 
recent text -- of a purely technical nature, since it referred 
to air connections between France and the two rival Chinese 
capitals -- has France acknowledged Beijing's position. 
<H5>  Intertwined </H5>
  "While there is only one China," Mr. Chien notes, "it is 
unfortunately divided into two political entities. The PRC 
rules over the whole mainland territory, and the Chinese 
Republic rules over Taiwan as well as the Quemoy, Pescadores, 
and Matzu islands. These are the jurisdictional boundaries of 
the two entities. We sincerely hope that France will be 
realistic enough to accept this fact: The PRC's claim of 
sovereignty (over Taiwan) is not based on today's de facto 
situation." Besides, he adds, this has been going on for 45 
years: "You may have a visa for mainland China, but you will 
not have any use for it here!" 
  Another cause for disappointment for the Taiwanese has been 
the return of the notion--expressed by, among others, [French] 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe before Mr. Balladur's visit to 
mainland China -- that the Taiwanese market (20 million people) 
is a tiny one compared to that of the mainland (1.15 billion 
people). "Look at per-capita income figures: $350 on the 
mainland, compared with $10,000 here. The PRC is not as large a 
market as Mr. Juppe seems to think it is." 
  Mr. Chien does not mention what many French businessmen and 
economic experts have been anticipating: Ultimately, unless 
tensions between Taiwan and the mainland become worse than what 
they currently are, Taiwanese entrepreneurs and financiers will 
play a key role in many industrialization projects on the 
mainland. They think that this at least is a trend that can no 
longer be ignored, since the two economies have become so 
intertwined that 30-year-old views of the two-headed Chinese 
world have become anachronistic. 
  This is a fact that should be taken into account during the 
upcoming visits to the two Chinas of [French] Foreign Trade and 
Industry Minister Gerard Longuet: One to Beijing, where he has 
promised to head an industrial mission, and one to Taipei, where 
he is to inaugurate a French industrial high-technology 
exhibition in July. Seeing how the Chinese police went about 
harassing people during Mr. Balladur's trip to the mainland, the 
true magnitude of the "Chinese challenge" is becoming apparent 
for French exports to both Chinas.

  [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Answering a reporter's 
question at a news conference this afternoon, a spokesman of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the report about 
China having sent additional troops to the Sino-India border is 
a "sheer fabrication" [chun shu nie zao 4783 1466 2250 6644]. 
  A reporter asked: According to a report, China recently sent 
additional 30,000 troops into Tibet and deployed them along the 
Sino-Indian border areas. Please confirm and comment. 
  The spokesman said: The report is sheer fabrication. Last 
year the Chinese and Indian Governments signed an accord on 
maintaining peace and tranquility in areas along the Line of 
Actual Control, and the two countries have also started 
discussing issues about reducing troops in areas along the line. 
Spreading the lie that China has sent an additional 30,000 
troops to the Sino-Indian border areas is obviously out of 
ulterior motives.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 28 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslim leader 
Alija Izetbegovic [spelling of name as received] today proposed 
a new temporary cease-fire in Bosnia in order to seek a 
comprehensive settlement of the crisis. 
  He made this proposal in the Sarajevo while meeting the 
newly 
established "contact group" on Bosnia, which consists of Russia, 
the European Union (EU), the United States and the United 
Nations. 
  After visiting Bosnia, the group, set up early this month in 
London, will prepare a report within a week for a ministerial 
meeting of the U.S., Britain, France, Germany and Russia. 
  This new group, headed by Lord Owen, an EU envoy for Bosnia, 
will also meet Bosnian Serb and Croatian leaders. 
  The task of the group is to ensure a two- to three- month 
peace in Bosnia, map out a comprehensive settlement, and draw up 
a plan for the division of territory.

<F P=106> [By reporter Ying Qian (2019 6197)] </F>
  [Text] Morristown (New Jersey), 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- At the 
U.S. Government's invitation, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of 
China's State Council, arrived at Morristown in New Jersey State 
in the small hours of 28 April for an official visit to the 
United States. 
  Zou Jiahua arrived here after attending the funeral service 
for former U.S. President Nixon in California. 
  During the visit, Zou Jiahua will meet U.S. leaders in 
Washington and deliver a speech by invitation at the U.S.-China 
National Trade Commission. He will also meet with people from 
various circles -- industrial, commercial, and business -- in 
the United States, as well as tour some important infrastructure 
facilities and enterprises that maintain economic and trade 
relations with China. AT&amp;T, which is located near Morristown, 
will be the first U.S. company he will tour. 
  Upon arriving at Morristown Airport, Zou Jiahua said the 
main 
purpose of his visit is to enhance mutual understanding, promote 
Sino-U.S. friendship, and expand mutually beneficial 
cooperation. He said he was looking forward to exchanging views 
with the U.S. side on issues of common concern, such as 
Sino-U.S. relations and Sino-U.S. economic cooperation and 
trade, so as to promote the further improvement and development 
of relations between the two countries. 
  He added: China and the United States share wide-ranging 
common interests and are highly complementary to each other in 
many areas such as economics and trade. There are vast 
potential and broad prospects for expanding mutually beneficial 
cooperation. Maintaining normal and good relations between the 
two countries is not only in the fundamental interests of the 
two peoples but also represents the wishes of the world's people 
and has an important effect on promoting world peace and 
stability and economic development. Differences between China 
and the United States should be solved step by step through 
dialogue and consultation between the two sides on an equal 
basis. The Chinese Government has always attached importance to 
its relations with the United States, and hopes that the two 
sides will build up trust, reduce trouble, expand cooperation, 
and refrain from confrontation. 
  Accompanying Zou Jiahua on his visit to the United States 
are 
Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of the State Planning Commission; Liu 
Huaqiu, vice foreign minister; and Zheng Silin, vice minister of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation.

  [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], April 27 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese 
escort group of Buddha tooth relic to Myanmar [Burma] led by 
Ven. Ming Yang, vice president of The Buddhist association of 
China (BAC) left here for home this afternoon after ending a one 
week visit to Myanmar. 
  The group was seen off by Myanmar Minister for Religious

  [Text] Sanaa, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Bloody fighting erupted 
this afternoon in the town of Omran, north of the capital Sanaa, 
between northern and southern Yemeni forces, informed sources 
told XINHUA here today. 
  The sources said the fighting between the Third Brigade of 
the south stationed there and the First Brigade of the north 
claimed a number of deaths and injuries. 
  This was the fifth clash between northern and southern 
troops 
since February 21, one day after the feuding president, 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih, and the vice-president, 'Ali Salim al-Bid, 
signed their reconciliation accord in Amman. 
  The fighting took place after President Salih warned that 
"anyone trying to disrupt Yemen's unity and its national ranks 
will pay a dear price." 
  He called on the entire Yemeni people to remain vigilant 
against "separatists and powers opposed to the unity of Yemen." 
  He call was made at a mass rally held in Sanaa to 
commemorate 
the first anniversary of Yemen's multiparty general elections. 
  The Yemeni president, who heads the General People's 
Congress, accused leaders of the Yemen Socialist Party headed by 
Al-Bid of shuttling in some Arab capitals to raise funds for the 
purchase of mines and guns with the aim of "aborting the process 
of unity and democracy." 
  Vice President Al-Bid and Salim Salih Muhammad, one of the 
Socialist Party's leaders had recently visited Saudi Arabia, 
Kuwait and some other Gulf states. 
  North and South Yemen merged in May 1990 to form the United 
Republic of Yemen. 
  The political crisis developed last August when Vice 
President Al-Bid returned to Aden, capital of the former South 
Yemen and refused to return to Sanaa. 
  The two men were said to have sharp policy differences over 
a 
number of key issues of the Republic. 
  The crisis has continued despite repeated Arab mediation 
efforts to reconcile the two parties and end the feud. 
  Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have tried to arrange a 
reconciliation conference between Salih and Al-Bid. Jordan and 
Oman previously arranged such meetings but failed to bridge 
their differences. 
  A joint Omani, Jordanian, American and French military 
commission formed at the end of February to prevent military 
clashes in Yemen have called for restraint by both sides.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- At the invitation of 
Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray, Premier Li Peng arrived here 
by a special plane at 1630 local time on 28 April to begin a 
two-day official visit to Mongolia. 
  When Li Peng walked down from the ramp, Jasray stepped 
forward to cordially shake hands with him and then extended a 
warm welcome to him. A group of Mongolian children dressed in 
colorful national costumes presented flowers to the Chinese 
guests. 
  A solemn welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. The 
band played the national anthems of China and Mongolia, followed 
by a 19-gun salute. Accompanied by Jasray, Li Peng viewed an 
honor guard from the Mongolian People's Army. 
  Welcoming Li Peng and his party at the airport today were 
also Mongolian Deputy Prime Minister Choyjilsurengiyn Purebdorj 
and Foreign Minister Tserenpiliyn Gombosuren. 
  Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Pei Jiayi and others also 
went 
to the airport to welcome Li Peng. 
  Those who accompanied Li Peng on the visit were: Zhu Lin, Li 
Peng's wife; Ismail Amat, state councillor and chairman of the 
State Nationalities Affairs Commission; Qi Huaiyuan, director of 
the Office of Foreign Affairs under the State Council; Wuliji, 
chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regional People's 
Government; Wang Mengkui, deputy director of the State Council 
Research Office; Deputy Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan; and Liu 
Shanzai, deputy minister of foreign trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  Li Peng issued a statement at the airport. He said: China 
and Mongolia are two countries linked by mountains and rivers, 
and there has been traditional friendship between the people of 
the two countries. We are happy to see the gratifying expansion 
of Sino- Mongolian friendly relations and cooperation in all 
fields in the past few years thanks to the concerted efforts by 
both sides. The maintenance and development of a friendly and 
good-neighbor relationship between China and Mongolia conforms 
with the common wishes and fundamental interests of the two 
peoples, and it will benefit peace, stability, and development 
in the Asia-Pacific region as well. 
  Today in Ulaanbaatar, the grassland capital, the spring 
breeze was warm and the sun was bright. (Buyintuho) 
International Airport was decorated to welcome the guests. The 
national flags of China and Mongolia were fluttering in the 
square in front of the place where the plane was to park. In 
front of the lounge there was hung a huge banner on which was 
written in Chinese and Mongolian, "A warm welcome to the 
respected Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic 
of China Li Peng and Madam Zhu Lin." 
  This is the first visit by a Chinese premier in 34 years 
since Premier Zhou Enlai visited Mongolia in 1960.

  [Text] Beijing, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Chairman Li Ruihuan 
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) met here this afternoon with 
diplomatic envoys from five European countries. 
  At the invitation of the governments of Finland, Sweden, 
Norway and Denmark and the Chamber of Representatives and the 
Senate of Belgium, Li will pay official goodwill visits to the 
five countries from May 2 to 21. 
  During the meeting, Li and the diplomats exchanged views on 
the furthering of China's ties with these five countries. 
  Li expressed thanks to these countries for their careful 
arrangements of the visits. 
  "This will be the first trip to Europe by a CPPCC chairman," 
Li told the four ambassadors and one minister-counsellor, saying 
he is looking forward to the visit and the contacts with leaders 
of the five governments and parliaments as well as peoples of 
these countries. 
  The visit is aimed at enhancing mutual understanding, 
expanding exchanges and strengthening cooperation between China 
and the five countries, he noted. 
  China and these countries maintain good ties, which have 
been 
furthered in the past few years. High-level contacts have been 
on the rise and the economic, trade, scientific and 
technological cooperation and cultural exchanges have borne new 
fruit, he said. 
  The two-way trade volume between China and the five 
countries 
has increased by a big margin, he added, voicing the hope that 
potentials be tapped to further expand trade and economic 
cooperation. 
  The five countries have plenty of advanced science and 
technology and management expertise that China should draw from, 
he said. 
  China and the five countries have no conflicts of 
fundamental 
interests and share much common ground on the maintenance of 
peace and promoting common development, he noted. 
  China is ready to further develop its ties with the five 
countries on the principles of seeking common ground while 
reserving differences, mutual respect, non-interference in each 
other's internal affairs and equality and mutual benefit. 
  "The CPPCC is willing to make new efforts for the promotion 
of the existing friendly ties between China and the five 
European countries," he said. 
  Denmark Ambassador to China William Friis-Moller expressed 
his welcome to Li's visit on behalf of the five countries' 
diplomats. 
  The visit has drawn attention from the governments and 
peoples of the five countries, he said. 
  He expressed the hope that the visit will deepen mutual 
understanding, promote the development of bilateral ties and 
provide a chance for the five governments and parliaments to 
know more about China.

  [Text] Montevideo, 19 Apr (XINHUA) -- During his cordial 
meeting with a CPC delegation headed by Hu Jintao, member of the 
Political Bureau Standing Committee and the Secretariat of the 
CPC Central Committee, at the presidential villa in Colonia 
Province on 19 April, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle 
said, "Uruguay places great hopes on strengthening its 
friendship and relations with China." 
  During the meeting, Hu Jintao first extended greetings to 
President Lacalle from President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li 
Peng. He said: Although the CPC delegation's visit to Uruguay 
has been very short, we were welcomed and treated warmly by the 
Blanco Party and the Uruguayan Government. Hu Jintao praised 
Uruguay's social stability, continuous economic development, 
independent and peaceful foreign policy, and active 
participation in international affairs. He said that Uruguay has 
become a respected member of the Latin American and 
international communities. 
  Speaking on the international situation, Hu Jintao said: The 
world currently is undergoing drastic and complicated changes. 
The old world structure has collapsed and the new one has not 
yet been formed. China and Uruguay should strengthen 
cooperation with the masses of developing countries and make 
concerted efforts to establish a fair and rational new 
international order. 
  President Lacalle stated: At present, ongoing changes in the 
world indicate that China is becoming one of the world's most 
important countries. Uruguay places great hopes on 
strengthening its friendly and cooperative relations with China. 
I hope that our relations will not only be limited to the field 
of trade. We should also strengthen our ties in the political, 
cultural, and other fields. 
  President Lacalle continued: At present, in the unstable and 
changeable world situation, countries sharing common interests 
should form economic blocs to make the best use of their unified 
strength. South American countries hope to form a large 
community and to turn our region into an important region of the 
world. Hu Jintao said: China praises Latin American countries' 
efforts in promoting regional unity, and I sincerely hope that 
the integration of Latin America will succeed. 
  Hu Jintao and his party arrived in Montevideo on the evening 
of 18 April to begin a friendly visit to Uruguay. On the same 
evening, the CPC delegation and the National Leadership 
Committee of the Uruguayan Blanco Party held working 
consultations. Both sides briefed each other on their party and 
national situations and exchanged opinions on international 
issues of common concern and on ways to further strengthen 
bilateral ties. After the talks, the National Leadership 
Committee of the Uruguayan Blanco Party gave a party to welcome 
the CPC delegation.

<F P=106> ["Beijing Political Situation" column article by Jen Hui-wen </F>
(0117 1979 2429) in Beijing on 27 April 1994: "The CPC's 
Purpose in Making Zhu Rongji Acting Premier"] 
  [Text] Chinese Premier Li Peng left Beijing on 18 April to 
pay official visits to Uzbekistan and other Central Asian 
countries. At the news conference held at the Great Hall of the 
People before his departure, Li Peng announced that Vice Premier 
Zhu Rongji would be acting premier of the State Council during 
his foreign visit. As everyone knows, during the last term of 
the State Council, each time Li Peng made a foreign visit, he 
announced that then executive vice premier Yao Yilin was acting 
premier. Since Zhu Rongji became vice premier in 1991, this was 
the first time he had become acting premier. Why did the 
Chinese authorities make such a decision? What was the purpose 
of such an arrangement? 
  Let us first see how the decision was made. According to 
sources in Beijing, the appointment of Zhu Rongji as acting 
premier was one of the personnel arrangements made by the CPC 
top leadership recently, and these arrangements included: 
  1. In accordance with the actual needs of the work of the 
State Council, during Li Peng's foreign visits and his absence 
from Beijing on other official missions, Zhu Rongji will be 
acting premier of the State Council. 
  2. Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua are executive vice premiers of 
the State Council. 
  3. The party leading group of the State Council is composed 
of Li Peng as secretary, Zhu Rongji as deputy secretary, and 
Qian Qichen (vice premier and foreign minister), Chi Haotian 
(state councillor and national defense minister), and Luo Gan 
(state councillor and seretary general) as members of the 
Standing Committee. 
  4. Tian Jiyun, Wang Hanbin, Qin Jiwei, and Ni Zhifu are 
executive vice chairmen of the Standing Committee of the 
National People's Congress [NPC]. 
  People in Beijing political circles held that the 
above-mentioned personnel arrangements were made according to 
the work performances of the individuals and the needs of the 
work. Such arrangements also balanced representatives from the 
party, the government, and the military. So they were favorable 
to strengthening unity in the top leading bodies and to 
quickening the pace of establishing the new market economic 
structure. Thus, the authorities will more effectively carry 
out the domestic and foreign policies of maintaining 
independence and extensively making friends in the world. The 
arrangements also indicated that the status of Zhu Rongji and 
Qian Qichen had been raised, and that they would shoulder 
greater responsibilities. The two political rising stars will 
play more important roles in China's domestic and foreign 
affairs in the future if things do not go beyond general 
expectations. Qian Qichen, who is also deputy leader of the CPC 
Central Leading Group for Taiwan Affairs, will also have a 
weightier say on the CPC's policy toward Taiwan, Hong Kong, and 
Macao. 
  The sources also revealed that the CPC top leadership's 
decision on appointing Zhu Rongji as acting premier was made in 
accordance with a proposal by Deng Xiaoping. During the NPC 
session in March this year, Deng Xiaoping twice mentioned the 
need to create the post of acting premier. 
  Once, Deng Xiaoping met with Qian Qichen and listened to 
Qian's report about recent diplomatic work. Afterward, Deng 
said: "Is Big Peng (Li Peng) in good health? He should take 
care of his health. He is still young and will have to do a lot 
of work. The workload in the State Council is heavy. I think 
that in the future when the premier makes foreign visits, an 
acting premier should be appointed to take charge of the State 
Council's routine work. Can the Political Bureau consider this?" 
  On another occasion, on 22 March, Deng Xiaoping met with 
party and government leaders of some provinces, autonomous 
regions, and municipalities. He talked about two issues. One 
was the need to safeguard the authority of the CPC Central 
Committee and the State Council; and the other was the 
reiteration of the need to "have two strong hands." He stressed 
that they must not have only one strong hand, with the other 
hand remaining weak, and should first toughen the style of the 
leading body. When talking about the work of the State Council, 
Deng said: "The workload of the State Council is heavier than 
before, but they are cooperating quite well. It is right that 
they continue to cooperate although there is division of work 
among them. Last year, Big Peng was ill for some time, and 
Rongji did a lot of work. Qichen also shared the workload. 
According to the needs of the work, the State Council should 
create the post of acting premier in the future. The State 
Council is a governmental institution, and it is different from 
the party's central Political Bureau and the Central Military 
Commission." 
  Obviously, Deng Xiaoping's proposal on creating the post of 
acting premier was aimed at making Zhu Rongji acting premier 
during Li Peng's foreign visits. The CPC central leading body 
understood this and immediately made the corresponding decision. 
This showed that although Deng Xiaoping had long withdrawn from 
the political stage, he still influenced the decisionmaking 
operation of the third-generation leading collective of the CPC 
in the capacity of a CPC member and a people's deputy. This may 
be regarded as Deng Xiaoping's thoughtful support for the 
third-generation leading body, but it also showed that the 
current leading body still lacked the insight and courage to 
make independent decisions. This was precisely one of the 
reasons why people could not trust them unreservedly. 
  The sources said that it was true that Zhu Rongji was 
promoted and appointed to such a crucially important top leading 
post because he was able and especially had the ability to 
handle economic affairs, but that he would not have the status 
he has today without Deng Xiaoping's bold recommendation. In 
the eyes of leftist-minded leaders, Zhu Rongji, who was labeled 
a rightist in the past, could never be a politically reliable 
person. Only Deng Xiaoping had the ability to remove this 
obstruction. 
  So, how did Deng Xiaoping discover Zhu Rongji? After the 4 
June Incident in 1989, Deng Xiaoping continued to seek someone 
who was able to open up a new path for reform. From Zhu 
Rongji's work performance as mayor of Shanghai, Deng felt that 
Zhu should be the right man. In early February 1991, as Deng 
Xiaoping had the intention of promoting Zhu to be vice premier 
of the State Council, he went to Shanghai with Li Xiannian and 
Yang Shangkun, and consulted them on this idea. In Shanghai, 
when Zhu Rongji reported to Deng Xiaoping on the plan to first 
develop financial business, trade, and infrastructural 
facilities in Pudong's development, Deng Xiaoping expressed 
appreciation again and again, and said: "I have been saying 
that we should have new ideas for reform, and that means new 
methods and measures different from those in the previous 10 
years should be worked out. So we need to study the new 
conditions, and explore new ways. The key lies in further 
emancipating the mind. The planned economy should not be 
equated with socialism, and the market economy should not be 
equated with capitalism, because there is planning in capitalism 
and there is a market in socialism. We cannot be bogged down in 
a new form of ideological ossification on this issue." Deng 
Xiaoping not only expressed this idea to Zhu Rongji, but also 
selected Zhu for the "premier body" later. Obviously, Deng hoped 
that Zhu would be more open-minded in creating a new situation 
in reform and opening. 
  After Zhu Rongji was promoted to be vice premier, Deng 
Xiaoping again named him as a member of his entourage on his 
inspection tour to Shougang [7445 6921] in May that year. Deng 
praised Zhu Rongji for being an able person with economic 
knowledge. Zhu did not let him down, and successfully fulfilled 
a number of tough tasks, including the settlement of the 
accumulated debt chains, the arrangements for adjusting the 
industrial and production structure, the transformation of the 
operation mechanism of the state-owned enterprises, the pilot 
schemes for adopting the joint-stock system, and the 
preparations for and reestablishment of the State Economic 
Commission. Zhu's work was widely praised and appreciated by 
people in economic and other circles. Since June 1993 he has 
further successfully organized macrocontrol and rectified the 
overheated economy. Deng not only praised Zhu but also 
instructed him to "turn the banks into true banks" rather than 
"currency-issuing companies or state treasuries." In November 
1993, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central 
Committee adopted the "Decision on Building the Socialist Market 
Economic Structure." After that, Zhu Rongji became the top 
architect of the banking and taxation reforms in the course of 
building the socialist market economic structure, and was 
regarded as one who had the best understanding of Deng 
Xiaoping's line. He became number two man in the State Council 
next to Li Peng, and naturally held the position of first vice 
premier. 
  However, Zhu Rongji is also facing various difficulties in 
the deep-going economic structural reform. For example, debt 
chains are accumulating again; the situation in which 
state-owned enterprises continue to incur serious losses has not 
yet been thoroughly changed; and inflation is becoming more 
serious. All these will be new tests for him. Time will prove 
whether he can tide over the difficulties and create a new 
situation.

<F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Wang Juntao Speaks on China's </F>
Changing Situation"] 
  [Text] Noted Chinese dissident Wang Juntao, who is in the 
United States, finally disregarded wife Hou Xiaotian's 
exhortations and no longer responded to reporters' questions 
with the two words: "Thank you." 
  After staying in jail for five years to complete the 
"required course" for his being a "professional politician," 
Wang Juntao still kept his candid, self-confident style. A few 
days ago, he told reporters: "I, Wang Juntao, never evade any 
questions." 
  Wang Juntao was quoted in Taiwan's CHINA TIMES and UNITED 
DAILY as saying that after going into jail, he once was 
handcuffed and placed in confinement for protesting against the 
authorities' decision to stop letting him met his wife, but 
apart from that, he was treated well by the prison authorities 
most of the time. It has been learned that the Ministry of 
Justice -- the highest administrative unit of prisons in the 
mainland -- had given clear instructions: "Anyone (warders) who 
harasses Wang Juntao will be punished." 
  However, Wang Juntao said that he did not enjoy preferential 
treatment right from the beginning, but that his conditions 
improved every year. After being arrested in Changsha, Hunan, 
in 1989, he was locked up in Wuhan Public Security Bureau's 
detention center, then transferred immediately to that noted 
concentration center for political prisoners -- Beijing's 
Qincheng Prison. In 1991, he was condemned to 13 years' 
imprisonment and served his sentence in Beijing's No. 2 Prison 
and in Yanqing Prison. In his first year of prison life, he was 
locked up in a stinking, messy prison cell. In the second year, 
he contracted hepatitis-B and was sent to hospital for 
treatment, but he was still undernourished. In the third year, 
newspapers and periodicals were available, and a TV set and a 
Hi-Fi system were set up in his prison cell. Moreover, there 
was a refrigerator and he could eat anything he liked. To his 
surprise, he was sent to the No. 301 Hospital -- the best 
military hospital -- and received specialist treatment when he 
fell ill. 
  Wang Juntao claimed that he and the warders got along quite 
well and that they called each other "brothers" in private. 
When he left the prison, a warder asked him: "Will you bear a 
grudge against me?" Wang patted the warder's arm and said: "I 
understand your plight. In the future, I will treat you 
leniently." 
  Wang Juntao smiled: "I am not grateful to the CPC simply 
because of my enjoying preferential treatment. I would not 
accept the charges against me, even if I were locked up in 
Zhongnanhai because it was absolutely unjustifiable and illegal 
to sentence me to 13 years' imprisonment. I was deprived of my 
freedom illegally, I must defend my political integrity, and I 
must appear stronger than they.... So it was not that they 
reprimanded me, but that they educated us in the prison" [suo yi 
zai jian yu li bu shi ta men xun chi wo er shi jiao yu wo men 
2076 0110 0961 4148 3739 5937 0008 2508 0100 0226 6064 2444 2053 
5079 2508 2403 5148 2053 0226]." 
  As people inside and outside the mainland were particularly 
concerned about the cases of Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, and 
because Hou Xiaotian made unremitting appeals to the 
international community on her husband's behalf, the Chinese 
authorities were forced to consider Wang's release, even if he 
did not suffer any physical torture in the prison. In last 
November, when the APEC summit was held in Seattle, U.S. 
President Clinton brought up Wang Juntao's case in the presence 
of CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin. This year, in order to get 
the United States to extend its MFN treatment, China took 
quicker steps to release Wang Juntao. A month ago, Hou Xiaotian 
was informed of her husband's forthcoming release, while Wang 
Juntao also was notified of this news in prison. 
  On 18 April, a deputy director of the Administration of 
Reform Through Labor of the Chinese Ministry of Justice came to 
Wang Juntao's medical ward and said to him: "To respond to the 
U.S. Government's request, we have consented to let you go to 
the United States for medical treatment." 
  Wang Juntao was extremely grieved and tears started from his 
eyes, as a Chinese citizen being treated inhumanely cannot 
ameliorate his fate until foreigners step in, and he even had to 
go abroad to cure his illness! He asked in reply: "What if I 
do not agree?" The deputy director said: "You may disagree, 
but then you must remain here." 
  Finally, Wang Juntao compromised with the authorities. He 
told reporters: "I could not lose this opportunity. I married 
Xiaotian in 1986, but we have been separated from each other for 
five out of the past seven years; she pays a too high price for 
us. However, I stated clearly to the deputy director of the 
Administration of Reform Through Labor that my consent to go to 
the United States did not imply that I confessed myself guilty. 
The deputy director said: `You have not reformed yourself 
well.'" 
  Soon afterward, the official politely said that the 
authorities placed three hopes on him, stressing that "this is 
not a request": 
  1. Devote your energies to receiving medical treatment. 
  2. Pay attention to your health, and do not carry out any 
activities unrelated to this. 
  3. Remember that you are a Chinese, and do not do anything 
to 
harm your motherland's interests. 
  Wang Juntao immediately said that it was necessary to 
clarify 
the meaning of "motherland" since the "motherland" should not 
represent the interests of only a few. 
  The authorities concerned hinted that if Wang Juntao 
"behaved 
well" outside the country, this would contribute to the release 
of other dissidents. Hence, on the day when he arrived at New 
York's Kennedy International Airport, Wang Juntao said he felt 
"vexed" at himself. He was worried that his friends in prison, 
including Chen Ziming and Liu Gang, would be implicated, so he 
could not speak out freely. 
  It was precisely such a "not well-reformed prisoner" who 
was sent, with many officials crowding around, to Beijing 
International Airport on the morning of 22 April. At the 
airport, officials shook hands with him and extended their 
congratulations one after another. Moreover, "humane" 
arrangements were made to allow his father, a lieutenant 
general, and his relatives in Beijing to bid him farewell in the 
airport's VIP lounge. At that time, his mother's face was 
"bathed in tears." 
  Before leaving Beijing, an official of the U.S. Embassy in 
China had a brief conversation with Wang and asked him two 
questions. The first was: "Do you volunteer to go?" Wang 
answered: "Yes, I do." The second one was: "After all, how is 
your health?" Wang answered: "In China, a patient is not 
informed of his real health condition, only his family members 
or his unit know." 
  It was precisely in this way that on the same day, Wang 
Juntao, accompanied by the first secretary of the U.S. Embassy, 
took a United Airlines flight to the United States and sat in 
the first-class cabin. He held a "PRC passport" and filled in 
the occupation column with the word "unemployed"; the passport 
will expire after April 1999. 
  Wang Juntao is still as self-confident as he was before 
going 
to jail. He said: "In the plane, I dozed off three times and 
passed my five years of prison life to my memory. I have 
already adapted myself to my new life." 
  Wang Juntao said he did not think that the upsurge of doing 
business in Mainland China had already stifled the people's 
grievances against the current regime; on the contrary, it can 
be said that a latent crisis is present everywhere which may 
break out at any time, no matter whether Deng Xiaoping is dead 
or not. 
  In his view, China's future situation is subject to all 
kinds 
of changes, including an out-of-control situation of massive 
collapse and chaos. Once there is massive chaos, the 
consequences will be dreadful to contemplate, and no one knows 
how many people will die. In this way, the goal of democracy may 
finally be fulfilled, but it certainly will be achieved at the 
expense of innumerable deaths. Therefore, such a path must be 
averted at any cost. 
  Wang Juntao said that when the intelligentsia debated the 
idea of "new authoritarianism" prior to the 4 June Incident, he 
had tried his best to evade such a debate. He even did not want 
to make any explanation when someone described him as the one 
who believed in "new authoritarianism." He was not eager to 
take part in ideological debates because he was soberly aware 
that the best way to deliver China from the crisis was to put 
forward a concrete proposal and to devise tactics to make it 
work. In the past, he and his comrades had done so, and in the 
future, they would do the same. 
  He has many old friends in overseas democratic 
organizations, 
and he said he would meet them. If someone really proposes to 
him to do something, he wants to do something inside China, but 
not outside. He said: "For those who are engaged in China's 
politics, there is too little room for maneuver outside the 
country. Therefore, I will return to China once I am healed." 
  He repeatedly stressed that his greatest concern at present 
is his friend Chen Ziming, who also was sentenced to 13 years' 
imprisonment and who remains in prison. He will try his best to 
strive to win the earliest possible restoration of Chen's 
freedom, and he hoped that people inside and outside China would 
continue to show their solicitude for Chen.

<F P=106> [Interview with Cai Cheng, vice chairman of the National </F>
People's Congress Law Committee, conducted by unidentified 
reporter on 26 April; place not given: from the "Report on 
Current Events" program] 
  [Text] Dear listeners and friends: 
  China has always attached great importance to the protection 
of intellectual property rights [IPR]. It has now established 
an effective protective network following more than a decade of 
hard work in reform and opening up. In an interview with a 
reporter on 26 April, Cai Cheng, vice chairman of the National 
People's Congress Law Committee, revealed that China will soon 
formulate specific provisions to punish copyright infringement 
crimes, in order to further curb and punish acts which infringe 
intellectual property rights. 
  He said: China will strengthen intellectual property rights 
protection in external economic and technological trade 
activities. It will focus on formulating laws and regulations 
that stipulate border-control measures on products which 
infringe such rights, and enhance the customs authorities' 
functions in protecting intellectual property rights and 
stopping rights-infringement products from leaving the country. 
Regarding law enforcement, China will soon give prominence to 
and consolidate law enforcement forces at all levels that are 
involved in copyright protection, so as to guarantee the 
effective enforcement of copyright laws. 
  He said: Intellectual property rights administrative and 
law-enforcement organizations may jointly investigate and handle 
major and important cases with science and technology, economic, 
cultural, public security, and industrial and commercial 
departments. Since August 1993, Beijing Municipality, Shanghai 
Municipality, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen city have 
successively established judicial courts for intellectual 
property rights. Cities such as Guangzhou, Zhuhai, and Shantou 
are also making plans to establish similar courts which 
specialize in trying intellectual property rights cases. 
Recently, seven departments, including the CPC Central 
Committee Propaganda Department, State Planning Commission, and 
the State Administration for Industry and Commerce issued a 
joint document urging quality control over compact discs and 
laser discs, as well as strict investigation and handling of 
copyright piracy cases. 
  Cai Cheng stressed: China will vigorously strengthen 
supervision and inspection over law enforcement on intellectual 
property rights. It will plan nonperiodic joint inspections by 
relevant departments on progress made by all localities and 
departments in enforcing intellectual property rights laws, 
focus on inspecting major rights-infringement cases, and 
exercise supervision over and solve problems arising from 
failure of certain localities to strictly enforce laws, and mete 
out stern punishment for rights-infringing acts. 
  He said: The state will fully bring into play non-government 
forces such as associations related to science and technology, 
and economic and cultural fields, as well as special social 
groups and socialized service organizations that are involved in 
intellectual property rights. It will guide them toward 
launching all kinds of legal consultations and services on 
intellectual property rights. At the same time, the state will 
also establish a group of organizations to provide legal 
services related to intellectual property rights, in order to 
help parties concerned investigate and collect evidence against 
rights-infringement acts, and to help settle rights-infringement 
disputes through legal means. It will turn these organizations 
into capable assistants of law enforcement agencies in 
intellectual property rights protection. 
  Citing examples, he said: Acting on behalf of the British 
(?Hezzelin Snow) Company this March, Beijing (?Zhongcheng) 
Intellectual Property Rights Protection Company, China's first 
and only civilian-operated intellectual property rights 
protection company, extensively investigated and collected 
evidence against a certain chemical product factory in Chaoyang 
city -- which falls under the jurisdiction of Shenzhen -- in 
Guangdong Province for producing imitation (?Hezzelin Snow) 
soap, and reported the relevant situation to the local public 
security organ. The factory was instantly closed down, and 
(?Hezzelin Snow) was prevented from suffering major economic 
losses. The Beijing company won praise from the British company. 
  Cai Cheng said: China put in place an intellectual property 
rights system not long ago. As such, different degrees of 
intellectual property rights infringement will exist. However, 
China is earnest and serious about intellectual property rights 
protection. China has established a relatively intact legal 
system. It has also joined international organizations and 
treaties such as the World Intellectual Property Organization, 
Paris Convention on Protection of Industrial Property, Madrid 
Agreement Concerning International Registration of Trademarks, 
and Berne Convention on Protection of Literary and Artistic 
Works.

<F P=106> [By reporter Hu Rongguo (5170 2837 0948): "Promote the Rapid </F>
Development of the Labor Reform Enterprises To Serve Shandong's 
Reform, Development, and Stability"] 
  [Text] The three-day provincial conference on the 
production and operation of the special labor reform enterprises 
concluded in Jinan on the afternoon of 18 April. Participants 
at the conference studied the ideas and measures for Shandong's 
labor reform enterprises to further deepen economic reform and 
accelerate development in the new situation of the socialist 
market economy. 
  Li Wenquan, deputy secretary of the provincial party 
committee, attended at the end of the conference to give a 
speech. He first affirmed Shandong's achievements in reform and 
reeducation through labor and, on behalf of the provincial party 
committee and government, extended cordial greetings to all the 
cadres and policemen on the forefront of the work of reform and 
reeducation through labor. Li Wenquan emphasized the need to 
clearly understand the situation, clarify tasks, and 
conscientiously strengthen the work of reform and reeducation 
through labor in the new situation. He said: To strengthen the 
work of reform and reeducation through labor in the new 
situation, we should adhere to the party's principles for this 
work and further improve the contingents of cadres and policemen 
and leading bodies. Meanwhile, we should seize the opportunity 
and intensify measures to expedite the development of the labor 
reform enterprises to serve Shandong's economic reform, 
development, and stability. He pointed out: The labor reform 
enterprises are special enterprises, which aim not only at 
production and profit-making but also at transforming people, 
the starting and ending point of these enterprises. In the new 
situation, these enterprises should accelerate their structural 
adjustment, add impetus to their technical transformation, 
further strengthen their management, and actively explore the 
new ways of production and operation compatible with the 
characteristics of the socialist market economy. 
  Zhang Xiufu, executive vice minister of justice, fully 
affirmed Shandong's judicial and administrative work, especially 
the work of reform and reeducation through labor. He said: In 
the new system of the socialist market economy, the labor reform 
enterprises, like other enterprises, have encountered new 
challenges. They should deepen economic reform, create new 
experiences, and maintain continuous development. 
  Sun Shuyi, standing committee member of the provincial party 
committee and secretary of its political and legal commission, 
gave a summing-up speech. He urged all the labor reformatories 
in the province to firmly focus on the general task of economic 
reform, development, and stability, relay and implement the 
guidelines of this conference successfully, and adopt realistic 
measures to promote Shandong's work of reform and reeducation 
through labor to a new level. 
  Attending the conference were Wang Yuxi, vice governor of 
Shandong; Han Bangju, special adviser to the provincial 
government; Wang Mingdi [3769 2494 6611], director of the 
Administration of Reform through Labor of the Ministry of 
Justice; and Meng Qingchen, director of the Administration of 
Reeducation through Labor of the Ministry of Justice.

<F P=106> [By reporter Yang Xin (2799 2946): "Enterprise Bonds Should </F>
Be Standardized"] 
  [Text] Thus far, Heilongjiang Province has issued 2.43 
billion yuan in bonds of local enterprises. These bonds have 
ensured the supply of funds urgently needed by some enterprises 
to expand their scale of production and to renew their equipment 
and to open up a new money-lending channel for enterprises. 
However, along with the fact that the bonds of some enterprises 
have become due one after another, the cases of being unable to 
cash the bonds have emerged time and again. 
  It is learned that the bonds of enterprises that became due 
last year are being cashed in a rapid manner through the 
consultation of enterprises, local financial departments, and 
bond issuing departments. 
  However, the outlook for cashing this year's bonds is not 
optimistic. Last year, the province issued 20-odd kinds of 
local enterprise bonds, and most of them were of the one-year 
short-term bonds. Therefore, enterprises' task of repaying debts 
was very arduous. According to the analysis of the bonds of 52 
enterprises issued by the provincial industrial and commercial 
bank on a commission basis, two thirds of enterprise bonds will 
be unable to be cashed when they become due. 
  There are many reasons for the failure in cashing enterprise 
bonds, such as the poor management of enterprises, the slow 
selling of products, the delayed completion and commission of 
projects, the slow turnover of funds, and so on. Meanwhile, the 
weakness in the linkage between bond issuance and bond 
management also constitutes a major reason for the failure in 
cashing bonds. 
  Enterprises should assume responsibility for investors. 
Motivated by the principle of being responsible for investors 
and adhering to the promise made before the issuance of bonds, 
enterprises, as bond issuers and debt holders, should make best 
use of the hard-won funds to accelerate the completion of 
projects and increase economic returns in order to ensure that 
the capital and interest of bonds will be cashed by the 
scheduled time. 
  Banks and other bond issuance agencies should strengthen 
supervision over and management of bonds. At present, some bond 
issuance agencies in the province are careless in checking the 
asset credit of enterprises before their bonds are issued and 
take a laissez-faire attitude after the issuance of bonds. Some 
enterprises use these funds to repay their own debts or divert 
these funds for other purposes, instead of using them to renew 
equipment as promised before the issuance of bonds. At the 
moment, there is not a single organ in the province that manages 
bonds in a unified manner. Stock dealers, banks, financial 
departments, and pertinent departments of local governments 
should form a joint force to strengthen the dynamics of bond 
management in order to ensure that the bonds issued by 
enterprises will be cashed on schedule. 
  On the occasion that many financial institutions are going 
hither and thither to resolve the problem of being unable to 
cash bonds, the bonds of Daqing Lianyi Chemical Industrial Plant 
and Nanguang Zhiye Corporation issued by the Heilongjiang branch 
of Guangda Bank on a commission basis have been cashed by the 
scheduled time. This bank's strict management of bond issuance 
has given us the following enlightenment. First, before the 
bonds are issued, a bank should conduct a strict examination of 
the asset credit of enterprises, as well as the managerial 
efficiency, project feasibility, leading bodies, and development 
prospects of enterprises, and an enterprise should not be 
allowed to issue bonds unless its bond repayment rate reaches 20 
percent or higher. Second, after the bonds are issued, credit 
personnel should be dispatched to learn how these funds are used 
and how the projects are being built in order to ensure the 
appropriate use of these funds. Banks and enterprises should 
report situations to each other frequently, and banks should 
supervise and urge enterprises to get prepared for transferring 
the funds for repaying the bonds 10 days before the expiration 
of bonds. 
  Relevant persons offered the following several 
countermeasures for resolving the failure in cashing bonds: 
First, for the enterprises whose efficiency is relatively good 
but whose funds cannot be circulated for a short while, bond 
issuing agencies should pay the bonds for them and the 
enterprises should repay the agencies. Or, new bonds can be 
issued to pay the old bonds. Second, those enterprises that are 
really unable to repay their bonds should declare bankruptcy to 
repay the debts.

<F P=106> [Speech by Gu Jinchi, secretary of the Liaoning Provincial </F>
CPC Committee, delivered at the ninth plenary session of the 
provincial discipline inspection commission on 7 April] 
  [Text] Comrades: 
  This plenary session of the provincial discipline inspection 
commission is a very important session. At this session, we 
have relayed and studied Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at 
the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission and the guidelines of the third plenary session, 
summarized Liaoning's previous anticorruption work, exchanged 
experiences, and studied and arranged the work tasks of the next 
step of the anticorruption work. Comrade Shangwen has given a 
report, and the opinions he spoke on had been approved by the 
standing committee of the provincial party committee after 
discussions. It is hoped that all localities and departments 
will conscientiously implement them in line with their actual 
conditions. I will speak on three issues in the following. 
  1. We should enhance the understanding of the importance and 
urgency of the anticorruption work in the new situation. 
  Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the third plenary 
session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission used the 
Marxist viewpoint and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building 
socialism with Chinese characteristics to expound the importance 
and urgency of the anticorruption work and the dialectical 
relationship between reform, development, and stability from the 
perspective of adherence to the party's basic line and the 
purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. He also 
emphasized: "Waging the anticorruption struggle, in the final 
analysis, is meant to consolidate and strengthen the party's 
ties with the masses in the new situation, to consolidate our 
party's status as a ruling party, and to enable the party to 
better hold the heavy historical task to lead reform, opening 
up, and socialist modernization drive. The relationship between 
the party and the masses is a basic political issue concerning 
the success and failure of the party's cause. We should 
emphasize this repeatedly and sound the alarm for a long time, 
and comrades of the entire party should attach great importance 
to it." His remarks profoundly told us that the key to whether 
the anticorruption work can be carried out thoroughly, 
persistently, and more effectively and yield good results at 
different stages lies in unifying the thinking of the entire 
party, especially the thinking of leading cadres. In line with 
the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the 
third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commission, the arrangements made at this third plenary session, 
and the specific conditions of Liaoning, all cadres with party 
membership, especially leading cadres, should particularly 
address the following three issues on the understanding of the 
anticorruption work. 
  A. The previous anticorruption work should be estimated in a 
realistic manner. To implement well Comrade Jiang Zemin's 
speech given at the third plenary session of the Central 
Discipline Inspection Commission and the guidelines of the 
session and to make this year's anticorruption work successful, 
we should first correctly estimate the previous anticorruption 
work. The provincial party committee recently held a standing 
committee meeting to hear and conscientiously discuss the 
provincial discipline inspection commission's report. The 
provincial party committee held that since August last year, 
party committees, governments, and discipline inspection, 
supervision, and judicial departments at all levels in the 
province had conscientiously followed the arrangements of the 
party Central Committee and the provincial party committee to 
actively carry out the anticorruption work, with the focus on 
reform and economic construction; and that thanks to the 
concerted efforts of all fields, the desired purpose was 
basically attained, good results were achieved at varying 
degrees in the three tasks that should be emphasized as required 
by the party Central Committee, corrupt phenomena in some 
aspects were checked, and more prominent achievements were won 
by the localities and departments which had done a better job. 
Through practice, we have achieved a more profound 
understanding of the guidelines of the party Central Committee's 
instructions on opposing corruption and explored and accumulated 
some good experiences and methods. However, this is only a good 
beginning, and we must never overestimate it. 
  We should recognize that there are still many disparities 
and problems in the current anticorruption work. The principal 
ones were: The work in various localities and departments was 
not evenly developed, and some localities and departments failed 
to fully grasp this work although they had conscientiously 
relayed the guidelines and devised plans in a timely manner. 
Leading cadres failed to deeply conduct self investigation to 
see whether they were honest and self-disciplined and to make 
self corrections, and some situations discovered during self 
investigation were not in conformity with the actually existing 
problems; some problems had been touched once but not been 
realistically solved; and some problems discovered during self 
investigation had not been corrected. We lacked strength in 
investigating and handling major and appalling cases, and the 
progress in this work was not rapid. Some localities and units 
had the serious problem of practicing protectionism, failed to 
report a case to the security authorities and to file a case for 
investigation which they should do, and failed to strictly 
handle the cases. Some failed to achieve noticeable results in 
checking unhealthy trends, and the masses of people were not 
pleased with this. Some leading cadres failed to fully 
understand anticorruption work and failed to actively carry out 
this work on their own initiative. Judging from the situation 
of the whole province, the progress of the previous stage of 
anticorruption work still lagged far behind the demands of the 
party Central Committee and the masses of people, and the 
achievements gained were not consolidated. If we slightly 
slacken our efforts in this aspect, some problems will possibly 
"come back." These are the problems which the broad masses of 
people are mostly worrying about and the party committees and 
governments at all levels must resolutely check. Therefore, in 
addition to affirming the previous stage of achievements in a 
fact-seeking manner, we should also recognize the existing 
problems, sum up experience, enhance understanding of the 
protractedness, complexity, and arduousness of anticorruption, 
firmly cultivate the idea of grasping this work unswervingly, 
and carry out anticorruption struggle in a deep, sustained, and 
more effective manner. 
  B. We should correctly understand and handle the 
relationship 
between, reform, development, stability and anticorruption. 
This is a crucial year for comprehensively implementing the 
decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central 
committee, an important year for China to enter the stage of 
carrying out comprehensive supporting package reform of the 
national economic structure with breakthroughs in key areas, and 
a year facing many heavy tasks and severe tests in 
anticorruption. Therefore, party committees and governments at 
all levels should proceed from the overall situation of the 
whole party's work, correctly understand and properly handle the 
relationship between reform, development, and stability and 
anticorruption, and in addition to exerting efforts to deepen 
reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain 
stability, act in line with the unified plans of the central 
authorities, and conscientiously attend to anticorruption work. 
Only by persisting in reform and development can we realize a 
long-term social stability. And if we carry out reform and 
development, we must have a stable social environment. Social 
instability will make us unable to smoothly conduct reform and 
development and to successfully carry out all other 
undertakings. Reform, development, and stability constitute the 
overall situation of the whole party's work, and anticorruption 
is an important guarantee for reform, development, and 
stability. We should carry out anticorruption work in close 
connection with the overall situation of the whole party's work, 
consciously submit ourselves to and serve this overall 
situation. Judging from the problems exposed in our province's 
anticorruption struggle, corrupt phenomena have infiltrated into 
all social sectors, and particularly, they have seriously 
corroded our party and government organs as well as the ranks of 
cadres. Last year, the discipline inspection and supervision 
organs across the province filed and handled 7,444 cases on law 
and discipline violations and punished 5,527 party-member 
cadres. Of these cases, 3,504 were filed for investigation and 
handling during four months from September to December, and 40 
percent of which were cases on law and discipline violations in 
the economic sector, and 175 cases involved cadres at and above 
the county (section) level. Procuratorial organs across the 
province filed 2,299 economic criminal cases for investigation 
last year, 1,452 cases of which each involved more than 10,000 
yuan, and 193 cases each involved more than 100,000 yuan, and 
these cases involved 77 cadres at and above the county (section) 
level. 
  The large number of criminals who abused power to practice 
graft and pervert justice for bribes, the large sum of money 
involved, and the mean tricks adopted were shocking and directly 
undermined reform, opening up, and economic construction. Some 
unhealthy trends characterized by abuse of power for selfish 
gains and extortion of money, especially those in some 
departments and trades, seriously infringed on the interests of 
the masses and aroused strong dissatisfaction among them. 
Therefore, we should be determined to eliminate the corrupt 
phenomena, punish corrupt elements, and correct the unhealthy 
trends. Otherwise, we will dampen the masses' enthusiasm and 
lose their support, and stability, reform, and development will 
be affected. 
  This year marks the largest number of reform measures to be 
implemented, and the quality, range, and dynamics of reform will 
also be unprecedented. The process to deepen reform will also 
be the process to adjust the relationship between the state, the 
local authorities, enterprises, and laborers in terms of power, 
responsibility, and profits. It will unavoidably involve the 
interests of many fields and may create social fluctuation at 
varying degrees. Because the extension of reform has been 
expanded but the formulation of the standards of activities 
falls behind, law and discipline breaches committed by taking 
advantage of the loopholes in laws, regulations, policies, and 
systems may increase. The depth of reform and the wide range of 
the adjustment of interests have instilled vigor to social life 
and provided favorable conditions for enterprises to compete on 
an equal footing. However, they will also create new 
contradictions and some sensitive, complicated, and 
destabilizing factors. Under such circumstances, it remains a 
serious task and test we should not dodge to not only add 
impetus to reform and promote development and stability but also 
keep the momentum of the anticorruption work going and make the 
work more effective. Some state-owned enterprises in Liaoning 
are suffering serious deficits and have failed to pay wages to 
their workers for a long time. The retired personnel in some 
localities also experience many difficulties in their life. In 
rural areas, some people still do not have sufficient food and 
clothes. Problems in public security are also very conspicuous. 
All these problems merit our great attention. Party committees 
and governments at all levels, especially principal leading 
cadres, must learn to take the overall situation into account; 
proceed from the general task of safeguarding reform, 
development, and stability to achieve success in opposing 
corruption and advocating honesty; comprehensively and correctly 
analyze the situation from the perspective of strengthening the 
party's flesh-and-blood relations with the masses, consolidating 
the political power, and maintaining the lasting order and 
stability of the state; and properly address the conspicuous 
contradictions cropping up in the process of advancement. 
Leaders should go to the places where problems are conspicuous 
to resolve the contradictions in a timely manner, safeguard 
social stability, and create a good environment for reform and 
development. 
  C. The principle of attaching equal importance to two tasks 
should be adhered to. Attaching equal importance to the two 
civilizations is Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea and an 
important component of the theory of building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. As early as the initial period of 
reform and opening up, Comrade Xiaoping raised the issue of 
attaching equal importance to two tasks, one being reform and 
opening up, and the other being crackdown on economic crimes. 
Later, Comrade Xiaoping again repeatedly emphasized, from 
different angles, the need to attach equal importance to the two 
tasks and called for "competence in both." He also emphasized 
that "we should oppose corruption in the entire process of 
reform and opening up." As has been proven in practice, his 
theses are totally correct. 
  The leading collective of the party Central Committee with 
Comrade Jiang Zemin as its nucleus has unswervingly implemented 
the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that 
both hands are tough," successfully made several important 
decisions, adopted a series of major measures, and pushed 
forward the work of opposing corruption and advocating 
administrative honesty. In his speech at the recent third 
plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission, 
Comrade Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out again that in 
waging the struggle against corruption, the party committees and 
governments at various levels should firmly grasp the center of 
the economic construction, persist in the principle of taking a 
two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough, and 
make overall plans and take all factors into consideration. So, 
at the time of grasping the economic construction, we are 
required to attend to the work of opposing corruption. At 
present, some of our comrades do not accurately understand the 
importance of anticorruption. Some of them maintain that the 
corrupt phenomena are brought about by reform and opening up and 
these phenomena are unavoidable. Some maintain that so long as 
the economy is developed will the corrupt phenomena naturally be 
eliminated. These ideas are wrong. The purpose of reform is to 
liberate and develop productive forces and to promote the 
economy. Some corrupt phenomena actually emerge due to the facts 
that the legal system is not perfect in the course of replacing 
the old systems by the new and that some people are affected by 
the capitalist corrosive ideas in the course of conducting 
reform and opening to the outside world. By no means are the 
corrupt phenomena brought about by reform and opening up. But, 
these phenomena are caused by the failure to thoroughly or 
deeply conduct reform. On the one hand, we should unswervingly 
wage the struggle against these phenomena, end their development 
trends, and reduce them in a step-by-step manner; on the other 
hand, we should deepen reform and perfect the legal system to 
fundamentally wipe out the soils and conditions which create 
corrupt phenomena. Each and every party member and each and 
every cadre should clearly understand that developing the market 
economy does not mean giving up socialism, advocating the 
coexistence of various sectors of the economy does not mean 
giving up the public ownership, and we must persistently attend 
to both spiritual and material civilizations to promote the 
development of the socialist market economy. On no account do 
the corrupt phenomena naturally disappear when the economy is 
developed. When the corrupt phenomena spread unchecked, it will 
be difficult to promote the economic construction. The economic 
construction, even though promoted, is temporarily promoted and 
will finally fall. Many facts prove that negative and corrupt 
phenomena are major reasons for affecting reform, opening up, 
and economic construction. The more profoundly the reform is 
carried out and the better developed the economy is, the more we 
should resolutely oppose corruption. 
  The tasks for reform and development in 1994 are very heavy. 
The party and government organs and the leading cadres at 
various levels should concentrate more energy on grasping the 
implementation of major reform measures. That is, we should 
continue to enliven state-owned large and medium-sized 
enterprises, take the increase in economic results as a key 
link, deepen reform, accelerate the pace of transformation, 
speed up the pace of readjustment, intensify management, and lay 
a good foundation for setting up a modern enterprise system. 
Simultaneously, we should continue to intensify agriculture's 
role as the foundation of the national economy and further 
rejuvenate the rural economy. Simultaneously, we should 
vigorously cultivate new economic growth points. Under such 
circumstances, we should further persist in the principle of 
"grasping with two hands" and "play the piano well." We must 
never slacken the anticorruption work just because the tasks for 
reform and development are heavy. Due to the fact that our 
province was deeply affected by the highly centralized planned 
economy, our ideology, management systems, and rules and 
regulations have many things that are not suitable to the 
requirements for setting up the socialist market economic 
system. We must exert great efforts to solve these problems. 
On the one hand, we should pay attention to guiding the broad 
masses of party members, cadres and people to further emancipate 
the mind, renew their ideas, bravely make explorations, boldly 
engage in practice, suggest ways and means for reform and 
development, and make contributions to reform and development; 
on the other hand, we should pay attention to grasping the 
ideological trends and well grasp the mass media orientation. We 
must be sober-headed, tell truth from falsehood, and have a 
clear-cut stand to know what we should support, advocate, 
restrict, and oppose within a period of time. 
  As for some wrong thinkings and acts, we should not leave 
them unchecked as well as should clear them up and give guidance 
to them. We should criticize and educate wrongdoers who deserve 
to accept them. We should boldly protect and support the new 
things cropping up in reforms. Great attention should be paid 
to protecting and bringing into play the enthusiasm of the broad 
masses of cadres in plunging into reform and construction. We 
should vigorously publicize and commend those who have performed 
their official duties honestly; done the administrative work 
industriously for the people; engaged in their work 
industriously; boldly pioneered roads; and made prominent 
contributions to reform, opening up, and economic construction. 
By coping with the evil trend cropping up in the administration 
honesty in every period, we should remind cadres of the trend in 
a timely manner and give an early warning to them so as to 
arouse them to pay attention to it and to avoid the mistake. As 
for cadres who have attempted to do their best in work 
wholeheartedly and committed faults because of their poor 
experience, we should help them summarize their experience and 
lessons and support them to better do their work in the future. 
We should correctly handle the contradictions among the people 
and turn the negative factors into active ones. We should 
chiefly give criticism and education to cadres who have 
committed malpractice. It will be all right for these cadres as 
long as they have actively examined and corrected their 
mistakes. We should impose necessary party-discipline sanction 
on cadres who have refused to accept the education and to 
correct their mistakes. We should strictly handle those in line 
with the law and party discipline, who have violated the 
criminal law and party discipline. 
  2. We should successfully grasp the implementation of 
anticorruption work in various fields this year by closely 
following the whole situation in the work undertaken by the 
entire party. 
  The third plenum of the Central Discipline Inspection 
Commssion has made overall arrangements for the anticorruption 
work this year. In line with the demand of the central 
authorities, by bearing the province's reality in minds, and by 
closely following the whole situation in the work undertaken by 
the entire party, we must further enhance our measures and 
reinforce the dynamics in work. A good job should be done in 
grasping the implementation of anticorruption work in various 
fields this year. Efforts should be made to concentrate efforts 
on dealing with the deep-rooted problems; to strive to score 
greater achievements; and to ensure the deepening of reform, 
economic development, and social stability in the province. 
Comrade Shangwen has made specific arrangements in his report 
for implementing the three tasks of anticorruption struggle. I, 
hereby, would like to stress again the following several issues: 
  A. We should seize the emphasis of encouraging leading 
cadres 
to perform official duties honestly and to be self-disciplined. 
The focal point of self examination and correction in the 
campaign of administration honesty and self discipline this year 
is still aimed at the leading cadres at the county (section) 
level. By bearing in their minds the reality in their own 
localities and units and according to the five provisions set by 
the central authorities and the five provisions issued in the 
year, party and government organs at all levels throughout the 
province should further do a good job in self examination and 
correction in the anticorruption work. Leading cadres at all 
levels and particularly principal leading comrades should play a 
leading role in the work. Leading bodies at province and city 
levels should strive to score better achievements in this regard 
so as to set an example for their subordinate units. In 
conducting self examination and correction, we should 
concentrate our efforts on grasping implementation and scoring 
practical results. As for the problems that have been exposed 
in the course of self examination and correction in line with 
the five provisions issued in 1993 but which have not been 
corrected, we should enhance the supervision and inspection and 
correct or handle them in line with the provisions concerned. 
We should organize forces to investigate the problems committed 
by some cadres who have not conducted self examination and 
correction and about which the mass has lodged strong 
complaints. They should be strictly handled as long as they 
have been proved as true. As for the problems whose mistakes 
have been clarified in line with the limits of policies set the 
five provisions issued in the year, we should correct them by 
intensively conducting self examination. As for the problems 
that have involved in a wider range in the society and whose 
contents are more complicated, we should do a good job in 
carrying out investigation and study in advance and have the 
provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial 
supervisory department to organize the departments concerned to 
formulate the limits of policies, to successfully conduct the 
pilot work, and to handle them in an overall way after gaining 
the experience from the pilot work. We should integrate the 
self examination and correction with the reports and opinions of 
the masses to bring into play the supervisory role of the 
masses. Party organizations at all levels and particularly 
discipline inspection commissions and organizational departments 
at all levels should be practically responsible for the work, 
enhance the supervision over party-member cadres and 
particularly leading cadres, and regard the results of 
administration honesty and self examination as an important 
content in appraising and employing cadres. 
  B. We should reinforce the dynamics in dealing with serious 
and appalling cases. Emphasis in handling cases this year is 
still directed at party and government leading organs and the 
departments of judiciary, administration, law enforcement, and 
economic management and should be placed on handling cases that 
are disturbing and damaging reforms, development, and stability, 
as well seriously violating the law and discipline. In line 
with the exposed clues of cases, various localities should 
earnestly analyze and study them and formulate explicit and 
specific plans for handling the cases that should be dealt with 
immediately. They should concentrate their efforts on dealing 
with the important and typical cases and the serious and 
appalling cases that have a guiding significance on the whole 
situation. We should affix responsibility on those who have 
blocked or disturbed the handling of cases, hidden the cases, 
put off the investigation of cases, and not handled the cases 
after finishing the investigation. When encountering 
difficulties and problems that have caused the suspension of 
carrying out investigation or handling of cases, the principal 
leading comrades of party and government organs should take up 
the difficulties and problems personally and adopt resolute 
measures to do away with the interference and obstruction and to 
vigorously make a breakthrough in dealing with them. The organs 
of discipline inspection, supervision, and judiciary should 
uphold the principles and boldly deal with the knotty problems. 
Under the situation in which reform is being continuously 
deepened, we should not only investigate and handle the acts 
that have not been stopped, though prohibition has been issued, 
but also handle the acts of not observing the order. We should 
strictly enforce the discipline among those who "have provided 
counter-measures for coping with the policies issued by their 
higher authorities" and damaged the whole interest in order to 
obtain the immediate and partial interest and the interest of 
small communities to ensure the smooth enforcement of 
administrative orders and the implementation of various reform 
measures. 
  C. We should continuously correct the malpractice. All-out 
efforts should be continuously made this year to score obvious 
results in dealing with the two problems of collecting fees 
arbitrarily and spending public funds on outside and overseas 
tours. We should resolutely implement the announcement on the 
collection suspension of some fees. By no means should we break 
our promise to the people by announcing the collection 
suspension on the one hand and continuously collecting fees 
arbitrarily on the other hand. As for the administrative fees 
and the income accumulated from fines and confiscations, we 
should enforce the managerial regulation of "double-track system 
between income and spending" in this regard. Departments 
concerned should rapidly make contact with their higher organs 
so as to formulate as soon as possible specific methods for 
implementing the regulation. Efforts should be made to 
earnestly implement the regulation on encouraging the economic 
entities run by the party and government organs to get rid of 
their relations with these organs. A good job should be done 
in clearing up and returning the unpaid occupation of property 
by the party and government organs to enterprises. Efforts 
should be made to intensively clear up and correct the arbitrary 
apportioning and the problems of asking assistance from 
enterprises on various pretexts. In correcting their 
malpractice, various industries and trades should define one or 
two targets while handling the existing prominent problems so as 
to conduct specialized consolidation over the targets. Various 
localities should also select several departments, industries, 
and trades to be the key units of taking up the work of 
correcting malpractice. Those who did a better job in 
correcting the malpractice and scored certain achievements in 
this regard last year should concentrate their efforts this year 
on consolidating and upgrading their achievements, as well as on 
deepening their consolidation to score more obvious results. 
  D. We should further perfect the supervisory mechanism and 
take radical and stopgap measures simultaneously. Developing 
the socialist market economy requires the guarantee of law. 
Only by perfecting the legal system and establishing the 
effective restriction mechanism of supervision can we prevent 
and eliminate corrupt phenomena systematically and ensure the 
healthy development of the socialist market economy. Therefore, 
in the course of anticorruption we must attach great importance 
on establishing legal systems, integrating anticorruption with 
the establishment of legal systems, and taking radical and 
stopgap measures simultaneously. We should not only establish a 
complete set of regulations and rules for the market economy, 
but also a series of laws and regulations for anticorruption so 
as to provide legal basis for more effectively punishing the 
corrupt. In coping with the loopholes cropping up in the course 
of anticorruption in the fields of management and systems, we 
should earnestly summarize the experience and lessons; perfect 
the systems; and enhance the management to resolutely block 
them. Some regulations and rules that were proved as effective 
in the past should be continuously enforced and popularized. 
Meanwhile, attention should be made to exploring the new ways of 
enhancing the fostering of work style and administrative honesty 
and of carrying out anticorruption struggles. 
  Now, some of our comrades' sense of legal system is getting 
blunted. No sooner do we stress the necessity to have the 
daring to think, do, and pioneer than these people engage 
themselves in unlawful and undisciplined activities. Therefore, 
education must be strengthened. We should organize the broad 
masses of party members and cadres to conscientiously study the 
third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; should 
prominently conduct the education on building socialism with 
Chinese characteristics; should conduct education on the purpose 
of the party, party discipline, and the legal system; should 
foster an accurate outlook on life and value; should enhance the 
sense of party discipline and the sense of the legal system; and 
should ensure that power should smoothly move in the cycle of 
policy decisions, implementation, supervision, and feedback. 
  We should strengthen the improvement of party style and 
administrative honesty among enterprises and institutions and 
vigorously sum up and popularize the good examples emerging from 
the construction of the spiritual and material civilizations. 
Leading cadres of the enterprises and institutions should be 
honest in performing official duties, be self-disciplined, 
observe disciplines, and abide by laws. Various kinds of 
negative and corrosive phenomena, such as abusing power for 
private gains, engaging in corruption and bribery, and indulging 
in extravagance and waste, should be opposed. 
  3. We should realistically strengthen the leadership over 
the 
anticorruption work. 
  The current anticorruption tasks are extremely heavy. The 
previous anticorruption work achievements should be 
consolidated. The work that has not yet been accomplished need 
to be continuously done. Some deep-layered problems should 
urgently be solved. New tasks and requirements in the 
next-stage anticorruption work have been set forth. That 
whether or not we can achieve the work in these aspects and make 
achievements in the anticorruption work is related to the 
prestige of the party among the masses and to the overall 
situation of reform, development, and stability. The party 
committees and governments at various levels should 
realistically strengthen leadership, carefully organize forces, 
and achieve this year's anticorruption work in a down-to-earth 
manner. 
  A. The anticorruption work should be carried out under the 
unified leadership of the party committees and the governments. 
The party committees and governments at various levels should 
put the anticorruption work in the important work agenda. Party 
and government principal leaders should personally engage in the 
work. They should not only personally mobilize and arrange the 
anticorruption work but also attend to the implementation of the 
work. Party and government principal leaders should engage 
themselves in the solution of major problems. Anticorruption 
should be brought into the overall situation of reform, 
development, and stability. At the time of studying and 
arranging the work of deepening reform, developing the economy, 
and safeguarding stability, we should set forth requirements and 
make arrangements for opposing corruption and strengthening the 
improvement of administrative honesty and ensure that the 
anticorruption work and the improvement of administrative 
honesty should be arranged in a unified manner and develop 
coordinately. There must be both overall plans and definite 
targets for the anticorruption work. This work must be carried 
out in a step-by-step, solid, and steady manner. The party 
committees and governments at various levels should 
appropriately convene meetings to hear reports, analyze the 
situation, study countermeasures, and promote the anticorruption 
work in a step-by-step and profound manner. 
  B. We should set up and perfect the system of responsibility 
for opposing corruption. Party and government principal leading 
comrades should assume overall responsibility for the 
anticorruption work of their localities, departments, and units. 
The members of the leading bodies at various levels in charge 
of the improvement of party style and administrative honesty 
should directly assume responsibility for the work. Other 
members of the leading bodies should assume major responsibility 
for the anticorruption work of the fronts that they belong to. 
Each level should guide, on a responsibility basis, the 
anticorruption work of its lower level. The provincial 
discipline inspection commission and the provincial supervisory 
department should assume responsibility for organizing, 
coordinating with, guiding, and generally analyzing the 
anticorruption work of the province as a whole. The work 
committee of the provincial-level organs should take charge of 
supervising, inspecting, and generally analyzing the 
anticorruption work of the provincial-level departments. In 
carrying out the three tasks for opposing corruption, the 
provincial-level units and all departments concerned should 
realistically attend to the work that they take charge of and 
pay particular attention to studying and formulating, as soon as 
possible, the policies relating to the three tasks so as to 
create conveniences for opposing corruption. All cities and 
provincial-level departments should report on the fulfillment of 
each and every task to the provincial discipline inspection 
commission and the provincial supervisory department. Then, the 
provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial 
supervisory department should collect the data for the 
provincial party committee and the provincial government. 
  C. We should strengthen supervision and inspection. The key 
to whether this year's anticorruption work can be more effective 
lies in whether the three anticorruption tasks can be truly 
carried out. Party committees and governments at all levels 
should hold their respective responsibilities, adopt various 
measures, and organize people at an opportune time to inspect 
how these three tasks are carried out. The central authorities 
will organize investigation groups to inspect provinces, 
regions, municipalities, and departments directly under the 
central authorities in June. The provincial party committee 
will also organize investigation groups to inspect cities and 
the departments directly under the province. All localities 
should strengthen this work in line with the requirements of the 
central authorities and the provincial party committee. Through 
the inspection, we should find out problems, strengthen 
guidance, summarize experiences, and adopt effective measures to 
make the anticorruption work successful. This work should become 
a system and be carried out on a long-term basis. 
  D. We should further strengthen leadership over discipline 
inspection and supervision work and give full play to its role. 
Discipline inspection and supervision departments are the major 
organs in charge of the anticorruption work, which shoulder 
still greater responsibility and encounter still heavier tasks 
in the future anticorruption work. Party committees and 
governments at all levels should show concern for and support 
their work from the perspective of building the party and 
political power, help them eliminate interference and obstacles, 
and help them address difficulties and problems in their work in 
a timely manner. Under the leadership of party committees and 
governments, discipline inspection and supervision departments 
at all levels should conscientiously perform their functions, 
fully and successfully play their role in the anticorruption 
work, and serve as good advisers and assistants to party 
committees and governments. 
  We should fully develop the role of people's organizations, 
democratic parties, and personages without party affiliation, 
organize them to participate in the work related to the 
anticorruption struggle, and earnestly listen to their opinions 
and suggestions. 
  Cadres with party membership at all levels, especially 
leading cadres, should intensify party spirit training, 
continuously remold their world outlook, foster the purpose of 
serving the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the 
masses, give heed to their voice, help them resolve misgivings 
and difficulties, and share weal and woe with them. We should 
overcome bureaucracy and formalism, go deep into the reality of 
life to conduct investigation and study, and help the 
grass-roots levels and the masses solve problems in a 
down-to-earth manner. We should give wide publicity to the 
typical examples in honest and industrious administration and 
advocate the main theme of this era. 
  Comrades, Liaoning's tasks of reform, development, and 
stability are very heavy this year and its tasks to oppose 
corruption are also very arduous. Under the correct leadership 
of the party Central Committee and the provincial party 
committee, we are convinced that Liaoning will win greater 
achievements in the anticorruption work, further facilitate 
reform, opening up, and economic construction, promote social 
stability, and ensure the smooth progress of its "second 
pioneering program" as long as we firmly rely on party 
organizations at all levels and the masses and make sure that 
the party and cadres are of one mind and act in unison with the 
masses.
