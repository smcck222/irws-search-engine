Korea " -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- The Saeppyol Society of 
South Korea distributed the poem "Ye, Korea, I Will Let You 
Shine", an immortal masterpiece, to inhabitants of Seoul, Pusan 
and Kwangju by mail, a Seoul-based Radio Voice of National 
Salvation reported. 
  The poem is written on a scroll made of vellum paper 45 by 
94 
centimetres on the background of Kimchongilia. 
  The following explanation is attached to the poem: 
  The dear leader Kim Chong-il, the sun of chuche, embarked on 
a glorious road in his early years with grand aspirations to 
accomplish the cause of chuche through generations. This is 
vividly shown in the poem "Ye, Korea, I Will Let You Shine" 
recited by him earnestly in his days of Kim Il-song University. 
  We are widely distributing this poem out of the desire to 
foster the soul of chuche and the resourcefulness of the nation. 
  "Reading the poem, people said, `Let Us Hold in High Esteem 
the Dear Leader Kim Chong-il, the Great Sun of the Cause of 
Chuche', vowing to bring earlier the day of reunification when 
they will enjoy happiness, guided by him generation after 
generation," the radio said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il's classical work "On the Chuche Idea" (published on 
March 31, 1982) has been widely disseminated and studied among 
South Korean people. 
  Students and expelled and stay-out students of Seoul 
National 
University held a seminar on the chuche idea to mark the 
anniversary of its publication. 
  A student said there: 
  "Our people must be awakened in order to tide over the 
present difficulties. 
  "Then, what is the essential idea for it? 
  "We can say confidently that it is the great chuche idea 
fathered by President Kim Il-song, the sun of the nation, as 
clarified in dear Kim Chong-il's famous work 'on the chuche 
idea'." 
  A historian in Seoul had this to say after reading the work: 
  "What impressed me most deeply is that the work is filled 
with love for and trust in the people, deals with the question 
of the people's destiny and consistently gives a scientific 
exposition of the way for its solution. 
  "I was filled with emotions and joy, while reading this 
work, 
at the thought that i at last discovered a true textbook for 
building a new life for our nation and myself and, furthermore, 
for mankind. 
  "Dear Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a prominent great thinker and 
illustrious leader of our nation." 
  A Chondoist believer residing in Chonju said after studying 
the work: 
  "I have read almost all famous works in the world, and I can 
say the most famous of them is dear Kim Chong-il's work `On the 
Chuche Idea'. 
  "It is, indeed, a great masterpiece which should be taken as 
a lifelong textbook." 
  An educationist in Pusan said: 
  "Dear Kim Chong-il's works should be deeply studied in order 
to keep alive the soul of the nation and bring about an epoch of 
national liberation. 
  "Dear Kim Chong-il is a genius of thought and theory with 
the 
steadfast idea of national independence and the lodestar of the 
times. 
  "Our nation is happy and its future is bright as it holds 
him, a great master of thought and theory, in high esteem."

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Sang-o: "The Effective Use of Soot Is an </F>
Important Way To Save and Mobilize Fuel Reserves"] 
  [Summary] The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught 
on increasing production by effective use of labor, facilities, 
and materials. 
  "One of the important problems in the present 
produce-more-and-save-more struggle and in inner reserve 
mobilization is to save as much fuel as possible and obtain more 
reserves." 
  In order to mobilize greater reserves of fuel in conformity 
with the rapid increase in fuel demand, "we should extensively 
conduct work to save not only the fuel for production purposes 
but the fuel for consumer uses as well." 
  "One of the ways to save fuel for consumer use is to 
effectively use soot [yonjae] based on the great leader's 
teaching and the party's intent." 
  "Soot, which is used for various fields, such as 
construction 
material industry, agriculture, and metal industry, thanks to 
the development of science and technology, is used to save and 
mobilize the reserve of fuel for consumer use as well." 
  "Taking into account the number of families of residents 
using coal and petroleum, we know we can obtain considerable 
fuel reserves by saving the fuel for consumer use." 
  "The use of soot enables us to save coal for consumer use." 
  "Soot contains unburnt coal [miyonsotan] which can give off 
energy in the process of secondary burning, therefore, if we 
properly use it for the production of coal briquettes by mixing 
it with coal, we can save considerable quantity of coal for 
consumer use. If we separate unburnt coal from soot and add the 
relevant quantity to general soot, we can make coal briquette 
without using other coal at all. If we use coal briquette by 
burning it in a fire box which can retain heat well, we can cook 
rice and heat the room quickly." 
  "The use of soot enables us to save petroleum for consumer 
use as well." 
  There are inexhaustible sources of soot in the country, in 
the power plants, and in boilers at plants and enterprises, 
therefore, there are good prospects for saving fuel. 
  The problem of primary importance in mobilizing and 
utilizing 
this fuel saving reserve is to effectively conduct the work of 
separating unburnt coal from soot. 
  "To attain major success in the active campaign to save fuel 
for consumer use through the effective use of soot, we must 
enhance the role of functionaries in the administrative and 
economic organizations and in the fuel supply sector." 
  "The more we make it possible to save fuel for consumer use, 
the more we can utilize it for production and construction in 
various sectors of the people's economy, and the better can we 
promote the expedience of the residents' life." 
  "The functionaries should solve on their own the problems in 
utilizing soot for consumer fuel displaying the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and contribute to a 
smoother solution to the fuel problem."

  [Text] Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- "New Spring in 
Sokgaeul", a serial TV drama, is being screened in Korea these 
days amid the keen interest of the people. It is being screened 
for the second time at the request of the TV audience. It is 
adapted from "New Spring in Sokgaeul", a long novel of Chon 
Se-pong, who was a renowned writer of Korea. 
  The stage is set against the background of the mid-1950s 
when 
agricultural cooperativisation was started and completed in the 
country. 
  The hero of the novel is Chang Hyok, a demobilized officer 
who returned to his home village after victory in the war. The 
theme of the drama is to carry out agricultural 
cooperativisation by educating and remoulding people of 
different interests and complex backgrounds. It enjoys 
unstinting praises of the audience for its high ideological and 
artistic value, three-dimensional depiction and tested acting of 
the actors and actresses. 
  The drama was created by the General Bureau of TV and Radio 
Literature and Art. The creating staff of the bureau which 
creates dramas adapted from masterpieces has successfully 
produced far more than 100 dramas meeting the demand of the 
Workers' Party of Korea and aspiration of the people. Typical 
of them are the serial dramas "The Morning of the Plateau", 
"Joy", "On the First Shore", "Coal Miners" and "The Lark". They 
vividly portray characters with distinct personality by delicate 
delineation, rousing interests of the audience. 
  Highly estimating their successes, the dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il sent thanks to the creating staff of the serial TV 
dramas. 
  The first serial TV drama appeared in Korea in 1981. The 
staff which was inaugurated with dozens of writers, directors, 
editors, etc. has grown into a mighty group of several hundred 
creative workers and artistes, among them people's artiste An 
Mun-ha and merited artistes Ko Song-yong, Sok Song-chae, Cho 
Chong-un, So Chang-ho and dozens of other famous actors and 
actresses. 
  The creating staff is giving last touches to several works 
including serial dramas "Song of Praise to Youth" and "My Name 
Is Youth". 
  "Those Handling Fire" (17 parts) will be shortly screened. 
It depicts the struggle of the workers of the Hwanghae Iron and 
Steel Complex who became the masters of the country after the 
liberation for making a sizable contribution to the building of 
a new country by rehabilitating a furnace which was heavily 
destroyed by the Japanese imperialists.

  [Text] Thai military officials yesterday dismissed 
Cambodian Co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh's accusations that 
Thai soldiers had helped Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot flee a 
recent government offensive on the radical faction's 
headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia. 
  "The report is groundless. A convoy of trucks was used, but 
only to repatriate Cambodians fleeing the fighting into 
Thailand," armed forces spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsana-seni 
said. 
  This was the only instance of a Thai convoy entering 
Cambodia 
without the permission of the Cambodian government, he said. 
  Foreign news agencies quoted Ranariddh as saying yesterday 
that Thailand had helped Pol Pot flee Pailin. 
  "Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to 
prove it," the prince told reporters during a break in the 
second session of parliament. 
  "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being 
attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks 
driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," he was quoted 
as saying. 
  The prince was adamant that the guerrilla leader escaped 
through Thai territory. 
  "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such 
good roads in that region," he said, but did not produce the 
photographs. 
  Anuson said such an accusation could destroy Thailand's 
image 
and insisted that Khmer Rouge leaders would be arrested and 
repatriated if found on Thai soil. 
  First Army Region Commander Lt Gen Chettha Thanacharo 
meanwhile said that the Army would fire a warning shot before 
opening fire should there be any further spillover of refugees 
into Thailand. 
  Thai officers along the Thai-Cambodian frontier said last 
week that Thai authorities did not provide refuge to Khmer Rouge 
forces in the wake of the fighting in Pailin, allowing only 
civilians to enter Thai territory. 
  Ranariddh meanwhile said his government was keeping the door 
open for talks with the Khmer Rouge. Reconciliation has been 
stressed by King Norodom Sihanouk, who on Friday returns to 
Cambodia from China, where he has undergone treatment for cancer. 
  A Khmer Rouge spokesman in Phnom Penh said the nominal Khmer 
Rouge leader, Khieu Samphan, would return to the Cambodian 
capital to pay homage to Sihanouk.

  [Text] Bangkok -- Foreign Affairs Minister Sqd Ldr 
[Squadron Leader] Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said that all sides 
must bear responsibility for the disappearance of a Russian 
diplomat. 
  Sqd Ldr Prasong pointed out that it is the responsibility of 
the police to the search and investigate the case, saying he was 
not directly in charge of the affair. 
  The Russian embassy has asked for cooperation from Foreign 
Ministry on this matter, he said. 
  He said he had provided Interior Minister Gen Chawalit 
Yongchaiyut with the information in order to help the foreign 
ministry. 
  If Thai police couldn't find the missing third secretary 
Igor 
Makeyev, all must take responsibility, as it will tarnish the 
country's image because foreigners may view Thailand as an 
unsafe country. 
  The foreign minister said officers suggestions that the 
Russian envoy had already left the country was only an 
assumption because his passport was found to have been left in 
Thailand. 
  He warned those who discussed such issue to be careful in 
what they say because it might cause confusion.

Mantaphon: "Thai-UN ties: From discourse to intercourse?"] 
  [Text] Any observer of the relations between Thailand and 
the United Nations (UN) can probably pinpoint the fact that 
politics and economics have been very much in the forefront of 
their discourse in recent decades. 
  The Cambodian issue, particularly the process towards peace 
between the warring factions, was the political agenda par 
excellence throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. The issue of 
free trade and the multilateral round of trade negotiations 
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) have 
superseded that political agenda during the present decade. 
There is no better testament to this than the more than 10,000 
pages of key documents resulting from the Gatt negotiations 
which will lead to the establishment of the new World Trade 
Organization. 
  Has there been sufficient intercourse with other issues 
beyond politics and economics? 
  There has been a gradual shift towards broadening the 
relationship. For example, on a positive front, Thailand has 
become more committed to environmental issues under the UN 
umbrella. This orientation is seen in Thailand's own 
participation in the concretization of international instruments 
on the promotion and protection of the environment. These 
include the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete 
the ozone Layer, and the various treaties and declarations 
resulting from the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and 
Development. The latter include the Convention on Biological 
Diversity and the Convention on Climate Change. 
  On another front, the issue of human rights, democracy and 
development -- and their interrelationship -- have come more 
strongly to the fore. This was evidenced by Thailand's 
participation at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights held 
in Vienna. Together with other countries, it adopted the World 
Declaration and Programme of Action on Human Rights which called 
for the adherence to and implementation of international human 
rights standards at the local level, including effective 
national mechanisms for the protection of human rights. 
  Yet, there are certain realities which undermine Thai-UN 
relations. The shortcomings may be highlighted as follows: 
  1. In Thai foreign policy, there is inadequate emphasis on 
democracy, and this is exemplified by its attitude towards the 
political situation in Burma. Although the various forums of 
the UN, including the UN Human Rights Commission, have called 
for reversion to democracy and release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi 
and other elected leaders in Burma, Thailand has preferred to 
shun the issue of democracy in its relationship with Burma. It 
has been more willing to accommodate the Burmese military junta 
under the Thai and Asean policy of "constructive engagement" 
rather than distance itself from that element of 
authoritarianism and promote the cause of democracy. 
  This is a serious anomaly, as the present Thai Government 
was 
born of a democratic movement and owes its legitimacy to 
democratic underpinnings in 1992. Morally, it is obliged to 
uphold the flag of democracy internationally. 
  2. Foreign policy-making in Thai governmental circles tends 
to be bureaucratic; it is not sufficiently participatory. The 
presumption among key governmental entities is that it is they 
who should shape policy-making and the interrelationship with 
the UN. 
  Interestingly in several delegations sent to international 
meetings, the composition of the delegates is drawn purely from 
governmental circles rather than an admixture of people derived 
from non-governmental and governmental settings. Non-state 
actors, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the 
business sector, community groups and concerned individuals, are 
not sufficiently consulted and granted adequate attention. This 
is particularly related to the question of access to and from 
NGOs in setting the agenda for foreign policy, especially in 
regard to life and death issues such as democracy, development, 
human rights, the environment and peace. 
  Are there any public hearings/enquiries on foreign 
policy-making, and if so, how transparent and accountable are 
the authorities? 
  3. On many issues of concern to Thailand and the UN, the 
response on the pan of the Thai authorities is reactive rather 
than proactive. This is exemplified by the inadequate 
participation of Thai representatives in several UN forums. 
  In the key setting of the UN Human Rights Commission, 
Thailand is merely an observer rather than a full-fledged 
delegate. This implies that events are likely to shape Thailand 
rather than the reverse. This creates an imbalance, as the 
response from the authorities tends to be too late, and negative 
repercussions will ensure unnecessarily. 
  4. The policy at the national level is more curative than 
preventive on many issues. For example, while Thailand 
complains that it has many Burmese refugees on its soil, it 
fails to deal sufficiently with the root causes of such 
displacement, especially the undemocratic regime in power in 
Burma, as part of preventive action. 
  Likewise, the recent debacle concerning 25,000 Cambodian 
refugees who sought refuge on Thai territory to escape from 
fighting between the Khmer Rouge and Cambodian government forces 
in the Pailin area was a situation where international censure 
could have been prevented. In pushing those refugees back to 
Cambodia without international monitoring and transparency, 
Thailand incurred the reprimand of the international community. 
The damage could have been avoided if the authorities had 
allowed the refugees to stay in Thailand temporarily and had 
worked towards transparency of conduct in the search for humane 
solutions. 
  5. The argument of national security and the executive 
entities vested the powers to deal with national security issues 
in Thailand are both obsolete. They are the ideological 
vestiges of the Cold War days, which are imbued with vested 
interests often aimed at self-perpetuation. 
  Precisely because foreign policy and Thai-UN relations are 
at 
times shaped by such obsolete residues, the Thai response to 
several international issues is parochial rather than 
international. A key example is the persistent argument used by 
the parochial approach to claim that refugees are merely 
"illegal immigrants" without rights in Thailand. This flies in 
the face of the international perception of refugees, namely 
those fleeing for well-founded fear of persecution and other 
dangers in their country of origin, and the fact that refugees 
have guaranteed international rights, such as the right not to 
be pushed back to areas where they may fear persecution and 
other dangers. 
  The international scenario has changed radically and the 
notion of "security" now being advocated has to be based more 
upon issues of human security, development, democracy, human 
rights and peace. 
  6. Thai relations with the UN are still searching to grapple 
with transnational issues, such as cross-frontier environmental 
degradation, diseases (e.g. Aids), human rights violations, 
criminality such as the sale and trafficking of women and 
children for sexual purposes and armed conflicts. Evidently, 
unilateral action does not suffice, and international 
cooperation is a key to both prevention and cure. 
  However, precisely because Thai foreign policy is reactive 
rather than proactive, the likelihood of damage looms large. 
  7. The Thai-UN relationship is more often than not bifocal; 
it concentrates on politics and economics rather than a broader 
range of social and other issues. The latter include the 
concerns of marginalized groups, and the lack of equity and 
social justice both locally and internationally. There is 
inadequate attention for the issue of income distribution and 
resource reallocation to help those who are poor and 
peripheralized. Gender and racial discrimination also rears its 
head in many circles, both national and international. 
  It is precisely this neglect that renders Thai foreign 
policy 
and its intercourse with the UN less than comprehensive. 
  For the future, the Thai-UN agenda should address the above 
failings by underlining the following components: 
  -- democracy, development, environment, peace and human 
rights as key underpinnings of Thai foreign policy, 
  -- a more participatory and pluralistic process for 
formulating and disseminating foreign policy, especially with 
the cooperation of non-state actors and the institution of 
public hearings/enquiries, 
  -- a more proactive approach in and beyond the UN, as well 
as more emphasis on preventive action and early-warning against 
possible violations of international standards, 
  -- more accession to international treaties on human 
rights and effective implementation of international standards 
to counter undue nationalism and parochialism, 
  -- a more humane and people-centred vision of national and 
international security, shunning the vestiges of the ideological 
past, 
  -- a more effective response to and an agenda on 
transnational issues, 
  -- a more concrete insertion of social and 
non-political/economic issues in the priorities of foreign 
policy. 
  The impact on Thai-UN relations can be reinforced by 
activities within and beyond the UN as follows: 
  Multilateral level: 
  -- establishment of an agenda for peace and security with 
a more people-based vision 
  -- adoption of an agenda for social development in a more 
pluralistic setting 
  -- promotion of the linkage between democracy, 
development, environment, peace and human rights, and 
transnational action 
  Regional/sub-regional/bilateral levels: 
  -- incorporation of issues of social development, for 
example a social development agenda, into all regional and other 
forums that deal with economic, political, peace and security 
issues (e.g. the Asean regional forum and Asean Free Trade Area, 
and bilateral joint commissions) 
  -- establishment of independent and accessible human 
rights system to prevent and remedy human rights abuses 
  -- enhancement of the linkage between democracy, 
development, environment, peace and human rights in the national 
and transnational setting 
  National/local levels: 
  -- establishment of human rights units in all government 
ministries to promote human rights and its linkage with the 
other issues noted above 
  -- adoption of national plans of action on human rights 
and their linkage with other issues 
  -- institution of a national human rights mechanism which 
is accessible, independent and transparent 
  With these orientations in mind, we can work towards 
ensuring 
that the discourse is not relegated to the realm of lip 
services, and that it becomes a forward-looking interaction well 
into next century.

  [Text] The Cabinet yesterday approved the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs' proposal to open a Thai consulate in Auckland, 
which is the largest city and a major gateway of New Zealand. 
New Zealand has a policy called Asia 2000 to expand its 
relationship with Asian countries. Thailand thus deems it 
appropriate to open an honorary consulate to deal with the 
increased trade and tourism. The Cabinet also approved the 
appointment of Sir Michael Wales as the honorary consul for 
Thailand in Auckland. 
  Meanwhile, the Cabinet approved the opening of the honorary 
consulate in the Republic of Latvia and the appointment of Mr. 
Prasong Chongrattanakun the honorary consul of the Republic of 
Latvia to Thailand.

  [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit 
yesterday said he voted in support of the Opposition's 
constitution amendment bill last week because the 
Government-proposed bills were based on the 1992 Constitution 
criticised as being undemocratic and dictatorial. 
  The 1992 Constitution was drafted at the order of the 
now-defunct National Peace-keeping Council [NPKC] which 
overthrew the Chatchai Chunhawan Government on February 23, 1991. 
  Gen Wimon said he thought it proper to support the 
Opposition 
bill based on the 1978 Constitution which had no connection with 
the NPKC in any way. 
  If we truly want to discard the dictatorial image of the 
NPKC, the proposed amendments should be based on the 1978 
Constitution, he said. 
  The Army chief said any amendment of the 1992 Constitution 
was likely to come in for criticism from some groups. 
  He said he wanted to see the nation united but thought this 
would be difficult while criticisms persisted. 
  A number of issues might yet be amended in the Opposition 
draft. 
  He said the reduction in the eligible voting age to 18 had 
divided senators and he hoped the committee appointed to 
scrutinise the bill would look carefully into the matter. 
  Gen Wimon said senators supporting the Opposition last 
Thursday had acted independently. 
  This contradicts another senator who claimed Upper House 
members had been lobbied to vote in favour of the Opposition. 
  The Army commander yesterday said he was worried some people 
might exploit the present situation. 
  He also thought it improper to say the situation would be 
tense during the scrutiny of the Constitution. 
  Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet said senators 
voted for the Opposition bill because they found it acceptable. 
  He also came to the defence of Defence Minister Gen Wichit 
Sukmak who is under attack from Government MPs for voting for 
the Opposition draft. 
  Adm Prachet said Gen Wichit was acting in his capacity as a 
senator, not a Cabinet member, when he voted on the issue. 
  He said any move such as replacing Gen Wichit should be 
based 
on reason. 
  Adm Prachet said the Government had made it clear from the 
beginning that the attempt to amend the Constitution had nothing 
to do with the Government and senators were free to exercise 
their own judgement. 
  House Military Committee chairman Gen Athit Kamlang-ek 
yesterday also backed Gen Wichit by saying he did not think the 
minister had committed any grave mistakes. 
  "I know Prime Minister Chuan Likphai quite well and don't 
think he will replace Gen Wichit. He is polite and has respect 
for other people," said the former army commander. 
  Mr Chuan, meanwhile last night vouched his support for Gen 
Wichit. 
  The premier said he fully understood the general whom he met 
for talks yesterday. 
  He said Gen Wichit did not vote for the change in the agenda 
to place the Opposition draft ahead of the eight amendments 
bills proposed by the coalition parties because he did not 
support the move. 
  The defence minister voted in favour of the Opposition draft 
because he felt the eight amendment bills were not sponsored by 
the Government, but the coalition parties. 
  The prime minister praised Gen Wichit as an honest and 
responsible man citing his cooperation in amending the capital 
peacekeeper's law. 
  Earlier, Mr Chuan said there was no misunderstanding on Gen 
Wichit's part since he knew from the beginning the amendments 
were not government drafts. He was not asked to vote for them 
as everyone had the right to exercise their own judgement. 
  The Premier also said there was no law prohibiting Gen 
Wichit 
from being both a senator and cabinet minister. 
  He would not say what was discussed with Gen Wichit 
yesterday 
but said: 
  "Gen Wichit is a soldier and a gentleman and he is not 
afraid 
of anything." 
  Gen Wichit yesterday refused comment on reports that 
Democrat 
Party MPs were pressing him to resign after he supported the 
Opposition-sponsored constitution amendment bill. 
  Gen Wichit, a senator appointed to the defence portfolio 
under the Democrat quota, insisted he had the right under the 
Constitution to a free vote. 
  The Defence Minister last week joined the majority of 
senators and the entire Opposition in an unprecedented move to 
beat the government-sponsored constitution amendment bills 
during the special session of Parliament. 
  Democrat MPs are reportedly angry with Gen Wichit and want 
him expelled from the Chuan Likphai Cabinet. 
  Gen Wichit denied discussing any political issues with the 
Premier yesterday. 
  He said the meeting was about the opening of the Thai-Lao 
Friendship Bridge scheduled for Friday. 
  He also denied he was told to choose between being a senator 
and a minister or that there had been any political pressure put 
on him. 
  It had earlier been reported that Gen Wichit told Mr Chuan 
he 
had voted with the Senate because he was afraid his lack of 
cooperation with the military might affect his work at the 
Defence Ministry. 
  Mr Chuan said there was no need for the Defence Minister to 
explain his vote to the Cabinet.

  [Text] Thailand's overall economic situation in 1993 was 
better than previously estimated. The country's economic growth 
rates increased from 7.6 percent in 1992 to 7.8 percent in 1993. 
In 1994, there are several factors, both external and internal, 
indicating that the Thai economic growth rate will exceed 8 
percent, but it may result in a more severe inflation rate above 
4.2 percent. 
  Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's 
Office, gave a briefing on the outcome of yesterday's cabinet 
meeting and said that the cabinet acknowledged the 
above-mentioned report presented by the governor of the Bank of 
Thailand. According to the report, the International Monetary 
Fund [IMF] has estimated that Thailand's total export value this 
year will possibly increase by more than 15 percent because the 
economies of its trading partners, especially the United States, 
are improving. Besides, there has also been greater demand for 
Thai goods in Japan and Europe. 
  Thailand, however, is expected to suffer a greater trade 
deficit than originally estimated due to the increased import of 
goods for use in expanding export-oriented production. 
Regarding competition in goods exports, there will be new 
competitors -- China and Vietnam. Due to greater export 
expansion in 1994, possible shortages of labor and raw materials 
are predicted. Thailand will not be faced with a capital 
shortage as has happened in the past because investors consider 
Thailand to still have good basic factors for investment. The 
influx of foreign capital contributes to better financial 
liquidity. The expansion of loans is expected to reach 22 
percent -- a considerably high rate when compared to that of 20 
percent in 1993. To maintain economic stability in Thailand, 
IMF representatives advised the Thai Government to establish a 
highly efficient savings system and at the same time cut down 
expenses.

<F P=106> [Report by Kim Ik-hyon and Kang Yong-chin] </F>
  [Text] Security-related ministers held a six-hour long 
emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence in 
Samchong-tong, Seoul on 5 April to discuss countermeasures on 
the North Korean nuclear issue following the U.S. request that 
the ROK concede on the issue of exchanging North-South special 
envoys, a precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. 
talks, in an effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. 
Failing to reach any consensus, however, the government is 
having trouble coming up with a clear position on this issue. 
  A righ-ranking government official disclosed that Prime 
Minister Yi Hoe-chang, Yi Yong-tok, deputy prime minister and 
unification board minister, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Kim 
Tok, National Security Planning Agency Director, and Yi 
Chong-uk, senior presidential secretary for foreign and national 
security affairs, gathered at the prime minister's official 
residence and extensively discussed measures regarding nuclear 
negotiations with North Korea from 1600 [0700 GMT] to 2200 [1300 
GMT] that day, but failed to reach any conclusion. 
  Following Foreign Minister Han's briefing on his trip to the 
United States, discussion centered around the U.S. suggestions 
for concession on the issue of exchanging North-South special 
envoys, and resumption of the Team Spirit military exercise. 
  According to a source, two very different views conflicted 
with one another at the meeting: While some argued that 
conceding on the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys 
so that North Korea- U.S. talks can proceed and, North Korea can 
be lead to receive nuclear inspections was a realistic way to 
resolving the nuclear issue, others insisted on not giving up on 
North-South dialogue. 
  It was learned that those in favor of conceding, noted the 
atmosphere in the international community and the United States 
of placing more importance on the realization of North 
Korea-U.S. talks as they feel that the UN action resulted from 
the International Atomic Energy agency's [IAEA] inspections and 
not the lack of progress in North-South dialogue. 
  Those opposed to any concession argued that conceding would 
appear as though our side were being dragged along by North 
Korea's tactics to delay talks and warned of public criticism of 
the government for repeated concessions to North Korea. 
  In a recent letter in the name of Kang Sok-chu, vice foreign 
minister and senior delegate of the North Korean side to North 
Korea-U.S. talks, to Robert Gallucci, U.S. Assistant Secretary 
of State and U.S. side's senior delegate, the North Korean side 
said that "if the United States does not link the holding of a 
third round of North Korea-U.S. talks with the exchange of 
North-South special envoys, which was put forward as a 
precondition for the talks, North Korea will accept additional 
inspections by the IAEA." Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher pointed out that "acceptance [of North Korean 
demand] is the only realistic method to breaking the current 
situation," and asked the ROK side to consider it. 
  Citing domestic sentiments, however, Foreign Minister Han 
reportedly expressed an opposing view. 
  Discussing how the situation must appear to the public with 
the confusion within the government pertaining to the 
negotiation strategy on the North Korean nuclear issue, another 
source revealed that the security-related ministers agreed on 
the need to fine tune the government's position, and decided to 
adjust flexibly to developments in the situation while adhering 
to existing policies. 
  Participants at the meeting also voiced concern over the 
possibility of Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong's recent 
remarks on the possibility of considering a plan to withdraw the 
demand to exchange North-South special envoys, upsetting 
government policy.

<F P=106> [Report by Ha Won from Tokyo] </F>
  [Text] North Korea and China are stepping up bilateral 
military cooperation, THE SANKEI SHIMBUN reported on 5 April, 
quoting a Hong Kong-based U.S. Congressional source on Asian 
affairs. 
  According to the paper, North Korea has developed long-range 
missiles with modern technologies from China. China, in return, 
is exporting missiles and other arms to the Middle East region 
via North Korean ports. 
  The source said that the China North Industries Group and 
Poly Technologies Incorporated are working in close military 
cooperation with North Korea. Both manufacture and sell arms 
and are directly controlled by the People's Liberation Army. 
The source added that the bilateral relations of cooperation 
between China and North Korea have been maintained for a long 
period of time through these organs. 
  In particular, the China North Industries Group has recently 
provided modern missile technology to North Korea, enabling it 
to complete the development of long-range missiles, the paper 
reported. 
  The paper pointed out that chances are very slim that China, 
which accounts for 85 percent of major imported goods to North 
Korea, will take part in practical sanctions against North 
Korea, even if it abstains when the UN Security Council votes on 
economic sanctions against North Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The United States has 
decided to take hard-line action against North Korea, including 
resumption of this year's "Team Spirit" military drill if 
Pyongyang fails to fulfill a statement by the United Nations 
Security Council urging it to allow additional nuclear 
inspections, by April 15 when Defense Secretary William Perry 
visits Seoul, a vernacular Japanese newspaper reported Tuesday. 
  Washington's new direction was decided Monday at the first 
U.S. administration meeting on the North Korean nuclear issue 
chaired by the chief negotiator at high-level talks with 
Pyongyang, Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, a 
senior U.S. official told the MAINICHI SHIMBUN. 
  Attendants of the meeting included officials above the 
assistant- secretarial level from the State and Defense 
Departments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence 
Agency and the National Security Council. 
  Officials from most agencies except for the State Department 
agreed that action against North Korea was inevitable, the U.S. 
official said. 
  It was agreed at the meeting that Washington will prepare 
action and follow-up measures if North Korea shows no 
willingness to compromise by early next week, the official said. 
  Time is running out for North Korea as the mood in 
Washington 
has hardened since the communist regime's obstruction of checks 
by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and as a 
hard-line stance is prevailing in Congress, the official told 
MAINICHI.

  [Text] Seoul, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The government reaffirmed 
Tuesday [5 April] the initial Seoul-Washington position that no 
further high-level talks between North Korea and the United 
States will be held unless Pyongyang allows additional 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and 
exchanges special envoys with the South. 
  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang chaired a strategic cabinet 
meeting attended by Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok, Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu and the director of the Agency for 
National Security Planning, Kim Tok, and reiterated the South 
Korean-U.S. stance after being briefed on Han's visits to 
Washington and Tokyo. 
  Han played up the significance of a statement by the United 
Nations Security Council in the name of its President 
Jean-Bernard Merimee, adopted unanimously last week, urging 
North Korea to permit full nuclear inspections. 
  Concerned countries are working closely to ensure that North 
Korea allows additional nuclear checks before the deadline, 
reportedly fixed for early May, Han reported at the meeting. 
  The foreign minister said he had discussed dropping the 
inter-Korean exchange of envoys as a condition for high-level 
North Korea-U.S. talks with his American counterpart Warren 
Christopher and other senior officials, but decided against it 
in light of South Koreans' sentiments.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 (YONHAP) -- A senior official of 
Chochongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in Japan], 
a federation of pro-Pyongyang Koreans residing in Japan, said 
Tuesday that Kim Chong-il has taken over power from his father, 
President Kim Il-song. 
  Chochongnyon Vice Chairman Ho Chong-man said, "(North 
Korean) 
Workers' Party Secretary Kim Chong-il has taken over power in 
politics, the economy and the military from his father Kim 
Il-song." 
  Ho made the remarks in an address at a plenary session of 
the 
Social Democratic Party's Japan-North Korea Committee. 
  Ho added that he had met with Kim Chong-il for about two 
hours while visiting North Korea from Feb. 15 to March 1. 
  He said that "Kim looked very well," denying rumors that Kim 
had been severely injured. 
  Chochongnyon sends remittances of 500 million to 600 million 
U.S. dollars to North Korea every year and its senior officials 
are well- informed on the communist country.

in South Korea through our consulate-general or embassy but the

  "The government's position on the matter remains the same as

saying.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 6 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean 
ambassador here, asserting "threat of nuclear arms development 
by South Korea and Japan is becoming a reality," said Wednesday 
his country will determine whether to develop nuclear weapons 
depending on the extent of the effect such a threat would have 
on their sovereignty. 
  Ambassador Cha Pong-chu said in an exclusive interview with 
the YONHAP News Agency that at the moment North Korea has no 
plan to develop nuclear arms. 
  "We hope to resolve the nuclear question through dialogue," 
Cha said. "To this end, a third-round North Korea-U.S. meeting 
should be held at an early date to discuss the issue." 
  He claimed that Japan's intent of getting nuclearly armed is 
an openly-known thing. "Japan will rise up (militarily) again 
under all circumstances," he said. 
  Cha said even if North Korea develops nuclear arms, they 
would not be directed against other part of the Korean peninsula 
where he said the same brethren live or against the United 
States across the Pacific. 
  "Our nuclear arms, if developed, would be primarily designed 
to contain Japan," he said. 
  The ambassador said North Korea's official position toward 
the issue of nuclear development is that "we have neither the 
intent nor the ability of developing nculear weapons." 
  In particualr, he said, North Korea has no expertise to 
develop nuclear weapons. 
  Cha said North Korea will not attack South Korea first. 
"But, if we were attacked, we will not sit idly by," he said, 
adding that if a war recurs, there will be no winner or loser. 
"We all will have no choice but to die," he said. 
  He further said North Korea has already gone through all 
IAEA 
inspections, the outcome of which he said showed there is no 
nuclear suspicion. 
  "IAEA's demand for additional inspection notwithstanding is 
an undue pressure stemming from a scheme of the United States to 
eliminate us," the North Korean ambassador said.

  [Text] It was learned on 4 April [New York time] that, 
regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, North Korean Foreign 
Minsiter Kim Yong-nam threatened in his letter to UN 
Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that "a war may take place 
again on the Korean peninsula." 
  In his letter dated 23 March, which was opened to the public 
by the United Nations on 4 April, Minister Kim threatened that 
the Korean peninsula would again face such unfortunate history 
as that of the 1950's if the UN Security Council yields to U.S. 
insistence on adopting a resolution unfavorable to North Korea. 
In the letter, Minister Kim also said that North Korea would 
resume its peaceful nuclear activities and warned that it is 
possible for North Korea to adhere to its decision to withdraw 
from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which was made last 
year. 
  In March, when the International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspection team reported that the recent inspection of North 
Korean nuclear facilities was insufficient, the United States 
asked member nations of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to adopt 
a UNSC resolution urging North Korea to allow additional 
inspections.

  [Text] Washington, April 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and 
U.S. officials held a trade subcommittee meeting here to discuss 
pending issues on Monday and Tuesday. 
  According to the South Korean Embassy, the United States 
expressed disappointment that no progress had been made on 
Korea's opening its market to American automobiles at the 16th 
working-level meeting. 
  South Korea, however, said that Trade, Industry and Energy 
Minister Kim Chol-su and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
can discuss the matter while in Morocco this month for the 
signing of the Uruguay Round agreement. 
  Washington also complained about the way Seoul handles 
protection of U.S. trademarks and intellectual property rights 
and demanded the lifting of a regulation on importation of 
frozen codfish heads and sausages. 
  South Korea expressed concern over the revival of the Super 
301 trade provision while protesting the U.S. delay in a new 
dumping trial for Korean-made color televisions and inclusion of 
Korean standard pipes in a list coming under anti-dumping 
regulations. 
  Seoul urged Washington to acknowledge its efforts to protect 
U.S. intellectual property rights and drop it from the Priority 
Watch List (PWL). 
  Moreover, South Korea voiced concern over a U.S. court 
ruling 
on "business secret violence" between Korea's Iljin Corp. and 
America's General Electric. 
  The two nations also discussed ways to narrow their 
differences in the investment and service sectors. 
  Chong Ui-yong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's 
International Trade Bureau, led the Korean delegation while 
Peter Collins, deputy assistant trade representative, headed the 
U.S. side.

  [Text] No country in the world but Korea has fallen victim 
to Section 301 of the U.S. omnibus trade bill even before 
Washington designated it as the target of comprehensive 
retaliation, a state- run think tank said in a report yesterday. 
  The Korea Institute for International Economic Policy [KIEP] 
advised the administration not to be scared by the invocation of 
the bill, which is originally a domestic law and contradicts the 
freer world trade order under the Uruguay Round accord. 
  Washington, which recently revived the section, popularly 
called Super 301 provision, is pressing Seoul to reduce what it 
describes as barriers in the auto market and threatening to 
designate Korea's auto import regulations as a "priority foreign 
country practice" otherwise. 
  Korea and the United States held two-day working-level trade 
talks in Washington yesterday which focused on the auto issue. 
  The Bush administration designated Japan, India and Brazil 
as 
priority foreign countries under the Section 301 in May 1989, 
putting six import practices of the three countries in its 
sights for urgent improvement. 
  What Americans called unfair trade practices concerned the 
Japanese government's procurement of supercomputers, India's 
purchase of artificial satellites and Indonesia's allegedly 
technical barriers in forestry development. 
  The three countries all turned down negotiations with the 
United States roundly as far as the talks entailed retaliation, 
ultimately escaping any retaliatory step, the KIEP said. 
  Actually, Japan agreed with the United States to comply with 
the latter's demand for economic restructuring that could 
facilitate U.S. access to the Japanese market on condition 
Washington excluded Tokyo from the list of priority foreign 
countries and reserved retaliation. 
  Washington got little tangible outcome from its talks with 
Tokyo on restructuring. 
  Brazil also led the United States to reverse its earlier 
designation by reducing import restrictions on some products 
through subsequent negotiations. 
  India was solely put on the list but was given no 
substantial 
retaliation. 
  Korea, for its part, expanded the farm market opening wider 
and committed itself to reducing tariffs on seven products while 
the United States was just reviewing its import practices with a 
threat of retaliation. 
  "Korea was the only country that yielded to the shadow of 
the 
Section Super 301 and made great concessions to the United 
States all ahead of the application of the provision," the 
report said. 
  The research body said that Korea does not have to be 
concerned too much over the Section Super 301 to lose core 
interests before negotiations. 
  "Many countries point out that the U.S. provision will be 
contradictory with the Uruguay Round of the new international 
trade regime which will set forth the World Trade Organization," 
it added.

  [Text] The government, which is working on the tariff 
schedule for 1995, is considering raising the tariff rates on 
apparel, footwear and toys up to 15 percent from the current 8 
percent level. 
  Though it is set to accommodate tariff concessions it has 
committed itself to under the Uruguay Round accord, the 
government has room for tariff rate increases for apparel, 
footwear and toys, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. 
  Under the Uruguay Round accord concluded last December, the 
ministry said, Korea is set to cut the tariff rates in the years 
ahead, not from the current 8 percent level, but from the 20 
percent level in the 1986 base year. 
  The ministry said the government will consider industrial 
competitiveness in readjusting tariff rates and that tariff 
rates on apparel, footwear and other light industrial products 
are far lower than in other countries. 
  In Japan, for example, tariff rates on apparel, footwear and 
toys exceed 20 percent, the ministry said. 
  The government, it said, will be able to lower tariff rates 
on heavy-chemical industrial products. 
  The 1995 tariff schedule will include yearly cuts in tariff 
rates that are set to decline to zero percent or to a minimum 
level in five to 10 years under the Uruguay Round accord, the 
ministry said. 
  Those items whose tariffs are scheduled to be eliminated 
during the next five to 10 years include computer input and 
output devices, printers and semiconductors. 
  To reduce the impact of the opening of the domestic farm 
market, the ministry said, the government plans to introduce 
specific tariff rates on certain farm products. 
  The government will also consider applying the higher rates 
of the ad valorem and specific rates on certain other farm 
products, the ministry said. 
  Specific rates will help curb low-priced imports as they are 
applied to the volume of imports in contrast with ad valorem 
rates applied to the value of imports, the ministry said. 
  The government will no longer prepare a five-year tariff 
reduction plan, the ministry said. The second five-year tariff 
reduction plan ends this year. 
  When tariffs were high, the government was forced to 
announce 
long-term tariff reduction plans. The average tariff rate, 
which stood at 21.9 percent, has been cut to 7.9 percent as of 
this year. 
  "Even without a tariff reduction plan, Korea is set to cut 
tariff rates under the Uruguay Round accord," said an official 
from the ministry. "In addition, we do now know that will 
happen during the next five years." 
  The ministry said the government will prepare a draft tariff 
schedule for the 1995 during the first half of this year and 
send it to the National Assembly for approval in September. 
  A committee set up to work on the draft schedule, chaired by 
Ku Pyong-hoe, chairman of the Korea Foreign Trade Association, 
held its first meeting yesterday morning. Committee members 
include government officials, economists and business 
representatives.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] yesterday announced a 
plan to conduct a reform of the tariff rate structure this year 
in line with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade negotiations. 
  As Korea committed itself to levying no tariffs on specific 
products or harmonizing its tariff system with those of the GATT 
members at the Uruguay Round, the overall overhaul of the 
existing tariff rate structures is needed, MOF officials said. 
Furthermore, Korea needs to come out with the new tariff rate 
programs as its second five-year tariff rate reduction program 
will be due this year, it said. Under the five-year plan, 
Korea's average tariff rate will fall to 7.9 percent by the end 
of this year, from 12.7 percent in 1989. The average tariff rate 
was 7.1 percent for industrial products and 17.8 percent for 
agricultural products at the end of last year, compared with 
11.2 percent and 20.6 percent, respectively, in 1989. 
  Despite foreign "satisfaction" over Korea's "low" tariff 
rates, there has been some criticism in the Korean business 
community that the government lowered the tariff rate too 
rapidly, without full taking into consideration the nation's 
economic status. 
  The MOF yesterday held a first working-level conference to 
reform the tariff rate structures. The new plan will become 
effective from next year following a formal endorsement from the 
National Assembly this fall, the MOF said. In the reform, the 
government will institute a system of levying customs duties on 
agriculture, fisheries and light industrial products on the 
basis of the imported quantity, not the imported value. This is 
designed to protect domestic industries from an influx of cheap 
foreign goods, it said. The government will also retain the 
right to levy tariffs on these agricultural products and light 
industrial goods either on the basis of imported volume or 
imported value, it said. 
  The reform will be made in such a way as to strengthen the 
international competitiveness of domestic industries through 
customs duties adjustment, it said. Existing imbalance of tariff 
rates on different industrial sectors will be adjusted. Instead 
of frequently levying "emergency or adjustment tariff rates," 
the government will made a realistic adjustment on customs 
duties on specific products, it said.

league in Japan from going to North Korea. YOMIURI SHIMBUN 
added that amid this kind of situation, the ship, 
Mangyongbong-92, which uses one of the routes used for sending 
money to North Korea left Niigata port, Japan for Wonsan, North 
Korea on 30 March. 
  It is the third time that Mangyongbong-92 set sail from 
Japan 
this year. After loading cargo at Niigata port on 28 March, 
Mangyongbong-92 set sail on 30 March at around 1000. 
  Mangyongbong-92, which set sail from Niigata port, arrived 
26 
hours later in Wonsan. Members of the pro-North Korean 
residents' league in Japan use this ship, which can carry up to 
250 people. It is also being used to transport cargo. 
  It was learned that in 1993 Mangyongbong-92 entered Niigata 
port on 25 occasions. It transported about 5,000 members of the 
pro- North Korean residents' league in Japan to North Korea and 
various cargo. 
  YOMIURI SHIMBUN pointed out that if the UN Security Council 
decides to carry out economic sanctions against North Korea and 
thus prohibits Japanese trade with North Korea and pro-North 
Korean residents league in Japan from visiting North Korea, 
there is a high possibility that Mangyongbong-92 will not be 
able to enter Japan any longer.

  [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government decided to expand military exchanges with Japan, 
informed sources said on Saturday [2 April]. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae will visit Japan on April 25 
for the first time as Korean defense minister and will have a 
meeting with the Japanese defense minister. 
  Both ministers are to discuss military exchanges between the 
two countries. 
  "The people's feeling has banned military exchanges between 
Seoul and Tokyo so far, but Yi's visit to Japan will be a 
momentum to activate military exchanges between the two 
countries," a government official said. 
  It is highly likely that navy ships of both countries will 
visit each other as early as this year, the official said. 
  Meanwhile, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Yi Yang-ho, 
who accompanied President Kim Yong-sam's visit to Japan and 
China, met with Japanese military leaders in Tokyo to discuss 
North Korea's nuclear problem and measures for a possible 
missile attack from Pyongyang.

  [Text] Amid growing criticism of the confusing government 
policy on foreign affairs and national security, an 
interministry body on policy coordination in the area will be 
soon formed, a Chongwadae [presidential office] official said 
yesterday. 
  The presidential office reached the conclusion there is a 
need for a coordinating body which will hold meetings on a 
regular basis as cacophonous views, especially on the North 
Korean nuclear issue, are being aired by ranking officials of 
the National Unification Board [NUB], the Foreign Ministry, the 
Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] and other 
security-related agencies, confusing the people. 
  Chongwadae has conducted indepth studies on whether to 
strengthen the function of the presidential secretary for 
foreign affairs and national security or create a new policy 
coordinating council. 
  The conclusion was that it preferred the formation of a 
coordinating body to the beefing up the role of the senior 
presidential aide. 
  The policy coordinating body will be launched this week and 
meet every week to check and analyze the security situation on 
and around the Korean peninsula so as to tune the policy the 
government will pursue. 
  A ranking Chongwadae official said yesterday, "We are 
studying whether the policy coordinating body will have the 
chiefs of government agencies dealing with foreign affairs and 
national security." 
  He added, "The body will not be the same as the National 
Security Council of the United States in character. It will be 
only aimed at discussing and adjusting policies on diplomacy and 
national security." 
  Currently, there are some similar conferences, including a 
meeting of security-related Cabinet members presided over by 
President Kim Yong-sam, a high-level strategy conference chaired 
by Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang and a unification-related Cabinet 
ministers' meeting presided over by Deputy Premier-National 
Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok. 
  The Chongwadae official said, "Since the Chief Executive 
makes the final decisions on diplomatic and security policy, the 
coordinating body will act to assist the President." 
  The body will consist of ministers of the NUB, Foreign 
Ministry, NSP director and ranking officials from the 
presidential office.

  [Text] Seoul, April 6 (YONHAP) -- Opposition Democratic 
Party [DP] Chairman Yi Ki-taek urged President Kim Yong-sam 
Wednesday to make resolute decisions on a series of recent 
incidents that he claimed have precipitated a national crisis. 
  Speaking at a press conference, Yi singled out four 
"suspicious affairs" including the violent power struggle at the 
Chogye Buddhist order, modifications in the Uruguay Round trade 
pact and a wavering government policy on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The current national crisis precipitated by these affairs 
was 
caused by "the absence of governing ability" and "the dogmatic 
ruling style" of the president, Yi declared. 
  He alleged that "political authorities" were behind the 
recent clash at the Chogye Buddhist order involving the 
re-election of its executive chief. 
  Obviously trying to make political hay out of the religious 
incident, Yi claimed "this is a grave problem that calls into 
question the basic morality" of the Kim administration. 
  In addition, he cited other serious incidents including 
alleged irregularities in the process of moving the site of 
Sangmu University, electioneering before the legally allowed 
period, and suspicion over possible police surveillance of 
former DP chairman Kim Tae-chung. 
  Doubts over these allegations must be cleared up, Yi 
insisted. 
  Meanwhile the spokesman for the ruling Democratic Liberal 
Party, Ha Sun-pong, issued a statement refuting Yi's charges. 
"The Democratic Party is trying to confuse the people by making 
political issues out of national and international difficulties 
the nation is facing." 
  "Chairman Yi should stop making irresponsible and 
instigative 
remarks," ha said. 
  Yi said that after a gang of goons had been brought in to 
beat up demonstrators demanding the resignation of Chogye chief 
executive the Rev. So Ui-hyon, police only arrested the 
demonstrators and not the ruffians. 
  This, he said, proves that political authorities are 
involved 
in the incident. 
  As for irregularities at Sangmu University, Yi said that 
according to his party's investigation, some 22.7 billion won 
had been raised for a slush fund and the money "flowed into" 
ruling Democratic Liberal Party coffers during the presidential 
election campaign. 
  Commenting on changes in the government's execution plans 
for 
the Uruguay Round agreement, Yi said the administration had 
caved in to pressure from the United States and other countries 
and made several concessions. 
  "This is a deceitful action on the part of the government," 
Yi declared. "It is unacceptable under any excuses." 
  The Democratic Party will stage outdoor rallies in order to 
condemn the government for its "lax attitude" and incompetence, 
Yi vowed. 
  With regard to the illegal electioneering allegedly 
committed 
by the mayor of Inchon and the governor of South Chungchong 
Province, two of the president's close associates, Yi accused 
the government of not punishing them. 
  Yi also demanded that the government fire Home Affairs 
Minister Choe Hyong-u for such incidents as the suspected police 
surveillance of Kim Tae-chung.

  [Text] President Kim Yong-sam yesterday expressed strong 
displeasure over the illicit election campaigning cases in which 
his close associates were implicated. Kim also said he was 
dissatisfied with the way the administration handled the 
revision of the country schedule of the Uruguay Round world 
trade pact. 
  "I had made it clear that this administration will not 
tolerate any illegality and wrongdoing in elections," the 
President said in a breakfast meeting with the cabinet members. 
Some people acquainted with past practices may commit 
wrongdoings, but (this administration's) commitment to clean 
elections should not be blemished under any circumstances, Kim 
said. 
  Kim made the tough remarks apparently in reference to the 
controversies created by his own close associates, including 
Inchon Mayor Choe Ki-son and South Chungchong Province Gov. Pak 
Tae-kwon. 
  Choe has already been formally warned by the Central 
Election 
Management Committee (CEMC) for distributing umbrellas to Inchon 
citizens in February. The election watchdog took the action 
after it concluded Choe, a former lawmaker, had conducted what 
amounted to campaigning for next year's local elections. 
  The CEMC is also investigating similar alleged illegal 
campaign activities by Pak, also a former member of the national 
legislature. Choe allegedly sponsored mountain climbing and 
overseas trips for South Chungchong Province citizens. 
  Both Choe and Pak were appointed by President Kim, and the 
opposition Democratic Party has been strongly demanding that Kim 
fire them. 
  A top Chongwadae [presidential office] official, however, 
indicated yesterday that President Kim will not take any 
punitive action against either Choe or Pak. 
  "The President's remarks emphasizing clean elections (at 
yesterday's meeting with the cabinet) should not be interpreted 
as meaning that he will take action against the two," said Yi 
Won- chong, the senior presidential secretary for political 
affairs. 
  Regarding the dispute over the Uruguay Round country 
schedule, President Kim urged the cabinet to reveal the truth to 
the people. "I hardly understand why we should have this kind of 
a dispute," Kim said. The administration should either seek the 
people's understanding or make apologies in accordance with the 
truth, he said. 
  Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang expressed his regrets over both 
the alleged illegal election campaign cases and the Uruguay 
Round controversy. 
  Opposition parties and news media have been criticizing the 
administration on the assumption that the government modified 
the country schedule in secret, Yi said. "But the Uruguay Round 
agreement entitles each country to make some changes to the 
country schedule," he said. The administration did nothing 
dishonest or immoral because the changes were made in 
consideration of the interest of farmers, the prime minister 
said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first </F>
prime minister of the Royal Government of Cambodia, by a TV and 
Radio Cambodia correspondent on 5 April; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Summary from poor reception] [Correspondent] Highness, I 
represent the national TV and Radio Cambodia Network. 
Concerning the peace and security question, the general public 
has asked why there is insufficient stability in the country 
despite the fact that the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has 
been set up for months as the legitimate government of the 
country? 
  [Ranariddh] "Thank you. First, I would like to thank you, 
who represent the national tv and radio network, for 
interviewing me today on questions that are of concern not only 
to the people and Buddhist monks in general but also to His 
Majesty our august king, who continues to closely follow 
developments in the Kingdom of Cambodia, especially the on-going 
bloodshed between Cambodians. 
  "The government is not happy with the current situation 
despite the fact that the so-called general war has been 
transformed into a mere state of insurgency. The RGC is not 
pleased at all with this insurgency war. Compared with the 
overall peaceful situation of the country, however, we see that 
this insurgency is very marginal. Nevertheless, the concern of 
His Majesty the king as well as that of the general public is 
most understandable. And it is the responsibility of the RGC, 
for the duty of the RGC born out of the elections is to seek 
peace and security for the people." 
  In addition to this question of peace, there is the Khmer 
Rouge problem. As first prime minister of the RGC, I would like 
to inform the public of the following: I am very saddened by 
what is happening between us and the Khmer Rouge. We still have 
this Khmer Rouge problem to solve although we already held 
elections, reintroduced the monarchy, formed the RGC, and wrote 
the Constitution. After being nominated prime minister, I 
agreed to make so many concessions to the Khmer Rouge. Some of 
my cabinet ministers even criticized me for tarnishing the 
prestige of the legal, elected government by consenting to meet 
with Khieu Samphan. "They said: Khieu Samphan has never 
officially recognized you as prime minister. He always 
addresses you only as chairman of FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative 
Cambodia]." But I still agreed to meet with him. This shows 
that the RGC and I have never hesitated in trying to put an end 
to the conflict between Cambodians. 
  We have always supported His Majesty the king's five-point 
proposal for peace, a proposal which demands that the Khmer 
Rouge dissolve their army, a cease-fire be declared, and the 
Khmer Rouge be included in the government if they wish. When I 
talked to Khieu Samphan, he said these conditions were designed 
by the Vietnamese. I just mentioned above that these conditions 
were proposed by His Majesty, but Khieu Samphan insisted they 
were proposed instead by the Vietnamese. 
  Another of our concessions is that we always refer to the 
Khmer Rouge as PDK or Party of Democratic Kampuchea. While we 
recognize the PDK, the PDK never recognizes the RGC. "The Khmer 
Rouge said they want to become government advisers or government 
members, but they have refused to recognize the RGC. This shows 
that they are not sincere." When I proposed to Khieu Samphan 
that there should be a cease-fire first, he answered no. He 
said: How can there be a cease-fire if the Vietnamese continue 
to attack us? "So, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] have no 
choice but to continue the struggle. The Khmer Rouge do not 
consider us as Cambodians, but as Vietnamese. Therefore, we 
have to fight them." 
  As I have already mentioned above, the PDK does not 
recognize 
the RGC. They keep talking about the quadripartite setup. 
This quadripartite setup is outdated. The four parties no 
longer existed after the elections. There is now only the RGC 
born out of the elections. The three parties forming the RGC 
cannot be regarded as separate entities. They already form the 
RGC. So, there are only the RGC and the PDK. 
  I tell you of all this to show that the RGC is sincere in 
seeking to solve the problem. In spite of everything, we are 
always prepared to follow the instruction of His Majesty our 
king. If His Majesty wants us to talk with the Khmer Rouge 
today, we will talk with them today. "Although the KRAF have 
won great successes at Anlung Veng and Pailin, we are still 
prepared to talk. Some said that Anlung Veng was a defeat for 
us. Let me tell you that the RGC did order the KRAF to pull out 
of Anlung Veng. Why? Because Anlung Veng is no longer a town. 
[Khmer Rouge commander] Ta Mok burned down everything there. 
How could we stay in a burned out location and wait to be 
bombarded from the outside? The objective of the KRAF was to 
prevent the Khmer Rouge from using Anlung Veng as their 
economic, political, and military base from which to launch 
attacks against Siem Reap." In this goal, we were 100 percent 
successful. 
  Concerning Pailin, before our campaign many people were very 
harsh with the KRAF, saying they were not capable of ending the 
Pailin tragedy, unable to stop the region from being raped and 
the Sangke river from being soiled. Now that we have attacked 
Pailin, they still criticize us, saying we are responsible for 
bloodshed. Allow me to stress here that this is our duty, the 
duty of the KRAF. Our constitution pointedly forbids secession 
of any part of our motherland. The KRAF have done their job and 
have upheld the Constitution. 
  Once again, I would like to emphasize that we are always 
ready to comply if His Majesty the king instructs us to hold 
talks with the Khmer Rouge. 
. Moreover, of the estimated $1 billion, $585 million has 
already been spent. The people could not believe that so much 
money has been spent on Cambodia and nothing concrete has been 
achieved. Let me tell you, this international aid was slotted 
for technical assistance. It could not be translated into cars, 
tractors, or equipment. But mind you, the UN Development 
Program is in full control of this aid. The people should not 
worry that the government will mishandle aid at all. 
  "In my opinion, what we need is not arms. What we need is a 
better life for the people. When the people have food, clothes, 
schools, medicines, roads, running water, electricity, and 
employment for the youths, when the people's living standard has 
improved, the problem of insurgency will be completely solved." 
  [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] 
  [Ranaridddh] Thank you again for reminding me of this issue. 
I would like to take this opportunity to recall that for 23 
years we have been through so many wars, many killings, many 
destructions. It would take us another 10 years to become as 
prosperous as we were under Sangkum Reas Niyum [Sihanouk's 
pre-1970 ruling party]. "Nonetheless, the RGC is striving hard 
to set the foundation and this foundation is underground, 
invisible to the eyes. Yet, we need a strong foundation in 
order to build a sturdy house." This is not an easy job. We 
have to revise, to rationalize the structure. We have hundreds 
of thousands of state employees to manage and reorganize and we 
must reform our legal system to cope with new national 
requirements. It all will take a lot of time. Priority should 
be given to so many domains, such as education and the 
infrastructure. However, to achieve that we need favorable 
conditions: security and social stability. 
  Under the current circumstances, some of us believe that we 
are wanting in security and stability. I have just returned 
from Europe and countries over there think differently. They 
marveled at our capability to achieve and maintain peace. 
Before leaving for Europe, I was a little worried that they 
might stop caring about what is happening in Cambodia. Giving 
us $773 million already shows how sympathetic and kind they are 
toward us. But the international community still cares about us 
because they have seen that we are serious about trying to help 
ourselves. In the economic field, they see that we have market 
stability, a stable riel currency, and an inflation rate below 
10 percent. Our main concern now is with agriculture. I have 
informed the international community that they should give less 
attention to spending their aid on training our cadres. I just 
told the Americans that we received too much training; instead, 
what we Cambodians want to see are tractors, excavators, and 
water pumps. We should not make a fuss about technical 
training. Months have passed and nothing concrete, except for 
the Cambodia-Japan friendship bridge, has been visible. And 
already $585 million of the aid has been spent, just on 
training. Those people who are misinformed will surely believe 
that Ranariddh and Hun Sen have lined their pockets with all 
that money. So, I have urged the donors not to spend to much 
money on training. 
  [Correspondent] As head of the RGC, what is your impression 
on the plight of the refugees forced to flee across the border 
in the wake of the large-scale government operations against 
Pailin? 
  [Ranariddh] I do not have enough words to comment on this 
matter. We are very concerned about the refugees' well-being. 
Seeing the young and old people turned into war refugees after 
months have eclipsed since the formation of the RGC is 
heart-rending. I have ordered our Red Cross to be prepared to 
take good care of the refugees. In my opinion, the right 
procedure should be to request the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees] and the ICRC [International Committee of the Red 
Cross] to take charge of the refugees. They should be in a 
position to allow the refugees to decide where they want to go 
and then provide them with the means to go there. This, 
however, was not what happened when our refugees fled from 
Pailin into Thailand. The Thais said they recognize the RGC. 
So, I said, we should hold talks at governmental level. I 
proposed that the UNHCR and the ICRC interview the refugees and 
help take them to where they want to go. If a sanctuary is 
needed, then we will set up one. But the Thai authorities, 
without informing us, instead forcibly repatriated our people to 
a region known to be under the control of the Khmer Rouge. 
"This does not conform with what the Thai authorities 
repeatedly assured me when I returned from Tokyo, that is, that 
they recognize only the RGC. They said: We do not help the 
Khmer Rouge. Highness, please believe us. What they just did, 
however, belies this assurance." 
  I have learned that some of the refugees said they wanted to 
go back to Kompong Cham where they first came from. I have also 
learned from Battambang that a few of the forcibly repatriated 
refugees had escaped from that area and revealed to us that 
hundreds more wanted to flee. I ordered our authorities to do 
their best to contact and help them out. 
  At least, we should give a free choice to the refugees to go 
where they want to go. Madame Ogata of the UNHCR and the ICRC 
have always been prepared to assist the refugees. 
  The press are closely watching the government's record on 
press freedom since the editor of a local newspaper was 
arrested. What is your comment? 
  [Ranariddh] "Thank you for raising this issue. It reminds 
me of an incident. This morning AFP wrote that I had claimed to 
be in possession of a picture clearly showing Pol Pot escaping 
in a car on a road inside Thailand. I would like to make it 
clear now before there is further misunderstanding by 
emphasizing that I really have a picture, but it is a picture 
taken by our agent showing a convoy of trucks transporting Khmer 
Rouge soldiers with pots, pans, and other belongings riding on a 
road in Thai territory from an area near Pailin to another area. 
I have this picture, but I have never said I have a picture of 
Pol Pot. I have a picture of Pol Pot's troops being 
transported, but not a picture of Pol Pot. I would be very 
happy to own one because Japan has promised to give $1 million 
to any person who can produce a picture of Pol Pot. So, I do 
not have a picture of Pol Pot, but I have a picture showing Pol 
Pot's men fleeing. I have to make this clear so that AFP will 
not report something that I did not say. However, I did stress 
that such a tarmac road with a white dividing line in the middle 
does not exist in the Pailin region. Where else can this road 
be?" 
  Yesterday, our Parliament was debating a press bill in 
conformity with our Constitution. Our local press seem to be 
not very happy with the present state of press freedom in the 
country. The French press are even more strident in their 
protest. But what we are talking about here is only a bill yet 
to be passed by Parliament. We should not compare ours with the 
press freedom of the French who have had theirs since 1789. 
Moreover, we have a lot of things in this bill that the French 
do not have, such as a clause protecting the journalist 
profession for Cambodian citizens, and so on. 
  Nevetheless, I am more concerned about the question of 
security than press freedom. There should be limits to all our 
undertakings. I told the cabinet meeting yesterday that His 
Majesty the king had sent us letter after letter urging us not 
to deprive this journalist of his right. However, while we must 
have a law on press freedom, we also must have some 
restrictions. A foreign newspaper said that I have gagged the 
national TV and radio network. You have my word, I have never 
asked His Excellency Ieng Muli or any other personalities to 
curb the TV and radio comments at all. I only once urged 
everybody not to make excessive additional comments on events, 
not to put words in other people's mouths. For that I have been 
accused of gagging the media. 
  I swear I have never told His Excellency Ieng Muli to cover 
anything up. I only begged for cooperation in respecting press 
freedom and also the right of other people. The press should be 
informative, educational, and useful to society. At the same 
time, the press should support the RGC in its difficult mission 
of rehabilitating the nation. This is my appeal to the press. 
I am proud that our country, after years of wars, has now 
entered a very liberal period. I hope that the press will have 
a high national conscience to transcend that liberal stage, 
become the pride of the nation, and refrain from 
spawing what is known as diplomatic incidents.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) on Wednesday [6 April] sought government 
understanding on its plan to raise some telephone charges. NTT 
did all it could do to streamline its business, including man 
power cuts and a reduction in facility expenses, Masashi Kojima, 
president of the telecommunications giant, told a biweekly news 
conference. 
  Kojima also tried to justify NTT's rate hike plan submitted 
to the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry last week by citing 
a cumulative 1 trillion yen in rate discounts made in the recent 
past. NTT plans to raise monthly basic charges from October by 
an average 18 percent per household and double a directory 
assistance service rate for two or more uses for any one month 
from the same telephone number from 30 yen to 60 yen per call. 
  The step, designed to improve the battered financial 
standing 
of NTT, would yield additional revenue of 93.2 billion yen to 
the company for fiscal 1994 started April 1. But the government 
is considering postponing enforcement of the increases 
apparently in response to a barrage of public criticism of the 
recent rate hike plans for utilities, public transportations and 
telephones. 
  NTT, privatized in 1985, should not be treated equally with 
other companies providing services with public nature, Kojima 
said. 
  Kojima criticized the office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative 
(USTR) for citing unsatisfactory American access to NTT business 
in its latest report on foreign trade barriers. Under the 
current business conditions, it is impossible for NTT to expand 
equipment purchases from U.S. makers, Kojima said. 
  Rather than focusing on purchases of foreign products, NTT 
is 
willing to form a joint venture with U.S. companies to create 
new business chances both for NTT and foreign firms, Kojima said. 
  The annual USTR report released last week urged more efforts 
by NTT to expand buying of telecommunications equipment from 
U.S. makers, claiming the American share was unfairly small in 
view of the international competitiveness of U.S. products. 
  On a new portable phone system now on a test run, Kojima 
said 
NTT plans to offer the service at more reasonable charges than 
the current pay telephone rate of 10 yen per minute for local 
calls. Kojima said the government should not impose strict 
business licensing and other regulations on the new service and 
other multimedia-related business expected to burgeon toward the 
next century.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The Air Self-Defense Force 
(ASDF) has proposed freeing air space in the vicinity of a base 
in Shizuoka Prefecture for civilian use in exchange for 
converting the base into a host facility for AWACS [airborne 
warning and control system] aircraft, Defense Agency sources 
said Monday [4 April]. The sources said the proposal was made 
in talks between the Defense Agency and the Transport Ministry 
over the use of skies off the ASDF base at Hamamatsu, which is 
used for training exercises over the Pacific Ocean. 
  Under the proposal, the base would be used exclusively for 
AWACS-converted Boeing 767 passenger planes, while its current 
training function would be shifted to another base, possibly on 
the Japan Sea coast. 
  The Transport Ministry has long been eyeing a return of the 
training air space since a major air corridor runs through it, 
utilized by about 330 civilian aircraft a day. The number of 
those planes is expected to increase with the opening of the new 
Kansai International Airport this fall. 
  AWACS stands for airborne early warning and control system, 
where airborne vehicles are equipped with search and 
height-finding radar and communications equipment for 
controlling weapons.

  [Excerpts] President Suharto and Netherlands Prime 
Minister Ruud Lubbers held talks at Merdeka Palace in Jakarta 
this morning. Minister/State Secretary Murdiono briefed newsmen 
on the outcome of the talks between the two leaders. 
  [Begin Murdiono recording] As scheduled, President Suharto 
held talks with his guest Ruud Lubbers this morning. President 
Suharto was accompanied by the minister/state secretary and the 
foreign minister, while Prime Minister Lubbers was accompanied 
by the Netherlands foreign minister. The talks, which covered a 
wide range of topics, lasted for quite some time. Here is a 
summary of what they discussed: 
  The talks concentrated on bilateral, regional, and 
international issues. President Suharto gave a general 
explanation of Indonesia's development proposals, strategy, and 
target under the first 25-year long-term development master plan 
which has been completed, and the development target under the 
second long-term development master plan. President Suharto 
explained to Lubbers in detail about our national development 
achievements so far which provided a basis to enter the next 
development phase, which is known locally as the take-off 
period. This period is known as the second era of national 
awakening. The president also explained in detail our 
achievements in creating and maintaining national stability to 
support economic growth and to provide an equal distribution of 
wealth to the people. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers expressed high appreciation for 
Indonesia's development achievements during the talks with 
President Suharto. He was amazed by President Suharto's ability 
to provide accurate figures on all topics. 
  The head of state also briefed Lubbers on Indonesia's ideas 
on the role of the Nonaligned Movement, NAM, and the Asia 
Pacific Economic Cooperation, APEC. Meanwhile, Lubbers also 
told President Suharto about developments taking place in Europe. 
  After explaining in detail Indonesia's development 
achievements so far and the government's plans for the future, 
President Suharto then invited Netherlands businessmen to 
participate in infrastructure development such as the 
construction of an electric generating station, and 
telecommunications and port facilities here on a build, operate, 
transfer basis because Indonesia has a limited capability to 
develop such areas of infrastructure independently. President 
Suharto also asked Netherlands investors to set up joint 
ventures with Indonesian businessmen by utilizing resources 
available in the country. He said the products can be marketed 
in Europe as well as in the Asia-Pacific region. [passage 
omitted] 
  Also today, President Suharto offered the Netherlands, a 
developed country, to contribute efforts to solve the foreign 
debt problem faced by Third World nations. [passage omitted] 
  President Suharto also extended an invitation to the 
Netherlands to join South-South cooperation, which according to 
his own concept is within the framework of tripartite 
cooperation. Briefly, it is difficult to promote cooperation 
among countries in the South due to limited funds available in 
some countries. Indonesia has vast experience in achieving 
self-sufficiency in rice production and it has accordingly 
offered to share its experience with several African countries. 
This is intended to enable African farmers to know clearly 
about what we do here, and it will be possible if they come to 
Indonesia and live with our farmers. However, Africa does not 
have enough funds to send its farmers here and at the same time 
we cannot afford to bring them here. Under such a situation, we 
hope that a third party -- a developed country -- will sponsor 
the program. This is what President Suharto meant by tripartite 
cooperation. 
  In his response, Prime Minister Lubbers said that the 
Netherlands is willing to promote bilateral cooperation in the 
fields of economy and investment because his country has the 
capability to do so. At the same time, Lubbers also said that 
there should be cooperation between the Navies of the two 
countries, both in shipbuilding technology as well as in 
training personnel. President Suharto welcomed this idea and 
reiterated that Indonesia is determined to give high priority to 
economic development besides paying attention to developing 
security and defense. 
  At the start of their talks, Prime Minister Lubbers conveyed 
greetings from Queen Beatrix to President Suharto. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam by </F>
unidentified correspondent on results of Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet's official friendship visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia from 
2 to 3 April; recorded -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Comrade foreign minister, Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet has just concluded his official friendship 
visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Could you please tell us the 
main points about the results of that visit? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] Even though Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's 
visit to Cambodia this time was very short, it brought about 
very fine results. First of all, both sides reiterated the 
principles governing bilateral relations in the new situation. 
Those principles are based on mutual respect for each country's 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; 
noninterference in each other's internal affairs; and 
cooperation for mutual benefit. Those principles provide the 
basis for the two countries to promote friendship and good 
neighborliness. In other words, it is necessary to further 
consolidate the time-honored ties between the two peoples. 
Based on those principles, our prime minister and the Cambodian 
first and second prime ministers as well as the two government 
delegations agreed on the need to take practical measures to 
further develop bilateral relations. This move will benefit not 
only each country's development, but also regional development 
as a whole. These measures consist, first of all, of efforts to 
step up economic, trade, cultural, scientific-technological, 
educational, and training cooperation. Generally speaking, this 
cooperation involves all areas of activities. Nonetheless, top 
priority is given to economic and trade cooperation. Therefore, 
on this occasion, the two sides signed a trade agreement under 
which the two countries will accelerate goods exchanges a step 
further. Regarding economic cooperation, the two sides agreed 
to step up cooperation under different forms, including joint 
ventures and participation of Vietnamese companies in bidding 
for contracts to build projects funded by aid to Cambodia from 
foreign countries or international organizations. Refund and 
other forms of cooperation will be available, too. 
  Regarding trade, along with efforts to step up goods 
exchanges, the Cambodian side made an earnest request for goods 
transit permission. We gave this request very favorable 
consideration based on the principle of mutual benefit. 
  Regarding other areas of cooperation, the two sides agreed 
on 
cultural and scientific-technological exchanges. In particular, 
the Cambodian delegation wanted us to continue to help Cambodia 
with cadre training and human resources development. We also 
concurred with the Cambodian side on this issue. 
  We try our best to promote bilateral relations based on the 
principle of mutual benefit. Nonetheless, as far as bilateral 
ties are concerned, a number of problems still need to be 
resolved. It must be said that, generally speaking, broad 
sections of public opinion show due concern for those problems. 
The first problem involves the border issue. According to the 
Cambodian side, there are many factions in Cambodia. Therefore, 
it is necessary to reconsider the border issue and take measures 
to resolve existing problems. 
  The second problem involves Vietnamese residents in 
Cambodia. 
In the past, due to the Khmer Rouge massacre of Vietnamese, a 
number of Vietnamese residents fled to the border area. In the 
meantime, Vietnamese nationals who stay in Cambodia often fall 
victim to the Khmer Rouge's attacks and cruel massacres. 
Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the safety of Vietnamese 
residents in Cambodia. At the same time, it is necessary to 
resolve the issue relating to the number of Vietnamese residents 
who are stranded in the border area. 
  [Correspondent] Comrade foreign minister, during Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit, the Vietnamese prime minister and 
the two Cambodian co-prime ministers discussed the problems that 
you have already mentioned. Did they agree on any 
problem-solving methods? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] This is part of the very important 
contents of the exchanges of views this time between Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet and the two Cambodian co-prime ministers, 
as well as between the two government delegations. 
  First of all, regarding the border issue, we made it known 
to 
Cambodia that it is our intention to resolve this issue at an 
early date in order to turn the Vietnamese-Cambodian border into 
an area of long-lasting peace and friendship for the two 
nations. Needless to say, if this goal is realized, there will 
be conditions for the two countries to enjoy stability, which, 
in turn, will benefit the region as a whole. 
  Based on this principle, the two sides agreed on the 
formation of a joint committee of specialists to exchange views 
on ways to resolve this problem according to the contents of 
different documents reached so far. 
  Secondly, there is another aspect of the border issue which 
is worth noting here, namely order and stability in the border 
area at present. At times, different incidents have taken place 
along the border which adversely affected mutual understanding. 
Also, we must mention the situation concerning smuggling 
activities. During his visit to Cambodia, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet made a very clear analysis of the advantages and 
disadvantages of the situation and stressed the need to ensure 
order and stability in the border area. As a result, the 
Cambodian leadership unanimously concurred with the need to set 
up a joint committee comprising representatives of agencies and 
localities concerned to help maintain order and ensure stability 
along the border. This move will help prevent the movement of 
illegal migrants and other violations which are likely to happen 
because of a lack of a well-defined border demarcation line. 
However, this move is designed especially to deal with 
smuggling activities, which are detrimental to both sides. 
  Cambodian First Prime Minister Ranariddh as well as Second 
Prime Minister Hun Sen and the Cambodian Government delegation 
were very much in agreement that border stability and order must 
be quickly restored, and especially that the two sides must work 
together to counter smuggling. 
  With respect to Vietnamese residents, our prime minister 
clearly stated that Vietnamese residents have been living in 
Cambodia for several generations. They have shared weal and woe 
with the Cambodian people through all stages of history. They 
have shared victories and difficulties with the Cambodian people 
and they have offered their contribution to national 
construction. Therefore, they deserve correct treatment so that 
they can conduct their own business in peace. Their business is 
not only for their own benefit, but also for building and 
reconstructing Cambodia. 
  This time, First Prime Minister Ranariddh stated clearly 
that 
the Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia will continue 
the policy of Prince Sihanouk when he was the head of state 
before 1970. He also said that the Royal Government will ensure 
safety as well as life so that the Vietnamese residents can 
enjoy the same conditions as other ethnic groups in Cambodia. 
  Regarding those who are stranded in the border area, we said 
clearly that this is not an issue of our concern only, but it 
also attracts attention from the region, the world, and 
international organizations. This issue, if left unsolved, will 
not be beneficial. The Cambodian side said that several 
investigations have been conducted lately leading to the return 
of some people. We suggested that this issue continue to be 
settled early and to return these people to Cambodia because 
they have been living there for many years with their families, 
assets, and property. Therefore, if they can return they will 
find it easier to get on with their lives and to contribute to 
Cambodian reconstruction. Prime Minister Hun Sen said that he 
would try his best. 
  [Correspondent] Dear minister, Vietnam and Cambodia signed 
four agreements during the visit. Can you inform us which 
issues of these four agreements will be implemented quickly in 
the intermediate period? 
  [Nguyen Manh Cam] It is correct that four agreements were 
signed during the visit. They include an agreement on trade 
cooperation; an agreement on transit goods; an agreement on 
cultural, education, scientific, and technical cooperation; and 
an agreement on creating a joint committee for field cooperation 
to help the two governments carrying out their agreements. 
  I believe that in the current conditions, stemming from the 
expectations of both sides, we must quickly form committees to 
settle the border issue and the issue of Vietnamese residents in 
Cambodia. Other issues will continue to be accelerated. 
Lately, we have accelerated steps in economic and trade 
relations. Moreover, we must quickly form a joint committee in 
order to review bilateral relations before finding measures to 
accelerate these relations for the better. 
  I believe that Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet's visit opened a 
totally new stage in relations between the two countries. It 
also correctly executed the principles agreed to by the two 
sides about current relations. Therefore, I believe that 
relations between the two countries will be further accelerated, 
thus contributing to regional peace and stability. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, minister.

  [Text] A spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful 
Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] issued a statement on the 
grave situation that has arrived [toraehada] on the Korean 
peninsula in which a nuclear war may break out due to the 
reckless [mubunbyolhan] war provocation moves of the United 
States and the South Korean puppet clique. 
  The statement issued by the CPRF spokesman: 
  Due to the reckless war provocation moves of the United 
States and the South Korean puppet clique, an extremely grave 
[kukhi omjunghan] situation has arrived on the Korean peninsula 
in which a nuclear war may break out. 
  As is well-known, the United States unilaterally reneged on 
its agreement to hold the third stage of DPRK-U.S. talks and is 
stepping up arms pressure on us. 
  On 29 March, the U.S. Defense Department deployed 48 
launching pads for Patriot missiles and a missile unit of some 
400 personnel to South Korea from Texas. In addition, saying 
that it will resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise, 
which was agreed to be suspended, the United States ordered Carl 
Vinson, an atomic aircraft carrier, to depart a naval base in 
Yokoska and to deploy near the Korean peninsula; and maintained 
a U.S. naval fleet of 30 ships, including two task forces of 
aircraft carriers, in advance areas of our waters so they can 
reach our area within 24 hours. 
  The South Korean authorities ruptured the working delegates' 
contact for the exchange of special envoys, which was arranged 
with much effort, and officially asked the United States to 
introduce Patriot missiles, which the whole world rebuffed. 
Worse still, it is openly instigating a war by disclosing a new 
Northward invasion plan called the New Operation Plan 5027, 
which was secret until now. 
  The CPRF brands aggressive arms buildup and war provocation 
moves of the U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters as a 
heinous criminal act to disturb the peace and security of the 
Korean peninsula and Asia and plunge the Korean nation into a 
new nuclear war holocaust, and strongly denounces this. 
  The U.S. and South Korean bellicose quarters rave that the 
Patriot missiles are so-called preventive weapons and so forth 
in an attempt to hide their aggressive intent and to justify the 
maneuvers for its arrangement. This is nothing but a foolish 
scheme. 
  Modern war is three-dimensional -- staged in the sky, on the 
ground, and in the sea -- attack and defense are not separated. 
Patriot missiles are ultra-modern weapons that can also be used 
for an attack. Considering the fact that the Patriot missiles 
can easily strike any target or object on the Korean peninsula, 
which is not that big, it is needless to say that its deployment 
is dangerous. 
  Today, the United States is openly bringing nuclear weapons 
into South Korea and scheming to continue nuclear war exercises. 
This indicates that it seek solutions to the issue not through 
negotiation but through strength, unilaterally reneging on its 
promise to refrain from threatening the DPRK with nuclear 
weapons, which was stipulated in the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. 
Also, the U.S. imperialists are massively bringing modern 
warfare equipment into South Korea. This is a very ill-boding 
[simsangchianun] military move that can only be seen on the 
night before a war. 
  What should not be overlooked is that the South Korean 
ruling bunch is coming out as a shock brigade for an 
anti-republic hostile policy of outside forces to crush fellow 
countrymen. 
  The South Korean puppets' frenzied maneuvers to crush fellow 
countrymen by continually bringing in U.S. nuclear weapons and 
by depending on strength of outside forces are antinational 
crimes that can be perpetrated only by the flunkeyist 
nation-selling traitors [sadae maeguk yokchokdul] who do not 
have even a slight degree of a sense of national independence. 
Their maneuvers are an intolerable traitorous act that 
unilaterally destroyed the North-South denuclearization 
declaration on the agreement not to produce, not to introduce, 
and not to possess nuclear weapons -- which reduced the 
declaration to wastepaper. 
  Today DPRK-U.S. talks, which can resolve a series of 
problems 
including the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through 
negotiations, were ruptured [kyollyol] and the nation's 
situation has been strained to an extreme pitch. This is because 
of flunkeyist nation-selling maneuvers of such crooked 
politicians as the traitor Kim Yong-sam who has no independent 
idea [chugyon] and philosophy for the nation. 
  The modern history of our nation illustrates that when the 
flunkeyists without the spirit for national independence grasp 
power of the nation and abuse it, the nation was reduced to an 
arena of competition by outside forces, and the people could not 
avoid the situation of homeless, ruined people. 
  The U.S. imperialists ignited the war of aggression in Korea 
in the early 1950's and brought their 15 follower nations, and 
as the result of this, the lands of our fatherland were 
infringed upon by outside aggressor forces and our people were 
enforced to suffer miserable war disasters. This was attributed 
to flunkeyist nation-selling acts committed by such a pro-U.S. 
flunkeyist nation-seller as Syngman Rhee in South Korea. 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam, the most vicious outside 
force-reliant flunkeyist nation-seller of all successive ruling 
bunches in South Korea, has no real power nor ability. 
Nevertheless, he continually and wildly ran amok in an attempt 
to interfere in negotiations between us and the United States, 
thus laying obstacles to DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group ruptured the working-level contact by 
putting forward the exchange of North-South special envoys as a 
precondition for the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. It is no 
secret that this proceeded from insidious political aims to 
apply the brakes on DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  Therefore, to ease the strained situation prevailing in our 
country and to seek a precise method for a solution to problems, 
the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK must be altered and 
such flunkeyist nation-sellers like traitor Kim Yong-sam must be 
removed from power in South Korea, and the democratic 
reunification forces--independent forces of the nation--who 
treasure sovereignty of our fellow countrymen should grasp power. 
  People from all walks of life in South Korea should oppose 
and reject the nuclear war policy and arms buildup maneuvers of 
the United States and the South Korean bellicose elements, 
including deployment of Patriot missiles, and should more 
fiercely raise the flames of anti-U.S., antiwar, antinuclear, 
and anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppets cannot 
frighten our people, who are firmly rallied behind the party and 
the leader with single-hearted unity, with any military threat, 
nor can they crush popular mass-centered socialism of our own 
style. They should correctly realize this and should not run 
recklessly. 
  If the bellicose quarters in the United States and South 
Korea bring Patriot missiles to South Korea and advance along 
the road of war at last in defiance of strong opposition and 
rejection of the people at home and abroad, they will have to 
pay dearly for this.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) 
published a declaration on the situation on March 29 denouncing 
the undisguised nuclear racket and intensified adventurous 
aggressive and belligerent moves of the U.S. imperialists and 
the South Korean puppets against the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of 
National Salvation. 
  "It is none other than the pro-American traitor Kim Yong-sam 
wearing a `civilian' veil that has brought a disaster to the 
nation," it said, and went on: 
  "The nation has to decide on whether it will undergo a war 
disaster with Kim Yong-sam left alone or will win peace with him 
removed." 
  The declaration called on all the patriotic people who love 
the country and the nation to staunchly join in the nationwide 
struggle for overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique. 
  It further said: 
  "The nuclear racket kicked up by the United States is a plot 
to stifle socialism on the globe from the ideological point of 
view, a trick to manage third world countries like slaves with a 
whip of the nuclear power from the political point of view and a 
scheme to realise its new idea of putting priority to Asia and 
`neoglobalism' with our nation as the hostage of a nuclear war 
from the strategic point of view." 
  It called on all the fellow countrymen to rise up in the 
nationwide struggle for thwarting the U.S. nuclear racket and 
war provocation moves against the North.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 2 (KNS-KCNA) -- A central meeting of 
Korean residents in Japan was held in Tokyo Saturday to denounce 
the nuclear war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and 
the South Korean puppet clique and open the way of peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  In his speech first Vice-chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon) Yi Chin-kyu condemned the Kim Yong-sam puppet 
clique for entreating the United States to restart the "Team 
Spirit" joint military exercises, desperately trying to 
introduce Patriot missiles into South Korea and openly inciting 
war fever, by opening to the public even a new war plan against 
the North dubbed "New Operation Plan No. 5027". He branded 
these moves of the puppet clique as a treacherous act against 
the 5,000-year-long history of the nation and a crime which can 
be committed only by the enemy of peace and reunification. 
  He said: 
  "The United States, which totally reversed the DPRK-U.S. 
agreed conclusions at the New York contact and unilaterally 
broke up the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks, is now scheming 
to unleash another war, while crying for `sanctions' and 
`blockade.' This fully shows that it is still watching for a 
chance to provoke a new war in Korea." 
  He strongly demanded that the Japanese authorities no longer 
join the United States and the South Korean puppet clique in 
their nuclear war provocation moves but promptly renounce the 
hostile policy toward the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
and Chongnyon. 
  Solidarity speeches were made by Japanese public figures and 
indignation speeches by Chongnyon officials at the meeting.

<F P=106> ["Mean Solicitation Diplomacy To Stifle Fellow Countrymen"-- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppet 
foreign minister, Han Sung-chu, flew to the United States 
recently and discussed "additional inspection" and "sanctions" 
against the North with U.S. high-placed officials. On April 3 
during his stay in Japan, he requested Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata to "take 
phased economic sanctions". 
  This solicitation diplomacy is a dastardly act of the 
special-class flunkeyist traitor who does not have an iota of 
the spirit of national independence and is hell bent on harming 
fellow countrymen by clinging to the coattails of the U.S. and 
Japanese masters. 
  "Additional inspection" claimed by Han Sung-chu during his 
tour of the United States and Japan is a nonsense which cannot 
work with anyone. 
  The DPRK which is in a special position after temporarily 
suspending the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is not obliged to undergo the 
agency's full inspection pursuant to the safeguards agreement 
and it has never agreed on this with the United States and the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Han Sung-chu's vociferation about "additional inspection" 
cannot be contrued otherwise than a deliberate act motivated by 
a sinister purpose to expand the scope of partiality of the 
agency and thus render the situation more complicated. 
  The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion, 
clearly knowing that their criminal attempt to isolate and 
stifle the DPRK will eventually lead them to destruction.

  [Text] Thai Embassy officials in Washington expect the 
United States to link its decision to extend tax concessions to 
Thailand to environmental protection issues when the Generalized 
System of Preferences (GSP) agreement is reviewed in September. 
  A report from the embassy's commercial counsellor indicates 
that environmental issues are among general social issues likely 
to be considered in the review of the GSP for Thailand. 
  Addressing environmental issues through trade restrictions, 
however, has been opposed by some conservation groups such as 
Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and the National Wildlife 
Foundation [as published], which argue that it was difficult to 
apply such pressure on trade. 
  The United States, the report noted is also likely to grant 
concessions to an additional 40 developing countries, especially 
from Africa. 
  Washington will further consider lowering the GSP's per 
capita income ceiling condition for some countries, as it feels 
the current set level is too high. 
  Meanwhile, the report said, US importers have lobbied for 
higher levels of imported goods under the GSP programme, 
especially for the three most active sectors -- textiles, 
footwear and leather products. 
  But local producers of these products are strongly opposed 
to 
any increase, fearing an influx of cheap imports will hurt US 
industries. 
  Washington has reduced import tariffs affecting US$19.5 
trillion worth of goods under the GSP programme, cutting US$500 
million from the normal level. 
  Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) recently informed the 
Thai 
Commerce Ministry that it will announce new conditions for Union 
GSP privileges by June 15. 
  The EU is considering new tax concessions for its GSP 
programme that will take into account the level of economic 
development of exporting countries as well as the level of per 
capita income. 
  The Foreign Trade Department expects the EU might cut the 
volume of Thai exports in some categories under its GSP 
programme. 
  Last year, Thai exporters took full advantage of the GSP 
programme in many sectors, including textiles and apparel, yarn 
and processed pineapple. 
  The European Union's new conditions for its GSP programme 
are 
expected to be introduced next year.

  [Text] Seoul, April 2 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tae-chung, chairman 
of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, said Saturday that South 
Korea should ask for nuclear transparency in the North and then 
quietly await the outcome without getting directly involved. 
  "This is because the nuclear question is basically an issue 
between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) and between North Korea and the United States," he said. 
  Kim said that although Seoul had the right to demand 
inter-Korean nuclear inspections under the joint 
denuclearization declaration, it could refrain from doing so 
once the IAEA completely guarantees Pyongyang's nuclear 
transparency. 
  Kim's remarks are part of a lecture at Cheju University to 
be 
given Saturday afternoon, whose text was distributed to the 
press in advance. 
  On the proposed exchange of special envoys, the former 
opposition leader said it should be used as an occasion to 
promote an inter- Korean summit by enabling the envoys to 
discuss matters related to peace, cooperation and unification. 
  He said an inter-Korean summit should take place without 
further delay if only to dispel distrust, misunderstanding and 
enmity between the two sides and also to explore "our destiny on 
our own." 
  Regarding the North Koreans' threat to turn Seoul into "a 
sea 
of fire," Kim said they should revoke the inflammatory statement 
and apologize to the 44 million South Koreans. He also 
criticized as "totally unrealistic and dangerous" a high South 
Korean defense official's remarks that "if war breaks out, we 
would use it as an occasion to achieve unification by force of 
arms." 
  Kim observed that the North Korean forces are strong and, 
besides, China would not allow South Korea and the United States 
to gain control of the strategic Yellow Sea. 
  He also foresaw the possibility of the United States and 
North Korea striking a deal featuring simultaneous resolution of 
the nuclear question and diplomatic normalization. "It appears 
that beneath-the-surface talks have been going on to a 
substantial extent between the United States and North Korea on 
the issues of diplomatic normalization and economic 
cooperation," he said. 
  Kim voiced opposition to an arms buildup in the South, 
asserting that deployment of Patriot missiles, procurement of 
sophisticated weaponry and resumption of the Team Spirit 
exercise would only impede attempts at dialogue.

<F P=106> [Report by John Wallach] </F>
  [Text] The United States may have no more than "a few days" 
warning of any North Korean attack against South Korea, a senior 
U.S. intelligence official disclosed Monday. 
  The short warning time has led U.S. forces to employ a "vast 
array" of technological and human spy techniques to keep ahead 
in the war of nerves on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. official 
said. 
  North Korea's troops are as close to ready as any forces 
that 
we ever faced in the Cold War, he said. "With the high state of 
readiness that has developed over quite some time, you can't 
expect hopefully more than a matter of a few days" warning, he 
said. 
  The U.S. official said the problem of knowing if and when 
North Korea plans to attack is compounded by the fact that 
Pyongyang has increased the numbers of "forward deployed" troops 
along its border with South Korea and "their general condition 
of readiness." 
  Thus, if North Korea wanted to attack, "it wouldn't have to 
change a great deal," he said. 
  Since the end of 1992, North Korea has increased its 
military 
strength from 16 corps or 144 divisions to 17 corps or 152 
divisions, boosting the total number of North Korean troops to 
1,030,000, he said. 
  Two-thirds of North Korea's troops are positioned within 60 
miles of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) at the 38th parallel 
dividing the two nations. Seoul, South Korea's capital, is only 
25 miles from the DMZ, within range of North Korea's big 
artillery pieces. 
  U.S. plans call for a combined U.S.-South Korean force of 
about 400,000 troops. The United States currently has 37,000 
troops in South Korea. 
  Among the techniques used by the CIA to detect changes are 
satellite photography, electronic or "signals" eavesdropping, 
aircraft and "humint," the intelligence gathered by human 
beings, presumably South Korean agents smuggled into North Korea. 
  "You try to look at patterns of behavior and see if they're 
changing," the official said. "Our warning people have long 
lists of things they are particularly interested in." 
  They include such seemingly mundane items as shipments of 
morphine designed to treat expected casualties and unusually 
large shipments of ammunition and other supplies. 
  Other warning signs include unusual troop movements, the 
mobilization of reserve forces. 
  None of these has yet showed any unusual activity, the 
official said. 
  But the art of obtaining such knowledge, when your enemy 
goes 
to inordinate lengths to conceal it, is an inexact science at 
best, the official said. 
  The experts divide the signs into two categories: 
unambiguous and ambiguous. 
  "You're rarely lucky enough to get absolutely clear-cut 
signs 
because the other guy tries to disguise it and also tries to 
frighten you by doing some things that may not be genuine," he 
said. 
  Such advance warning is critical to providing U.S. and South 
Korean troops with enough time to prepare for either a 
counterattack or to launch a preemptive strike, a move which 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry has pointedly refused to rule 
out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, by Bengt </F>
Therner in Singapore; date not given -- recorded; first 
paragraph is introduction] 
  [Text] Premier Carl Bildt, who is on a week-long round 
trip of East Asia with official visits to Malaysia, Singapore, 
and Vietnam, says after talks with many political leaders of 
these countries that he does not want to rule out armed 
intervention against North Korea. North Korea has obviously 
misled the rest of the world about its nuclear weapon ambitions, 
Premier Bildt says. 
  [Bildt] This is a first-class challenge to one of the 
cornerstones of the international order (?nuclear 
non-proliferation) agreement. Should North Korea manage this, 
to acquire nuclear weapons in spite of all agreements, in spite 
of the UN, then it is clear that it can then [words indistinct]; 
Saddam Husayn did not succeed. If Kim Il-song succeeded, then 
[several words indistinct] and then we can live in a totally 
different world suddenly. 
  [Therner] What do you think Kim Il-song's intention is? 
  [Bildt] It is very difficult to know that. It could be a 
manifestation of the general desperation about the future which 
certainly exists (?there). 
  [Therner] Is there something the international community can 
do if North Korea chooses to continue on this road? 
  [Bildt] The international community must find ways to 
intervene in this and the responsibility here lies with the UN 
Security Council according to agreements. 
  [Therner] Even if China does not use its veto against a 
decision in the Security Council in the end, there are many who 
doubt the effectiveness of sanctions against a country which is 
already so isolated. 
  [Bildt] I do not think there is any reason to exclude any 
issues the Security Council and its members, not least its 
permanent members, should discuss regarding a serious situation 
such as this. 
  [Therner] Does this mean you do not rule out even an armed 
intervention? 
  Premier Carl Bildt, who is on a week-long round trip of East 
Asia with official visits to Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam, 
says after talks with many political leaders of these countries 
that he does not want to rule out armed intervention against 
North Korea. North Korea has obviously misled the rest of the

such as this. 
  [Therner] Does this mean you do not rule out even an armed 
intervention? 
  [Bildt] In a situation like this, I do not think it is for 
me 
to dictate to the members of the Security Council what they are 
not allowed to do; I think it is more important for me to say 
that something must be done. 
Sweden would be isolated politically in Europe if its people 
rejected European Union (EU) membership in a forthcoming 
referendum, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said yesterday. 
  Opinion polls indicated that a majority of Swedes were not 
in 
favour of membership and one survey published late last month 
showed that 54 percent would vote "no," he told a news 
conference here. 
  Mr. Bildt, who has described the decision to enter the EU as 
the most important for his country this century, said his 
minority centre-right government would launch a campaign to 
convince Swedes to opt for membership. 
  He expressed confidence about a turnaround in attitudes by 
November when the vote is scheduled. 
  He said it was essential to build political and security 
structures that were stable and durable in Europe. 
  Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Austria are due to join the 
12-member EU by January next year following the successful 
conclusion of negotiations on their terms of membership last 
month. 
  Mr. Bildt said that for Sweden and Northern Europe to be 
outside of such structures would bring "political dangers" in 
the years ahead. 
  It was also necessary, he said, to extend such structures to 
Eastern and Central Europe in the interests of stability. 
  Otherwise, he warned "developments in the East could go in 
different directions and they will, in turn, extend instability 
towards the West five to 10, 15 to 20 years from now." 
  Mr. Bildt, who arrived from Kuala Lumpur for a day's visit, 
leaves for Vietnam today. He will go on to Hong Kong from Hanoi.

  [Excerpts] Kuala Lumpur, Sun -- Cambodia is anxious to 
foster bilateral relations with its ASEAN neighbours and is 
exploring the possibility of setting up embassies in these 
countries. 
  Its Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut told 
reporters on arrival for a three-day official visit that 
Cambodia planned to set up embassy here before proceeding to do 
so in other ASEAN countries. 
  Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign affairs and 
international co-operation, said the embassies were necessary to 
enable his country to keep abreast the developments in the 
region, as Cambodia had been isolated since the last 20 years 
because of civil war. 
  However, he could not say how soon the plans would 
materialise as the country's top priority was to revive its 
economy. 
  "Ours is a very poor country, we have to revive our economy 
first before embarking on other plans," he said at the Kuala 
Lumpur International Airport in Subang on arrival from Phnom 
Penh. 
  Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was present to 
greet Sirivut who is leading a 10-man delegation. 
  Sirivut's visit was on the invitation of Abdullah. 
  He said that he would be discussing with Abdullah about the 
possibility of setting up the embassy besides discussing 
bilateral matters with Malaysian officials. 
  The visit was also to finalise details of Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed's three-day visit to Cambodia from April 14. 
  The Malaysian prime minister is scheduled to hold 
discussions 
on bilateral, regional and international issues with the 
co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun 
Sen. 
  Dr. Mahathir will then proceed to Laos, also for a three-day 
visit. 
  Sirivut said that the people of Cambodia were looking 
forward 
to Dr. Mahathir's visit because of Malaysia's role in the peace 
process. 
  He said Cambodia had expressed deep gratitude to the 
government and people of Malaysia who had contributed greatly 
towards the peace process in the country. 
  Malaysia, he said, was among the first countries to send 
troops to serve in the United Nations Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia (UNTAC) whose duty was to organise and monitor the 
country's first free elections. [Passage omitted] 
  He said King Norodom Sihanouk has agreed to personally 
welcome Dr. Mahathir. 
  Sirivut said Cambodia also welcomed Malaysia's private 
sector 
to invest in the country and would seek the government's 
assistance in its rebuilding. 
  Cambodia is seeking Malaysia's expertise in various fields 
including agriculture and tourism. 
  "We have alot to learn from Malaysia in our efforts to 
rebuild our country," he said. [passage omitted] 
  He is also scheduled to call on Dr. Mahathir Tuesday.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and 
Cambodia will set up a joint commission to promote 
reconstruction in the Indochinese country. 
  Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, was announced this 
yesterday, said the commission was suggested by Cambodian Deputy 
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut at their one-hour meeting 
at the Foreign Ministry here. 
  Cambodia wanted to tap Malaysia's experience and expertise 
in 
agriculture, tourism, extraction of Minerals and petroleum, 
logging and manpower training, he told reporters after the 
meeting. 
  Abdullah said Cambodia also requested Malaysia's help to 
attract foreign investment. 
  He said the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority was 
the most suitable agency to explain Malaysia's investment 
strategy to the Investment Council of Cambodia. 
  The Malaysian Economic Planning Unit might also help the 
Cambodian Development Council on development strategies, he said. 
  Abdullah also said Malaysia would support Cambodia's 
participation as an observer in July's ASEAN foreign ministers 
meeting and the post-ministerial conference in Bangkok as well 
as the ASEAN regional security forum. 
  He did not expect any objection from other ASEAN member 
countries since ASEAN had played a role in bringing peace to 
Cambodia. 
  As such, Cambodia's participation in regional conferences 
should be welcomed, he added.

  [Text] Cambodia will adopt Malaysia's policy of 
non-confrontation when dealing with neighboring countries on 
sensitive issues. Its deputy premier, Prince Norodom Sirivut, 
said his country respects the able and high leadership of Prime 
Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed in dealing with 
neighbors. He said this at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur at 
the end of his four-day official visit to Malaysia. In this 
respect, he said Cambodia would not jeopardize its relations 
with Thailand and Vietnam in efforts to resolve frontier 
problems with the two neighbors. He said Cambodia would refer 
the problems to the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting in Bangkok 
in July. Cambodia has been invited to the meeting as a guest. 
But he pointed out that Thailand should first stop harboring 
the remnants of the Pol Pot guerrillas along the common border. 
  He also said Malaysian experience in the rubber and oil and 
palm oil industries had always impressed Cambodia and his 
country was eager to learn from Malaysia its experience in rural 
development.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- A visiting 
British minister expressed the hope that it will not be long 
before the first step is taken towards normalising 
Anglo-Malaysian relations. 
  Secretary of State for Education John Patten said effort 
needed to be made to put mutual relations back into the warm 
waters. 
  Malaysia barred British companies from bidding for public 
sector contracts in February following publication of 
unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Malaysian 
leaders in the British media. 
  Speaking to reporters at the British Council here a few 
hours 
after his arrival yesterday, Patten said he was disappointed by 
the effect of reports in the British press on the relationship 
between the two countries. 
  As Douglas Hurd (British Foreign Secretary) said in the 
House 
of Commons last Wednesday, we should not allow the press to come 
between us, he said. 
  He said both Hurd and Trade Secretary Richard Needham had 
made it clear that Britain wished to see a resumption of normal 
relations as soon as possible. 
  Patten added Britain would continue to work vigorously to 
bring about a situation in which the Malaysian Government felt 
able to lift its ban on public sector contracts for British 
companies. 
  Certainly the British press had been pretty quiet on this 
issue over the last two or three weeks, he said. 
  Asked about Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's stand on 
the matter, he said the Malaysian leader had always been a very 
powerful advocate of Malaysia's case internationally. 
  He said Dr. Mahathir had made his views known especially in 
a 
very striking letter to the FINANCIAL TIMES of London a few 
weeks ago.

  [Text] The defense minister, Dr. Yeo Ning Hong, says 
Singapore's strong defense must be complemented with defense 
diplomacy. This is to ensure that the nation will not stand 
alone in time of need. He said Singapore will continue to 
emphasize its active policy of fostering good relations and 
building open and frank communication with other countries. 
This would help minimize the prospects of tension and 
instability. Dr. Yeo made the point in an interview in the 
latest issue of ASIAN DEFENSE JOURNAL. He stressed that a 
strong defense capability would enable Singapore to deal with 
exigency which may erupt with little warning. 
  Turning to the SAF [Singapore Armed Forces] in the year 
2000, 
Dr. Yeo said the organization would be well-placed to face any 
challenges which may [words indistinct]. The SAF would continue 
to place emphasis on improving its technological capability 
which is essential to compensate for Singapore's limited 
manpower. It will also give the SAF the edge in a modern day 
battlefield.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Prime 
Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has assured foreign investors of 
protection of their intellectual property rights in the country. 
  The foreign investors can bring their technical know-how to 
Malaysia secure in the knowledge that the rights would be 
protected, he said in his message in a special supplement on 
Malaysia's achievements in technology published in the April 
issue of the scientific American magazine. 
  Malaysia would soon introduce the industrial design AIT 
which 
would protect the intellectual property of both Malaysian and 
foreign investors, he said in the message entitled Technological 
Competitiveness Towards 2020. 
  He also said that with excellent infrastructure, trainable 
human resources and a congenial business atmosphere, Malaysia 
offered an outstanding profit centre for high technology 
business. 
  Dr. Mahathir said the country already has the Patent Act 
which encouraged Malaysians to be innovative and inventive. 
  The sustained high investment in education over many years 
in 
Malaysia was paying off, where a vast pool of well-educated men 
and women was available, he said. 
  Our workers are highly motivated, trainable and eager to 
learn while their positive work culture, ethics and attitudes 
have resulted in the industries being cost-effective and 
efficient. 
  Even though wages have been rising steadily, increases in 
quality and productivity continue to position Malaysia as a very 
competitive location for many kinds of industries, he said. 
  Malaysia's political stability was also a positive 
attraction 
for investment in the country, he said. 
  Dr. Mahathir said Malaysia continued to pursue an open 
philosophy, open to joint ventures and open to contributing 
Malaysia's share to the technologies brought in and transferred 
to the country. 
  In the increasingly competitive global economy, it is 
imperative that we tap the best available resources, both human 
intelligence and material, irrespective of where they come from, 
he said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Objective Criteria -- Focal Point </F>
of Economic Framework Talks"] 
  [Text] The issue of setting up "objective criteria" to 
measure the openness of Japan's market has come to the surface 
as the key to resuming economic framework talks between Japan 
and the United States. This is because there is a 
behind-the-scenes move within the two nations toward holding 
unofficial talks in an attempt to break the impasse in the trade 
talks. However, while the United States urges Japan to set up 
criteria that have the character of numerical targets, the 
Japanese Government is persistent in setting up criteria just to 
measure the effectiveness of Japan's efforts to open its market. 
Is it possible for the two sides to come to a compromise? The 
following article reviews the focus of the dispute between the 
two nations and to predict how the situation will turn out. 
<H5>  Foreshadowing Confrontation </H5>
  "An outcome of the Miyazawa-Clinton summit last July is one 
cause of the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit in February." 
Many of those concerned with the government regard the 
agreement reached between then Prime Minister Miyazawa and U.S. 
President Clinton as a cause of the rupture of the Japan-U.S. 
economic framework talks. It was specified in the joint 
statement of the July 1993 summit that progress in Japan's 
market opening will be measured "on the basis of objective 
criteria." Those officials said that there are still 
differences between the two nations in interpreting such a 
statement. 
  An official who took charge of drafting the joint statement 
said that Japan urged the United States to specify that 
objective criteria are not a pledge. However, the United States 
answered that "if we specify that, we will be not able to win 
our people's understanding." The official said that the 
statement eventually became "vague" because of the Japan-U.S. 
dispute over how to specify objective criteria. 
<H5>  Meaning of Objective Criteria </H5>
  A senior Foreign Ministry official said that objective 
criteria are merely a "yardstick to measure progress in market 
opening." He said that "it seems that the United States hopes 
to have Japan set up objective criteria in the form of the 
Japanese Government's pledge and that the U.S. Government is 
ready to take sanctions if such a pledge is not fulfilled," thus 
showing a stand of keeping an eye on U.S. moves. 
  On the contrary, in the United States, particularly within 
the Congress, there is a hardline view calling on Japan to come 
up with numerical targets that Japan will achieve to promote a 
share of foreign products in Japan's market, saying: "Japan 
will not seriously come to grips with the issue of expanding 
imports unless clear targets are set." While saying that the 
United States "will not call for setting up clear numerical 
targets," such U.S. leaders as U.S. Trade Representative Kantor 
have been urging Japan to set up an indicator that has the 
character of numerical targets. Underlying this is that the 
United States deeply distrusts Japan. 
  However, there is another view. [Bowman] Cutter, 
presidential assistant (and deputy for economic policy), 
stresses that "Japan should understand more that the United 
States is not calling for setting up numerical targets that are 
subject to sanctions." 
  Just before the February Japan-U.S. summit, Presidential 
Assistant Cutter reportedly hammered out a compromise proposal 
in which he said that among priority areas of economic framework 
talks, numerical targets will not be introduced to the insurance 
sector, and that in the area of government procurement, the two 
nations will only analyze the "trend" of Japan's market opening. 
Although his proposal failed to become an official U.S. 
proposal, there is still a possibility that it will give a 
"hint" to resuming economic framework talks. 
<H5>  Possibility of Compromise in Government Purchases and </H5>
Insurance 
  Judging from the U.S. stance not to call for setting up 
numerical targets, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] sees that a request calling for setting up a 
target "designed to help foreign products gain a certain market 
share in the future" is "out of the question, and the United 
States will not make such a request." Meanwhile, as for the 
U.S. call for "keeping a growth rate in Japan's imports," MITI 
views that it is possible that the United States will instead 
stress that "such a call is not a numerical target, and Japan 
should accept this as objective criteria." For that reason, 
MITI says that "both requests are numerical targets, and we 
cannot accept them," thus indicating a strong posture in 
rejecting numerical targets. 
  In the February negotiations, Japan and the United States 
were about to reach an agreement in the area of government 
procurement and insurance, two of the three priority areas, 
which are: 1) government procurement of telecommunications and 
medical equipment, 2) insurance, and 3) automobiles and auto 
parts. In view of this, in the course of behind-the-scenes 
negotiations, it is possible for the two nations to find a 
breakthrough in the deadlocked talks. Although it is observed 
that the two nations will try to reach a compromise based on a 
proposal that places emphasis on "an increase in import trends," 
the Japanese say that "if we put any kind of a number in a 
proposal, it will be interpreted as a pledge." In this way, 
Japan's distrust of the United States is deep-rooted. On the 
other hand, Japan is required to make efforts to dispel the 
distrust of the United States, which says "moderate criteria are 
not effective to promoting Japan's imports." 
  Japanese officials in charge of negotiations "are half in 
doubt about the U.S. position not to call on Japan to set up 
numerical targets" (according to a Foreign Ministry source). It 
seems that the two nations' ability to dispel mutual distrust 
will be the key to a compromise on "objective criteria."

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 6 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] On 5 April, a government source commented on the 
resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, stating: 
"We have nothing to do. As far as Japan is concerned, it is 
important that the United States see Japan's position in an 
economic package to be compiled in June." The source indicated 
that the framework talks will not be resumed earlier than June, 
at which time Japan is scheduled to compile a final package of 
measures to reduce its current account surplus, including 
market-opening measures through deregulation. 
  In response, Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
concurrently foreign minister, said at a news conference 
following a cabinet meeting on the same day: "It is 
inappropriate to say we have nothing to do. Each ministry and 
agency is trying to come up with such measures as deregulation. 
We have a chance to discuss the issue on various occasions. It 
is important for us to discuss what efforts are now being made." 
He thus criticized the remarks by the government source.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The U.S.-DPRK Dialogue Is a Key To Progress in </F>
Negotiations"] 
  [Text] On 31 March, the UN Security Council [UNSC] 
unanimously adopted a presidential statement which urges the 
DPRK (North Korea) to accept additional inspections of its 
nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) and calls on nations concerned to continue dialogue with 
the country based on an agreement reached between the United 
States and the DPRK on 25 February. 
  In response, both the United States and South Korea have 
reached an agreement to suspend the resumption of their joint 
military exercise "Team Spirit." 
  We have maintained that the suspicion of North Korea's 
nuclear development should be solved not through a "north wind" 
[hard-line measures] such as economic sanctions but through 
negotiations, and that the solution should lead to the 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and to the 
normalization of the whole situation. We would like to highly 
appraise the UNSC's rational decision. 
  We sincerely hope that North Korean leaders will positively 
react to the statement and they will accept additional IAEA 
inspections to dispel the suspicion of its nuclear development. 
The international community's prudent stance is an indication 
of its hope to resolve the nuclear suspicion through 
negotiations. North Korea should not misunderstand this 
intention. 
  Before the statement was issued, the IAEA special Board of 
Directors had referred the matter back to the UNSC, claiming 
that it failed to confirm that nuclear materials had not been 
used for military purposes because its first inspection of seven 
North Korean nuclear-related facilities in a year was obstructed. 
  In response, the United States, the UK, France, and Russia, 
which are permanent UNSC members, worked out a draft resolution 
which urged North Korea to accept nuclear inspections within one 
month and hinted at future economic sanctions against the 
country, stating that if North Korea does not comply with the 
resolution, "a further step will be taken." 
  However, China did not change its policy of seeking a 
solution through dialogue during recent successive visits to 
China by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and South Korean 
President Kim Yong-sam. The country has called for a 
presidential statement which has less binding power than a 
resolution, and 10 nonpermanent UNSC members have agreed with 
it. For this reason, it appears that the United States and 
other nations have decided to take a course of moderation. 
  Consideration for North Korea is seen everywhere in the 
presidential statement. While it says it is "regrettable" that 
the IAEA inspection failed to bring a conclusion to the question 
of whether nuclear materials had been transferred to military 
weapons, the statement says it has attached "importance" to 
North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA inspection. 
  The "25 February U.S.-DPRK agreement," to which the 
presidential statement especially refers, stipulated 
simultaneous implementation of the following: 1) North Korea's 
acceptance of inspections of its nuclear facilities; 2) 
resumption of South-North dialogue; 3) suspension of "Team 
Spirit" military exercise this year; and 4) start of the third 
round of the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. However, the United 
States later proposed that the IAEA's full inspection of North 
Korean nuclear facilities and exchange of special envoys between 
the North and the South become a precondition to the start of 
the U.S.-DPRK high-level talks. North Korea has expressed 
opposition to the U.S. proposal. 
  It is hoped that all the parties concerned will resume their 
own dialogue with North korea as soon as possible in line with 
the the UNSC presidential statement. Especially, the U.S.-DPRK 
negotiation is the key dialogue. 
  North Korea has promised that if the U.S.-DPRK high-level 
talks are held, it will discuss such issues as its complete 
return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and 
switchover of its nuclear facilities to light water reactors, 
together with the issue of normalizing relations between the 
United States and the DPRK. Moreover, the country has 
maintained: "We have no obligation to accept full inspection of 
our nuclear facilities because we have now just suspended the 
effectiveness of our declaration of withdrawing from the NPT." 
  If the United States succeeds to have North Korea return to 
the NPT through high-level talks, there will be no grounds for 
North Korea to assert such a peculiar logic. The United States 
and North Korea should resume their working-level talks 
immediately and should make concessions to implement the above 
four points at the same time. 
  Moreover, we hope that China will continue to serve as a 
mediator between North Korea and the countries concerned from 
now on and it will play a major role in achieving 
denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. The real value of the 
UNSC presidential statement, which China pushed forward, will be 
judged from now on.

  [Text] Issei Inoue (vice chairman of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ]) and leader of the SDPJ Diet members 
delegation who visited China from 1 to 3 April, and other 
members of the delegation held a news conference at the Diet 
building on 4 April. At the news conference, they revealed the 
contents of their talks with leading figures of China on such 
issues as the DPRK's (North Korea's) refusal of inspections of 
its nuclear facilities. Mr. Inoue revealed that during talks 
with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on 2 April, the delegation had 
indicated the SDPJ's intention to support the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] presidential statement and to attach importance 
to cooperation with the United Nations. He said he had told the 
foreign minister that "because the SDPJ is one of the ruling 
parties, it intends to abide by the UN policy" on the issue. 
Moreover, he showed eagerness to develop diplomatic activities 
of ruling party members for solving the issue at the "diplomatic 
forum" which is to be set up on 5 April by Diet members of the 
ruling parties. 
  According to Mr. Inoue and other delegation members, while 
the SDPJ delegation indicated the party intention to seek a 
solution of the DPRK nuclear issue through dialogue during 
series of meetings with Chinese leaders, it said that the SDPJ, 
in its capacity as a ruling party, has no intention of deviating 
from the Japanese Government's policy. Moreover, in connection 
with the UNSC's mildly worded presidential statement which was 
recently adopted, the delegation urged China to take a positive 
part in efforts to solve the issue, saying: "We suppose that 
China also bears a responsibility (for implementing the contents 
of the statement)." However, Foreign Minister Qian insisted on 
the view that China "is not a party directly involved." During 
the meeting, they reportedly could not reach an accord on the 
issue.

  [Text] It was disclosed on 4 April that one of the members 
of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] delegation (led 
by SDPJ Vice Chairman Issei Inoue) to China contacted a 
high-ranking official at the DPRK (North Korean) Embassy during 
their stay in Beijing from 1 to 3 April. An SDPJ source said 
that SDPJ upper house member Hajime Fukada met with the North 
Korean Embassy official in Beijing and proposed that a 
delegation of coalition Diet members visit North Korea. The 
North Korean official reportedly demonstrated a positive 
reaction to Fukada's proposal. 
  Inoue said at the 4 April news conference that he told 
Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on 2 April that the SDPJ 
supports the UN Security Council [UNSC] presidential statement 
on the North Korean nuclear development issue and that it 
attaches importance to cooperation with the United Nations. He 
added he had told Qian that "the SDPJ will abide by the UN 
policy as one of the Japanese ruling parties." Inoue then 
demonstrated an eagerness to promote diplomatic activities 
between ruling party lawmakers to solve the issue at the 
interparty "diplomatic forum" to be set up on 5 April.

  [Text] In connection with the issue of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear development, some legislators affiliated with 
the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] have 
discussed the possibility of sending a delegation to North 
Korea; but on 5 April, one ruling party after another argued 
that sending such a delegation to North Korea should be handled 
cautiously. Commenting on the intraparty discussion at an 5 
April news conference, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ, 
stressed: "We intend to cautiously study what our party can do 
after grasping the situation a little more clearly." SDPJ Vice 
Chairman Inoue recently met with a high-ranking North Korean 
official in Beijing. It is said that during the meeting, Inoue 
got the impression the North Korean official showed a 
forward-looking attitude toward a visit by the delegation. 
However, the remark made by Chairman Murayama at the news 
conference indicated his cautious attitude toward sending the 
delegation to North Korea. During the news conference, Chairman 
Murayama also stated: "If there is a role to be played by the 
SDPJ in easing tensions in Asia, the SDPJ is willing to play 
that role aggressively."

  [Text] It has been learned that the F-15 fighter which 
crashed after taking off from Kadena Air Base had been flying 
eastward shortly before the crash. With Okinawa Highway and 
Okinawa City located near the crash site, the crash could have 
caused a terrible disaster. A resident who witnessed the crash 
has indicated the flight route of the aircraft on a map. As 
regards the accident, the Kadena Air Base Public Affairs Office 
stated: "An investigation into the cause of the crash is under 
way, and there is nothing to comment on at this moment." 
  Since the military aircraft crashed near residential areas, 
Okinawans continued to take angry action on 5 April. 
  The Okinawa prefectural government takes the crash seriously 
and sent Tatsuo Matayoshi, chief of the Public Affairs Office, 
to Kadena Air Base on the morning of 5 April to express regret 
to Jeffrey Cliver, commander of the 18th Wing, and to ask the 
commander to conduct a through investigation into the crash. 
  On 4 April, the Okinawa City Assembly held an extraordinary 
session; on the morning of 5 April, the Kadena Town Assembly and 
the Chatan Town Assembly held extraordinary sessions to 
unanimously adopt resolutions. In this manner, protests against 
the crash are now spreading to cities and towns located near 
Kadena Air Base. 
  On the morning of 5 April, labor and peace organizations 
staged emergency rallies to protest the crash on the so-called 
"hill where the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is seen" along the 
runway of the air base. 
  Officials from the Okinawa Federation of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party, the Okinawa Federation of the ruling 
Social Democratic Party of Japan, and the Okinawa Federation of 
the ruling Komeito have visited the Naha Defense Facilities 
Administration Bureau to demand the removal of F-15 fighters, an 
investigation into cause of the crash, and the prevention of a 
recurrence of the crash.

Shusei Arakawa and representatives of the Okinawa City Assembly 
visited both the U.S. consulate general on Okinawa as well as 
Kadena Air Base to strongly protest the crash of an F-15 
fighter, demanding an investigation into the crash and the 
prevention of future recurrences. During his meeting with 
Colonel Joseph Komisarz, commander of the 18th Logistics Group 
of the 18th Wing at Kadena Air Base, Mayor Arakawa strongly 
protested the accident, saying: "If anything went wrong, the 
crash could have resulted in a terrible disaster. The crash is 
a serious issue that threatens the lives of Okinawa citizens." 
During the meeting, the mayor also asked the commander to work 
for the prevention of future recurrences, stating: "The recent 
crash was not the first accident involving U.S. military bases 
on Okinawa. Citizens are uneasy. I hope you will work to 
prevent a recurrence of such accidents."

  [Text] Tokyo -- Kosuke Uehara, director general of the 
Okinawa Development Agency [ODA], commented on the crash of a 
U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter which occurred at Kadena Air Base on 
4 April, saying: "Two or three seconds later and the accident 
could have ended in a major disaster. It is very regrettable." 
ODA Chief Uehara made the remarks at a news conference 
following a regular cabinet meeting on 5 April. He reemphasized 
that "the government should make positive efforts to adopt 
safety measures and prevent accidents." 
  At the news conference, ODA Chief Uehara stated: "Though the 
accident occurred within the area of the U.S. military 
facilities, precautions should be taken not to arouse 
apprehension among local residents." Regarding an investigation 
into the cause of the crash and restraints on flights, he said: 
"In my capacity as a state minister, I would like to influence 
the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Agency." Thus, ODA Chief 
Uehara revealed his intention to ask ministries and agencies 
concerned to take measures against the accident.

  [Text] The Okinawa Prefectural Assembly's Special 
Committee on U.S. Military Bases (chaired by Seichu Kikuyama) 
held a session on 5 April to discuss ways to deal with the crash 
of an F-15 fighter. The special committee decided the Okinawa 
Prefectural Assembly will hold an extraordinary session on 8 
April to adopt a statement calling for a halt to landing and 
takeoff exercises by F-15 fighters until the cause of the crash 
is fully investigated, and to adopt a resolution protesting the 
crash of the F-15 fighter. During a question-answer session, 
Tatsuo Matayoshi, chief of the Public Affairs Office in the 
Okinawa Prefectural Government, made clear that he will fly to 
Tokyo on 6 April to ask the Foreign Ministry, the Defense 
Facilities Administration Agency, the commander of U.S. Forces 
in Japan, and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo to prevent a recurrence 
of the crash. 
  Draft statements and resolutions to be adopted by the 
Okinawa 
Prefectural Assembly strongly protest the crash of the F-15 
fighter, claiming: "The crash site is near Kadena Air Base's 
ammunition dump as well as tourist areas; it could have resulted 
in a terrible disaster." They also demanded a thorough 
investigation into the cause of the crash and a halt to landing 
and takeoff exercises by F-15 fighters until the cause of the 
crash is determined. 
  During the session, members of the special committee agreed 
that "the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly, the Okinawa Prefectural 
Government, and Okinawans should take concerted actions to 
protest the accident." The special committee decided that the 
Okinawa Prefectural Assembly should send a delegation led by 
Speaker Mitsuo Gima to Tokyo on 13 April to protest the crash. 
  During the question-answer session, members from the ruling 
and opposition parties asked the Okinawa Prefectural Government 
to strongly demand an investigation into the cause of the crash, 
while asking U.S. forces in Okinawa to explain a briefing given 
by a pilot involved. In response, Matayoshi stated: "We have 
yet to receive any report on the cause of the crash from U.S. 
forces in Okinawa." He added: "During my stay in Tokyo I will 
strongly ask for a report on the cause of the crash, including 
reports on past crashes." 
  During the session, Matayoshi added that when he protested 
to 
U.S. forces in Okinawa over the crash, they replied: "The 
investigation will take six months at the longest." 
  The crash inflicted damage to crops in tacitly approved 
fields near the crash site. As for the question of U.S. Forces 
compensating for the damage, Matayoshi said: "My understanding 
is there are rules providing for such compensation, but I will 
inquire with the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Bureau 
about it."

<F P=106> [Discussion between Hisahiko Okazaki, former ambassador to </F>
Saudi Arabia and Thailand and currently adviser to the Hakuhodo 
Advertising Agency, and Motoo Shiina, independent member of the 
House of Councilors; place and date not given: "A Time of 
Ordeal for the U.S.-Japan Alliance"] 
  [Text] We Could Not Use "Rice" as a Trump Card in 
Negotiations 
  [Okazaki] We have so much to talk about because so many 
things have happened since we last talked together (for the 
December 1993 issue). First, there is the topic of rice. I 
think that there was no other choice but to liberalize the 
market because the rice issue had reached the stage it had. If 
Japan had refused to liberalize the rice market at that point, 
the Uruguay Round would have failed. As a result, the stock 
market would have crashed on the very same day. The world would 
have blamed Japan for all the resulting ills, and economic 
friction would have become really severe. Under such 
circumstances, there would not be any prospects for the Japanese 
economy's recovery. It was a crisis of that magnitude. 
  One can also ask whether we could have done anything at some 
[earlier] point, before we were driven to such a situation. 
  [Shiina] We had a chance in late December three years ago. 
  [Okazaki) That was the time of the complete liberalization 
of 
beef and oranges in 1991. But that, too, was the outcome of the 
pressure of continuous trade negotiations which had begun about 
10 years earlier. I am not against the liberalization of rice, 
but if I were to give advice to the ones who want to protect the 
rice market, I think that the situation would have been very 
different if we had asked [at that earlier opportunity] for "an 
exception only for rice" and we had actually instead liberalized 
all the other items two years earlier, rather than reluctantly 
opening the market as a result of pressure. 
  [Shiina] As for skillfulness in the negotiations, we must 
have had many cards to play because the volume of the trade 
involved was so large. Including secondary industry products, 
we should have used each card as one of an entire deck of cards. 
But we could not do that because we went into the [Uruguay 
Round] negotiations under a vertical-division system which 
states that "agricultural products are under the jurisdiction of 
the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries." And, we 
could no longer use "rice," which it had been intended to use as 
the last card and which thus was wrested away from us. 
  [Okazaki] It has been said that farmers could not make 
career 
plans for the future. Until now, the government's agricultural 
policy has steadfastly insisted that we would not let even a 
single grain of foreign rice into the country. But, because of 
the outcome [of the liberalization] this time, do they now have 
better prospects? 
  [Shiina] Not yet. They have been so busy debating only 
whether to leave the outer wall the way it is, to lower it a 
bit, or to take it down altogether that they have neglected to 
discuss what to do about the situation inside the wall. I am 
not sure whether the new agricultural policy will be any better. 
  [Okazaki] For now we have a six-year moratorium, but 
liberalization thereafter is inevitable. After six years, 
tariffication will be adopted, and the tariff rate will go down 
every year thereafter. Everyone understands that. 
  [Shiina] There may be some people who do not understand 
(laughter). Such people say that "we only bought a ticket to 
the next station so let's get off the train there and think it 
over again in the waiting room." 
  [Okazaki] I can tolerate that sort of people. The ones I 
worry about, however, are the ones who are sitting in the 
driver's seat on the train. The situation will be very 
different 10 years from now, yet I wonder whether the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries has an agricultural 
policy plan to cope with such a situation. 
  [Shiina] The people who are in charge of making agricultural 
policy seem to be too worn out by their work to buy a ticket to 
the next station. I do not think that the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries is the driver. To begin 
with, the drivers should be politicians and farmers themselves. 
But the problem is that they maintain that they themselves are 
also passengers. It is hard to find people who insist "Let me 
drive." 
  [Okazaki] Then the situation is more serious than I thought. 
You are saying that people have not been thinking about the 
future while they have been insisting "do not let even a single 
grain in." 
  [Shiina] No, they must have known that it would not be 
possible to keep insisting on "not even a single grain." To use 
the previous metaphor, they knew that they had to board the 
train. That is why for now they have settled on "to the next 
station." 
  The problem is that in the case of Japanese agriculture, 
what 
is poured into the land per area unit is greater than what is 
harvested. In other words, the cost is exceedingly high. At a 
minimum, they have to achieve parity between input and output. 
  [Okazaki] You mean government subsidies? 
  [Shiina] Everything, including government money, private 
money, labor, and so on. 
  [Okazaki] I, too, worry that the government does not have a 
policy. But on second thought, now that we have some prospects 
for the future because of the recent agreement, what might be 
more important is the "invisible hand." 
  [Shiina] That's right. We must keep in mind the element of 
the "invisible hand." 
  [Okazaki] The era may have passed in which the bureaucrats 
in 
charge of agricultural policy determine "what should be the form 
of new rice cultivation." 
  [Shiina] There are fine orchestras in European cities, even 
in small cities, and they all get subsidies. But it is not good 
to go around giving free concerts. When an orchestra only gives 
free concerts, its quality goes down. When it charges an 
appropriate admission fee and the people who purchased tickets 
start attending, the level of that orchestra goes up. It will 
even get to a level at which it will be asked from all over the 
world to "please come." But still, the orchestra cannot be 
maintained merely by selling tickets. At that point, subsidies 
come into play. I think that agriculture should follow the same 
thinking. 
  [Okazaki] It is true that every country in the world gives 
farm subsidies. 
  [Shiina] The prices for agriculture products are low, and 
when the bumper crops occur, they become even lower. 
  [Okazaki] Still, if they are made to depend totally on the 
government and such, the "invisible hand" will not work and the 
consequences will not be good. 
  [Shiina] It will become similar to the orchestras which go 
around playing for elementary schools for no charge. They will 
play haphazardly and say, "They won't know [the difference]." 
  [Okazaki] As I look to the future, things should not take a 
form in which the government takes no role, but at the same time 
the government should not assume full responsibility. 
  If the farmers make honest and full efforts, even if 
recessions occur at times, the government would not abandon 
them. I hope that the agricultural policy 10 years from now 
will be in this vein. 
  [Shiina] Anyway, because Japan bought a ticket and boarded 
the train, GATT remained intact. But there is no country which 
bought a ticket to the end of the line, which is called the 
ideal international free trade system. If we were to stick 
rigidly to that principle, it would mean a planned economy on a 
global scale. When Japan bought a ticket for the next station, 
France bought one for the station after it. There was very 
little order. And thereafter, the matter was left for the 
future. Now, it seems as if the countries which bought tickets 
for stations a little farther on are swaggering. 
<H5>  Where Will Political Reform's Effects Show Up? </H5>
  [Okazaki] Political reform has been achieved to some extent, 
hasn't it? 
  [Shiina] It is often said that the "result itself is 
important in politics." The upper house members of the Japan 
Social Democratic Party [SDPJ] who opposed their party 
executives' line this time have ended up being pulled in a 
totally undesirable direction. 
  [Okazaki] That is right. This resulted in the bill that the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] wanted most. I wonder how they 
justify themselves. I wonder if they think what they did was 
right. 
  [Shiina] If they believe that "the SDPJ is in essence the 
party of protest," then there is no problem. (laughter) 
  [Okazaki] But as a result, a single-constituency electoral 
district system has been produced which is more disadvantageous 
to them than is the single-seat district system that they had 
been opposing. 
  [Shiina] For them, principle is more important. But then, it 
is no longer politics. The raison d'etre of politics is to 
improve things, however minute the improvement might be. 
  It is called the "rebellion by the 17." But at the bottom of 
the situation, there is the LDP. So in that sense, the LDP 
played it well. But it is also interesting that not all LDP 
members think that things went well. 
  [Okazaki] Also, it is not clear if the LDP executives had 
read the situation to that depth and went along. If the 
executives had read the situation incorrectly and the bill had 
passed by one or two votes, the LDP would have sustained quite a 
bit of damage, damage both system-wise and image-wise. 
  [Shiina] Speaking of image, at that time the government 
parties could have put the bill to a vote again without having 
resorted to holding conferences in both houses and could have 
dissolved the Diet if it did not pass. That way, they could 
have said that "the LDP ruined political reform." 
  Getting back to the SDPJ, it is in a state in which it had 
been taking a nap while leaning on the wall of ideology. But 
the wall has disappeared, and it has tumbled backwards. So, it 
is completely at a loss about what to do now. But there are 
some unexpectedly spirited people among them, and they have 
opposed [the electoral reform bill], arguing that "for our 
righteous ideology to be accurately reflected in Japan, such a 
strange election system is totally authoritarian." 
  [Okazaki] That is a logic which I do not understand. 
  [Shiina] Neither do I (laughter). But anyway, they must have 
had the fear that if the election system were to change, then 
the SDPJ would disappear. And yet, they do not understand that 
it is precisely because they are still making such arguments 
that the party is facing collapse. It is an issue which takes 
precedence over the election system. 
  [Okazaki] I have the impression that they are acting that 
way 
because they believe that if the party is going to collapse 
anyway, then it is better not to compromise their principles. 
  [Shiina] But even were the party to collapse, the 
individuals could survive. I think that when the ship was 
sinking, there would be more of them who would escape by 
lifeboat and would say "let me get on your boat" than those who 
would say "I will go down with the ship." In such 
circumstances, one wonders what in the world the 1955 structure 
was all about, in that it was so troubled by such a party. 
  [Okazaki] The 1955 structure, in concrete terms, was a 
medium-sized electoral district system in which each district 
had a quorum of four to five representatives. The first and 
second seats were taken by the LDP and the third by the SDPJ. 
Am I correct? 
  [Shiina] In other words, with the exception of some 
districts, the SDPJ only had to run one candidate in each 
electoral district. In effect, it was handled as a 
single-constituency electoral district. Because most of the 
time each of the [SDPJ] candidates was elected, it must have 
been just fine for those people. 
  [Okazaki] But that system is going to change. 
  [Shiina] Still, they must have known that their number would 
dwindle, even under the previous system, because they lost 70 
seats in the last election. 
  [Okazaki] No one knows what will happen after the electoral 
system reform this time. But it is still quite significant that 
it was changed. When a system remains unchanged for a long 
time, various kinds of system fatigue and friction occur. 
  The commotion at the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] is one example. They made a special personnel 
arrangement in order to accommodate a person who wanted to run 
for an election. When questioned about this, the [MITI's] answer 
was that "it is done routinely." I wish the bureaucrat who 
answered had said, even if it were untrue, that "he was 
exceptionally talented and there was no other suitable person 
for that post. For the sake of the country, we had no choice 
but to appoint him." 
  [Shiina] That's right. But there have been just too many 
similar cases; that answer would have sounded too strange. 
  [Okazaki] Because there was a seniority system, which was 
determined by one's number of terms in the LDP, when bright 
persons who came from the provinces entered the top ministries, 
they were quickly cultivated to become LDP Diet representatives. 
Then, in turn, they protected the interests of the respective 
ministries. This has been the system. I hope to see some 
changes in the system. 
  [Shiina] That is why the change of the government is really 
significant. In the past, when one served as parliamentary vice 
minister, one was considered to be a two- or three-term 
representative. 
  [Okazaki] Was that the last stage of the LDP era? 
  [Shiina] No, it was the middle stage. The reason was that 
there was no one who had been elected 10 times as is the case 
today. My father (Etsuzaburo) became chief cabinet secretary in 
his second term. People said that that was quite an 
achievement. But because the old-timers were mostly purged 
after the war, the majority were second- or third-termers. So, 
he was not selected in particular or anything like that. But 
today, when there are many seven- and eight-termers, it is much 
easier to adopt a personnel system based on seniority. The 
reason is that unlike other regular professions, it is harder to 
tell whether a politician is able or not. (laughter) 
  [Okazaki] It is no longer easy for someone to enter some 
ministry in Tokyo soon after being elected from his district, 
and to live a secure life as an LDP politician ever after. That 
is because the possibility has arisen that such a person could 
lose to a new new party candidate or some such person and lose 
everything. It could lead to a situation in which it "would 
have been better if I stayed at the ministry." 
  [Shiina] Then it will be the right kind of risk. In previous 
elections, I thought that "it is not good that everybody has 
become a populist." But such a situation may have positive 
consequences, for in the upcoming so-called realignment of the 
political world, the unsteady, not-too-bright politicians may 
well be weeded out. 
  [Okazaki] I think when the reshuffle takes place, many good 
things will happen, even though they may not be visible. 
  [Shiina] I am glad that political reform was achieved 
without 
a collapse. If this matter had not been taken care of, all 
other matters would have stopped. 
  [Okazaki] As with the rice issue, political reform had to be 
passed when the situation reached a certain stage. Otherwise, 
they would not be able to work on economic countermeasures. 
That is the political current. 
  [Shiiina] This, too, is like buying a ticket to a station 
three stops away. "We will think later what we should do 
afterwards." 
  [Okazaki] The fact that they boarded the train is 
significant 
in itself. 
  "Welfare" Tax Ridicules Japanese People 
  [Shiina] Next, let us talk about the "national welfare tax." 
The [Finance] Ministry said [the budget] would be "compiled in 
the new year." That was the ministry stringing the government 
along, saying that "unless you make it clear where you are 
going, we won't let you buy a ticket." 
  And finally, they tried to make them buy a ticket to their 
destination. The timing was also good, and their words were 
effective: "Unless you buy this ticket, you will be embarrassed 
when you meet Mr. Clinton next week." So Prime Minister 
Hosokawa bought the ticket in a hurry and tried to jump on the 
train. But when he was told the ticket was not good, he swapped 
it for one that would only take him halfway. The bureaucrats, 
who thought they had succeeded "at least in putting him on the 
train," found the ticket was torn from him almost immediately. 
  [Okazaki] But even according to the initial plan, the 
consumption tax hike would take effect after three years. It 
seems almost a foregone conclusion that, after three years, 
consumption tax will have to be raised. 
  [Shiina] Public opinion surveys show people feel it is 
inevitable. But the bureaucrats, especially Ministry of Finance 
officials, regard the Japanese people as ignorant and do not 
trust them. And because they think politicians are the 
representatives of such ignorant people and "might do something 
beyond the reach of our control," they tried to make them buy a 
ticket for a special express train that would not be stopping at 
stations along the way. They failed, though, to get them aboard 
that train, and the situation is the same as it was at the end 
of last year. That is why the incident [surrounding Hosokawa's 
tax proposal] was useful, because it at least made the 
bureaucrats realize that "not everything can be made to work as 
we want." 
  [Okazaki] At the same time, there may be some benefit in the 
government having started to talk about "raising the consumption 
tax rate." 
  [Shiina] A lucky accident. 
  [Okazaki] Now it has been mentioned, everyone will expect it 
to happen in the future. 
  [Shiina] And they will begin discussions about how to do it. 
  [Okazaki] When a party is in the position the LDP used to 
be, with three hundred seats, every bill passed if the 
bureaucrats skillfully pre-arranged them. The style of politics 
is no longer one of perfection, though. If there is a hitch to 
anything then people in Japan denounce you as no good and 
disgraceful. In the United States, however, it is common 
practice to submit a bill, delete a portion after debate, and 
then resubmit it. I think the situation in Japan is beginning 
to approach that style. 
  [Shiina] One can say that we have moved closer to 
conservatism and away from socialism under which ministerial 
offices manage a planned economy. 
  [Okazaki] It may not be a bad idea to bring up logically 
sound proposals for which the possibility of success is about 60 
percent. 
  [Shiina] The incident this time [Hosokawa first announcing 
the tax plan and then almost immediately retracting it] is a 
good precedent to show that things can be upset. In the 
conventional wisdom of the past, if the LDP president had done 
the same thing, he would have had to take responsibility. Mr. 
Hosokawa, on the other hand, is still here. (laughter) 
  [Okazaki] It seemed the Finance Ministry would take in too 
much under the original proposal. They opted for a six trillion 
yen tax cut and a 7 percent consumption tax rise three years 
later. It would have been better instead to opt for a 7 
trillion yen tax cut. That might have brought about a more 
natural increase in tax revenue. 
  [Shiina] To try to calculate during a recession is like 
going shopping when you are hungry. You tend to buy more than 
otherwise might. Also, it treats people as fools to think they 
will consent [to pay] if the term "welfare" is used. It is best 
not to collect taxes earmarked for a specific purpose. You can 
see the problem if we use the analogy of the household budget: 
Though you are hungry, as you have spent the entire food 
budget, you can not buy food with the money remaining because it 
is set aside for housing expenses. (laughter) Ultimately, 
clever people show themselves to be fools if they take the 
attitude toward ordinary people that "we can cheat them if we 
describe things this way.". 
  [Okazaki] Nevertheless, it is not good that wise people do 
not propose wise measures. I think it was good that this time 
at least the issue was publicized. 
  On the defense issues that I have long been involved with, 
even when we made progress in theory, we were told that "public 
opinion has not reached that stage," and we compromised before 
we made a public presentation. It would have been better [to 
have made a proposal and] if it failed to pass, amended it. I 
wish the LDP had had that much courage. 
  [Shiina] When proposal are made, they will be discussed. If 
there are no proposals, there is no discussion. 
  [Okazaki] People feel differently about Mr. Hosokawa's 
political ability. But, as a matter of fact, he depends very 
little on vested interests. That includes areas such as rice 
and automobiles. He should, therefore, be able to act 
decisively. He should be proposing one wise measure after 
another. There is nothing we can do if the foolish view 
prevails after thorough discussion, but at least the matter has 
been debated. 
  [Shiina] They should make use of the lesson learned from the 
failure this time. 
  What The U.S. Actually Wanted 
  [Okazaki] I mentioned earlier that because there was only 
one week left before the U.S.-Japan summit meeting, they agreed 
on tax system reform. But I think it was a mistake in judgment 
to decide on the figure of 6 trillion yen. The reason is that 
the failed discussions on "micro" issues such as numerical 
targets was not a significant enough prize for the United States 
side claim "victory," even if a compromise had been achieved. 
It would have been merely a draw. They [the Hosokawa 
government] knew from the beginning their "micro" issue 
proposals would not work sufficiently to satisfy the U.S., so 
they should have bet on the "macro" approach. 
  I think what the United States actually wanted was an 8 
trillion yen tax cut. The Japanese tax cut was said to be 
between 5 trillion and 7 trillion yen. But according to the 
opinion of many people I heard, Trade Representative Kantor 
would have gone home saying, "we wrestled this much from Japan: 
The meeting was successful," if we had come up with 7 trillion 
plus something else. I thought everybody understood this. It 
may be that the leadership did not recognize it or, perhaps it 
did but was unsuccessful in controlling the Ministry of Finance, 
which was not so aware. 
  [Shiina] I am concerned about how much the bureaucrats will 
learn from that mistake. After all, they are giddy with 
excitement at being able to claim "we said 'no'." But they 
would also have been happy had they been made to swallow the 
American demands because they could then have been able to give 
all kinds of orders to the auto industry and others. They are 
happy that they won the argument, but there is nothing for them 
to do now. 
  The bureaucrats say "it is absurd for the government to put 
a 
framework on the market." That is a good point. There are even 
some Americans who say, "let's not make the bureaucrats the 
champions of the free economy." 
  [Okazaki] Right. That is why I think it is wrong for people 
to conclude that, as a result of this incident, the U.S.-Japan 
relationship has become a "mature," or that "we said 'no' for 
the first time." 
  This time, the United States was out of step. It was clear 
that they were unreasonable in individual negotiations toward 
Japan. The USTR (United States Trade Representative) took a 
hard line. But in places like the Commerce Department they were 
embarrassed to tell Japan to "self-regulate." So the Japanese 
did not say "no" to the United States, they said "no" to a 
section of the United States. But because they made a mistake on 
macro policy, they created a dispute with the entire United 
States. 
  [Shiina] It began because Mr. Miyazawa gave an ambiguous 
promissory note at the time parliament was dissolved. His 
successor was told to "honor it." It would be quite 
understandable in such circumstances to have said, "I can not 
honor such an incomplete promissory note." But in the United 
States last year they considered that they had received a 
promissory note. They called responsible officials to Congress, 
had a public hearing, and asked "does this promissory note bear 
a bona fide signature," "is the date included?" They thought 
they had confirmed this to be a genuine promissory note. When 
it was withdrawn the United States held an empty hand, but Mr. 
Hosokawa should have said "I can not honor that note, but I 
want to exchange it for my own promissory note." 
  [Okazaki] That's right. He should have used the new 
promissory note called 7 trillion yen plus something else. He 
could have said that "the last one was issued by a firm that 
went bankrupt." 
  [Shiina] They had to run around trying to take care of the 
promissory note. They should have started in the first place by 
rejecting a promissory note they could no longer honor. 
<H5>  What Japan Should Do in Emergency on Korean Peninsula </H5>
  [Okazaki] Here is the result of am MIT (Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology) forecast of the future U.S.-Japan 
relationship made two years ago in May. There were several 
participants each from Japan and the United States, two Chinese, 
two from the Soviet Union, and two from the EC. They divided a 
dozen years into three segments and discussed each; the 1993 to 
1996, 1997 to 2000, and the four years after that. It was 
originally a secret strategy plan commissioned by the Pentagon. 
But when some of it started to leak out, they turned it into a 
document and made it public -- this is typically American. 
  What astonished me when I read it was the severity of the 
Americans. It recommended withdrawing most favored nation 
status from Japan if it would not reduce the trade surplus. 
That was only a first step. It also wanted the United States 
to conspire with NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement] and 
the EC to isolate Japan. Since all the American "players" 
agreed on these points, the situation is quite serious. In the 
end, the evaluator said that "the U.S. strategy was formulated 
to be carried out under ideal conditions which would not be 
found in reality." The ideal situation they referred to was the 
State Department and Defense Department having no voice. 
  Which means, though, that as long as the State Department 
and 
the Pentagon regard Japan as a true ally, we have a chance to be 
saved. This will be put to the test on many occasions, but the 
biggest test in the next two to three months will unquestionably 
be the Korean issue. 
  [Shiina] The future forecast is very clear, but they do 
not bear in mind the fact that everything they import from Japan 
would be extremely expensive if they stopped giving Japan most 
favored nation status, do they? 
  [Okazaki] That is not a problem. The United States would be 
substantially damaged, but Japan would be ruined. They say that 
would be alright. It is not a zero sum game, but if it is X 
minus Y for this side but X minus 2Y for the other side, this 
side wins. That is the Huntington theory. 
  [Shiina] If they calculate to that extent, it is really 
something. But it is all based on the premise that Japan will 
not change, is it not? 
  [Okazaki] The proposals Japan made were all concessions 
(compromise): It has been constantly offering to purchase all 
its new airplanes or all its new weaponry from the United States. 
  [Shiina] Will it not work even then? 
  [Okazaki] No. In its conclusion, the forecast describes how 
Japan will be completely unable to resist the United States. 
  [Shiina] If the concession simply enlarges the bandage which 
has been applied, there is some hope. In other words, Japan's 
remaining task will be to cure its internal afflictions. 
  [Shiina] You may be right. If the Pentagon and the State 
Department consider Japan an ally, no matter how bad economic 
ties, the relationship will survive. The first test will be the 
emergency on the Korean peninsula. When it happens, we must say 
"yes" immediately in prior consultations. That is important, 
because there is nothing for us to think about. 
  When Japan is given a time limit of "five hours," it always 
mulls things over for four hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds, and 
then says "yes." We should avoid that. If we make them wait 
for five hours, young Americans will have died on the Korean 
peninsula in that time. The United States, too, might need to 
make preparations and might not be able to move out that 
quickly, but we don't want to be blamed even for that. As for 
the F-15's taking off from Okinawa, it is subject to prior 
consultations because at the time of reversion of Okinawa we 
made an agreement that "protecting the security of South Korea 
is ultimately protecting the security of Japan." If we are 
prepared to say "yes" immediately, that is acceptable. 
  [Shiina] I think you are right. And if there are any other 
approaches we can utilize, we should make sure they are ready to 
be used right away. 
  [Okazaki] That's right. What I just said is the minimum 
condition, and it is harder to go further. North Korea is much 
stronger than Iraq, so there is the possibility that any war 
will be prolonged. We will then face the important issue of 
whether Japan can simply sit quietly doing nothing with 200 
F-15's on its territory while Americans are dying every day. In 
other words, this is an issue of whether or not the situation 
would lead to the collapse of the U.S.-Japan alliance. Japan 
might say now that "South Korea would not want it," but if they, 
along with the United States, were to come asking for our help, 
then the Japanese people would have to make a decision. 
  [Shiina] At such a time the economic issue about which we 
said "no" will become very minor in the face of a more major 
concern. 
  [Okazaki] Right. Everything will be determined by the 
Japanese response then. It is said that the United States was 
prepared to take economic sanctions against North Korea in 
April, June, and autumn last year because it was so 
uncooperative. Each time they continued the talks, but the 
patience of the public and Congress is about to run out. There 
may be many more stages in the future, but if it reaches a point 
where things are going nowhere, economic sanctions will be 
imposed. And North Korea says that "your application of 
economic sanctions will be taken as a declaration of war." 
  [Shiina] As for the U.S.-Japan summit, although the press 
has concentrated on the framework talks, the two sides also 
discussed the North Korean issue. Mr. Hosokawa said that if the 
United States were to impose economic sanctions, Japan would go 
along. But then, would economic sanctions be the end of the 
matter. 
  [Okazaki] There is more to come. 
  [Shiina] At such a time we will not have the option of 
saying "we will only ride as far as the station half way." We 
must be prepared to go all the way. 
  [Okazaki] At every stage, there is the possibility of 
resolving the situation peacefully. That will be alright. But 
if events turn worse, we have no choice but to go all the way. 
In that case, it is important not to destroy the U.S.-Japan 
relationship. If we blow that, Japan will be ruined in the 
economic relationship. 
  [Shiina] That is why we should stop looking at the 
U.S.-Japan summit only through the magnifying glass of the 
framework talks. You said earlier that as long as the Pentagon 
and the State Department regard Japan as an ally, the U.S.-Japan 
relationship will survive, and the test case would be the 
situation on the Korean peninsula. But before we talk about 
that test case, there is an unanswered question: In the United 
States during the Gulf war there was much debate about "whether 
or not Japan is really an ally." 
  Because an answer was lacking, neither the State Department 
nor the Pentagon came to the fore when we were struggling with 
economic issues. Unless we think deeply to this extent, we can 
not simply say "no" on economic issues.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 6 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] At a 3 April dinner, Prime Minister Hosokawa made a 
remark indicating his wish to resign. 
  Commenting on the prime minister's remark while speaking 
with 
a group of reporters early in the morning of 6 April, Deputy 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama said: "The prime 
minister made the remark at a dinner. He made the statement 
from his position as a civilian, not as prime minister. He is 
used to speaking his mind to others." But Hatoyama added: "As 
prime minister, he made a reckless remark. I believe he did not 
make that statement even jokingly."

<F P=106> [From MAINICHI SHIMBUN 5 April Evening Edition] </F>
  [Text] At a news conference held after the cabinet meeting 
on 5 April, Director General of the Defense Agency Kazuo Aichi 
stated: "Each cabinet has a role to play. The Tanaka cabinet 
dealt with the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan 
and China, and the Takeshita cabinet with consumption taxes. 
The Hosokawa cabinet has accomplished its mission of political 
reform. It will naturally have to change its character and set 
its next goal. Depending on what the goal will be, the question 
of whether the present framework is good enough may arise." He 
indicated that in order to facilitate the implementation of tax 
reform, which is expected to follow the passage of the fiscal 
1994 budget, there may be changes in the composition of the 
coalition. 
  Among the ruling coalition parties, Komeito Secretary 
General 
Yuichi Ichikawa has proposed a "council on basic issues" for the 
ruling parties to discuss policies, while the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan and Sakigake [Harbinger] are suspicious of this 
proposal. Under the circumstances, Aichi's remark is expected 
to create a stir.

<F P=106> [Interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo (Japanese </F>
Trade Union Confederation) by TOKYO SHIMBUN reporter Yuji Saito: 
"Political Realignment Talks Should Come After Passage of the 
Fiscal 1994 Budget"; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Saito] Could you please tell us your views on the 
controversial plan to form a new policy study forum among ruling 
coalition parties? 
  [Yamagishi] The policy study forum was first said to provide 
a basis for a parliamentary union of coalition party members in 
the House of Representatives. However, when we think of the 
next lower house election, there will be a good possibility that 
the policy study forum will develop into the so-called 
coalition-wide "new new party [shin shinto]" in the end. 
Parties in the ruling coalition should first complete the 
process toward forming a single parliamentary group in the House 
of Councilors by dispelling the ill feeling among them, by 
deepening mutual confidence, and by overcoming their fundamental 
policy differences. It was reported that participation in the 
policy study forum would become a precondition for candidate 
selection that would be jointly supported by all coalition 
parties in the next lower house election. It was also said that 
the prime minister and the promoters of the study forum plan had 
a secret meeting to discuss who would take up which post in the 
coalition-wide "new new party." If this is true, I strongly 
object to these moves. I have to confess, I never expected such 
developments in the political realignment talks. 
  [Saito] Shinseito and Komeito are maneuvering quickly. 
  [Yamagishi] I want them to put off such a move until the 
fiscal 1994 budget clears the Diet. Coalition members should 
not give the impression that they are engrossed in an 
interlocking puzzle to find a new combination of parties and 
paying no attention to the most important and urgent matter, 
which is the implementation of measures to stimulate the 
sluggish economy. If they do not go all-out to win passage of 
the fiscal 1994 budget, I am afraid that the fate of the 
coalition government might become uncertain. If the coalition 
government were to collapse, coalition members would suffer a 
total loss. As such there is no point in discussing the "new 
new party" plan right now. 
  [Saito] What exactly is the "social-democratic/liberal" 
alliance? 
  [Yamagishi] Since Japanese people have various political 
values, there should be a tendency to wish for a political force 
that fights for the interests of workers, like the Labor Party 
under the European type of two-party system. However, a 
movement to create this sort of political force has not taken 
shape so far. People with such an idea are still groping in the 
dark. Hopefully, a neoliberal party should have the following 
selling points: It should promote a nonmilitary role in global 
security efforts, emphasize the interests of workers, and secure 
clean and open politics. 
  [Saito] What kind of role do you expect Hokkaido Governor 
Takahiro Yokomichi to play in the next phase of the unfolding 
political realignment drama? 
  [Yamagishi] The governing coalition is now supported by two 
forces. One is the Shinseito-Komeito axis, which is already 
very steady. Unfortunately, the other one has not taken shape 
yet. However, there are indications that it is coming into 
existence. The movement toward the creation of a neoliberal 
party is a sign. I want Hokkaido Governor Yokomichi to play a 
certain role in promoting this movement, in cooperation with 
other leaders. One point is that his comeback to the central 
stage should be well timed. We are going to see another 
climactic scene in the unfolding political realignment drama, 
from the end of the current regular Diet session until early 
autumn. At that event, Mr. Yokomichi should not give the 
impression that he has been prevailed upon to become the new 
leader of the liberal force. Like Prime Minister Hosokawa did 
when he created his party, Mr. Yokomichi will have to 
demonstrate that he is firmly determined to create a new party, 
even if he is left alone. 
  [Saito] You have announced that Rengo will establish a 
political forum in June. Don't you think that the forum will 
become a means for selecting political parties with which Rengo 
will cooperate in the next elections? 
  [Yamagishi] Before the inauguration of the political forum, 
a preparatory panel will be set up in early April. Electoral 
cooperation will necessarily be brought up for discussion. 
However, participation in the political forum should absolutely 
not become a precondition to get Rengo's support or endorsement 
in the next elections. At this moment, the most delicate issue 
for the preparatory panel is which parties should be invited to 
join the political forum. 
  [Saito] Some Rengo-affiliated local industrial unions, such 
as the All-Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers' Union, have 
announced that the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] will 
no longer enjoy a monopoly on their support. What do you think 
of the change in their policy? 
  [Yamagishi] Candidates backed by all coalition members 
will automatically receive Rengo's support; this is quite 
natural. The recent gubernatorial election in Ishikawa 
Prefecture showed the coalition parties will not be able to 
defeat the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] if they fight 
individually. Rengo has traditionally backed the SDPJ and the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. However, in the next lower 
house election to be held under the new single-seat electoral 
system, many members who belong to neither the SDPJ nor the DSP 
will be selected as candidates to be jointly supported by the 
coalition parties. Therefore, these labor unions cannot but 
change their policy of supporting only one party. 
  [Saito] What future do you foresee for the governing 
coalition? 
  [Yamagishi] There are now two different tendencies among the 
ruling coalition. However, all members are of the same opinion 
that they will have to cooperate in fielding candidates in the 
next general elections. They should present an effective united 
front against the LDP by making utmost efforts to jointly 
support a single candidate in each district. 
  [TOKYO SHIMBUN editorial note] Yamagishi is a senior member 
of the SDPJ who joined the party in 1954 and has been affiliated 
with it ever since. During the interview, we strongly felt his 
anxiety about the future of his party. It seemed as if he was 
saying: "Whether it stays with the ruling coalition or whether 
it secedes from it, the SDPJ should remain united. Otherwise 
other parties will try to take its electoral power base by 
assault, bringing about a breakup of the SDPJ. As a party 
member, I am anxious about it." At the same time, we also 
realize he has a strong sense of duty as a "cheerleader" for the 
governing coalition. In an effort to maintain unity within the 
coalition, he seemed to be ambitious to play a role as a 
mediator between the Shinseito-Komeito forces and the rest of 
the coalition members.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] 
has started working on a project to promote the interconnection 
of locally operated cable television networks and to support the 
development of a multimedia services system which will link 
cable television services with telephone and other 
communications services. In addition to compiling a set of 
technical criteria for the connection of networks, the MOPT 
plans to conduct experiments into making practical use of 
cordless phones by utilizing cable television networks and 
eventually establishing cordless phone networks. Since the MOPT 
eased regulations concerning cable television services last 
December, it is possible that with the implementation of the new 
MOPT project, more trading firms and foreign cable television 
companies may now enter the market. 
  Currently, approximately 1.08 million households throughout 
the nation have subscribed to cable television companies. This 
network has drawn much attention because of the possibility that 
it could compete favorably with the Nippon Telegraph and 
Telephone Corporation (NTT) network as a new data communications 
infrastructure. The MOPT's new project is aimed at encouraging 
the joint development of new services which will merge 
communications with broadcasting and the mutual provision of 
such services by connecting cable television networks, which are 
dispersed throughout the nation, with networks run by new 
common-carrier companies. 
  According to plans, consideration will be given to the 
process of standardizing the interconnection of cable television 
networks, with the Cable Television Council (Kohei Kogure, 
chairman), which consists of 158 cable television companies, 
playing the major role. Studies will also be made of ways to 
solve technical problems regarding the joint use of different 
cable television networks in bidirectional services, such as 
video-on-demand with which viewers can see video programs at any 
time they want to. 
  By experimenting with cordless phones, it is hoped that a 
new 
business can be established whereby subscribing households and 
other users can talk with each other by utilizing cable 
television networks. The cordless phone system enables cordless 
home phones to be used outdoors. Among its numerous advantages 
are that the entire system itself is very simple, with 
construction costs for automated transmission stations being 
considerably lower than the costs of constructing such stations 
for mobile telephone systems. One shortcoming of the system is 
that cordless phones cannot be used when a user is traveling at 
high speeds, but phone bills can be cheaper than for regular 
mobile telephone systems. 
  Currently, experiments are being conducted primarily using 
NTT's local telephone networks in Tokyo, Sapporo, and other 
cities, but so far there has been no case of experiments using 
cable television networks. The MOPT plans to first conduct 
experiments by calling on cable television companies in Tokyo. 
It then plans to connect cable television stations together in 
the future to expand the areas of coverage. 
  As for plans to link cable television networks with 
communications services, the Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui and 
Company, Ltd., the Tokyo Electric Power Company, Ltd., and the 
Tokyu Corporation have concluded a tie-up, in view of developing 
the multimedia industry in the future. The MOPT's project is 
expected to boost such moves among private firms.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Ministerial talks will be held in Marrakech, 
Morocco, for four days beginning 12 April to sign the final 
agreement document that was hammered out last December at the 
Uruguay Round (the multilateral trade negotiations of GATT]. 
The ministerial talks are expected to adopt a declaration 
calling for the implementation of an accord on the World Trade 
Organization (WTO) in January 1995, earlier than July 1995 
called for in the document. The United States and other nations, 
however, have proposed that the issue of protecting workers in 
developing countries be taken up for discussion at the 
ministerial talks, but the coordination of views among the 
participating nations on the proposal is facing rough sailing 
because of backlash to the proposal from developing countries. 
Hence, how to grapple with the North-South issue is surfacing 
as a focal point of the ministerial talks. 
  In a bid to end child and forced labor which is pervasive in 
developing countries, the United States and France have proposed 
that WTO map out a set of unified rules to protect workers in 
those countries. The two nations have also demanded that a 
document to be adopted by the ministerial talks incorporate a 
work schedule to study the compatibility of the protection of 
workers and trade. They have made the proposal out of their deep 
concern about an export offensive from developing countries in 
Asia and other regions that are supported economically by 
low-wage workers. Some industrialized nations have asserted 
that the export of low-priced goods from developing countries 
where labor conditions are poor should be restricted as dumping. 
  Developing countries have reacted against their assertions, 
saying, "They are pursuing protectionism under the pretext of 
protecting our workers." In his recent meeting with Hiroshi 
Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, French 
Foreign Minister Juppe asked for Japan's cooperation, but Mr. 
Kumagai took a cautious attitude, saying, "Consideration should 
be given to the concerns of Asian nations." Environmental 
protection has been referred to as a major item on the agenda of 
the next round of multilateral trade negotiations and a few 
industrialized nations plan to demand that exports from 
developing countries where the costs of protecting environment 
are low be restricted as "environmental dumping." Developing 
countries are reacting against such a move by some 
industrialized nations. Both industrialized nations and 
developing countries will inevitably confront at the ministerial 
talks. 
  The declaration to be adopted by the ministerial talks is 
expected to call for the implementation of the accord on WTO in 
January 1995, but signatories to the accord need to do the work 
of amending their respective domestic laws. There is a view 
that given political agendas in the Untied States and European 
nations, it is unclear whether the accord would take effect in 
January 1995.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Objection to U.S. Hardline Policy"] </F>
  [Text] The Super 301 provision of the U.S. Omnibus Trade 
Act is just like a "sacred sword" which will never be used. If 
the United States invokes sanctions, such as imposing high 
tariffs on selected goods, in line with the Super 301 provision, 
it will face international criticism. Moreover, U.S. consumers 
will suffer damages from the difficulties in importing goods 
subject to sanctions. 
  An event in the Japan-U.S. construction talks proves that it 
is not easy for Washington to invoke sanctions. During the 
talks, the United States began to take the steps necessary to 
impose sanctions, but it twice postponed the implementation of 
sanctions. It eventually did not invoke sanctions because an 
agreement was reached with Japan in January. 
  In short, the Super 301 provision is a tool to obtain 
concessions from a trading partner by threatening sanctions. A 
nation such as Japan, which is still on the threshold of 
"adulthood," is not immune to such trade tactics. We can see 
the evidence in the recent cellular phone talks. 
  The "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade 
Barriers" released by the Office of the U.S. Trade 
Representative [USTR] is one such tactic. Although it is a 
regular annual report, this year's edition focuses its attention 
on Japan, a nation with a huge trade surplus. The report 
stresses Japan's uniqueness, in referring to the stalled 
Japan-U.S. framework trade talks. It notes that the USTR will 
specify the market sectors that are subject to the application 
of the Super 301 provision unless improvements are made within 
six months. 
  We know that the current U.S. domestic situation has forced 
the Clinton administration to adopt a hardline strategy on 
trade. While calming down Congress, where there are many who 
take a tough stand toward Japan, the administration has to 
secure the support of labor unions to prepare for an off-year 
election in November. The opening of Japanese markets will be 
necessary for the United States to boost its exports and to 
maintain the growth of its economy. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. hardline tactics are not only 
unfavorable but also dangerous. 
  Although U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor evaluated 
highly the U.S. strategy in negotiations with Japan over 
cellular phones by saying that it would set a good precedent for 
future negotiations, the president of Japan Motorola expressed 
regret. He said: "The image of our company has suffered 
(because of our many demands in the cellular phone 
negotiations). It was a mistake." 
  President Clinton should listen to what he has said. Even if 
the United States assumes by any means an advantageous position 
in negotiations, deals with Japan will not necessarily be 
smooth. Not only Japan but also other Asian countries have 
deepened their distrust of the United States for its selfish 
trade tactics. 
  What worries us more is the possibility that the United 
States' threatening to impose sanctions will develop into a 
trade war between Japan and the United States. If a trade war 
occurs, it will become a drag on the world economy, which is 
still in the doldrums. 
  Following the issuing of the trade report, Washington has 
reportedly been considering taking hardline steps in some 
sectors as early as the end of April. While refusing to resume 
the framework trade talks, the United States is considering 
taking hardline steps. The nation lacks a broad view and is 
concentrating more on domestic issues. We hope that the United 
States will change this attitude. 
  The great trade imbalance between Japan and the United 
States 
stems from the cyclical factor of different economic trends, as 
well as from structural factors. While Japanese products enter 
the United States, which is a nation of overconsumption, 
regulations and business practices that bar foreign products 
from entering this country have taken root in Japan, which is a 
nation of excessive savings. 
  President Clinton once said the United States was to blame 
for most of its trade deficits. Both Japan and the United 
States need to make efforts to rectify the trade imbalance. 
  It seems that the Clinton administration thinks that 
although 
Washington has struggled to reduce its budget deficits by 
implementing such measures as unpopular tax hikes, Tokyo's 
efforts are lacking. This assertion is understandable, but it 
is also true that Washington has not carried out its task of 
increasing savings. 
  The tasks to be undertaken by Japan have been discussed many 
times. For the moment, it should work to formulate effective 
economy-boosting and market-opening measures by the end of June. 
Japan must take bold actions to ease trade frictions with the 
United States.

  [Text] The government has started preparing a written 
refutation of the U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Office's 
"National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers," 
which was released late last month. The Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] thinks that "the 
unilateral report has been compiled based on false premises." 
The refutation will be formulated as a report and will be sent 
to the U.S. Government as early as mid-April. It will convey 
Tokyo's position at every level of upcoming bilateral 
negotiations. 
  In the report on trade barriers, the USTR listed 43 items 
deemed to be Japan's "trade barriers," and, in a follow-up news 
conference, USTR Counsel General Ira Shapiro stressed that 
"Japan's trade barriers are extremely numerous compared to those 
of the seven advanced nations." 
  In reaction, the government criticized the U.S. report, 
noting that "the definition of `trade barriers' is unclear and 
the report has been written based on the wishes of U.S. 
industrial circles" (as stated by MITI). Moreover, the 
government said that individual trade barriers are "based on 
false premises." As for government procurement of medical and 
telecommunications equipment, which has been newly added to the 
trade barriers list, the government noted that the "U.S. request 
concerning this sector has already been incorporated into our 
economic reform guidelines." The government intends to convey 
the aforementioned points to the United States.

  [Text] A senior Foreign Ministry official said on 5 April 
that in connection with the DPRK's suspected nuclear weapons 
development, Japan and the United States might discuss the issue 
of concluding an "acquisition and cross-servicing agreement 
(ACSA)" during U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's stay in 
Japan, which is scheduled to begin from 19 April. If the ACSA 
is signed, Japan can provide fuel and services to the U.S. 
forces. 
  It is expected that if economic sanctions are imposed 
against 
North Korea, Japan will be asked to supply fuel to the U.S. 
warships participating in naval blockade. The United States has 
long been asking Japan to sign the ACSA. Meanwhile, as tension 
has mounted on the Korean peninsula, opinion has prevailed 
within government offices, such as the Foreign Ministry, that a 
rear-echelon support system should be established immediately. 
  The government will seriously consider the conclusion of the 
ACSA if the United States renews its request. However, the same 
Foreign Ministry official said: "Discussions within the 
government will not be smooth."

  [Text] Ishikawa -- At a news conference on the morning of 
6 April, Ishikawa City Mayor Takashi Hirakawa issued a statement 
protesting the crash of a U.S. Air Force F-15 fighter. He 
stated: "A jet belonging to the U.S. Kadena Air Base crashed 
during exercises into the Miyamori Elementary School in Ishikawa 
City 35 years ago. The accident killed 17 people, including 11 
school children, and injured 121. Having experienced a tragic 
accident in the past, we cannot look on the latest crash 
nonchalantly. We will file a strong protest against the U.S. 
forces and the Japanese Government, and will strongly demand 
they take carefully thought-out measures to prevent similar 
accidents." The Ishikawa City Government intends to send 
letters of protest about the accident to ten officials, 
including the prime minister, the ambassador to the United 
States, the airbase commander, and the prefectural governor.

  [Text] Tokyo -- On the evening of 5 April, Kosei 
Oyadomari, mayor of Naha City in Okinawa, visited the Foreign 
Ministry together with Kosuke Uehara, director general of the 
Okinawa Development Agency. There, they met with Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata and asked the Foreign Ministry to make 
efforts for an early return of Naha port facilities (Naha 
Military Port). Oyadomari said: "To attain the goal, which is 
included in the third Okinawa development program, of attracting 
5 million tourists to Okinawa, it is necessary to improve port 
facilities." 
  Hata showed his understanding of the purpose of the request. 
However, referring to the Japan-U.S. security pact, he said: 
"The government needs to look for an appropriate site where the 
functions of the port will be moved. While taking this into 
consideration, we will study measures." 
  Oyadomari said: "The return of Naha Military Port was agreed 
upon at a Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting in 1974 on 
condition that the Japanese Government provides a site where the 
functions of the port will be moved. But regrettably, this 
agreement has not yet been carried out." Noting that Okinawa 
heavily depends on revenue from tourism, Oyadomari also said: 
"In the third development program, Okinawa has set the goal of 
attracting 5 million tourists to Okinawa by enhancing its 
industrial economy. But this goal will not be attained unless 
the port facilities are improved. I hope the port will be 
returned as early as possible." 
  Director General Uehara, who also attended the meeting, 
said: 
"The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee needs to discuss specific 
measures (for the return of the port) at an early date. I think 
the people in mainland will also welcome the return of military 
bases on Okinawa, particularly Naha Military Port." Uehara then 
asked Hata to visit Okinawa.

<F P=106> [Article by Ryoichi Hatta, Industrial News Department, </F>
second in the series: "Field Report on Market Opening"; this 
one entitled: "Flat-Glass: Wholesaling and Engineering Form Two 
Major Barriers"] 
  [Text] "I represent the controversial Guardian Industries." 
  "What do you really want?" 
<H5>  Reaction to Political Pressure </H5>
  President Iwao Matsumoto of Matsumoto Avante (head office in 
Toshima Ward, Tokyo), a major primary wholesaler of flat glass, 
could not help raising his voice when talking to the Japanese 
representative of the U.S. glassmaker, Guardian Industries. 
According to Matsumoto, the Guardian representative, in an 
effort to enter into new deals with Matsumoto Avante, started 
with a long lecture on the closed nature of the Japanese market. 
Arguments and counterarguments were exchanged with Matsumoto, 
and in the end, "we did not even talk business." 
  Matsumoto Avante does not reject transactions with foreign 
manufacturers. Two years ago it started importing products from 
major U.S. company PPG through PPG-CI (head office in Minato 
Ward, Tokyo), a glass marketing joint venture between PPG and 
Itochu Corporation. 
  However, Matsumoto is very critical of the Guardian method 
of 
taking advantage of political pressure. Guardian Industries, 
whose vice president Ralph Gerson clamored for "the opening of 
the closed Japanese market," is quite notorious among glass 
dealers. However, surprisingly few wholesalers have actually 
had any contact with Guardian until recently. 
  The president of a leading dealer said: "We have known about 
that company for years, but it was only last January that a 
salesman actually came." 
  The share of foreign makers in the Japanese flat-glass 
market 
is 4 percent. The U.S. Government has consistently charged that 
Asahi Glass Company, Ltd., Nippon Flat Glass Company Ltd., and 
Central Glass Company Ltd. have organized the nearly 400 glass 
wholesalers throughout Japan into their respective "keiretsu," 
and that this forms the greatest barrier to foreign 
participation. 
  However, Yu Maeyoshi, president of PPG-CI, who operates in 
the marketing front line, claims: "There are practically no 
physical barriers. Psychological barriers may exist, the result 
of many years of business ties." 
  The delivery systems of foreign companies are also 
inadequate. 
  A glass dealer said: "Japanese makers take no more than two 
days to deliver, but foreign products take as long as 40 days." 
In Japan, where small lot deliveries are the norm, the smallest 
lot dealers are able to order is one ton; but some foreign 
companies still insist on a minimum delivery of two tons. 
  As a matter of fact, it is true that tangible and intangible 
"pressure" restraining the business transactions of glass 
wholesalers did exist, as Asahi Glass managing director Yasuhiko 
Furukawa admits. 
  He said: "About four years ago, a situation like the one the 
United States complains of did exist." 
<H5>  Limits of the Cozy, Symbiotic Relationship </H5>
  We obtained a copy of a document distributed to members of 
the National Federation of Flat-Glass Engineering Companies in 
March 1987. 
  The federation is a group of glass engineering contractors 
that buy glass from wholesalers and to use in subcontract work 
for general contractors. The title of the document is: "How To 
Deal With Requests From Clients To Use Imported Materials." 
This is a "manual" on "excluding foreign products" which cites 
11 reasons for refusing to use foreign glass products -- such 
as: 1) there is little variety in imported products, and it is 
difficult to complete an entire engineering project using 
imported products only; and 2) using imported materials 
simultaneously with Japanese products may undermine the 
relationship with Japanese makers. 
  Five years later, the federation distributed another notice 
negating the contents of the "manual." Meanwhile, Asahi Glass 
and other domestic makers have brought their manuals into line 
with the Antimonopoly Law. 
  Decision To Use Foreign Glass Not Implemented in the 
Field 
  The truth is, the Japanese system was not the object of U.S. 
criticism alone; Japanese makers themselves were also beginning 
to feel the limits of the traditional marketing method of 
relying on longstanding symbiotic relationships and presiding 
over a network of exclusive distributors. In the past, the 
accepted procedure had been to decide prices not when orders 
were placed, but after the general contractors had used the 
products in the maker-wholesaler-engineering firm-general 
contractor sequence of material flow. According to Asahi Glass, 
there were cases where a request for substantial discount would 
be made after the merchandise was delivered, resulting in "many 
instances of deficits." They decided last year, therefore, to 
fix prices at the time the merchandise is delivered to the 
customer. This is, of course, the norm in Western countries. 
  The makers have also lost the ability to spare manpower or 
money for the sake of maintaining a stable relationship with the 
wholesalers. The glass divisions of the big three Japanese 
makers are all suffering from a deficit. Rumors -- such as, 
"Company X is able to take care of only four of its 30 exclusive 
distributors in Tokyo" -- are rife among glass dealers. 
  Dealers who are outside the "keiretsu" organization are now 
seeking to build a relationship with foreign companies. The 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry recently published 
the results of its survey of more than 380 wholesalers. 
Compared to a similar survey conducted a year before, 11 
percent of dealers are now handling foreign glass products, 
which is twice the percentage in the previous poll. 
  Mitsubishi Corporation, which started doing business in 
foreign glass products last year in cooperation with major glass 
engineering and processing firm Yamada Shoten (head office in 
Minato Ward, Tokyo; president, Ryuichi Yamada), often receives 
telephone inquiries from wholesalers feeling insecure [about the 
existing marketing system] saying: "We would also like to deal 
in foreign glass products." 
  However, it would be premature to predict a rapid increase 
in 
foreign participation in proportion to ongoing changes. Even if 
the "keiretsu" formed by glass makers and wholesalers 
disintegrate, the solid relationship between general contractors 
and engineering firms remains intact. 
  In one case, Mitsubishi succeeded in obtaining the client's 
agreement to buy imported flat glass. However, the decision was 
overturned at the last minute. Apparently, the head of the 
general contractor's local office had to heed a request from the 
subcontracting engineering firm, with which he had a 
longstanding, friendly relationship. While the head offices of 
all the general contractors are saying, "we would very much like 
to use foreign products," this does not seem to apply in the 
field. 
  Even if all the barriers between the makers and wholesalers 
are removed, other barriers to foreign participation still 
exist. The debate between Guardian and Iwao Matsumoto may 
continue for some time.

  [Text] Next-Generation Communications Experiments 
Launched by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Company NTT in Kanto 
Region 
  Experiments to be launched in July at the Kansai Cultural 
Academy Research City will involve many companies and will be 
the first large-scale domestic test of the broad-band integrated 
system digital network known as B-ISDN. On the other hand, 
although of a small scale, NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Company] intends to proceed earlier with experiments of its 
next-generation communication system in the Kanto region. 
  In the spring of last year, it built an optical-fiber 
communication line between its Yokosuka Research and Development 
Center in Yokosuka city and its Musashino Research and 
Development Center in Mitaka city. 
  Both centers are equipped with numerous terminals including 
work stations linked to local area networks (LAN) which are each 
tied into the new communication lines via asynchronous 
transmission mode (ATM). 
  The system has the capacity to transmit and receive data at 
speeds of 2.4 gigabytes (with one gigabyte equalling 1 billion 
bytes) per second between Yokosuka and Musashino, equaling the 
basic transmission capabilities of a B-ISDN. 
  Further, a model house was built at a point about four 
kilometers away from the Yokosuka center and the two were linked 
with optical fiber cables. Although the same type of optical 
fiber cable was used, differences in the equipment installed at 
both ends will limit the transmission speed to 156 megabytes 
(with one megabyte equalling 1 million bytes) per second. This 
speed will equal the capacity built into B-ISDN subscriber lines. 
  In the future, the type of basic transmission line installed 
between Yokosuka and Musashino will crisscross the Japanese 
archipelago and telephone exchanges and offices and homes will 
be interconnected just like the Yokosuka center and the model 
house. The purpose of the experiments is to determine the 
practical uses of the system as well as the residual technical 
hurdles. 
  NTT has labeled the new services to be made available in the 
B-ISDN age with the acronym "VI&amp;P" from the title "Visual 
Intelligent and Personal Communications Services." As indicated 
by the title, the services visualize multimedia use in the home 
as well as commercial use such as high-speed computer 
communications. 
  Subscriber functions being tested relative to the model 
house 
include transmission of high-resolution images and simultaneous 
multiplex transmission of data. 
  High-resolution images are called super high definition 
(SHD) 
images which can be used without alteration for purposes such as 
computer graphics and fabrication of printing plates. They have 
the capacity to hold four times as much data as that prescribed 
for high-definition television broadcasting studios. It has been 
confirmed that static images can be transmitted at the rate of 
one per second without obvious compromise of quality as the 
result of compressed transmission. 
  Evaluations are being performed of applications for the 
system to include operation of electronic newspaper services 
entailing the transmission of newspaper page images to homes and 
the conduct of remote diagnostics based on transmissions of 
microscopic photographs of pathologic tissue. Consideration is 
being given to the conduct of experiments on the transmission of 
data between medical institutions. 
  It has already been confirmed in intra-research center tests 
that animated images compressed under criteria similar to 
international standards known as MPEG2 can be transmitted 
without deterioration at speeds of 625 megabytes per second. 
Sooner or later, transmission of such images will be tested on 
the optical fiber circuits. It is said that technical problems 
do not exist relative to the concept of receiving high-vision 
images when using television telephones. 
  The VI&amp;P Integrated Experimentation Section states that 
in 
the area of high-speed computer communications, "capabilities 
and stability factors relative to transmission functions are 
adequate." However, actual transmission tests at the speed of 
2.4 gigagbytes per second have not been conducted yet between 
Yokosuka and Musashino. Work has not been completed on 
installing equipment for interfacing between terminals and LAN 
or LAN and the high-speed transmission circuits, thus limiting 
transmission tests between terminals at speeds of 25 to 30 
megabytes per second. 
  Needless to say, this bottleneck can be eliminated when the 
interface issues are resolved, while considerably high 
transmission speeds have already been achieved even under 
current tests. Data on floppy disks used with wordprocessors and 
personal computers can be transmitted at the rate of 1.25 
megabyte (1 byte equals 8 bits) per second. A standard sheet of 
documentation handled routinely by businessmen can be 
transmitted in a short 0.4 seconds which is more than adequate 
of such purposes. 
  High-speed transmission of data is very useful in such work 
as computer-aided design work (CAD) done at work stations and 
for engineers to crunch massive numbers on super computers. Such 
requirements can probably be handled on the B-ISDN. 
  Now that a year has passed since commencement of 
experiments, 
officials in charge of the VI&amp;P Integrated Experiment Section 
express the frank sentiment that, "They would like to expand the 
application for the proposed system." It may be appealing to 
transmit super high-resolution images and a floppy at 
instantaneous speeds, but the question arises as to whether 
there would be any demand of such capabilities alone. 
  VI&amp;P experiments conducted by NTT represent forerunners 
of 
the technical phase of tests to be performed at the Kansai 
Cultural Academic City. Trials and errors to produce concepts 
for new types of commercial services represent a major project 
for the future.

  [Text] INTEC will be mutually linked through packet 
switching networks operated by Sprint International, the 
international division of Sprint, a U.S. long-distance telephone 
company. Linkage of networks of the two companies will provide 
for an integrated system offering international data 
communications services. They will offer improved services 
encompassing an expansion of service areas and increased 
sophistication in services offered. 
  INTEC and Sprint signed an "International Communications 
Mutual Linkage Contract." Based on this contract, INTEC's packet 
switching net known as "Ace Telenet" will link up with and use 
the "Sprint Net Service"--operated by Japan Sprint, Sprint 
International's Japanese subsidiary--as a gateway. This 
arrangement will enable INTEC to provide services without 
changing its status as a domestic special class II operator. 
  INTEC's service area will expand to over 40 countries. 
Currently, it services 10 countries, including the United 
States, Great Britain and Southeast Asia, but the service areas 
will be expanded geographically to include Australia, South 
America, the European continent and the former Soviet republics. 
  Services offered will be expanded from the current rate 
system based on volume of usage to fixed rate systems and rates 
for circuit use which bypasses Japan. Companies with branches in 
multiple overseas locations can utilize a variety of services 
with options covering such aspects as purpose, data volume, 
optimum linkage times as well as arrange direct communication 
links between their overseas branches and billing and settlement 
of service fees on a consolidated basis via their Japan 
headquarters. 
  INTEC is scheduled to initiate the new services effective 
the 
first part of April. It claims that its fees will be 10 to 30 
percent lower than those of other long-distance service 
companies.

<F P=106> [Interview between Nomura Securities President Hideo </F>
Sakamaki and NIKKEI KINYU securities division reporter Akira 
Suzuki; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Prospects for profitability on the part of 
securities firms have brightened, stock prices are gradually 
recovering, and the four leading securities firms will show 
recurring profits for the fiscal year ending in March 1994 for 
the first time in three years. On the other hand, the operating 
environment does not permit optimism in view of the decontrol of 
brokerage fees for high-volume transactions beginning in April 
of this year and the establishment of securities subsidiaries by 
city banks between July and November. We asked top officials of 
the leading securities firms for their management strategies to 
be used in operating their firms during this difficult period. 
  [Suzuki] We understand that a specific numerical target was 
set for the first time at your department and branch managers 
conference for a return on equity of 3 percent. 
  [Sakamaki] In my first three years as president I have 
placed 
importance on systems in terms of building a foundation. In the 
next three years, I will look for improvements in not only 
systems but in results as well. Establishment of specific goals 
will clearly define the direction in which we wish to head. A 
return on equity of 3 percent represents the average for 
companies whose stocks are listed on the exchanges, but we have 
a need to reach 100 billion yen in recurring profits. In the 
year ending March 1993, just over 10 firms attained recurring 
profits of 100 billion yen, but I do feel it is a reachable goal. 
  [Suzuki] I understand you'll be implementing new managerial 
accounting and personnel systems. 
  [Sakamaki] We can summarize a company president's work into 
accounting and personnel. The current personnel system was made 
over 20 years ago in 1970 and now contains a number of revisions 
which make it look like extensive patchwork. We must now modify 
the system so that recognition is given for productivity. The 
reason is that we face foreign securities firms' competition 
immediately next door. 
  [Suzuki] The past several years have witnessed criticism 
that 
Nomura has not fulfilled its role as the industry leader. 
  [Sakamaki] As an example, I do not believe that leadership 
consists of Nomura engaging in major stock transactions to be 
participated in by other securities firms. Rather, I believe 
leadership consists of Nomura, including its Nomura Research 
Institute, actively engaging itself in the development of new 
products and improvement of market features such as tax reform 
relative to securities. Development of new products does involve 
considerable cost, but it is a fact that we have contributed to 
the industry as a whole in this respect. 
  [Suzuki] What sort of retail strategy have you prepared for 
the new fiscal year? 
  [Sakamaki] We would like to beef up our research services in 
their second year and emphasize investments in securities on a 
scheduled [cost averaging] basis. Such accounts could easily 
total 3 million for the industry as a whole. Since we are seeing 
increasing volumes of financial instruments that pay only 1 
percent in net return, there is greater appeal for investments 
in stocks of companies whose future prospects are improving. 
This year will witness a resumption of secondary offerings and 
an increase in initial public offerings. I think we will see 
increased liquidation of interlocking stock ownership. The next 
three to five years will require extraordinary efforts on the 
part of the industry to raise the ownership of stock by private 
individuals as a means to absorb stock made available through 
such liquidation. 
  [Suzuki] What sort of strategy do you envision for overseas 
operations? 
  [Sakamaki] The total valuation of stocks listed on the Tokyo 
Stock Exchange when I was hired by Nomura was about 2 trillion 
yen. We now have other Asian markets operating on a similar 
scale. Asia is now ripe for both human resource and capital 
investments. U.S. firms have clearly assumed a policy of 
establishing local subsidiaries. Our American subsidiaries 
employ 900 of which only 5 percent are Japanese. Our European 
subsidiaries have not been localized as much as our U.S. 
subsidiaries but our basic policy consists of localization of 
human resources and horizontal integration. 
  [Suzuki] I assume you will cooperate in aid to Sanyo 
Securities and assist in its secondary offerings? 
  [Sakamaki] Although Sanyo is not affiliated with Nomura, we 
have collaborated in the request for aid after obtaining 
confirmation of separate actions in the reconstruction of its 
nonbank element and the parent Sanyo. We will expeditiously 
determine that there are no financial problems and underwrite 
the stock offering. In any event, we hope that Sanyo will make 
quick progress towards recovery through self-help efforts. 
  [Suzuki] What will be the effects of establishing securities 
subsidiaries by city banks? 
  [Sakamaki] I believe it will become a case where the city 
banks encroached upon territory they considered greener 
pastures, but will find that they were in reality pastures 
remaining in decay forever, resulting in bad times for both 
banking and securities industries. We will engage in competition 
when appropriate, but as a special member of the Securities 
Dealers Association of Japan, we would like to see city bank 
securities subsidiaries cooperate with other securities firms in 
playing a confrontational role against parent banks in expanding 
direct financial markets. 
  President Sakamaki looks back at the past three years and 
comments, "It was a period for changing the cultural aspects and 
building a new foundation for the company." If one is to 
consider his tenure of six years, he must use the next three 
years in building a new Nomura Securities on top of the 
foundation just built. The past several years have witnessed 
many accusations of "Nomura being a sleeping lion," and there 
were times when dissatisfaction was expressed by the younger 
company employees and former senior officials of the firm 
relative to its operations. (Future installments will be carried 
in General Financial News section.) 
  One board member comments, "It would be normal to feel some 
doubt about one's management policies if he heard so much 
criticism, but Mr. Sakamaki was not affected in any way." 
  A relief pitcher, suddenly designated as such just when the 
bases are loaded with no outs, endeavors to minimize errors and 
confidently begins pitching straight balls. President Sakamaki 
states, "Nomura has not increased its net worth since I became 
president. It's about time that we started making investments 
for the future." There is a feeling that we will see the return 
of a strong Nomura.

  [Text] Ministry of Finance (MOF) Implements System 
for Monitoring Observance of Firewalls to Include Hearings 
  The MOF has implemented a system for monitoring compliance 
with regulations or firewalls concerning the separation of 
businesses conducted by banks and their securities subsidiaries. 
As a first salvo in operating its surveillance operations, the 
MOF summoned department heads in charge of underwriting services 
at Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi and initiated a hearing on 
activities of bank-affiliated securities firms and their 
overseas subsidiaries and will seek the views of Nomura 
Securities within the week. MOF has revealed that it will 
appoint officials in the early part of this month who will be 
responsible for checking on the adequacy of measures being used 
to prevent abuses from taking place between banks' securities 
subsidiaries and their parent banks. 
  The foremost purpose of the new system is to uncover 
violations of Section 65 of the Securities Transaction Law which 
prohibits the performance of securities businesses on the part 
of banks, but it is said that the MOF is interested in whether 
or not prices which favor businesses were established in the 
process of issuing new bonds. 
  Officials of the General Affairs Section Securities Bureau 
who are commonly referred to as "watchmen" say, "Before 
officially approving securities subsidiaries of city banks, we 
will gather information on the involvement of parent banks in 
the operation of overseas securities subsidiaries."

  [Text] Prime Candidate for BOJ Governor Matsushita 
Has Created Ripples in Financial Industry Circles, But Hope Is 
Placed on Government and Private Industry Background 
  Now that a decision has been made to appoint Japan 
Export-Import Bank President Mitsuhide Yamaguchi as the next 
Chairman of the Board of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, negotiations 
are progressing on the appointment of Sakura Bank Chairman Yasuo 
Matsushita as the primary candidate to succeed Bank of Japan 
[BOJ] Governor Yasushi Mieno when the latter's tenure expires at 
the end of the year. If Matsushita is appointed to the BOJ 
position, although he was a former career official of the 
Ministry of Finance including service as a vice minister, he 
will be the first governor with private banking industry 
experience since Governor Jun Usami who served with the BOJ from 
1964 to 1969 after an earlier career with the Mitsubishi Bank. 
News of the strong potential for appointment of a governor with 
a "private industry background" has already caused ripples in 
financial circles. 
  Officials of the leading city banks worry that, "Perhaps the 
appointment of a BOJ governor with private banking industry 
experience when the condition of banks has weakened will pose 
difficulties." Governor Usami who had gone to work for the BOJ 
after serving as president of the Mitsubishi Bank won fame for 
his actions in implementing a special BOJ loan and resolving the 
difficulties of Yamaichi Securities in coordination with Prime 
Minister Kakuei Tanaka during the securities market panic of 
1965. 
  The current situation is similar in that we face a financial 
recession following the collapse of the bubble, but the foremost 
difference is that the recession is not limited to the 
securities firms but encompasses the structural weakening of 
banks. Government aid in the 1965 recession was limited to the 
securities firms, but the current recession is expected to 
require some form of aid for banks as well. There is the fear 
that "if the BOJ governor is one that has a private banking 
background, he may examine the banks with a prejudiced eye." On 
the other hand, it is a fact that hope is being placed on the 
appointment of a governor with solid experience in banking 
operations as reflected by some who say, "Mr. Matsushita has 
private banking experience as well as a career background with 
the Ministry of Finance. He's the best candidate for the 
position in terms of the coming age." 
  The Sakura Bank at which Mr. Matsushita serves as chairman 
has avoided the issuance of official comments noting that, "An 
official decision has not been made." However, other banks take 
the view that, "Sakura Bank is not in a position to celebrate 
the potential appointment on an unqualified basis." 
  Mr. Matsushita was appointed as president of the former 
Taiyo-Kobe Bank in 1987 and collaborated with current Sakura 
Bank President Kenichi Suematsu to complete a merger with the 
Mitsui Bank in 1990. From prior times, there was a history of 
coordinating roles played by former Ministry of Finance vice 
ministers between the former Taiyo and Kobe Banks. Even after 
the Sakura Bank was formed, Chairman Matsushita observed 
procedures whereby he would first coordinate with officials 
within the former Taiyo-Kobe Banks on important personnel 
actions and then consult with President Suematsu. Some banking 
officials take the position that departure of Mr. Matsushita who 
has provided strong support for the former Taiyo-Kobe banking 
system may "pose some difficulties for the Sakura Bank." 
  However, Sakura Bank officials stress that they have reached 
the final phase of the merger actions to include the integration 
of former Taiyo-Kobe and former Mitsui Bank personnel 
departments in June and that, "Even if Chairman Matsushita 
departs, we should have no problems." Even some rival banks take 
the view that, "The departure of a coordinating official will 
mean that parties concerned will cease to present parochial 
positions and former Taiyo and Kobe Bank elements will exercise 
a greater degree of solidarity." 
  Nine months remain before the appointment of the new BOJ 
governor and many obscure facets remain in the race for the next 
governor to include future political developments. The true 
sentiment in private banking circles appears to be that "We are 
not too sure that we can be positive about a BOJ Governor 
Matsushita."

  [Excerpt] BOJ Governor's Speech Encourages Financial 
Institutions To Effect Reforms by Strengthening Services Through 
Competition 
  In a speech delivered on the 24th [of March] in Tokyo, Bank 
of Japan [BOJ] Governor Mieno criticized the tendency of banks 
to copy each other by saying, "There is a pervasive tendency for 
banks to imitate each other, facilitating the spread of risk." 
Additionally, he appealed for the reform of financial services 
through the promotion of competitive actions by commenting, "One 
direction conceivable for the reform of financial systems would 
be maximum competition and creativity as well as checks and 
balances emanating from market forces." 
  In the beginning of his speech, he pointed out, 
"Strengthening of the financial systems are an important issue 
from the standpoint of Japanese economic growth." He expressed 
viewpoints as the Governor of the BOJ after citing as objectives 
of the reform of the financial system 1) promotion of 
competition, 2) controls based on market forces, and 3) 
improvements in the financial system's infrastructure. 
  Specifically, after saying, "As long as we treat financial 
services as an industry, we should encourage active innovation," 
he pointed out that innovative efforts were lagging by adding, 
"In contrast to the automotive and electrical equipment 
industries, financial innovation has consisted almost entirely 
of imported concepts." 
  As reasons, he cited the pervasive tendency to imitate each 
other and the lack of competitive ideas and stressed the need 
for a change in perception by stating, "The competitive strength 
of Japanese financial institutions will weaken unless they alter 
their practices so that they challenge themselves to provide new 
types of services and benefit from successful ventures or face 
the penalties imposed by unsuccessful ventures." 
  He then explained that in order to avoid a repeat of the 
bubble economy, we must preclude a drop in managements' morale 
by saying, "We have room for strengthening control through 
market functions such as supervision of managers based on 
changing stock prices in the securities markets and checks 
exercised by ordinary creditors and depositors." 
  Finally, in terms of appraising risks and returns for 
management as a whole, he stated, "There is a need to improve 
the infrastructure in the areas of accounting systems and 
information disclosure rules," and stressed the importance of 
improving the infrastructure for financial transactions by 
pointing out "the importance of improving settlement systems."

  [Excerpt] Federation of Bankers' Association of Japan 
President Okuda Responds to BOJ Governor's Criticism About 
"Imitating"--"Innovative Services Could Be Established If 
Controls Did Not Exist" 
  In response to BOJ Governor Mieno's criticism of financial 
institutions' tendencies to imitate each other, Federation of 
Bankers' Association of Japan President and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank 
President Masashi Okuda in a press conference on the 29th [of 
March] said, "Banks have exercised commensurate creativity 
amidst limited freedom under a variety of controls." President 
Okuda also pointed out that "If management's options are 
expanded by the decontrol of financial systems, competition 
should increase above previous levels and we should witness the 
creation of innovative services which are peculiar to Japan." 
  In his speech on the 24th [of March], Governor Mieno stated, 
"The reason why it is difficult for Japanese financial 
institutions to create financial innovations is that there is a 
relative lack of a tendency to utilize competitive market 
principles." When asked for his thoughts on this statement, 
President Okuda said, "Banks have been restricted by a variety 
of controls such as licensing systems from the standpoint of 
protection for depositors and maintenance of confidence and 
order," in pointing out that regulation by banking authorities 
prevented the creation of innovative services. Finally, he 
stated that the "industry would like to enhance the quality of 
financial services by challenging themselves to offer new 
services" through such actions as review of bank operations and 
decontrol of interest rates.

situation at a news conference held on 5 April. He stated: 
"The economic situation will soon hit bottom, then take a turn

  [Text] Reports of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
alleged "remark on his wish to resign" circulated immediately 
among the ruling coalition parties on the evening of 5 April, 
causing serious repercussions. 
  Since the reported remark came at a time when the schedule 
of 
the lower house Budget Committee's deliberation of the draft 
1994 budget remained undecided, some ruling party members were 
even suspicious of the prime minister's true intention. On the 
other hand, rumors are rife in both the ruling and opposition 
parties that if deliberations on the budget remain suspended, 
"the cabinet may be forced to resign en masse, or the lower 
house may be dissolved to give way to a general election." 
While ruling party members are generally negative about Diet 
dissolution because Diet deliberations are actually being 
stalled over the prime minister's personal problem, this 
"resignation remark" may serve to encourage the opinion that the 
cabinet should resign to take responsibility for failing to 
steer Diet affairs properly. 
  The ruling parties' reaction to the prime minister's remark 
was a mixture of perplexity and shock. The Prime Minister's 
Office was swamped with phone calls trying to confirm the 
reports on the evening of 5 April. Deputy Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Yukio Hatoyama was summoned in haste to the Prime 
Minister's Official Residence at midnight, and the secretaries 
concerned were also rushing in and out. In the early hours of 6 
April, the prime minister denied having made the "resignation 
remark." The government and the ruling parties then 
concentrated their efforts on informing all concerned that "the 
prime minister did not make the remark," and on restoring calm. 
  In the first place, when senior Social Democratic Party of 
Japan [SDPJ] officials heard about the reports on the 
"resignation remark," they pointed out, "That is inconceivable. 
The worst thing is for such reports to go out of control." 
Other SDPJ officials were evidently shocked. They said, "We 
are in for trouble from 6 April." 
  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] members expressed concern 
over the effect, saying "This is different from an ordinary 
joke; it may lead to a surprise outcome." 
  Since the prime minister is supposed to have made the remark 
during a dinner, most ruling party members said that "we do not 
think he was serious." Because the people he talked to were 
opposition upper house members, a senior Shinseito official 
said, "These are people the prime minister does not usually talk 
to, so we are not even sure how he talked to them." He doubted 
if there was actually any "resignation remark." 
  As the prime minister's alleged remark has already been made 
public, "the prime minister's authority" will surely suffer the 
more he and his aides deny such reports. Moreover, this 
unwittingly revealed the prime minister's lack of confidence 
over his Sagawa Kyubin affair. The Liberal Democratic Party is 
expected to intensify its efforts to "overthrow the cabinet." 
  The prime minister's alleged remark indeed came as a great 
surprise, whether or not he meant what he said. This 
"resignation remark" has surely become another explosive issue 
in his management of the political situation.

  [Text] The Japan New Party [JNP] decided on 4 April to 
call on Sakigake [Harbinger], Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
and the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan [DSP] for their 
cooperation to form a parliamentary group consisting of these 
four parties. It hopes to first carry out this plan in 
preparation for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to form 
a framework for unity among the ruling coalition parties, in 
view of the next general election. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa has proposed setting up a "policy 
study group," but a "freeze" has been placed on this plan due to 
opposition from the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and 
other parties. Therefore, the JNP hopes the four parties, which 
have many points in common regarding policies and other matters, 
can act as a catalyst in promoting moves toward unifying the 
ruling coalition parties. However, rough sailing is expected 
since not only is the SDPJ, which has been left out of the plan, 
reacting against it, but there is hardly any possibility that 
Sakigake, which already has formed a parliamentary group with 
the JNP, would accept the idea. 
  JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka and other JNP executive 
officials met with Prime Minister Hosokawa on 4 April. They 
informed him of their plan for the formation of a parliamentary 
group, and Hosokawa approved the idea. A senior JNP official 
explained: "As we have gained the understanding of Sakigake, 
which has opposed the planned formation of a policy study group, 
the four parties will come together first, and hopefully, the 
SDPJ and Komeito will join us in the future." 
  At a 29 March meeting, executive officials from the JNP, 
DSP, 
and Sakigake agreed on a plan to form a parliamentary group 
among the three parties. Later, however, the JNP decided to 
change its original plan to form a parliamentary group among the 
four parties because, among other reasons, the three-party group 
would not be able to become a nucleus of the ruling coalition 
alliance, since the total number of lower house seats these 
three parties currently hold would only add up to 74 -- the same 
as the number of lower house seats currently held by the SDPJ. 
  In reaction to such JNP moves, Sakigake has made critical 
comments. A senior party official said: "The merging of 
Sakigake and the JNP, which we have promised to the people, has 
precedence."

  [Text] On 8 March, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
introduced his proposal for an interparty policy study group 
involving all coalition parties. The proposal provoked friction 
among the coalition parties, and, in the end, Hosokawa had to 
drop it. Nevertheless, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa 
has again proposed an interparty "conference on basic policy 
issues" (tentative name). On 4 April, Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who has just returned 
from Europe, will join a coalition leaders' meeting to restart 
discussions on the interparty consultative body. Shinseito and 
Komeito are still eager for an early merger of all coalition 
parties, and the controversy is likely to again threaten the 
coalition government's unity. 
  It appears Hosokawa and Ozawa are impatiently seeking a 
coalition merger. Now that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
is intensifying its stance in urging the Hosokawa cabinet 
resign, these coalition leaders want to rehabilitate the 
multiparty coalition's unity, which was weakened after the 
enactment of the political reform legislations. Hereafter, the 
coalition government will have to grapple with such pending 
issues as tax reform and the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear weapons 
development program, and these controversies may trigger serious 
internal discord in the government. A senior Shinseito official 
said that, "if the coalition's framework is left as it is, each 
party may go its own way until the coalition breaks up." 
  Yet, the turmoil over Hosokawa's policy study group proposal 
clarified that Ozawa's real intention is to merge all coalition 
parties into one under his control. In this sense, proposals 
for the policy study group and the unified floor group were made 
to discourage the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and 
Sakigake [Harbinger] from opposing a coalition merger. 
Commenting on this, the senior Shinseito official said, "in 
fact, that was a tricky action." 
  However, every coalition party is aware that some sort of 
interparty tie-up is needed for the coalition government's 
survival after the next general election. The senior Shinseito 
official stressed "everybody knows the need for multiparty 
candidates or joint campaigns." At a coalition leaders meeting, 
even SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo acknowledged the need 
for selection of multiparty candidates. 
  Sakigake Secretary General Hiroyuki Sonoda insists joint 
election campaigns are possible without a coalition merger, 
saying: "Even under the new electoral system, it would be 
better to seek selection of multiparty candidates." However, 
Ichikawa stresses that a policy accord is an inevitable 
prerequisite for joint election campaigns, saying "interparty 
cooperation in election campaigns is impossible without 
narrowing policy gaps among parties." 
  Ichikawa explained the "basic policy issue council" is 
intended for "narrowing policy gaps" among election partners on 
security and defense affairs. But Shinseito intends to demand 
the SDPJ and other leftist groups review their political stances 
to pave the way for tie-ups in election campaigns. On the other 
hand, the SDPJ intends to separate policy debates from 
multiparty cooperation in elections. For the time being, 
coalition parties are likely to confront each other over the 
issue.

<F P=106> [Discussion between Yoshiaki Kobayashi, professor at Keio </F>
University; Takao Iwami, MAINICHI SHIMBUN special editorial 
staff member; and Yasuhiro Tase, NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN editorial 
staff member; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Iwami] The first act of political realignment 
began with the establishment of a coalition government last 
summer; now the second act has begun. The commonality between 
the two is that the coalition is on the offensive and the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is entirely on the defensive. 
However, there is also a decisive difference between the two 
acts. In the first act, the coalition reaped the fruits of 
capturing power; in the second, it is trying to alter those 
fruits. In that sense, although the coalition parties are on 
the offensive, their unity is on the decline and they will have 
considerable difficulty in conducting state affairs. 
  The Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichi Ichikawa, leaders of 
Shinseito and Komeito] lineup continues to pursue a positive, 
aggressive strategy; Hosokawa seems to be taking part in it, 
thus accelerating the political tempo. The confrontation with 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura will be the first step. In the 
end the Ichi-Ichi lineup, in alliance with Hosokawa, might go so 
far as to form a new new party [shin shinto]. 
  [Kobayashi] Until the election last year, Hosokawa, 
Takemura, and Ozawa had all been advocates of a two-party 
system. However, the substance was different: The Ichi-Ichi 
lineup had favored a two-party system comprising the LDP and a 
new conservative party; Hosokawa-Takemura had favored a union of 
Shinseito and Komeito as well as a union of the Japan New Party 
[JNP] and Sakigake, and had wanted the LDP and the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to join either of the two 
unions. However, since becoming prime minister Hosokawa has 
shifted his stance to the Ichi-Ichi lineup. Therefore, it has 
become impossible for Takemura to take the initiative. 
  Shinseito and Komeito want to be the ruling parties again. 
There are two conditions for this: One is that the LDP should 
not have a one-party majority in the next general election, and 
the other is that there should not be a coalition government 
comprising the LDP and other parties. For this purpose, the 
current coalition parties must unite under the single seat 
constituency system as much as possible. As things stand, there 
is a possibility that a tripolar structure will come into being: 
a group comprising Shinseito, Komeito, and part of the JNP; a 
group comprising Sakigake, the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist 
Party [DSP], and part of the JNP; and the LDP. Then there is a 
possibility that a coalition government consisting of the LDP 
plus a Sakigake union will come into being. This is what the 
Ichi-Ichi lineup dreads the most. 
  Added to this, there is the problem of candidate 
adjustments. 
There is an 11-member single-seat constituency district for 14 
incumbent coalition members, so some incumbents will have to 
change to the proportional representation system. However, even 
if elections are held on the basis of "the candidates of party A 
for the single-seat constituency system and the candidates of 
party B for the proportional representation system," there is no 
knowing how many votes for party A of the single-seat 
constituency system will go to party B of the proportional 
representation system. Under certain circumstances, candidates 
who have changed over to the proportional representation system 
will end in grief. Then a new new party will surely be 
preferable. 
<H5>  The Rupture of the Hosokawa-Takemura Combination </H5>
  [Tase] The biporlarization of the coalition parties now in 
progress comes not so much from confrontation due to the 
difference of lines and policies as from emotional 
confrontation--in effect, a power struggle. Hosokawa's 
character has a lot to do with that. Hosokawa is the type who 
severs connections with his close friends in an instant. There 
is no knowing how long Hosokawa's honeymoon with the Ichi-Ichi 
combination will last. 
  Therefore, since the political situation will progress for 
the time being based on individual emotions, it is impossible to 
determine what will happen in the future. 
  However, it is now impossible to repair the rupture in 
relations between Hosokawa and Takemura. We may take this as an 
established fact. 
  [Iwami] The Ichi-Ichi lineup wants to discard Takemura as 
soon as possible. That policy was decided on much earlier. The 
decision was made when the national welfare tax caused trouble; 
it may even have been made prior to that. 
  Tase's indication that there exists an emotional 
confrontation is certainly true, but the confrontation between 
the two men is rooted in their differences as regards political 
ideas and methods. We did not know what Hosokawa would do in 
this connection, but that has become clear now. Hosokawa will 
go along with the Ichi-Ichi lineup. 
  [Tase] However, his move is not a calculated one. If you 
say that is the characteristic of a lord, that is the end of it; 
but nobody knows his "outlook on the state" or his "line." What 
Ozawa is going to do and what Hosokawa has said are 
contradictory. Concerning the election system, Hosokawa has been 
advocating the medium-constituency plural ballot system, has he 
not? 
  Strictly speaking, he may have no principles. 
  [Iwami] Anyway, the tripolar structure has been consolidated 
in nine out of 10 cases. Concerning the new new party advocated 
by the Ichi-Ichi lineup, Secretary General Ichikawa has begun 
saying Hosokawa will be its president. If we tentatively call 
it the Hosokawa party, it is likely the Takamura party will come 
into being. The Kono party will also remain. The next election 
will be contested by these three parties. 
  [Kobayashi] Contrary to expectation, the Kono party may have 
few dropouts. Since the number of small electoral districts has 
been increased to 300, the Kono party's surplus Diet members 
have considerably decreased in number. 
  The problem is the Takemura party. Since this party will 
unite as an anti-Hosokawa party, it will include not only those 
members of the SDPJ who have considerable inclination toward the 
left, but also Sakigake members who have considerable 
inclination toward the LDP. If the Takemura party is challenged 
to policy discussions by the opposing parties, to what extent 
can it keep itself united? 
  [Iwami] However, the SDPJ, the JNP, and all the other 
parties are going to split. The Takemura party will establish 
its own ideals and will somehow survive, even if its union is 
far from perfect. Takemura is trying to differentiate himself 
from Ozawa by publishing a book in opposition to Ozawa's. It is 
the LDP that is uncertain, and it may not be able to 
differentiate itself from the Takemura party. 
  [Kobayashi] Another point is what kind of move will be made 
by the Diet members of the Japan New Party. There are some 
individual electoral districts in which the Japan New Party will 
have to compete with Sakigake. These districts will be captured 
by the Hosokawa party. Conversely, Sakigake will have to 
compete with Shinseito in some districts, and these districts 
may be captured by the Takemura party. 
  [Tase] There is no knowing what Representative Secretary 
Sonoda will do. 
  [Iwami] That being the case, in principle the Hosokawa party 
will try to win Diet members to its side one by one. The 
problem is the left faction of the SDPJ. During his address in 
Nagoya, Takemura extended his tolerance limit so as to embrace 
Gotoda and Yokomichi. Even the Hosokawa party is capable of 
embracing Michio Watanabe and Tomiichi Murayama. The party can 
try to bring members to its side one by one. 
  [Tase] Any combination is possible depending upon the 
manner of adjustment of the ruling parties' candidates; the 
formulation of doctrines can wait. 
  [Kobayashi] There is little possibility of there being 
policy disputes. In the U.S. House and Senate elections, there 
are few electoral districts where the policies of the Democratic 
and Republican candidates are different. In Japan, it is also 
unlikely that substantial differences will emerge no matter 
which side wins. 
<H5>  The Leftist Faction of the SDPJ Has No Place To Go </H5>
  [Iwami] However, this time the basic policies of each party 
will become more clear than those of the current coalition 
government, otherwise political realignment is meaningless. In 
that case, those who cannot follow will be excluded. It is 
unlikely the left faction of the SDPJ will join the new new 
party. Since it is highly ideological to advocate the 
principles of "a major power" or of "a small but brilliant 
country," peacekeeping operations may come to the surface again 
as one of the indices. Hosokawa's new party, or Ozawa, has a 
rather clear view on such operations. On the other hand, 
Takemura is against them, and Kono leans towards Takemura. 
  [Kobayashi] There are many Sakigake members within the 
Takemura party who can accept the left faction of the SDPJ, but 
DSP members will not. 
  [Iwami] Then the pure left faction of the SDPJ will have no 
place to go. It may pursue its own lines, but there are those 
in the left faction who are not strict about principles. 
  [Tase] There are still some active members in it. 
  [Iwami] Ozawa says there will be "two-party party and other 
parties," but I think there will be a three-party party and 
other parties. 
  [Kobayashi] In actual elections, both the LDP and Hosokawa 
party have firm support organizations. Who will conduct 
elections for the Takemura party? Sakigake aside, the SDPJ will 
have to depend on its left faction. 
  [Tase] According to opinion polls, Takemura enjoys 
considerable popularity. It is unthinkable that Hosokawa's 
approval rating will continue, but the popularity of Takemura 
may continue for a fairly long time among a public who are fed 
up with the high-handedness of the Ichi-Ichi lineup. Then 
Takemura will fare well in elections. 
  [Iwami] I am of the same opinion. 
  [Tase] Some say Takemura is the first Vulcanian [Vulcan is 
the god of fire and metalworking in Roman mythology] politician 
since Miki. 
  [Iwami] He has Vulcanian characteristics. I have a feeling 
he is a political type who is large in scale and whom we have 
not encountered for some time. There is something vague about 
Hosokawa, but Takemura is well-defined. He seems to be clear, 
fresh, and fit. However, being attacked from both sides by the 
Hosokawa and Kono parties, he will not attain enormous power. 
  What makes the matter complicated is that Kono and Takemura 
overlap. Therefore, those who are thinking of leaving the LDP 
find it difficult to say they are going to join the Takemura 
party because of the difference in ideas. The focal point of 
political realignment is how many members switch over to 
Hosokawa and Takemura from the LDP. As Kobayashi says, the 
number may be smaller than expected because the number of small 
electoral districts was increased to 300. 
  [Tase] There are already those who have been left out of 
selection in the adjustments to the fielding of candidates now 
being conducted by the LDP. Since such people are close to 
Takemura, they are watching his moves. 
  [Kobayashi] The question is: What are these people actually 
going to do? Are they going to join the Hosokawa party, or are 
they going to be independent? However, under this tripolar 
structure, the form of government after elections is generally 
clear: The coalition of the Takemura party and the Kono party 
is more likely than the coalition of Takemura and Hosokawa. 
  [Iwami] That is when each of the three parties is unable to 
hold a majority. 
  [Kobayashi] That is right. On the other hand, a coalition of 
the Kono party and the Hosokawa party will be very difficult. 
The Hosokawa party cannot afford to slip down to an opposition 
party in full knowledge of the situation; therefore I think it 
is likely that a chaotic situation will occur after all: The 
Hosokawa party will ultimately establish a coalition government 
again through union with not three, but five or six parties 
other than the Takemura party and the Kono party. 
  [Iwami] Only the Kono party and the Hosokawa party can put 
up candidates for all 300 electoral districts; the Takemura 
party will lag behind them. Then the question arises: Which 
one of the two will win? It is possible that one of the two 
will win a majority. Then there should be a one-party 
administration; otherwise, there will be a coalition government 
of the Kono party and the Takemura party, as Mr. Kobayashi says. 
  [Kobayashi] Therefore the division of electoral districts is 
important. Since Shinseito, the JNP, and Sakigake will compete 
especially hard in urban areas, the JNP will have to join either 
the Hosokawa party or the Takemura party, depending upon the 
method of division. The division of electoral districts itself 
is a power struggle. Will a report of the eighth Election 
System Council concerning the division of electoral districts be 
accepted, or will there be a different division? The method of 
division will decide the outcome of 40 out of 300 districts. 
  [Tase] The question is: Who in the ruling parties will take 
the initiative? 
  [Kobayashi] It will be easy for the ruling parties to make 
adjustments in the fielding of candidates if the ruling parties 
divide into the Hosokawa party and the Takemura party; 
otherwise, these two parties will have to compete throughout the 
urban areas. The objective is to bring the heads of local 
governments to one side. When 300 electoral districts are 
allocated, blank districts will inevitably come into being, 
where a big city becomes a small electoral district, as it is; 
therefore, victory or defeat is a matter of which camp the mayor 
belongs to -- whether he leans toward the Hosokawa party or the 
Takemura party. 
  [Iwami] However, the future trend will be decided by the 
rise and fall of the popularity of Hosokawa and Takemura. Is 
Hosokawa's popularity at its height now? 
<H5>  The Possibility of a Takemura Cabinet </H5>
  [Kobayashi] According to a survey conducted by Fuji TV's 
"Report 2001," 60 percent approved of Hosokawa and 30 percent 
disapproved of him. From the time the national welfare tax 
became troublesome, Hosokawa's disapproval rating has increased 
a little, while Takemura's strong point is that he has no 
enemies. 
  The LDP side may be relieved at the rupture in relations 
between Hosokawa and Takemura. If the two men are united, the 
LDP will have no good move to make. However, if they are 
divided, the LDP will have a good chance to form a coalition 
with the LDP as leader. 
  [Iwami] This is going to be the first election under the 
single-member constituency system. If the Hosokawa party holds 
the advantage in each electoral district, members of the LDP may 
switch to the Hosokawa party in avalanche-like fashion. 
  [Kobayashi] That is because the effects of election 
forecasts of the single-member constituency system are 
diametrically opposite those of the medium constituency system. 
Under the medium constituency system, those who were said to 
have an advantage over others often lost their elections. Under 
the single-member constituency system, however, the forecast 
that the chances that a candidate will succeed are 55:45 will 
shift immediately to 90:10. To the support groups and the 
influential people of the district, it does not matter which 
party wins. Since there is only one link between the district 
and the center, the support groups and the influential people 
will be "killed" if they back the wrong horse. 
  [Tase] The LDP has no good candidates now. If Takemura 
makes his attitude clear by parting with Hosokawa, a 
considerable number of people in the LDP will be willing to form 
a coalition with Takemura as prime minister. In that case, the 
Takemura party and the LDP will be united instantly, not in the 
form of Takemura party's returning to the LDP, but in the form 
of a coalition. 
  [Iwami] On the other hand, it is doubtful whether today's 
LDP has such centripetal force and mobility. 
  [Tase] Today's LDP is not what it used to be in that the 
only active members are young ones who were elected three times 
or less. The other day I talked to a young member who said: 
"Mr. Gotoda telephones me, asking: `What is going on?'" This 
was unthinkable in former times. Members who were elected seven 
times or more were still not given any information. Therefore, 
there is no knowing what will happen in the LDP. 
  As far as centripetal force is concerned, the Kono and Mori 
establishment is not functioning at all, which is not a 
surprise. The reason that the LDP seemed to have functioned well 
so far is that the Keiseikai, the largest faction, had run the 
whole thing through a kind of reign of terror. Now that the 
central force of the Keiseikai has disbanded and the Keiseikai 
is leaving the Sabokaikan Building, it is impossible for the LDP 
to have centripetal force. The president and the three key 
officials of the LDP are almost amateurish in their management 
of the party. Stranded in the stream of the times, the best they 
can do is dither. 
  I do not think that the chiefs of factions are giving 
gratuities to their faction members at year's end any more. 
Diet members are going Dutch at their parties. 
  [Iwami] The top-ranking leaders of the LDP used to rule 
through skillful factional maneuvering inside the party, but now 
that the factions are gone, they are at a loss what to do. They 
are in a state of weightlessness. I do not think that Kono will 
be able to find a new method of maneuvering, since there are 
neither responses nor clues. In that respect, we can say that 
the LDP is already in a state of dissolution. However, in the 
provinces, the local organizations of the LDP are still the 
strongest and the most massive. I think that the chairman of 
the prefectural assembly of every prefecture still belongs to 
the LDP. Therefore, the LDP is strong when it comes to 
elections. 
<H5>  The "Japan-U.S. Relationship" and the "Economy" Are the Key </H5>
Points 
  [Tase] To change the subject, if the Hosokawa administration 
were to collapse, that would be due to "the relationship between 
Japan and the United States" and "the economy." The recent 
rupture of the Hosokawa-Clinton talks is a serious matter. 
"Mature relationship," indeed! That is a fiasco of the 
administration. We should not make light of the United States. 
It is no use to have a conference by summoning officials in a 
hurry at this belated time. Unless the administration gives 
definite directions to the bureaucrats, the situation will 
deteriorate further. However, the Hosokawa administration does 
not have such leadership. The matter can never be solved 
Hosokawa-style -- "I have had them discussing the matter." 
  [Kobayashi] It is on Europe that the Hosokawa 
administration is placing its hopes. Japan thinks that Europe 
will side with it if it appeals to GATT. The Japanese 
Government seems to be hoping for Europe's help because the 
entry of U.S.-made products into Japan means a cut in the 
imports of European products that have entered until now. 
However, even if Japan's appeal to GATT is successful, Europe 
will enter into partnership with the United States thereafter. 
Europe and the United States comprise a community bound 
together by common interests regarding the opening of Japan's 
markets. The United States is exercising its political power to 
the full for the persuasion of European countries. Japan does 
not have enough power to compete with the international 
political power of the United States. 
  [Tase] The observation of the recent negotiations of the 
officials shows that the rupture occurred at the last moment. 
Such a situation existed many times in past negotiations 
between Japan and the United States. However, past negotiations 
had been narrowly saved through a top-down approach. The 
Hosokawa administration allowed the rupture to happen without 
trying to do anything to prevent it. Such an approach is 
impermissible even though Hosokawa is a novice at diplomacy. 
  [Kobayashi] It is the United Stats that gained the most due 
to the change of administration in Japan. The United States had 
been making concessions when Japan asked a question -- "Is it 
acceptable for Japan to be socialized?" -- which was raised when 
something happened to the one-party rule of the LDP. This time, 
however, there is no possibility of a socialist government, and 
if you do not like the Hosokawa administration, you can recall 
the government of the LDP. This is advantageous to the United 
States. The United States could not possibly make a concession 
to Japan owing to the circumstances surrounding the Clinton 
administration in the United States. However, the Hosokawa 
administration failed to reach a correct understanding of the 
situation. What was the current administration's understanding 
of the change of the U.S. ambassador to Japan from Armacost to 
Mondale? With the coming of Ambassador Mondale, the moves of 
the U.S. Embassy have become very political, have they not? 
  [Tase] That is because Mondale is a lawyer. His way of 
thinking is similar to that of a group of lawyers who work with 
Mickey Kantor as the group's axis. Rendering great service to 
their clients during their tenure of office is their way of 
doing things. However, Japanese politics is not ready to cope 
with the situation. It is natural for Japan and the United 
States to clash with each other because the Hosokawa 
administration lacks the ability to play the part which had been 
played by the former administration -- add two things and divide 
by two to get an average. 
  [Iwami] Takemura and others had been excluded from the inner 
circle of the Hosokawa administration, and this time there was 
no one around Hosokawa who could teach him the rudiments of 
summit diplomacy. 
  [Tase] The dispatch of special envoy Kiuchi was also a 
fiasco. The U.S. side was dumfounded because he visited the 
United States not to bring any new proposals but only to pay a 
courtesy call. 
  [Iwami] But the reports of the media were terrible. The 
next day's newspapers praised Hosokawa in chorus, saying "the 
age of the mature relationship between Japan and the United 
States has come." I could not believe my own eyes and said to 
myself, "What is the meaning of all of this?" 
  [Tase] I had been boarding together with the brains of the 
Clinton administration until yesterday. If Japan's perception 
of the situation is the same as theirs, it will lead to grave 
consequences. The brain trusters themselves do not think that 
the setting of numerical targets is a smart thing to do. 
However, they say that Japan should not have broken off the 
negotiations just because of that. 
  [Iwami] Japan's response was that the rupture of the 
negotiations was a great achievement on the part of Japan. 
  [Tase] The Hosokawa administration is like the Konoe 
cabinet, which refused to deal with the Nanking government. 
  At present Japan is producing an atmosphere in which people 
who attach great importance to good relations between Japan and 
the United States have to keep a somewhat low profile. They are 
being overwhelmed by the opinions which attach great importance 
to Asia. I think that this is really a dangerous omen. Despite 
that, however, Hosokawa is being evaluated highly. In short, he 
is not criticized, no matter how badly he manages national 
affairs. I can hardly understand that. 
  [Kobayashi] For one thing, the media also is responsible for 
that. With the establishment of the Hosokawa administration, 
discussions on election systems are conducted only within the 
framework of the heiretsu system. The media almost always 
refuses to carry articles which point out problems with the 
heiretsu system. Even monthly magazines refuse to carry articles 
critical of the system. 
  [Iwami] In the first place, it was a mistake for leaders of 
newspaper publishing companies to become members of government 
committees. 
  [Tase] Hosokawa is never criticized for the absence of 
measures to boost the economy. This is also strange. 
  [Kobayashi] Japan is a unique in that its government is 
rarely criticized for the country's recession. It was at the 
time of the oil shocks that a return to conservatism was 
advocated. There are two theories for that: one is that public 
opinion had it that only the LDP could solve the problem of 
recession; the other is the time- lag theory. This theory 
explains holds that consumers have a real sense that recession 
exists only after a certain period of time has elapsed. This is 
said to be the most likely reason. 
<H5>  "The Opinion That Hosokawa Is Not To Blame" Is Rampant </H5>
  [Tase] Which theory explains the current situation? 
  [Kobayashi] Neither theory can explain the current 
situation. Voters still have a great distrust of LDP government. 
It may be that such a level of misgovernment by Hosokawa is not 
enough to dispel that distrust. 
  [Tase] I have another idea. I think that the people believe 
that the bureaucrats, and not Hosokawa, are responsible for the 
recession. 
  [Iwami] It may be that Ozawa's consistent claim still has 
persuasive power: It is because of the misgovernemnt of the LDP 
that the current government cannot take drastic measures 
regarding Japan-U.S. relations and the recession. At first, the 
business community was opposed to Ozawa's claim that political 
reform should have priority over the budget, even if it is 
carried forward to the following year, but it approved his claim 
afterward. That persuasive power is still existent. In short, 
it says that government by the LDP is to blame and that the 
Hosokawa administration is trying to change that. Therefore, no 
matter what the Hosokawa administration does, it is no longer 
held responsible. 
  In weighing government by professionals against government 
by 
amateurs, public opinion still bets on government by amateurs. 
  [Kobayashi] The current administration has worsened the 
recession not by doing something about it, but by doing nothing 
about it. Since it does nothing, it is not held responsible. 
That is the way it looks. 
  [Tase] That is right. The downfall of a government due to 
policy occurs when it tries to implement something -- like 
Thatcher, who initiated a poll tax. The recent national welfare 
tax is a case in point. 
  [Iwami] The Hosokawa administration has been working out 
a barrage of policies. It is advocating themes one after 
another without pause. The Ichi-Ichi lineup is impatient, and 
it seems that Hosokawa himself is also very impatient. He may 
be obsessed that his administration will not last unless he 
works out policies one after another. There is a growing voice 
in Nagata-cho that the dissolution of the Diet will take place 
next year, but I have a feeling that he will decide on an early 
dissolution. As soon as a new new party is formed and electoral 
districts are decided on, there will be a dissolution. 
  [Kobayashi] I think that there may be an early dissolution, 
contrary to expectations. After the passage of a political 
reform bill, a rumor spread at once that the dissolution would 
be late. I think that was rather intentional. New political 
parties, like the Hosokawa party and the Takemura party, will 
have an advantage when elections are held immediately after the 
formation of parties. New parties will naturally be born when 
electoral districts are decided on. Then an early dissolution 
is quite possible. 
  [Iwami] The political situation will not be quiet for the 
time being. We must keep a constant eye on the political 
situation.

  [Text] Ho Chong-man, responsible vice chairman of the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan [Chongnyon], 
said he believes "DPRK (North Korean) President Kim Il-song has 
delegated full power -- political, economic, and military -- to 
Workers' Party of Korea Secretary Kim Chong-il." He made the 
remark in an address at a meeting of the Social Democratic Party 
of Japan's Japan-Korea Committee held at the First Dietmen's 
Hall on the morning of 5 April. 
  Vice Chairman Ho said he had talks with Secretary Kim 
Chong-il for about two hours when he visited North Korea from 15 
February to 1 March. Ho denied rumors that Kim had been 
seriously injured, saying "he was in excellent health."

<F P=106> [By correspondent Katsuhiro Kuroda] </F>
  [Text] Seoul, 6 Apr -- An informed source in Seoul 
revealed information on 6 April that he obtained from a Chinese 
military source in Beijing. According to the information, North 
Korea has recently redeployed some of its ground-to-ground 
missile units to target China. According to the information, 
DPRK border guards along the border between North Korea and 
China have recently fired upon North Koreans trying to flee to 
China, killing some Chinese, and Beijing has expressed its 
displeasure over the casualties. 
  The Chinese military source did not given details about 
which 
North Korean missile units have been redeployed to target China. 
According to a missile deployment chart in North Korea that 
SANKEI SHIMBUN obtained in Seoul, the launch pads for "Nodong"-1 
and "Daepodong"-1 missiles are deployed in eastern coastal areas 
while launch pads for other North Korean missiles are located in 
Chungkangjin (Chagang Province) near the North Korea-China 
border, Chulsan in western coastal areas (North Pyongan), and in 
Changsankon (South Hwanghae). 
  Scud-C missiles, with a range of 500 km, would not be able 
to 
hit Beijing if fired from those launch pads, but industrial 
areas in China's three northern provinces would be within their 
range. 
  Nodong-1 missiles with a range of more than 1,000 km are 
able 
to hit Beijing. 
  The Chinese military source expressed distrust of North 
Korea, saying, "like Vietnam, North Korea is unpredictable and 
we do not know for sure what it is going to do." 
  This comment shows that in military affairs, the Chinese 
military is placing more importance on the lessons it learned 
from the China-Vietnam war in the 1970's, when its forces 
suffered a bitter defeat, than on the Korean war in the 1950's 
which paved the way for the blood-tied relationship between 
North Korea and China. As a result China, though ostensibly 
friendly to North Korea, is guarding against the country. 
However, North Korea is believed to be far more distrustful of 
China than China is of North Korea. DPRK reporters have said 
repeatedly and publicly in Panmunjom: "We do not know what 
attitude China will take toward North Korea in the end. China 
is not a nation we can trust to the last." 
  North Korea is believed to be preparing for the time when 
its 
relations with China worsen in the light of what happened with 
the former Soviet Union, which played a key role in founding the 
Kim Il-song regime, but then abandoned Pyongyang when its 
domestic circumstances changed. 
  Commenting on the information that "North Korea has 
redeployed missiles to aim them at China," an informed source in 
Seoul said: "North Korea is deepening its international 
isolation and feeling a sense of crisis arising from this. 
North Korea's action represents `its resolve and determination' 
to maintain its system." 
  The same source also speculated that the recent North Korean 
action may be aimed primarily at using the military to solidify 
its system. 
  Leaders from both Japan and South Korea have visited Beijing 
in the hope of asking Chinese leaders to persuade North Korea to 
resolve the nuclear issue based on the friendly relations China 
is believed to maintain with North Korea. The information that 
"North Korea has redeployed missiles and targeted China" reveals 
North Korea's distrust of China. 
  Chinese leaders have frequently said, "China has a limited 
role to play on North Korea." This new information and that 
remark repeated by Chinese leaders are combining to grab 
attention.

  [Text] Dear Listeners: The Democratic Voice of Burma [DVB] 
inquired by telephone about the proposed peace talks today 
between the KNU [Karen National Union] and the SLORC [State Law 
and Order Restoration Council] as mentioned in today's BANGKOK 
POST with a KNU responsible official. The KNU official 
responded by saying the news is untrue. Moreover, the KNU 
Central Committee's seven-point announcement of 29 March 
included the following important factors concerning the 
negotiations. 
  Since the KNU wants genuine peace, it has vowed to begin the 
peace process given any opportunity. The KNU has already agreed 
to hold separate talks with the SLORC. The KNU also proposed 
the talks be held at a neutral place agreed upon by both parties 
in order to hold free and frank talks, but the SLORC has not yet 
given any reply. The announcement said current events have 
indicated that political problems cannot be solved politically. 
  The KNU also urged the three following points to various 
persons and organizations inside and outside the country. The 
KNU will continue its efforts to hold separate talks with the 
SLORC. It will also strive relentlessly to achieve a genuine 
and stable peace by solving political problems politically. And 
it will call a general congress of all political forces from 
among the populace and personnel and organizations from overseas 
in order to solve political problems politically. The KNU 
believes only then genuine and stable peace and democracy can be 
achieved nationwide.

  [Text] On the occasion of the official friendship visit to 
Vietnam by Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, the paper NHAN DAN 
on 7 April carried an editorial entitled: "Strengthen the 
Relations of Friendship and Cooperation Between Vietnam and 
Sweden." The editorial says: 
  The world economic crisis has caused numerous difficulties 
for the Swedish economy. As a result, the Swedish Government, 
headed by Prime Minister Carl Bildt after the 1991 election, has 
cut its development aid to foreign countries. However, it has 
increased aid to our nation and has become the country with the 
largest volume of non-refundable aid to Vietnam. 
  The Swedish Government and businessmen have highly appraised 
Vietnam's renovation process and hailed the achievements 
recorded by our country in this regard. Our Swedish friends 
have also expressed their wish to expand cooperation with 
Vietnam and enhance the fine relations between the two countries. 
  The official visit to Vietnam by Swedish Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt is a significant event in the Vietnam-Swedish relations 
and is in line with Vietnam's open door foreign policy. 
  The Vietnamese people warmly welcome the first visit to 
Vietnam by the Swedish Prime Minister and wish him splendid 
success. Indeed, the visit will contribute to strengthening the 
friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and Sweden, thereby 
meeting the aspiration and interest of the two peoples and 
strengthening peace, stability, and development in the region.

  [Text] The party organization of the Central Bloc for Mass 
Mobilization Work held its midterm party conference recently. 
Comrade Vu Oanh, member of the Communist Party of Vietnam 
Central Committee Political Bureau attended and addressed the 
conference. 
  During the past period, party committees of the bloc have 
closely coordinated with the party, the Fatherland Front 
Committee, and mass organizations to study and firmly grasp the 
resolutions of the Seventh National Party Congress and 
resolution No 8b of the party Central Committee Political Bureau 
on mass mobilization work. 
  The conference discussed the program of action aimed at 
renovating the organization and activities of the bloc. The 
conference urged various mass organizations to formulate plans 
to integrate and motivate the people's strata to implement the 
socioeconomic task and protect the people's interests. The 
conference also discussed the tasks and orientations of the 
party organization of the bloc for the remaining two years of 
its current term. 
  Addressing the conference, Comrade Vu Oanh commended the 
bloc 
party organization for its effective staff role in helping the 
party Central Committee and Secretariat to improve the mass 
mobilization work to suit the new situation. Comrade Vu Oanh 
disseminated the main contents of the Midterm National Party 
Conference resolution, especially the party concept on mass 
mobilization work in the new situation. He clearly stressed the 
position and duty of party organization echelons in implementing 
the renovation process; accelerating economic growth; 
strengthening social development and justice; opposing 
corruption, smuggling, and social vices; and foiling the 
peaceful evolution.

January Mid-Term Party National Conference Resolution] 
  [Text] The political report of the party Central Committee 
presented at the Mid-Term Party National Conference reviews the 
implementation of the Seventh National Party Congress [SNPC] 
resolution and the practical steps of the renovation in our 
country. In order to successfully implement the SNPC resolution 
and the renovation, the political report reviews prominent 
achievements, weaknesses, and shortcomings; presents general 
conclusions on opportunities and dangers; provides guidance on 
the directions for national construction in the new developing 
period; outlines some major lines and measures; and further 
concretizes the socialist direction. 
  I. Achievements and Weaknesses, Opportunities and Dangers 
  1. The political report presents three prominent 
achievements: 
  -- The great achievement of primary significance is the fact 
that we have succeeded in overcoming the socioeconomic crisis to 
a very important extent. 
  The following are its major manifestations: 
  Many stagnant and degrading fields have been overcome. The 
economic development rates have been fairly good and stable in 
the last three years. Inflation was limited to 5.2 percent in 
1993. Economic relations have been broadened in a diversified 
and multilateral manner and annual export volume has increased 
about 20 percent. 
  The economy began to have some internal savings. The 
multisectoral economic structure has been forming. The market- 
oriented mechanism under the state management in the socialist 
direction has become an operational structure for the national 
economy. 
  The settlement of social issues and the implementation of 
social policies have been given more attention. People's lives 
in many cities and rural areas have been improved. 
  -- The second important achievement is that political 
stability has been maintained and consolidated. 
  The party role has been strengthened. State management 
efficiency has been further upgraded. Democracy has broadened 
and it has scored significant developing steps in line with the 
construction of the law-governed state of the people, by the 
people, and for the people. National defense and security have 
been safeguarded. The people's confidence in the party, the 
state, and renovation has been increased. The public movements 
in the economic and social fields have obtained some developing 
steps. 
  -- The third achievement is that foreign relations have been 
broadened and our national reputation and position were 
enhanced, thus creating favorable international conditions for 
national construction and protection. 
  All three aforementioned achievements are very important and 
inter-related. The mention of economic achievement first is 
reasonable and suitable to our renovation line, which places 
economic renovation first and considers it a central task. The 
great economic achievements contributed to overcome the 
socioeconomic crisis in a very important step, stabilized our 
politics, broadened our external relations, and safeguarded our 
national defense and security. 
  2. Shortcomings and newly arising problems: 
  -- The economy still carries the characteristics of a 
backward agricultural economy with low productivity, quality, 
and efficiency. The industry is small with poor infrastructure. 
The ability to control inflation is not strong. The state-run 
economy and collective economy are slow in renovating and 
consolidating. And the market mechanism is in its preliminary 
stage and carrying many spontaneous elements. 
  -- The fields of culture and society have recorded some 
achievements, but there are a lot of pressing problems which 
remain unsolved: unemployment, social injustice, education, 
culture, arts, health care, and corruption and smuggling. 
  -- Political stability has been maintained, but complicated 
factors which must not be overlooked still exist. Many party 
and state organs have not been clean and strong. Some party 
members have become depraved politically and morally and 
loosened their vigilance and commitment in our chosen path. 
They remain unconcerned in the face of wrong viewpoints and 
sabotage activities by our enemies. Many party cadres and party 
members are still sluggish when it comes to self-education. 
They do not try to improve their character and understanding. 
Political stability is not totally stable, social order and 
safety are not safeguarded. 
  3. What are the opportunities and advantages? 
  The national conference unanimously agreed on fundamental 
advantages: 
  -- Our party has a correct line. The party is united and 
unanimous. Our people are industrious, intelligent, and 
patriotic. They are bravery, resolute, and confident in the 
party leadership. Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the 
people's revolutionary undertaking. 
  -- The achievements of the renovation mainly shown in the 
three aforementioned achievements are creating new stature and 
strength for us. 
  -- The development of the science technology revolution and 
the trend to broaden cooperation and development relations in 
the world and in the region are providing us with more important 
resources. 
  The current opportunities are from advantages, internal 
achievements, and external conditions but they are mainly 
created by our people. They do not come by themselves. We have 
to grasp opportunities to move the country forward.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of an interview with Interior Minister Chawalit </F>
Yongchaiyut by an unidentified correspondent; place, date not 
given] 
  [Text] Some people have described your performance as 
interior minister as poor. How do you respond to this 
assessment. 
  Our country has long been plagued with conflicts, political 
and otherwise. When I became interior minister, I tried to 
solve these conflicts peacefully. I tried to improve the 
efficiency of the agencies in charge of administration and 
security. Conflicts occurred when I tried to reform the Police 
Department. The reforms were implemented, however. As a 
result, the police are working harder and more efficiently in 
serving the public. Gambling dens have been suppressed and road 
check-points set up in an improved effort to keep law and order. 
  So how do you feel about continued criticism in spite 
of all your hard work. 
  It's normal and healthy for MPs to criticize me. I would do 
the same thing if I were in their place. I appreciate the fact 
that people were very angry at me following a few violent 
incidents, like bomb attacks in certain provinces, and so on. 
They wondered why I resisted taking action, like transferring 
police chiefs of those provinces, etc. I say to them that 
before taking any drastic action we need more evidence and more 
time to study the facts of the case. 
  What do you see as hampering the running of your 
ministry. 
  Bureaucracy in the agencies under my ministry. For example, 
the Police Department. Its structure really only allows it to 
deal with internal law and order problems, and not with 
international terrorism. 
  You mean the Police Department's structure has kept its 
role limited, or are you saying that the police should not be 
doing the job in the first place. 
  Neither the Interior Ministry nor the Police Department can 
be expected to perform a task which is beyond their capabilities 
or which will require measures which exceed those we have 
already prepared in order to cope with any forseeable crisis. 
If a major crisis breaks out and we deem it to be beyond our 
capability, we should be able to say that it is now time for the 
military to step in. 
  What will you do now that international terrorists have 
apparently penetrated our borders. 
  The situation is certainly not out of hand yet. We have 
several devices we can employ to help us spy on the terrorists, 
such as an electronic device which can be placed on any concrete 
wall less than one-foot thick. That device will enable us to 
hear the conversations of the people behind the wall. However, 
terrorists could also monitor our electronic eavesdropping tools 
or communications equipment. 
  So, terrorists will know more about the movement of 
police from the department's equipment than the police will 
learn about the criminals. Is that right. 
  That's it. 
  What more will you do to improve the performance of the 
Interior Ministry. 
  We need to improve our intelligence work. We should also 
improve the coordination between interior agencies, especially 
those concerned with security affairs. The agencies' structure 
should also be streamlined to increase efficiency. 
  Recent incidents have prompted many to think that the 
Interior Ministry's performance in protecting people's live's 
and property has been poor. 
  Problems occur in every government. Whenever you have a 
situation where there are a lot of conflicts in a country, 
incidents like these will happen. 
  What parties have been in conflict recently. 
  Last May, we had a political conflict. That conflict arose 
because two major groups had different approaches to solving the 
country's problems. One side wanted to solve the problems 
peacefully while the other wanted to use force. 
  I myself has been trying to solve problems by reforming the 
structure of certain interior agencies, including the Police 
Department. But my attempts to reform the Police Department 
have led to conflicts in the agency. 
  So, someone dislikes you. 
  Of course. There is always trouble inside the Police 
Department. This department is one of several government 
agencies under political influence. 
  But why are there so many who disagree with you. 
  When the department was reformed, illegal businesses like 
gambling and prostitution were affected. The revamp has caused 
billions of baht in damages to certain groups of people and this 
has caused conflict.

  [Text] The Interior Ministry announced yesterday it would 
impose measures to thwart international terrorists from entering 
and operating in Thailand, including tighter control on the 
movements of some tourists, stricter controls on immigrants as 
well as improvements in intelligence-gathering. 
  Permanent Secretary for Interior Ari Wong-araya said after a 
meeting with the governors of 31 border provinces, Special 
Branch police and the National Security Council at the Interior 
Ministry yesterday that he told the participants to redouble 
their efforts to deter international terrorists from entering 
the country. 
  "The governors of border provinces were briefed on 
international terrorists and ways to prevent them from entering 
and carrying out missions in Thailand," Ari said. 
  He said although the focus of the plan was on international 
terrorists, provincial governors were also told to monitor the 
movements of possible would-be saboteurs in their jurisdiction. 
  Ari said stringent control on the movement of certain 
foreign 
tourists and immigrants was a priority to be carried out by the 
Immigration Division police. He said tighter immigration 
controls would be adopted. 
  He indicated that one of Thailand's neighbouring countries 
had been supporting terrorist activities in Thailand. He did 
not identify the country. 
  Ari said provincial governors had been instructed to closely 
monitor the movement of suspected terrorists in their 
jurisdiction and share the information with other provinces 
through a coordination centre at the Interior Ministry. 
  Provincial governors were also told to draw up their own 
plans to deal with international terrorists based on political 
and social factors unique to their respective areas, Ari said.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri will visit Rangoon 
on April 19 and will official!y invite Burma to attend the Asean 
Ministerial Meeting in July as Bangkok's guest. 
  His visit, at the invitation of Rangoon, comes shortly after 
Prasong finally obtained approval from the five other member 
states -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and 
Singapore -- that Burma should be invited as a guest of the host 
country and not of the regional grouping. 
  This will limit Rangoon's participation to attending the 
opening session and the official dinner, not the closed 
discussions. 
  Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines had initially held 
"some reservations" about inviting Burma to the Asean 
conference. They have expressed concern over Asean losing 
credibility in the eyes of the world community and about strong 
criticism from the West, which has strongly condemned the 
Burmese military regime's heavy-handed policy against the 
democracy movement. 
  They are also concerned that the problems of Muslim Rohingya 
refugees fleeing from military persecution in Burma's western 
Arakan State into Bangladesh are not yet fully resolved. 
  Thailand, as chairman of the Asean Standing Committee, will 
host the ministerial meeting in July. The forum will be 
immediately followed by a meeting of Asean with its seven 
developed, dialogue partners -- Australia, Canada, Japan, New 
Zealand, South Korea, the European Union and the United States. 
  Informed sources said Prasong's acceptance of the Burmese 
junta's invitation and the date is being conveyed to Rangoon for 
final approval. The trip will last one or two days, depending 
on the programme arranged by Burmese authorities. 
  Prasong will visit Burma as chairman of the Asean Standing 
Committee and as Thai foreign minister. The objective of the 
trip is to inform the Burmese regime what he has done in 
inviting Burma to the Asean meeting, and to assess the political 
situation and development in the country, said the sources. 
  The Thai foreign minister has been criticized for his 
drastic 
shift of policy towards Burma. He earlier strongly criticized 
the government of then prime minister Anan Panyarachun for its 
ties with the Burmese junta and for ignoring the plight of the 
Burmese democratic forces. At that time he called for a change 
of policy and for sympathy and support for pro-democratic 
movement in Burma. 
  Since his appointment as foreign minister, however, he has 
discarded his previous views and himself become involved with 
the military junta known as the State Law and Order Restoration 
Council (Slorc). 
  He travelled to Burma last September amid strong opposition 
from the Burmese dissidents to endorse the establishment of a 
new bilateral Thai-Burmese committee, which is to oversee trade 
and economic relations. 
  Prasong has expressed his strong desire to include Burma as 
a 
member of Asean at the earliest opportunity. Rangoon has for 
the past three years shown interest in attending the annual 
Asean meeting, but lack of consensus among the Asean countries 
prevented its participation.

  [Text] A formal bilateral trade commission is to be set up 
between Thailand and Australia. Evan Williams reports from 
Bangkok that the body will boost relations by providing a formal 
network for trade and foreign ministries: 
  [Begin Williams recording] Launching the second leg of his 
Asian tour, Paul Keating meets his Thai counterpart Chuan 
Likphai today before addressing a business lunch and having an 
audience with the king. A new joint economic commission will be 
set up, and Thailand wants Australia to play a more active role 
in coordinating the future of APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation]. 
  Tomorrow, Mr. Keating will help open the Australian-funded 
bridge to Laos in a ceremony chaired by the Thai king. The

  [Text] Myanmar [Burma] Economic Holding Co, a private 
holding company of the Burmese Government, has agreed to 
cooperate with Loxley Plc in a first step to turn the country's 
economy toward free-market policies. 
  The move was suggested by the Asian Development Bank in 
Manila. 
  Burmese National Planning and Economic Development Minister 
Brig- Gen [Brigadier General) D.O. Abel said during the signing 
of a memorandum in Bangkok yesterday that the Burmese military 
rulers had liberalised the country's economy since 1988, making 
it more market- oriented in line with international business 
practices. 
  His government, through the holding company, is holding 
talks 
with Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers Bank and Thai Military Bank to 
become correspondent banks with the state bank in Burma. 
  The Burmese bank, which has been allowed to operate foreign 
exchange and offshore banking businesses, has such correspondent 
bank agreements with banks in Japan, Switzerland, Singapore and 
South Korea. 
  The holding company's business includes trading, 
construction, general business and services. 
  It has industrial joint ventures with companies in South 
Korea, Hong Kong, Germany and soon with the United States. 
  Phuangkeao Phochanpanit, executive vice-president of Loxley, 
said cooperation with her company would include Loxley's 
distribution of jewellery from Burma. Loxley would distribute 
consumer, telecommunications and related products in Burma. 
  The memorandum would be a basis of cooperation for each 
party 
to buy and distribute the other's products and to exchange 
information on products, markets and technical training. 
  Loxley director Wichian Watanakun said his company made a 
feasibility study of running a business in Burma before setting 
up Loxley Myanmar Co in Rangoon in January. 
  Brig-Gen Abel described the cooperation between the holding 
company and Loxley as a model for regional cooperation. 
  Two Thai companies have applied to run authorised timber 
businesses in Burma, he said. 
  The Burmese administration has to consider environmental 
protection and the scope of timber plantations among other 
things, before giving a final decision on whether both companies 
can be awarded contracts. 
  "End-users should invest in Burma for the timber business," 
he said. 
  He said that before 1988 the military rulers had 100 percent 
control of the Burmese economy. But now about 72 percent of 
Burma's GDP growth was contributed by the private sector. 
  Burmese government figures showed that Burma's GDP growth 
last year was 10.9 percent and was expected to be 5.6 percent 
this year, he said.

<F P=106> ["Interview" with Prime Minister Chuan Likphai by </F>
unidentified MATICHON correspondent at the Imperial Hotel in 
Bangkok on 4 April] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Would you tell us about your 
government's achievements? 
  [Chuan] Some critics say that the government has nothing 
much 
to talk about its past achievements. It's hard to say. The 
government's daily performance has always been overshadowed by 
more exciting political news such as those predicting the 
imminent fall of the coalition. This sort of news draws more 
attention. Frankly speaking, the mass media themselves have 
been trying to paint a picture of the prime minister as an 
incompetent and indecisive person. 
  However, I never allow such things to dishearten me. My duty 
is to keep on working. The government has its own principle to 
follow. We also hold consultations with academics. They do not 
have to agree with us. We have our own methods of working. 
Hence, I have become the target of criticism as a person who 
does not dare to make any decisions and who has no sense of 
responsibility. 
  I do not feel insecure if academics will not support me 
because I was elected by tens of thousands of voters. People 
have their own different opinions. Last week, lecturers of 
Prince Songkhla University, Pattani Campus, voiced their 
agreement with what the government has done. However, they said 
that their views might not be weighed because they are merely 
upcountry lecturers. 
  If we reject advice given by academics, it does not mean 
that 
we do not attach any significance to their views. The 
government always listens to their opinions. However, some 
members of the government like Akhom Engchuan frequently come 
out to counter criticism. 
  [Correspondent] We have the impression that the government 
is 
rather slow. How can it work under the current situation? 
  [Chuan] It is necessary for the government to be firm under 
the present conditions. Otherwise, the country will be plunged 
into confusion and disorder. We must have courage to deal with 
problems and to defend national interests. 
  [Correspondent] Isn't it necessary for the government to 
fulfill the desires of the people? 
  [Chuan] Sometimes, it is not what the majority of the people 
want. We must be rational and realistic in solving problems. 
  [Correspondent] What is your view regarding relations 
between 
your government and the Senate? We are talking about the 
incident in the National Assembly [the rejection of the 
government-backed constitutional amendment draft bill]. Most of 
the senators are military officers and apparently do not support 
your government. 
  [Chuan] I look at it from another angle. I believe that 
senators will vote against any draft bill that calls for the 
reduction of their number if the legislation is sponsored by the 
opposition. If, however, the National Assembly rejects the 
government's budget bill, that is a different story. 
  [Correspondent] Do you mean that the constitution drafts are 
not that important? 
  [Chuan] No, the Constitution is important. The government 
alone cannot amend the Constitution because it has only 193 
votes in the house. It is our intention to make the amendment 
perfect. Ten political parties earlier made a gentleman's 
agreement to support the government-sponsored bills. We have 
not added anything to the bills. We kept our promise. I admit 
that the bills are not that perfect, in particular the one on 
the reduction of the number of senators. 
  We have to look into the background of this issue. The 
government has not proposed the draft as its own legislation 
because it cannot ensure the passage of the bill with its 193 
votes in the house. It merely gives its support to the 
legislation. Whether the bill will be passed into law or 
rejected by the parliament is not important. The issue has not 
yet come near its end. Let's wait and see how things will 
evolve. In fact, the government-sponsored draft includes all 
major points. Since the government's drafts were on the agenda 
before those of the opposition, the deliberation should 
continue. We forwarded the drafts to the parliament before the 
opposition, but the agenda was later revised. 
  As we all know, the government only has 193 votes. If they 
do not support us, our law will be rejected. The house speaker 
faithfully did his job. 
  There is no need to dissolve the parliament. Nobody wants it 
to happen. Military officers who have the power in their hands 
have no such an idea. It is those with no power who talk too 
much. 
  [Correspondent] Pro-democracy groups such as the Group of 13 
Organizations have now emerged. 
  [Chuan] It is better if they come out to give support to the 
principle of democracy, not violence. 
  [Correspondent] Their emergence can lead to confrontation. 
  [Chuan] I reaffirm that we uphold the path of democracy. On 
this path, let changes be made. 
  [Correspondent] Do you see any chance of clashes among the 
Thai people? 
  [Chuan] We must try to prevent that. Democracy is the best 
avenue that relies on rationalism. 
  [Correspondent] But to follow the path of democracy means we 
must serve the people's interests. Otherwise, the people will 
not have faith in the democratic form of government. 
  [Chuan] We cannot use any particular group as a yardstick. 
We must look at the entire population in the country. If not, 
we will take the wrong approach to solve problems. We must 
stand firm regardless of what happens. If we fail to use the 
democratic approach in dealing with problems, we will put the 
democratic system in danger. If we reject the democratic way, 
we will do whatever is convenient for us even at the cost of our 
own credibility. But we adhere to the principle of democracy. 
We will not do anything simply to serve our own desires since 
we will not learn anything from doing that. 
  [Correspondent] Is the house dissolution an option in line 
with the principle of democracy? 
  [Chuan] Yes, it is. But I do not think that it's time to do 
so. 
  [Correspondent] What about your resignation? 
  [Chuan] Have I done anything wrong? 
  [Correspondent] Will you not feel embarrassed if you have to 
resign? 
  [Chuan] I do not feel like I will lose face. On the 
contrary, we, as a political party, must honor our promise. 
That is the right thing to do. 
  [Correspondent] Suppose you resign and become the prime 
minister again, will you consider including some opposition 
parties in your new coalition? 
  [Chuan] I have not yet thought about such a scenario. After 
the closure of this National Assembly session, we will have to 
take some time to iron things out.

  [Text] The two suspects and a lookout in the assassination 
of Leopoldo Mabilangan, alias Comrade Hector, and his bodyguard 
have already been identified. However, PNP [Philippine National 
Police] ReCom [Regional Command] IV Chief Romeo Odi refused to 
disclose the names of the three. The three are now the subject 
of an extensive manhunt called Task Force Comrade Hector. 
  The first gunman is 5 feet and 6 inches tall, weighs 135 
pounds, slim-built, around 20 years old and of brown complexion. 
According to witnesses, the first gunman approached and shot 
Comrade Hector between the eyes. When he fell, the second 
gunman approached and shot Comrade Hector in the face and the 
body to make sure that he was dead. 
  The second gunman is a mestizo, stands 5 feet and 7 inches, 
is between 28 and 33 years old, and is of medium-build. He is 
believed to be the leader of the group. The lookout, who also 
served as the back-up, is also of medium-build and is 5 feet 7 
inches tall, of fair complexion, and 25 to 30 years old. 
  Meantime, ReCom IV confirms that the murder of Comrade 
Hector 
was decided by the Southern Tagalog Regional Committee of the 
New People's Army [NPA]. According to Superintendent Victor 
Tiangco, five former followers of Comrade Hector descended the 
mountain to warn him of the assassination plan. 
  [Begin Tiangco recording in English; monitored in progress] 
...our investigation leads to Comrade Roger's group and we have 
witnesses and statements by reliable sources that this is the 
handiwork of Comrade Roger of the CPP (Communist Party of the 
Philippines)-NPA, because one week before the actual ambush of 
Comrade Hector, a group of NPA's loyal to Mabilangan went to his 
residence and warned him of the assassination to be carried out 
by expert assassins led by Comrade Rex and Comrade Carlo. [end 
recording] 
  In a related development, the possible motive for murdering 
Mabilangan is alleged to be related to his livelihood projects. 
According to the NBI [National Bureau of Investigation], many 
rebels surrendered to join Comrade Hector's projects, which 
grossly reduced the ranks of the NPA, especially the Banahaw 
Command, formerly led by Comrade Hector. 
  President Ramos assured the family of Comrade Hector that 
the 
government would do its best to arrest his assassins. The 
president likewise called Comrade Hector a hero because he 
risked his life when he surrendered and decided to help the 
government. The president likewise issued a directive to study 
the possibility of putting rebel surrenderees under the witness 
protection program or granting them security.

  [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] has 
claimed responsibility for the assassination of former communist 
guerrilla commander Leopoldo Mabilangan, alias Comrade Hector. 
The Philippine News and Features interviewed another communist 
guerrilla chieftain who is still active in the movement about 
the Mabilangan assassination. Gregorio Rosal, alias Comrade 
Roger, spokesman of the CPP in southern Tagalog and Luzon, told 
the news organization that Mabilangan was ordered killed for his 
criminal and anti- revolutionary activities. Mabilangan had 
been charged of extortion and other criminal activities, 
including kidnapping for ransom. He was expelled from the CPP 
in February last year. 
  Mabilangan and a bodyguard was shot dead in front of a 
parish 
church in Batangas on Easter Sunday [2 April]. Mabilangan was 
to act as principal sponsor in a wedding ceremony. Three other 
people, including a traffic policeman, were wounded.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The United States is wrong 
in seeking bilateral trade targets with Japan, but that does not 
mean Japan can keep its markets to itself, Canada's trade 
minister said Thursday [7 April]. 
  Roy MacLaren, Canadian minister for international trade, 
said 
in Tokyo that Canada "regrets" the revival of "Super 301" trade 
legislation by U.S. President Bill Clinton as well as the U.S. 
insistence on setting numerical trade targets in bilateral trade 
with Japan. But he quickly added, "there is broad recognition, 
including by the Japanese Government, that meaningful action to 
address Japan's chronic current account surpluses is essential." 
  Canada, MacLaren said, favors a more open, international 
Japan and suggested that the country must bring forth 
"meaningful regulatory and administrative reform," particularly 
in distribution, transportation, communications and financial 
services. 
  Speaking to Japanese and Canadian executives, MacLaren 
emphasized that while he does not support the U.S. approach to 
negotiations with Japan, "Japan remains limited by regulations, 
many of which appear to us as quite unnecessary." 
  Meeting reporters after his address, MacLaren said both 
Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
outlined Japan's commitment to deregulation in meetings with 
him. Detailed plans were not presented, but an outline for 
changes over the next five years were shown him, he said. 
  At later meetings with International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai and Construction Minister Kozo 
Igarashi, MacLaren said he would press for significant action in 
reducing regulatory barriers to the expansion of Canadian 
exports of building products, other materials, and value-added 
goods to Japan. 
  Touching on the market access measures Japan released last 
week, the minister said Canada "welcomes them." But, he added, 
"they hardly meet what we regard as a desirable goal -- they 
don't go very far -- but are a step." 
  He also stressed that Canada supports decentralization in 
Japan and pointed to his visit to the southernmost main island 
of Kyushu earlier this week as underlining the benefits small 
and medium Canadian companies can obtain if they don't have to 
do business "through Tokyo's great trading companies." At the 
regional level, he suggested, business-to-business ventures and 
agreements "come quickly." 
  MacLaren will host a roundtable on Japan-Canada business and 
economic relations Friday and meet with several business leaders 
before departing Saturday for Morocco where he will represent 
Canada at the signing of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade 
agreement.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Canada's Trade Minister 
Thursday [7 April] criticized U.S. calls to introduce "numerical 
targets" to measure foreign access to Japanese markets, Foreign 
Ministry officials said Thursday. Canadian Minister for 
International Trade Roy MacLaren voiced the concern in separate 
meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, the officials said. 
  MacLaren told Hosokawa and Hata that Canada considers it 
important to promote trade under multilateral rules, they said. 
  He expressed appreciation for Hata's remarks that Japan 
intends to report the results of bilateral discussions to other 
nations, and added that Canada opposes U.S. calls on Japan for 
numerical targets or to introduce managed trade because such 
moves affect third parties, they said. Canada has repeatedly 
told Washington of its opposition, MacLaren was quoted as saying. 
  Hata, during an hour-long meeting with MacLaren, said he has 
told U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor that agreements 
between the United States and Japan should not affect other 
nations, so Japan disagrees with numerical targets, the 
officials said. 
  He also referred to the successful Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade talks and said managed trade should be 
avoided. 
  MacLaren voiced expectations that Japan continue to promote 
deregulation, they said, and Hosokawa and Hata told MacLaren 
that Japan is trying to do so. 
  The trade minister, who arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday after 
visiting Fukuoka in western Japan, told the Japanese leaders 
that Canada wants to strengthen ties not only with the Tokyo 
area but also with local economies, they said. 
  MacLaren invited Hosokawa and Hata to visit Canada, they 
said. 
  MacLaren has been in Japan since Tuesday on the last leg of 
a 
three-nation Asian tour that also took him to China and South 
Korea. He is scheduled to leave Japan on Saturday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japan will grant up to 500 
million yen in assistance to Cambodia to help it increase food 
production, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday [7 April]. 
Japanese Ambassador to Cambodia Yukio Imagawa and Cambodia's 
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Prince Norodom 
Sirivut exchanged documents on the agreement in Phnom Penh, the 
ministry said. 
  The aid will be used to purchase fertilizers and 
agricultural 
machinery, it said. Food production in Cambodia is very slow 
because its economy was destroyed by years of war and because of 
lack of fertilizers and machinery, the ministry said. 
  The latest aid brings the total amount of Japanese 
grant-in-aid to Cambodia in fiscal 1993 to about 8.4 billion 
yen, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa pledged on Thursday [7 April] to lend Kazakhstan up to 
12.98 billion yen to help it improve railroad transportation and 
tackle pollution from thermal power stations, Foreign Ministry 
officials said. Hosokawa made the pledge in a meeting with 
Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, the officials said. 
  Japan will extend the loan to support the central Asian 
nation's economic reform efforts and to help its environmental 
preservation measures, they said. 
  Of the total, 7.23 billion yen will be set aside for a 
project to improve railroad transportation. The project aims at 
supplying equipment necessary to expand Druzhba station at the 
border with China which serves as the base for material 
transportation, and to repair and improve the track. 
  Another 5.74 billion yen will be for a project to tackle air 
pollution from the Ekibastuz thermal power station in northern 
Kazakhstan, the officials said. 
  The project aims at installing electric dust collectors and 
denitrification and desulfurization equipment at the power 
station. Despite the use of coal for thermal power generation, 
sufficient environmental preservation measures have not been 
taken in Kazakhstan since it became independent with the breakup 
of the Soviet Union, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The Japanese Government 
pledged Thursday [7 April] to immediately begin covering trade 
insurance for Kazakhstan. International Trade and Industry 
Minister Hiroshi Kumagai made the pledge during his meeting with 
Syzdyk Abishev, Kazakhstan's deputy premier in charge of 
economic affairs, who is accompanying President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev on a four-day visit to Japan since Wednesday. 
  Kazakhstan will become the first country among the five 
former Soviet republics in Central Asia to receive Japan's trade 
insurance coverage. As a first step, Japan will apply the 
insurance to two facility expansion projects for the Karaganda 
steel mill in line with a credit line of 300 million dollars 
established last year, a MITI official told a press conference. 
  Kumagai also told Abishev that Japan is prepared to accept 
trade insurance for Kazakhstan's new oil pipeline project if 
certain conditions on loan repayments are met, the official said. 
  Japan also decided to give technological assistance to 
Kazakhstan, including cooperation in a copper exploration 
project, while it will assist restructuring efforts at the 
Karaganda steel mill, the MITI official said. 
  Abishev asked Japanese companies to redouble their 
investments in Kazakhstan, noting that only three Japanese firms 
are now involved in joint ventures with Kazakh companies. 
  Kumagai said Japanese firms will probably respond favorably 
if investment conditions in the country improve.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa said Thursday [7 April] Japan will allocate 11 million 
dollars to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear weapons, 
Foreign Ministry officials said. Hosokawa made the announcement 
in a meeting with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who 
arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a four-day visit. 
  The amount is part of a total of 100 million dollars Japan 
pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics -- 
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- dismantle their 
nuclear weapons. The officials said detailed use of the 11 
million dollars will be decided in discussions between the two 
sides at a committee on cooperation for the destruction of 
nuclear weapons. 
  Hosokawa praised Kazakhstan's efforts to denuclearize, 
democratize and shift toward a market-oriented economy, they 
said. Kazakhstan joined the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty 
(NPT) as a nonnuclear weapon state last November. 
  Nazarbayev, 53, asked for Japanese cooperation in helping 
his 
country tackle environmental pollution at the Semipalatinsk 
nuclear testing site and in the Aral Sea, the officials said. 
Specifically, he requested cooperation in providing medical 
equipment for hospitals treating people exposed to radioactivity 
near Semipalatinsk. 
  Hosokawa said Japan will seriously consider cooperation with 
the hospitals, which the ministry officials said is expected to 
be covered by the 11 million dollars. 
  An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are 
believed to be left in Kazakhstan. As for environmental 
problems in the Aral Sea, Hosokawa said the problem should be 
solved internationally but added Japan would study what it can 
do, the officials said. 
  Also during the 30-minute meeting, followed by an hourlong 
dinner, Nazarbayev, 53, said he supports Japan's bid to become a 
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. 
  A joint statement signed by the two leaders prior to the 
meeting said Kazakhstan "expressed the hope" that Japan would 
become a permanent member of the Security Council and "fulfill 
its relevant responsibilities." Hosokawa told Nazarbayev Japan 
intends to fulfill its responsibilities within its capabilities, 
the officials said. 
  On the international front, the Kazakhstan president 
proposed 
holding a conference covering the whole of Asia to build trust. 
Hosokawa agreed on the importance of creating trust in Asia but 
expressed reluctance to set up a forum covering the whole region 
such as the conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe 
(CSCE). 
  Nazarbayev asked Japan to offer its manufacturing technology 
to Central Asia and suggested setting up a committee between 
Japan and Kazakhstan to study such a possibility. Hosokawa 
suggested the two sides utilize the existing bilateral economic 
committee. 
  Nazarbayev also offered a list of 1,394 Japanese prisoners 
of 
war detained in Siberia who died in Kazakhstan, the officials 
said. 
  On Friday, Nazarbayev is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress 
Michiko and give a press conference later in the day.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Japanese and Russian 
shipping companies have agreed to open a ferry route between 
Sakhalin and two Japanese port cities in Hokkaido -- Otaru and 
Wakkanai -- in April 1995, a Transport Ministry official said 
Wednesday [6 April]. The agreement, which came after two days 
of talks ended in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Wednesday, also calls for 
serving the new ferry route on a trial basis in July, the 
official said. 
  The shipping talks were held under a February 1991 agreement 
between the Japanese and then Soviet governments. 
  The two sides are slated to meet again between late May and 
early June in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to negotiate details of the 
trial service, including how many and how long.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- A joint survey of the Sea 
of Japan by Japan, South Korea and Russia found no particular 
effects of Russia's radioactive waste dumping, Foreign Ministry 
officials said Wednesday [6 April]. The survey team, consisting 
of experts from the three nations and from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), found no particular abnormalities 
in seawater and seabed samples compared with past data, the 
officials said. 
  Operating from a Russian-registered oceanographic survey 
ship, the Okean, the team began a study of the seawater and 
seabed of the Sea of Japan on March 18 following the Russian 
dumping of liquid nuclear waste in October. The team took water 
samples from both the ocean surface and deep within the sea at 
seven survey spots southeast of Vladivostok, and the survey 
ended Wednesday. 
  Official results of the survey will be announced after 
detailed analysis is complete, the officials said. 
  The Russian Navy dumped 900 tons of liquid nuclear waste in 
the Sea of Japan in October 1993. A planned second dumping was 
canceled following protests from Japan and South Korea.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japanese trading firm 
Marubeni Corp. said Thursday [7 April] it has tied up with a 
Chinese enterprise to sell personal computers and other 
electronics equipment in China. 
  Under the agreement, Marubeni and China's Legend computer 
group will jointly develop, produce, market and service personal 
computers, communications equipment and medical analysis 
systems, Marubeni said. The two companies initially will sell 
computer hardware and software made by Apple Computer Inc. of 
the United States, beginning this autumn, it said. 
  The company said the burgeoning Chinese personal computer 
market, which saw sales of 300,000 units last year, is likely to 
experience an annual growth of more than 20 percent through 2000. 
  Legend, backed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, annually 
sells 20 billion yen worth of personal computers, it said. 
  International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and other U.S. 
computer makers are already competing for a larger share of the 
Chinese market.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japan agreed Thursday [7 
April] to import 7.15 million square meters of silk goods from 
China in fiscal 1994, the Trade Ministry said. The sum compares 
with 7.2 million square meters in the previous year, the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said, 
summing up two days of silk trade talks in Tokyo between Japan 
and China. 
  The accord also calls for Japan to import 10,500 bales of 
Chinese-made silk thread for the year which started April 1, 
down from 11,500 bales in fiscal 1993. 
  Raw silk shipments to Japan in the current year will total 
19,000 bales, up from 13,500 bales, MITI said. One bale weighs 
60 kilograms.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Central Union of 
Agricultural Cooperatives registered its opposition Wednesday [6 
April] to an accord to be signed by Japan that will bring the 
seven-year-long Uruguay Round of world trade talks to a 
conclusion, officials of the union said. They said Hakaru 
Toyoda, president of the union, met with Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura and Eijiro Hata, minister of the agriculture, 
forestry and fisheries. 
  The union said it opposes the accord because it will lead to 
liberalization of Japan's markets for farm produce, the 
officials said. Toyoda urged the government to, instead, 
implement policies that will create a stable working environment 
for farmers and adopt farm trade laws that secure the survival 
of Japan's agricultural industry. 
  The Uruguay Round accord, which comprises a broad range of 
trading rules agreed on at talks sponsored by the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will be signed in Marrakech, 
Morocco at a ministerial meeting to be held April 12-15.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa 
Fujii told OECD leader Jean-Claude Paye Tuesday [5 April] the 
Japanese Government is considering full-scale tax cuts in years 
beyond fiscal 1995, officials said. The officials said Fujii 
and Paye, secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development, exchanged views on the 
economic situation. 
  The government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been 
under pressure to implement tax cuts on a continuing basis to 
stimulate domestic demand, thereby increasing market potential 
for imports. 
  Fujii told Paye the government is considering full-scale tax 
cuts in fiscal 1995 and onward, the officials said. Legislation 
for a 20 percent reduction in income and residential taxes for 
this year has already cleared the Diet. 
  Fujii was quoted as telling Paye the government considers it 
necessary to raise the 3.0 percent consumption tax rate to help 
ease the tax burden on middle-class wage earners, the officials 
said. Paye, on a regular visit to Japan for consultations with 
Japanese leaders, expressed hope that tax cuts will help 
stimulate consumer spending in Japan and expand domestic demand, 
they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Outgoing German Ambassador 
to Japan Wilhelm Haas said Thursday [7 April] that 
German-Japanese relations have "widened and deepened" in recent 
years although Bonn sometimes devoted "probably too much" 
political energy to German unification and European problems. 
Speaking to reporters at the Japan National Press Club, Haas 
said Germany has intensified its relations with East and 
Southeast Asia, adding Bonn's new Asia policy, adopted in 
October, "singles out Japan as major partner in the region." 
  A cooperation council for high technology proposed during 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to Japan in February 1993 
will likely be formally established when Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa visits Germany as part of a European tour in May, he 
said. Through the council, representatives of both governments 
and the high-tech industries of both countries and research and 
development personnel will meet on a regular basis to exchange 
views on the latest technological developments and sound out 
possible joint projects. 
  Haas, who will leave his Tokyo post on April 29 after more 
than three and a half years in Japan, said Bonn "very warmly 
welcomed" the priorities set by the Hosokawa cabinet, citing 
political reform, decentralization and deregulation. However, 
he indicated that political developments since August, when 
Hosokawa's coalition government took power ending almost four 
decades of Liberal Democratic Party rule, have put a damper on 
Bonn's initial enthusiasm. 
  "We had high, possibly too high expectations and may have to 
prepare ourselves for some disappointment," Haas said. "You 
sell twice as much as you buy from us," said Haas, urging more 
Japanese efforts to adjust the bilateral trade imbalance which 
reached 930.44 billion yen in Japan's favor in 1993. 
  "The Germans feel that Japan can and should be more open to 
its competitors and to international division of labor," the 
ambassador said, adding that Germany hopes to solve trade 
problems in a multilateral context. 
  Turning to cultural relations, Haas acknowledged that 
Germany 
should correct another imbalance -- the number of Japanese 
studying in Germany is seven to eight times higher than the 
number of Germans studying in Japan, he said. Haas, who is 
fluent in Japanese, said, however, "it is simply not true" that 
speaking the partner country's language is a prerequisite for 
mutual understanding. 
  With the increasing global interdependence English will 
become the mode of communication in German-Japan relations 
anyway, he said. "This is not a bad development," Haas said, 
adding that bilateral relations need to be taken somewhat "out 
of the hands of specialists." 
  Son of a career diplomat, Haas spent almost his entire 
childhood in Japan and China. In the 1960s he served as a 
junior officer under his father, who was then the German 
ambassador to Japan. Bonn has not decided yet who will succeed 
Haas.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry on 
Thursday [7 April] announced bills to relax car inspection 
regulations as part of government deregulation efforts. The 
deregulation involves the elimination of rules requiring a car 
inspection once every six months as well as a reduction in items 
required for annual and biennial car inspections. 
  The ministry plans to implement the latest measures next 
year, ministry officials said. 
  The ministry expects the scrapping of the six-month 
inspection requirements to save car owners an average 15,000 yen 
and the reduction in items for annual and biennial inspections 
to save them 4,000 yen and 8,000 yen, respectively, they said.

  [Text] New York, April 7 KYODO -- Both Japan and Germany 
should be given permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, a 
panel of some 40 Japanese and U.S. academics, diplomats and 
U.N. executives said Wednesday [6 April]. This would make up 
for an increasingly serious shortage of U.N. resources, such as 
peacemaking personnel, financial resources, and other means 
needed to keep or enforce peace in conflict-torn areas, it said 
in a 16-page report. 
  The panel, formed by the United Nations Association of the 
United States (UNA-USA) and the Asia-Pacific Association of 
Japan (APA), said U.N. authorization of military force should be 
a last resort and relatively rare, but once decided should be 
carried out efficiently, effectively and professionally. "To 
accomplish this, however, will entail major improvements in 
command and control procedures, in training, in the preparatory 
earmarking of troops...and supplies, and in the provision of 
financial support," it said. 
  Pointing to the need for a further use of U.N. peacekeeping 
activities, it urged that member states "contribute to the 
strengthening of that capability." 
  To resolve the problem of financial constraints on the U.N. 
peacemaking budget, it urged all member states to "explore the 
possibility of paying the U.N. peacekeeping assessments from 
their defense budgets." 
  The panel also recommended Japan and the U.S. "maintain 
close 
cooperation on all U.N.-related matters, particularly those 
involving the Security Council." To this end, it recommended 
that "American and Japanese representatives meet regularly in 
New York and consult on outstanding U.N. issues." 
  The report acknowledged, however, the U.N. difficulty, due 
to 
its financial and personnel limitations, in living up to the 
expectations from the international community to ensure peace. 
  It expressed understanding of arguments by some U.S. 
intellectuals that the U.S. forces should keep its independence 
of command from U.N. peacekeeping operations in enforcing peace. 
"We fully acknowledge that not all of the suspicion and 
resistance, if not outright opposition, to U.N.-led 
multilateralism derives from selfishness and shortsightedness," 
the report said. 
  "There are genuine dilemmas that we must face up to and 
resolve," it said, adding that it hopes the report's 
recommendations will "provide some impetus for overcoming these 
dilemmas." 
  The report, titled, "Addressing the New Challenge, Regional 
Crisis Management and the United Nations" and based on two and a 
half years of research, was drafted under the co-chairmanship of 
Donald McHenry, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., and 
Ryukichi Imai, former Japanese ambassador to the U.N. Geneva 
Disarmament Conference. 
  The UNA-USA urged the U.S. State Department to implement its 
recommendations to bolster the capability of the U.N. to restore 
peace in various conflict-marred regions at a time when the U.S. 
is increasingly loath to police such trouble spots. 
  The institution is a private research group dedicated to 
strengthening the U.N. and enhancing U.S. participation in it. 
The APA is a quasigovernmental research group affiliated with 
the Japanese Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- A senior Foreign Ministry 
official Thursday denied suspicion by some countries that Japan 
may arm with nuclear weapons now that it has launched the new 
plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor "Monju," which produces 
more plutonium than it uses. 
  "Japan has properly accepted (international) nuclear 
inspections," said the official on the condition of anonymity. 
"Nuclear armament will not benefit Japan...I can understand some 
countries think Japan will arm with nuclear weapons if North 
Korea does so." 
  The official said Japan must clear the suspicion on such 
occasions as summit meetings and foreign ministerial meetings 
with every country. 
  Earlier the same day, North Korea accused Japan of promoting 
a plan to become a nuclear power, according to the official 
KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA). "The commissioning of Monju 
fully reveals Japan's undisguised scheme to become a nuclear 
power by securing a large quantity of plutonium for itself and 
manufacturing nuclear weapons any moment," the KCNA said. 
  Monju reached criticality Tuesday morning in Tsuruga, Fukui 
Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. Criticality is the point 
at which the reaction in the reactor's fissionable material is 
sufficient to sustain a chain reaction. 
  Some environmentalists have criticized the operation of 
Monju 
partly because plutonium can be used to produce nuclear weapons.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- The Japan New Party (JNP) 
led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Thursday [7 April] 
it is suspending discussions on a proposed merger with new party 
Sakigake, [Harbinger] another member of the seven-party ruling 
coalition. The JNP reached the decision at a meeting of its 
Diet members earlier in the day. 
  Many members voiced opposition to the party leadership's 
plan 
to suspend the proposed merger with Sakigake, which is led by 
Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, party officials said. 
  Hosokawa said Monday the proposed merger between the JNP and 
Sakigake is "not a commitment." 
  The JNP, however, decided at Thursday's meeting to maintain 
a 
loose parliamentary group with Sakigake in the House of 
Representatives. 
  Hosokawa and Takemura floated the idea of a merger last 
summer while they were campaigning in the July 18 general 
election for the House of Representatives. 
  The close ties of the two parties became a driving force in 
creating the coalition government last August by uniting with 
five other parties to oust the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
from its 38-year-old grip on power. But the relationship 
between Hosokawa and Takemura has soured, making remote the 
likelihood of a merger of the two parties, political sources 
said. 
  The two leaders have differed over handling of tax system 
reform. Moreover, in moves to form new political forces among 
the ruling parties, it appears likely that Hosokawa and Takemura 
will join rival groups, according to the sources. 
  The coalition government may separate into two groups -- one 
formed by the JNP, Komeito and Shinseito, and the other mainly 
by Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan], they 
said. 
  Takemura, meanwhile, indicated Thursday that his party may 
scrap the merger plan with the JNP if the soured relations 
between the two parties continue. In a meeting with reporters, 
Takemura expressed dissatisfaction with the JNP's attitude 
toward the idea, saying "if the JNP has changed its stance, I 
want (the party) to respond a bit more fairly." 
  Takemura also said Sakigake will go back to the starting 
point to reconsider the matter.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- An advisory committee has 
completed the outline of a report on transferring the Diet and 
other government facilities outside congested Tokyo, committee 
officials said Wednesday [6 April]. 
  The outline, set for release in June, suggested that such a 
transfer would enable Japan to "realize a land structure 
suitable for the 21st century." The issue of transferring the 
Diet outside the capital has been debated for years. 
  The panel said it would also serve to facilitate political 
and administrative reforms, including deregulation and 
decentralization of power. 
  The outline will serve as the basis for an intermediate 
report to be issued in June on the subject of the "significance 
and effect" of making such a transfer. Afterwards, the 
committee will come up with a master plan. 
  At the end of the month, a separate advisory panel will 
begin 
considering what conditions should be met before considering new 
sites for the Diet. Contenders include such cities as Sendai in 
northern Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- An influential business 
leader appealed to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa Wednesday [6 
April] to give top priority to early passage by the Diet of the 
1994 fiscal budget. 
  Takeshi Nagano, chairman of the Japan Federation of 
Employers' Associations (Nikkeiren), told a news conference 
Hosokawa should take tough action to get the bill through the 
Diet. His remark indicated he considers it unavoidable for the 
ruling coalition government to vote on the bill, even in the 
absence of opposition parties, observers said. 
  Parliamentary debate on the budget has been stalled over 
demands by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party that Hosokawa 
disclose details of a 100 million yen loan he accepted from the 
scandal-tainted trucking firm Sagawa Kyubin Co. and purchases 
of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. made by the 
premier in the name of his late father-in-law. 
  Nagano said the budget committee should resume debate on the 
budget quickly and transfer discussions on the scandal to other 
panels.

  [Text] Washington, April 5 KYODO -- Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa assured Americans on Tuesday [5 April] that 
economic reform he is pushing in Japan will heal the ailing 
Japanese economy and turn it once again into a "powerful engine" 
for global growth. 
  Hosokawa, writing in the editorial page of the newspaper USA 
TODAY, said the fresh market-opening measures unveiled by Japan 
last week were one result of his reform efforts, and he urged 
Americans to take advantage of new business opportunities in 
Japan. "I hope that foreign firms will, with enthusiasm, take 
advantage of the opportunities provided by the measures, thereby 
leading to an increase in imports to Japan from the United 
States and elsewhere," Hosokawa said. 
  A Japanese Embassy spokesman said Hosokawa contributed the 
article in response to a request from the newspaper to present 
the Japanese case on growing trade disputes between the two 
countries. 
  The Japanese premier, who was swept to office last August as 
a champion of change, began his article by promising the 
American public that he is determined to press on with political 
and economic reforms in Japan. "Economic reform is particularly 
important in order to pull Japan out of the current recession 
and once again make it a powerful engine for the world economy," 
Hosokawa said. 
  Hosokawa gave an outline of the market-opening measures his 
government adopted last Tuesday, arguing that tapping the 
Japanese market would help create jobs in the U.S. 
  He said, "Japan is America's largest export market after 
Canada, and Japanese investment is greatly contributing to the 
creation of American jobs and to the enhancement of production 
in the U.S. industry."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Japanese economy may 
pull out of its prolonged three-year recession if persistent 
concerns over the yen's rise and other fresh downward pressures 
on the economy prove unfounded, Bank of Japan [BOJ] Governor 
Yasushi Mieno said Wednesday [6 April]. 
  "The economy is brighter and close to hitting bottom," the 
BOJ chief told a news conference after wrapping up a three-day 
quarterly meeting of the central bank's managers of 33 domestic 
branches and its three overseas representatives. His comments, 
reflecting increased optimism by the regional branch managers 
and overseas representatives, indicated a slight change from 
recent remarks that more time is needed to see if emerging 
bright spots in consumption and production will be sustainable 
enough to lift the economy. 
  Mieno was still cautious about a recovery, though, citing 
potential downward factors such as the yen's appreciation amid 
the stalled Japan-U.S. trade talks. 
  The BOJ chief said his view on the economic situation has 
"delicately" changed, but reiterated that he will continue to 
"carefully watch" recent improvements led by recovering personal 
consumption and slightly increasing exports. 
  Summing up the quarterly meeting of branch managers, Mieno 
said the managers confirmed evidence of improved corporate 
sentiment. Most of the branch managers attending the meeting 
reported that the economy is showing signs of bottoming out. 
  Mieno said their assessment of the economy "turned brighter 
than at the time of the previous meeting," noting that 
anticipation of recovery is spreading among corporate managers. 
  Company leaders, who until recently had been discussing the 
timing of the recovery, are now talking about its tempo rather 
than its timing, he added. 
  "The chances are slim for the economy to fall back again," 
Mieno said, brushing aside the possibility of a repeat of the 
setback which occurred a year ago. He noted four "stronger 
positive factors" which have come to the surface over the past 
year. 
  "Inventory adjustments and corporate restructuring programs 
have progressed steadily, and recent macroeconomic measures are 
buoying the economy," he said. 
  "Exports are recovering due to brighter overseas economies 
led by the United States, and improvements in domestic economic 
activities are spreading," he added. 
  But Mieno said he wants to carefully monitor to what extent 
the book closing by companies for the fiscal year ended March 31 
"inflated" economic indicators. 
  The BOJ chief also said three persistent factors should be 
carefully watched -- the yen's appreciation, ongoing labor 
cutbacks and continuing balance-sheet adjustments by financial 
institutions, noting these may drag the economy down again. 
  With Japan's current account surplus remaining at a high 
level, trade friction with other nations prevails, and a trend 
toward a higher yen is dominating foreign exchange trading, 
Mieno said. The recent yen-dollar exchange rate of around 104 
yen to the U.S. dollar is "severe for exporters," but the latest 
round of the yen's appreciation is milder than last year's, 
Mieno said. 
  He noted that the dollar fell from 125 yen to near 100 yen 
last year, while its fall in the current round is only from 110 
yen late last year to Wednesday's 104 yen level. 
  Asked about the central bank's stance on the yen's 
appreciation in connection with the stalled trade talks with the 
United States, Mieno repeated that he desires to see stable 
exchange rates reflecting economic fundamentals. 
  An agreement reached among finance ministers and central 
bankers of Group of Seven major industrial nations on their 
cooperation to stem wild rate fluctuations is alive, Mieno 
added, suggesting his intention to call for reconfirmation of 
the accord at a G-7 meeting slated in Washington later this 
month. 
  Considering the recent upward trend in long-term interest 
rates led by the United States, Mieno said they are unlikely to 
continue rising. He said it is natural for market rates to move 
up and down in the near term, but long-term rates will settle 
down during the process of adjusting to the state of the economy. 
  Mieno praised the positive stance taken by financial 
insitutions to liquidate bad loans.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Bank of Japan Governor 
Yasushi Mieno told business leaders Wednesday [6 April] he sees 
bright signs in corporate sentiment and such is reflected in the 
real economy, a business leader said. 
  Mieno pointed to a slight increase in exports against the 
backdrop of a strong U.S. economy and progress in reducing 
corporate inventories and corporate restructuring, according to 
Kenji Kawakatsu, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren). Kawakatsu cited Mieno as saying that 
was clearly not the picture a year ago. 
  But Mieno reportedly added he will continue to watch those 
bright signs to determine whether they will lead to a 
full-fledged economic recovery. 
  Mieno also said the strength of the yen in currency markets 
continues to put pressure on the economy and stressed the 
importance of private business vigor to ensure economic 
recovery, according to Kawakatsu.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- Japan's economy is not yet 
set to recover but a further fall is unlikely, Vice Finance 
Minister Jiro Saito said Thursday [7 April]. "As we have been 
saying, the economy is unlikely to deteriorate further," Saito 
told a scheduled news conference, referring to remarks Wednesday 
by Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno. 
  The BOJ chief virtually declared an end to the three-year 
recession by saying the economy is showing signs of hitting 
bottom. 
  But Saito remained cautious about projecting recovery as did 
Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii when he met reporters after 
Mieno. "There may be some differences in nuances, but they 
(Mieno's comments) are basically the same as the latest 
(monthly) economic report by the Economic Planning Agency," 
Saito said. 
  "Mieno also did not completely mention a recovery," Saito 
said. Under these circumstances, Saito stressed the government 
must steadily implement the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus 
package and enact the fiscal 1994 budget as early as possible to 
put the economy on a "full-fledged recovery track." 
  Considering the tax issue, Saito welcomed the recent 
direction indicated by the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to 
accepting a consumption tax hike. But he declined to comment 
further on ongoing discussions among the ruling coalition 
parties which are to decide on a full-scale tax reform by the 
end of the year.

  [Text] Osaka, April 7 KYODO -- Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. has developed new model-based three-dimensional 
human image synthesizing technology, the company said Thursday 
[7 April]. 
  A senior company researcher said if a programmer inputs 
general data on the character of a model -- for instance, a 
model with weak characteristics -- into a workstation, the 
computer automatically outputs facial expressions and motions 
suited to the character on the basis of that data. He said the 
new technology will probably be put to practical use in the 
field of game software in a few years, and eventually in the 
field of motion pictures and broadcasting.

  [Text] Sapporo, April 5 KYODO -- Most of Japan's minority 
Ainu remain dissatisfied with their standard of living, 
according to a survey released by the prefectural government on 
Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island. The survey showed 
that 33 percent of the Ainu families interviewed on Hokkaido 
said they find it "tough" to make ends meet, while another 44 
percent opted to characterize it as "somewhat difficult." 
  A total of 300 Ainu families in Hokkaido, where most of 
Japan's Ainu live, were interviewed last June for the survey, 
which has been conducted every seven years since 1972. Despite 
complaints about difficulties in earning a livelihood, the 
survey showed that ratio of Ainu receiving welfare payments from 
the government fell from 60.9 per 1,000 population in the last 
survey, undertaken in 1986, to 38.8 per 1,000 population in the 
current survey. 
  The survey said Hokkaido's Ainu population stood at 23,830, 
or a decrease of 551 over the last survey. 
  There are few remaining full-blooded Ainu in Japan. Counted 
as Ainu in the survey were those thought to have at least some 
Ainu blood or those living in families with members who have 
Ainu blood. 
  The survey said the percentage of Ainu children going on to 
senior high school increased by 9 points to 87.4 percent, though 
it fell short of the 96.3 percent overall figure for Hokkaido 
children. A bigger gap surfaced in the figures for those 
children proceeding to university or college, with 11.8 percent 
for the relevant Ainu population compared with 27.5 percent for 
the overall population. 
  In a questionnaire targeting Ainu aged 15 and older, only 
7.3 
percent said they faced incidences of discrimination over the 
past six or seven years, while 62 percent said they had not. 
  Officials said the Hokkaido Prefectural Government intends 
to 
use the survey in planning its future Ainu welfare policies.

<F P=106> [Report on the speech by Kang Song-san, premier of the DPRK </F>
Administration Council and Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) 
deputy, entitled "On Successfully Fulfilling the Tasks of 
Socialist Economic Construction in the Period of Adjustment 
(wanchunggi) Set Forth by the Workers Party of Korea" delivered 
at the opening of the seventh session of the ninth SPA held at 
Mansudae Assembly Hall on the morning of 6 April] 
  [Text] [Begin Kan Song-san recording] Comrade deputies: At 
a time when all the working people are vigorously accelerating 
the general march of socialism under the wise leadership of the 
party and the leader [suryong], upholding the revolutionary 
banner of the chuche idea, today we are to discuss the matter of 
successfully fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic 
construction in the period of adjustment set forth by the 
Workers Party of Korea [WPK] at this SPA session. 
  The 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK Central Committee 
held last December summed up the status of the fulfillment of 
the Third Seven-Year Plan and set an adjustment period of three 
years and presented an economic strategy based on the scientific 
analysis of today's situation and the present state of our 
country's socialist economic construction. 
  Effecting a turn in socialist economic construction by 
thoroughly implementing the revolutionary economic strategy set 
forth by the party is the most important revolutionary task 
facing us today. 
  Solemnly pledging before the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, president of the DPRK, to fulfill the strategic goal 
set forth by our party by thoroughly implementing the 
revolutionary economic strategy at any cost, I am going to 
present to this SPA session measures to successfully fulfill the 
tasks in the period of adjustment of socialist economic 
construction. 
  Comrade deputies: Successfully fulfilling the tasks of 
socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set 
forth by the 21st plenary session of the sixth WPK Central 
Committee is of very important significance in the struggle to 
strengthen the might of the fatherland of chuche and to further 
add luster to the popular masses-centered socialism of our own 
style. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In 
socialist economic construction, we should set the upcoming 
three years as a period of adjustment as decided at the 21st 
plenary session of the sixth party Central Committee and should 
thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, 
light-industry-first, and trade-first policies during this 
period. Along with this, we should give priority to the coal 
industry, the electric power industry, and railway transport, 
which are the leading sectors of the national economy, and 
should continue to develop the metal industry. 
  The task of the period of adjustment of socialist economic 
construction is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first 
policy, the light-industry-first policy, the trade-first policy; 
to firmly give priority to the coal industry, the electric power 
industry, and railway transport--which are the leading sectors 
of the national economy--and to continue developing the metal 
industry. This is an economic strategy to rebuild [kaejo] the 
economic structure of the country in conformity with the changed 
international circumstances and the present demands of our 
national economy, and to bring about a change in the direction 
of foreign trade [taewoe muyogeso panghyang chonhwanul halte 
taehan]. 
  The basic objective of the economic strategy set forth by 
the 
party is to rapidly improve the people's livelihood by 
concentrating efforts on developing agriculture, light-industry, 
and trade in two to three years to come; to regularize 
production in all sectors by giving priority to the leading 
sectors of the national economy; and, thus, to fully enhance the 
might of the existing economic foundation. 
  That our party has set forth the adjustment period of three 
years and has determined its economic strategy is a wise step 
which makes it possible to deepen and develop our socialist 
construction to a new, high stage while consolidating the 
successes registered in the fulfillment of the Third Seven-Year 
Plan. [applause] 
  The party's revolutionary economic strategy is a most 
just-our-style economic strategy which totally corresponds to 
the basic interest of our revolution and construction and which 
precisely reflects the aspiration and desire of our people. 
  The revolutionary economic strategy, which should be 
implemented during the period of adjustment of socialist 
economic construction, reflects our party's firm decision and 
will to epochally upgrade the people's living standard within 
the near future and to develop our economy into an economy that 
has strong independence and does not waver under any 
circumstances and which can survive on its own strength. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is a most just 
economic construction plan which enables us to drastically 
enhance the people's living standard in compliance with the 
demand of socialism. [applause] 
  It is a supreme principle in our party's activities and a 
consistent policy of the republic's government to constantly 
upgrade the people's living standard. 
  Thanks to the wise leadership of the party and the leader 
and 
to the popular policies of the republic's government, today our 
people are enjoying a happy life without any worries and anxiety 
with all conditions of life such as food, clothes, and spending 
being ensured by the state and society. 
  When the revolutionary economic strategy put forward by our 
party is embodied, a new turning point will be effected in 
agriculture, light-industry, and foreign trade; and the 
long-cherished desire of all people to eat rice with meat soup, 
wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house will be 
brilliantly realized within the near future. At the same time, 
the people's material and cultural life will become more 
abundant and plentiful [touk yuntaekhago pungjokhata] according 
to the nature of socialist society. 
  The revolutionary economic strategy of our party is a just 
plan which enables us to further strengthen the self-reliance of 
socialist economy in our country and to firmly consolidate the 
nation's economic foundation. [applause] 
  Socialism was frustrated in many countries and capitalism 
was 
restored in recent years. By taking advantage of this, the 
maneuvers of the imperialists and reactionaries to isolate, 
suffocate, and crush our republic, have been intensified more 
than ever before. 
  Under such an acute situation and changed international 
circumstances, it is an important issue related to the future of 
the socialist cause to strengthen the independence and 
self-reliance of our economy in every way. 
  Only when we consolidate the foundation of the nation's 
self-reliant economy and strengthen its independence can we 
survive with our own strength without wavering under any 
economic blockade maneuvers of the imperialists. Thus, we can 
victoriously advance the popular mass-centered socialist cause 
of our own style. 
  When we effect a new turning point in the development of 
agriculture, light-industry, and trade by thoroughly carrying to 
accomplishment the party's revolutionary economic strategy, and 
when we continually develop the metal industry by giving 
priority to precedent domains of the national economy, the 
sectional structure [pubun kujo] of the economy will be further 
perfected and its self-reliance and might will be remarkably 
strengthened. 
  Our party's economic strategy is a just policy which enables 
us to successfully implement the basic line of economic 
construction in compliance with the prevailing situation and the 
development of realities. 
  From the outset, developing heavy industry with priority has 
not been aimed at developing heavy industry itself, but has been 
aimed at developing light-industry and agriculture rapidly 
through the attainment of speedy, expanded reproduction. At the 
same time, state management has been aimed at enhancing the 
people's living standard systematically. [wollae, chunggongobul 
usonchoguro palchon sikinungosun, ku chachee mokchogi innungosi 
anira, hwakttae chaesangsanui nopun sokttorul pojanghayo, 
kyonggongopkwa nongobul ppalli palchon sikigi wihangosimyo, 
kugyongun inmin saenghwarul chegyejoguro nopigi wihangosimnida]. 
  Truly, the revolutionary economic strategy which our party 
put forth firmly ensures a new great upswing in our country's 
socialist economic construction and promises a more rewarding 
future for our people's lives. [applause] 
  That our party set aside the period of adjustment for 
socialist economic construction and put forth a revolutionary 
economic strategy for this period was another important event in 
our country's socialist economic construction. At the same 
time, it was a revolutionary step that enables a firm prospect 
to be opened to positively cope with the prevailing situation 
and to attain a new high target of socialist construction. 
[applause] 
  Our party's revolutionary measure is a banner of struggle 
that arouses all the people vigorously to a new struggle and 
heroic exploits, deals a hard blow to the imperialists and 
reactionaries who vilify and attack socialism, and gives great 
hope and faith in victory to the world's progressive people who 
are heading for socialism. [applause] 
  We should successfully carry out the tasks for the period of 
adjustment of socialist economic construction with a great pride 
and self-respect in struggling with the revolutionary economic 
strategy under the leadership of the great leader and great 
party. 
  The agriculture-first policy is the task of primary 
importance we should persistently keep up in the period of 
adjustment. [applause] 
  We should thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy 
and bring forth a great upturn in all areas of agricultural 
production, including the production of grain, meat, eggs, 
fruits, and vegetables, so that we can smoothly solve the 
problem of food for the people. 
  In the historic letter to the national agricultural meeting 
"On the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Problem Under the Banner 
of the Socialist Rural Theses," the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song clearly elucidated the tasks and methods to realize the 
industrialization and modernization of agriculture and to 
drastically increase the overall agricultural production, 
including grain. We should uphold the great leader's plan and 
intent and achieve a great upswing in all areas of agricultural 
production. 
  Above all, we should solidify the successes attained in the 
irrigation and electrification that have been completed, and let 
their might be amply displayed. The irrigation facilities and 
equipment that have been built should be in good maintenance and 
repair. At the same time, we should actively introduce 
efficient irrigation methods, such as circular irrigation, 
vigorously push ahead with the technological modernization 
project aimed at converting the water-pumping and irrigation 
system into a multi-waterway watering system, and manage water 
scientifically and technologically so that our country's great 
circular irrigation system may be given full play. 
  In conformity with the rapidly increasing machinery and 
power 
facilities for farming and the ever-improving standard of 
farmers' cultural life, we should build more power supply 
facilities and improve the power supply system so as to 
satisfactorily fill the rural area's demand for electricity. 
  To further enhance the general mechanization and 
scientification standard of rural economy is an important task 
to solidify and modernize agriculture. We should boost the 
general mechanization and scientification standard of rural 
economy to free the farmers completely from hard and difficult 
labor, to continuously increase agricultural production, and to 
remove the gaps between industry and agriculture and between 
urban and rural areas. 
  To continuously enhance the general mechanization standard 
of 
the rural economy, we should maximize the utility rate of the 
available farm machines. At the same time, during the period of 
adjustment, we should increase the production and supply of 
various farm machines, including the production and supply of 
30,000 tractors and over 10,000 trucks, necessary to mechanize 
the difficult work requiring much manual labor. We should also 
smoothly solve the fuel problem for the rural economy. 
  In conformity with the enhancement of the general 
mechanization standard of the rural economy, we should make the 
paddies and fields into large-scale standardized and mechanized 
fields. 
  The chemicalization of the rural economy must be raised to 
a higher level. The fertilizer plants must be all the more well 
repaired, maintained, and modernized, and their productive 
capacity must be all the more created to sufficiently supply 
production conditions including electricity and coal so that 
various chemical fertilizers can be produced and supplied all 
the more. Also, micronutrient fertilizer including silica 
fertilizer, slightly burnt magnesia fertilizer, and boron 
fertilizer must be supplied in assortments. In addition, 
bio-fertilizer including the nitrogenous bacterial fertilizer 
and phosphate (?decomposite) fertilizer, and botanical growth 
accelerant must be produced more to send them to farms. Along 
with this, highly effective agricultural chemicals including 
spray chemicals, insecticide, and disinfectant must be smoothly 
produced and supplied. 
  In accordance with raising the overall mechanization and 
chemicalization of the rural economy at a high level, the method 
of farming and the land cultivation system were developed. 
Therefore, in the future, work must be carried out so that one 
farmer can farm over 10-chongbo [1 chongbo = 2.45 acres] fields 
in accordance with the party's plan and will. 
  Based on achievements accomplished in the modern biological 
field, the green revolution must be vigorously accelerated in 
the rural economy sector so that research and introduction can 
be carried out on high-grade strains of seeds, which are 
high-yielding, suitable to the climatic and soil conditions of 
our country, early-ripening, and resistant to storms, cold, 
moisture, blight, and harmful insects, including the first 
filial generations of rice and maize which can yield 12-15 
tonnes per chongbo. 
  An important reserve in increasing agricultural products 
lies 
in increasing the area of cultivated land. We must continue to 
vigorously push ahead with the tidal land reclamation project, 
and carry out the work to find new land through a mass movement 
to increase cultivated land and thoroughly protect it so that 
not even an inch of land is wasted. Also, cultivated land that 
is buried and washed away must be restored at the appropriate 
time. 
  Based on the agricultural technological revolution and the 
scientific and technological results in agriculture, we must 
develop the chuche farming method, carry out farm work 
scientifically and technologically in accordance with it, and in 
particular, the planned area for sowing and the number of plants 
per pyong [1 pyong = 3.954 square yards] must be thoroughly 
supplied to increase the yield per chongbo of fields from an 
average of over eight tonnes to over 10 tonnes so that the goal 
of producing 15 million tonnes of grain can be carried out 
annually in the near future. [end recording] 
  The speaker [pogoja] continued to point out that the area of 
orchards must be all the more increased and the fertility of 
soil enhanced so that fruit production during the period of 
adjustment can be increased by 30 percent. He said that the 
work in growing vegetables and basic fertilization management 
must be improved so that per chongbo yield can be increased 
considerably, and that the stock breeding industry must be 
further developed to increase meat production by over 30 percent 
so that the problem of meat can be solved smoothly. 
  The speaker talked about putting great strength in 
fulfilling 
the policy that light industry is the best to all the more 
defend, reinforce, and modernize the light-industry plants 
during the period of adjustment, so that its potential can be 
sufficiently manifested to normalize production at a high level. 
Therefore, textile production must be increased by over 20 
percent, shoe production by over 10 percent, and food processing 
industry must be all the more developed so that the people's 
dietary life can be all the more abundant and diversified. 
  The speaker said that the consistent policy of our party and 
the republic's government is to actively investigate and 
mobilize local raw materials and sources and inner reserves of 
the plants and enterprises in production of people's consumer 
goods, so that they can be used effectively. He continued to 
say that the weight of the production of people's consumer goods 
through local raw material in the local industrial sector must 
be at a level over 70 percent, and export bases must be firmly 
maintained through the mass movement to actively find sources 
for export so that more foreign currency can be earned [suchul 
wonchonul chokkuk chajanaeo tomanun oehwarul poltaedaehaeso 
malhaetta]. 
  The speaker talked about normalizing production at a high 
level at chemical plants and various plants and enterprises that 
supply raw material to light industry, so that production of 
synthetic fiber and synthetic resins including vinalon can be 
increased by 10 percent respectively during the period of 
adjustment. He also talked about smoothly producing and 
supplying various light industrial raw materials including 
paper, dyes, and basic chemical products. 
  While talking about bringing about a new upsurge in foreign 
trade in accordance with the changing environment, Premier Kang 
said that the policy that trade is the best must be highly 
upheld in all sectors of the people's economy, expand and 
strengthen export goods production bases, and vigorously carry 
out the struggle to raise the quality of goods so that exports 
of goods can be increased decisively. 
  The speaker said without promoting the leading sectors of 
the people's economy and developing the metal industry, the 
agriculture-first, light-industry-first, and trade-first policy 
cannot be implemented. He also said that during the period of 
adjustment, the production of coal and electricity and the 
volume of railway cargo transportation should be increased by 
over 1.3 times respectively, and the metal industry should be 
developed so that the increasing demand for steel material can 
be satisfactorily guaranteed. 
  The speaker continued his speech: 
  [Begin Kang recording] Comrade deputies, the tasks of 
socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment set 
forth by our party are historic and meaningful tasks of our 
people's struggle to complete the socialist cause. All the 
people should rise to carry out the rewarding tasks of struggle. 
[applause] 
  In order to successfully implementing the tasks of socialist 
economic construction in the period of adjustment, we should, 
above all, properly and flawlessly carry out economic 
organizational work and economic management. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In order to 
successfully carry out socialist economic construction, economic 
guidance and work management should be ceaselessly improved. 
  The question of successfully implementing the tasks of 
socialist economic construction in the period of adjustment 
depends on whether the State Administration Council [SAC] can 
fulfill its role or not. 
  We should thoroughly implement the policy of strengthening 
the system in which the SAC is the center responsible for 
economic works set forth by the party so that the party's 
unitary leadership in economic works is firmly established. The 
SAC should implement the party's economic strategy and policy 
without fail, taking a position of being wholly responsible for 
each and every work of the party and the people. 
  The responsible functionaries of the SAC will learn about 
strong discipline and order to flawlessly organize economic 
operations and organizational works for implementing economic 
strategy and the party's policy, promptly solve all the pending 
problems rising from the economic works in a revolutionary 
manner, strengthen hold on, guidance to, and control over all 
areas and units of economic works, including the committees and 
ministries, and the provincial administrative economic 
committees, and thoroughly execute the decisions and guidelines 
of the SAC. 
  Highly displaying the creativity of every unit on the basis 
of firmly guaranteeing the country's unified guidance is one of 
the fundamental principles of socialist economic management. 
  We should provide conditions for the committees and 
ministries, provinces, cities, counties, plants, and enterprises 
to highly display their creativity and should actively help 
them. In particular, we should produce more goods demanded in 
people's daily living by mobilizing local resources and reserves 
to the maximum in provinces, cities, and counties, and 
vigorously wage a struggle to secure resources internally 
instead of being reliant to the center. 
  Improving the planning of works is one of the important 
demands of socialist economic construction and one of the 
fundamental conditions of successfully implementing the party's 
revolutionary economic strategy. 
  Economic guidance functionaries should properly coordinate 
economic balance under the principle of making everything 
obedient to implementing the economic strategy presented by the 
party, practically draw up the people's economic plan, and 
implement daily, monthly, quarterly, and indexical national 
plans without fail bearing a correct view and attitude that the 
reform of the people's economy is the party's order and the 
country's law. 
  We should give priority in unconditionally guaranteeing 
electricity, coal, raw material, and equipment for agriculture, 
light industry, and external trade sectors by properly carrying 
out the material supply work, and should thoroughly guarantee 
material and equipment demanded by the leading sectors of the 
people's economy and the metal industry. 
  All domains and units of the people's economy should 
actively 
help agriculture, light industry, and external trade sectors and 
vigorously carry out the people's support movement to these 
sectors. 
  We should thoroughly implement the duty of the Taean work 
system, and maximize economic efficiency in production and 
management by pushing ahead with the management of labor, 
equipment, and material and by taking good care of economic 
assets. Under the party committee's collective guidance, we 
should also scientifically and reasonably manage and operate the 
economy so that the true superiority of the collective economic 
management and operation method is further displayed. 
  In economic management, we should properly utilize 
economic leverages such as cost, price, and profit; correctly 
implement the independent accounting system; and intensify 
control by won [Korean monetary unit]. 
  To successfully carry out the tasks for the period of 
adjustment in socialist economic construction, we should 
vigorously conduct the struggle to produce more and save more. 
One who produces more and saves more is the true loyalist and 
patriot today. 
  All sectors and units should wage a vigorous struggle to 
produce more and save more as a mass movement, while efficiently 
carrying out the economy of the country in a position befitting 
masters, taking good care of the properties of the state and 
society, and effectively utilizing idle materials and waste 
materials. By so doing, they should increase production to the 
maximum degree with the available labor, facilities, and 
materials. 
  The key to the produce-more and save-more strategy is to 
innovate technology in all sectors of the people's economy. We 
should go deep among the producing masses, actively arouse the 
producers' wisdom and creativity, and see to it that scientists 
and technicians exert their patriotic enthusiasm and talents so 
that they can come up with more valuable scientific and 
technological inventions, technologically innovative ideas, 
creative ideas, and rationalization ideas, so that they can be 
used effectively in production. 
  We should set up scientific and technological measures to 
introduce in the production facilities and processes the 
technology of plasma and heat radiation and the method of 
compound (?burning material) and to effectively use low calorie 
coal, [choyoltan], low-grade coal [poroktan--"bony coal"], and 
meta-anthracite coal. We should make sure that methane gas and 
(?grass briquettes) [`choyontan' not `chomuyontan'] coal are 
used extensively in the provincial and rural areas. 
  Our party's revolutionary economic strategy is the strategy 
of self-reliance and fortitude. Self-reliance and fortitude is 
the resolute revolutionary spirit with which one is resolved to 
carry out the revolution and construction to the end with one's 
own strength. It is the indomitable struggle spirit to adhere 
to the revolutionary banner in the face of any obstacle and 
difficulty. As we have advanced up to today under the 
revolutionary banner of self- reliance and fortitude, so we must 
in the future as well complete the cause of socialism under this 
slogan. [applause] 
  Self-reliance and creative (?participation) -- this should 
be 
the struggle ethos and work ethos of our functionaries. As we 
supported the front in the grim days of war by producing hand 
grenades with bare hands and effected the chollima upsurge from 
the empty lot after the war upholding the party by increasing 
steel production under the party's slogan "Let us vigorously 
accelerate the general onward march of socialism with the 
revolutionary spirit of self- reliance and fortitude," so we 
should thoroughly carry out the economic tasks for the period of 
adjustment. 
  If we create something out of nothing and struggle with the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, there will 
be nothing we cannot accomplish. Our functionaries should 
precisely fulfill the economic task entrusted to their sectors 
and units, producing what they need and making available what is 
short with an attitude and position befitting masters. By so 
doing, they should powerfully demonstrate once again the 
indomitable struggle spirit and heroic spirit of our people who 
advance under the banner of self-reliance. [applause] 
  To successfully carry out the tasks for the period of 
adjustment under the grave situation where the imperialists and 
reactionaries are more viciously maneuvering to crush our 
republic, we should further strengthen the wholehearted unity of 
the revolutionary ranks. Wholehearted unity is an immortal, 
glorious tradition of our revolution and a banner of victory. 
  To effect a new upsurge in socialist economic construction 
upholding the party's revolutionary economic strategy, we 
should, in the future as well as we have done in the past, 
vigorously advance under the banner of wholehearted unity. We 
must push through the grim situation countering it [chunomhan 
chongserul matppada ttulko nagaya hamyo] with the might of 
wholehearted unity, and crush [chitpusigo] the enemy's maneuvers 
with the might of wholehearted unity in order to carry out the 
tasks for the period of adjustment. 
  All the functionaries and working people should arm 
themselves firmly with the chuche revolutionary outlook. Uniting 
more firmly around the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and our 
party, they must powerfully display the might of wholehearted 
unity of the chuche revolutionary rank in carrying out the tasks 
for the period of adjustment. [applause] 
  Invincible is the might of the popular masses who have 
formed 
a solid socio-political living organism firmly united around the 
party center in terms of ideology, volition, morality, and 
fidelity and cherishing the greatness of the party and the 
leader as their absolute faith. [applause] 
  We should become true loyalists and dutiful children who 
resolutely protect and defend the party and the leader in any 
adversity and invariably and loyally uphold the party's 
leadership. 
  We should become the resolute advocator and thorough 
implementor of the party's policy with the firm faith and will 
as in the slogan "What the party decides, we will do," and the 
standard-bearers of struggle who unconditionally carry out the 
tasks for the period of adjustment in socialist economic 
construction. 
  The economic tasks set for us for the period of adjustment 
are heavy and enormous, and in the course of implementing them, 
there can be difficulties and trials. However, as long as we 
have the tested leadership of the party Central Committee headed 
by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, as long as we 
have the inexhaustible might of the popular masses 
wholeheartedly united around the party and the leader, and as 
long as we have the strong socialist economic base of 
self-reliance with the chuche industry as its backbone, there is 
no difficulty we cannot overcome, nor any fortress we cannot 
occupy. [applause] 
  There is no force in the world that can block the way of our 
people who advance with redoubled courage and in high spirits. 
  Next year, we will be greeting the 50th anniversary of 
national liberation and the 50th anniversary of the founding of 
the Workers Party of Korea. We must bring forth decisive 
progress in carrying out the economic tasks for the period of 
adjustment by effecting a new great revolutionary upsurge to 
brighten these significant anniversaries which are historically 
significant in the struggle of our party and people with high 
political enthusiasm and heroic exploits. 
  The tasks for the period of adjustment in socialist economic 
construction are exceedingly rewarding and resplendent, and we 
are assured of victory. Let us all be firmly united around the 
party and the leader and wage a general onward march toward the 
new position to charge at in order to occupy a new higher hill 
of socialist construction under the banner of the three 
revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--with the 
spirit of chollima to which the speed of the nineties is added. 
[applause] [end recording]

<F P=106> ["On Review of Performance of DPRK State Budget for 1993 and </F>
State Budget for 1994" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Deputy Yun Ki-chong, 
minister of finance, delivered a report on the second agenda 
item "On the Review of the Performance of the State Budget of 
the DPRK for 1993 and the State Budget for 1994" at the 
second-day sitting of the 7th session of the Ninth Supreme 
People's Assembly [SPA] today. 
  Yun Ki-chong quoted the great leader President Kim Il-song 
as 
saying: 
  "Last year, while achieving one victory after another under 
the party's leadership in the political and military 
confrontation with the enemy, our people glorified the final 
year of the Third Seven-Year Plan by displaying great 
revolutionary enthusiasm and accelerating the construction of 
the socialist economy." 
  According to the report, the state budget was successfully 
performed last year with a great upswing in socialist economic 
construction. 
  The total revenue of the state budget last year was 
40,571,200,000 won, or 100.3 percent of the plan and 2.6 percent 
up on the previous year, and the total expenditure of the state 
budget was 40,242,970,000 won, or 99.5 percent of the plan and 
2.4 percent up on the previous year. 
  As a result, the state budget last year was successfully 
performed, leaving a financial reserve of 328,230,000 won after 
fully meeting the increasing financial demands of various 
sectors of socialist construction. 
  During the Third Seven-Year plan, the state budgetary 
revenue 
of the DPRK Government increased at the rate of 5.2 percent on a 
yearly average, augmenting the total scale of the budgetary 
revenue 40 percent. 
  Thus, the state budget in Korea has greatly contributed to 
increasing the potential of the socialist independent economy, 
developing socialist national culture, promoting the material 
and cultural welfare of the people and bringing into full play 
the advantages of Korean-style socialism. This eloquently shows 
the great advantages and solidity of the state budget of Korea 
developing in a planned way in reliance on the independent 
financial basis and the validity of the financial policy of the 
Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]. 
  Last year, the DPRK Government increased the appropriations 
for the national economy 2.5 percent as against the previous 
year and markedly boosted the investments in the preferential 
sectors of the national economy, the light industry and 
agriculture. 
  The investments in the coal industry, the mining industry, 
the power industry and the metal industry rose 3.5 percent 
compared with the previous year. 
  The coal production capacity has grown remarkably with the 
construction projects of new coal mines and new pits including 
the Hwaphong coal mine of the Anju District coal mining complex 
and the expansion projects of the existing pits promoted and 
completed last year. 
  The Komdok general mining enterprise and other big promising 
mines were expanded, with the result that the output of the 
concentrates of lead and zinc and other valuable ores augmented. 
  The construction of the Kumgangsan and Yongwon power 
stations 
and other large-scale hydraulic power stations and thermal power 
stations was promoted vigorously. The metal plants were 
consolidated as self-reliant and modern metallurgical bases. 
  Last year the DPRK Government allotted to the light industry 
vast amount of fund 4 percent greater than the previous year. 
  As a result, great innovations were effected in the 
production of daily necessities in urgent need for the 
improvement of the people's living standard. 
  The capacity expansion project of the Kusong textile mill 
and 
the construction projects of the March 4 factory, the Nanam 
garment factory and other modern textile and garment factories, 
shoe-making factories and food processing factories were 
completed and the equipment of the light industrial factories 
was streamlined energetically. 
  The large appropriations for rail transport last year was 3 
percent up on the previous year. Heavy rails were introduced 
and railway lines were modernised at an accelerated pace, and 
the electrification of various railway sections and the laying 
of new rails were completed, with the result that the rail 
transport capacity grew considerably. 
  Last year the DPRK Government increased the investment in 
agriculture 2.8 percent as against the previous year. 
  President Kim Il-song in his historic letter to the national 
agricultural conference held on the lapse of 30 years since the 
publication of "Theses on the Socialist Rural Question in Our 
Country" reviewed the great achievements made by our party and 
people in the efforts to implement the rural theses. He 
declared that with the realization of irrigation, 
electrification and mechanization of agriculture, and with an 
extensive application of chemicals in farming in Korea, the 
historic task of the rural technical revolution set forth in the 
socialist rural theses has been carried out in the main. 
  This is an epoch-making change in the countryside of Korea 
and the most brilliant victory in the efforts to implement the 
rural theses. 
  The material and technical foundations of agriculture were 
strengthened and the chuche method of farming strictly applied, 
with the result that bumper crops were reaped last year in spite 
of unfavourable weather. 
  Last year, the DPRK Government channelled funds 1.5 percent 
greater than the previous year into housing construction and the 
management of towns and land. 
  The state increased the appropriations for scientific and 
technological development 7 percent and those for education 3.5 
percent last year as against the previous year. 
  More than 20 universities and colleges including 
universities 
of technology, agriculture and physical education made their 
appearance last year. 
  The appropriations for various popular measures to further 
promote the wellbeing of the people was increased in the last 
year's state budget, granting them great additional benefits at 
the expense of the state. 
  In our country where the tax system was totally abolished 20 
years ago, the factory and office employees are supplied with 
food almost free of charge at the expense of the state, the 
universal free education and medical care are in force and 
factory and office workers and peasants are given dwelling 
houses free of charge. Billions of won were disbursed for these 
policies last year, too. 
  During the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, the WPK and 
the DPRK Government invariably took various communistic, popular 
measures for the people, not decreasing the huge financial 
burden of the state even under the rapidly changing situation. 
In this period, epochal measures were taken to raise the 
salaries of the factory and office workers and technicians 43.4 
percent on an average, largely increase the pensions of those 
who benefit by social security and the scholarship of students 
of schools at all levels and raise the purchase price of some 
farm products including rice and maize so that the peasants 
might earn a larger income share. 
  Last year, the DPRK Government directed 11.5 percent of 
the total expenditure of the state budget to national defence to 
firmly defend the security of the socialist motherland and the 
gains of the revolution. 
  Today our military potential has become mighty enough to 
drive back any provocation and surprise attack of the enemy. 
  Referring to the state budget for 1994, the reporter said: 
  This year's state budget has been made according to the new 
revolutionary economic strategy shaped by the WPK in such a 
manner as to concentrate the nation's financial resources on 
implementing the agriculture-first, light industry-first and 
foreign trade-first policies and giving priority to the 
preferential sectors of the national economy and further 
increase the might of the country's socialist independent 
economy. 
  In the state budget the total revenue and the total 
expenditure are equally set at 41,525,190,000 won, the former 
2.4 percent up and the latter 3.2 percent up on last year. 
  This year, the DPRK Government will increase appropriations 
for the national economy 3.2 percent as against last year, of 
which a large amount of the state fund will be directed 
preferentially to developing agriculture, light industry and 
foreign trade. 
  The state is expected to increase the investment in 
agriculture 6 percent and that in light industry 5.4 percent 
above last year. 
  The state investment in the expansion and consolidation of 
the export goods production bases will go up 4.1 percent above 
last year. 
  This year's state budget envisages that the investment in 
coal and power industries and railway transport will be 
increased 3 percent and that in metal industry 26 percent as 
compared with last year. 
  The DPRK Government will increase the appropriations for the 
socialist cultural policies at 2.8 percent, those for scientific 
development 4 percent and education 2 percent above last year. 
  This year, the government will increase the appropriations 
for the popular measures so that the people may enjoy greater 
state benefits in the form of free education and medical care, 
the upbringing and education of children at the expense of the 
state, social insurance and social security, etc. 
  This year, too, it will send a large amount of educational 
aid funds and stipends to Korean children in Japan. 
  It will allocate 11.6 percent of the total expenditure of 
the 
state budget to national defence to consolidate the defence 
capacity of the nation in face of the enemy's war provocation 
moves. 
  The reporter said this year's state budget submitted for 
deliberation at the SPA was a chuche-based, defendable budget 
that definitely guarantees the fulfilment of the vast tasks of 
the economic construction set by the party with domestic 
financial resources in reliance on the solid foundations of the 
socialist independent economy. She also said it was a popular 
and revolutionary budget that will help improve the material and 
cultural living standard of the people, increase the might of 
the country and bring the advantages of Korean-style socialism 
into full play.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Dag Norum, 
international secretary of the Norwegian Communist Party, was 
interviewed by KCNA in Pyongyang on March 30. 
  He said that to remove the danger of a nuclear war and ease 
the tensions on the Korean peninsula where an acute military 
confrontation continues is an important question directly linked 
to peace and security of the world at present. 
  Charging that the United States is committing insincere act, 
deploying Patriot missiles in South Korea by reversing the 
agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York, 
he said: "The Norwegian Communist Party strongly opposes the 
shipment of new mass destruction weapons to South Korea." 
  He held that the United States must not resort to 
"sanctions", but work for a peaceful solution of the Korean 
question through dialogue and negotiation. 
  "If the United States think it will be able to bring the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to its knees by strength, 
it is a big mistake," he said, and added: "The United States 
must abandon its anachronistic dream."

  [Text] According to reports, U.S. papers have recently came 
out publicly with bellicose assertions opposing our country. 
  According to reports by the Voice of America on 4 April, THE 
NEW YORK TIMES ran amok in an editorial that the United States 
should at once bomb North Korea's nuclear facilities. U.S. 
TODAY has said this and that on the inevitability of unleashing 
a war on the Korean peninsula. 
  A U.S. defense magazine, AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, 
on 5 April reported that the United States has worked out a plan 
to deploy ultramodern ground equipment to South Korea so as to 
directly analyze information sent by a spy satellite. 
  In an interview with National Broadcasting Company [NBC] 
Television Network on 3 April, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who 
has carelessly set out war outbursts [pokon] and disguisedly 
revealed a warmonger's true color, again brought up North 
Korea's fictitious nuclear development. He said that even at 
the cost of triggering a war on the Korean peninsula, the United 
States will suspend the development of nuclear arms. Raving 
that the United States will not rely on diplomatic means but 
take the road of pressuring North Korea, including imposing 
sanctions, he let loose outbursts that the United States will 
not exclude the possibility of a preemptive military strike on 
North Korea. 
  Timed to coincide with the U.S. military heads' war 
outbursts, the U.S. papers' bellicose assertions opposing us, 
which are being revealed more nakedly, provoke just vigilance.

<F P=106> ["Paid Trumpeters Dancing to the Tune of Warmaniacs" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- THE NEW YORK TIMES in 
an editorial kicked up a war hysteria, crying for a prompt 
bombing raid on the nuclear sites of North Korea by the United 
States, according to Voice of America April 4. 
  USA TODAY also clamoured about "the inevitability of a war 
on 
the Korean peninsula." 
  The U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry has let loose a 
string of bellicose outbursts, fully revealing his true color as 
a warmaniac. In an interview with the U.S. NBC Television on 
April 3, he again brought forward the fiction of "nuclear arms 
development by North Korea" and declared that the United States 
was ready for a war adventure to check it. 
  Responding to the bellicose utterances of a U.S. brasshat, 
paid trumpeters of the United States are coming out with 
nonsensical arguments against the DPRK. 
  The very one bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war over 
the Korean peninsula is the United States which is threatening 
the DPRK with nuclear weapons. 
  In vociferating about the fictitious "nuclear weapons 
development" by North Korea, the U.S. warlikers seek to find a 
pretext to stifle the socialist system of the DPRK. 
  Ignoring this stark fact, paid trumpeters of the U.S. are 
dancing to the drum-beating of the warmaniacs. This shows that 
they are despicable hackwriters who have thrown away justice and 
conscience, impartiality and truth of the press like a pair of 
wornout shoes for a few dollars. 
  The trumpeters bribed by the U.S. bellicose elements would 
be 
well advised to act with discretion, drawing a proper lesson 
from the doom of such warmaniacs as Hitler and Tojo who perished 
in the flame of the war of aggression kindled by them to 
subjugate other countries and nations and from the doom of the 
hackwriters who played into their hands.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Overseas Korean 
compatriots have protested against the U.S. imperialists' 
shipment of "Patriot" missiles into South Korea. 
  The European regional headquarters of the National Alliance 
for the Country's Reunification, in a statement, expressed a 
surging indignation at the introduction of patriots and other 
sophisticated weapons into South Korea by the United States, 
saying it is increasing the war crisis on the Korean peninsula. 
  Kim Chong-su, chairman of the Association of Koreans in 
Japan 
for Peaceful Reunification, said in a press statement: 
  The United States is sending its military intelligence team 
and a large quantity of latest-type weapons to South Korea and 
scheming large-scale military exercises there. This is an 
unpardonable criminal act intended to keep hold on South Korea 
as its colony and military base and, furthermore, into its 
nuclear forward base, military information-gathering centre and 
to lead the situation of the Korean peninsula to the grave brink 
of war. 
  The Federation of South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and 
Unification in a statement strongly urged the United States to 
withdraw at once the projected Patriots deployment in South 
Korea and stop all kinds of war games including the provocative 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises.

  [Text] According to a military source, the U.S. 
imperialists brought in succession overseas-based 
fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, vertical takeoff and 
landing assault planes and an early warning plane, and tanker 
planes to South Korea, and staged provocative joint air war 
exercises against the North. 
  On 4 April, an E-3 early warning plane, FA-18 
pursuit-assault 
planes, AV-8 VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] assault planes 
and KC-135 tanker planes rushed to bases of U.S. Air Force in 
South Korea. Following this, on 5 April, formations of military 
airplanes belonging to the U.S. Marine Corps and tanker planes 
again flew into bases of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea. 
  These military airplanes, deployed from overseas bases, ran 
amok with exercises, such as a surprise bombing on ground 
targets, air attack and support of ground attack, with the skies 
above Oeyon islet, Chungju, Tanyang and Pyongchang as 
operational theaters, in coordination with several hundreds of 
fighter-bombers, pursuit- assault planes, observation planes and 
reconnaissance planes of the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and 
the puppet air force. 
  On 4 April, an E-3 early warning plane, called a flying 
commanding post, commanded airplanes, which ran wild with joint 
air war exercises, by searching targets under the protection by 
formations of pursuit-assault planes. 
  On 4 and 5 April, KC-135 tanker planes refueled 50-odd F-16 
fighter-bombers and A-10 assault planes engaged in air war 
exercises, by making shuttle flights between the skies over the 
sea off Kunsan and Tokchok Island for a long time, thus 
instigating an atmosphere of war. 
  These gun powder-reeking and frenzied war exercises were an 
extremely dangerous play with fire aimed at promoting actual 
combat capabilities of overseas-based airplanes for mobilization 
to bases in South Korea and for a surprise northward attack 
under coordination with formations of airplanes belonging to the 
U.S. Air Force in South Korea and the puppet Air Force. 
  Meanwhile, the South Korean puppets ran wild with exercises 
by firing guns and conducting helicopter operation before our 
eyes in the foremost frontline. 
  On 4 and 5 April, large-caliber artillery units of the 
puppet 
Army, which were mobilized and deployed in areas in Majon-ni, 
Yonchon County, and in Kangsan-ni and Sangsan-ni in Chorwon 
County in South Korean Kangwon Province, indiscriminately fired 
more than 60 shells at areas near the Demilitarized Zone. Armed 
hooligans of the puppet Army occupied the attack starting points 
in Pangmong-ni, Paju County, Chokkori, Yonchon County, and 
Oechon-ni and Yulli in Chorwon-up, Chorwon County in the South 
Korean Kangwon Province, and fired more than 1,000 shells of 
large-caliber machine guns and automatic rifles, thus showing 
war hysterics. 
  On 5 April, formations of helicopter gunships and transport 
helicopters of the puppet Army staged missile strike and 
airlifting exercises, making low- and ultralow-altitude flights 
in the skies above Paju and Yonchon areas. 
  Warplanes mobilized in various air war games against the 
North which were staged over South Korea on 4 and 5 April 
totaled more than 700. 
  Such provocative military moves by the U.S. imperialists and 
the South Korean puppets, which are becoming more reckless at a 
time when frenzied, bellicose remarks were made by the U.S. 
military leaders one after another, are indeed alarming. 
  The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets must act 
with discretion, clearly mindful of the seriousness of the 
tensions created on the Korean peninsula.

pursuit-assault planes, AV-8 VTOL [vertical takeoff and landing] 
assault planes and KC-135 tanker planes to South Korea for 
provocative joint air war exercises against the Northern half of 
Korea, military sources said. 
  Exercises, such as a surprise bombing on ground targets, air 
attack and support of ground attack, were staged with the skies 
above Chungju, Tanyang and Pyongchang as operational theatres. 
They involved hundreds of fighter-bombers, assault planes, 
observation planes and reconnaissance planes belonging to the 
U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet Airforce. 
  In another development, the South Korean puppets on April 4 
and 5 fired shells and volleys of large-calibre machinegun and 
automatic rifle bullets into spots near the Demilitarized Zone 
in Yonchon and Paju Counties, Kyonggi Province, and Chorwon 
County, South Korean Kangwon Province. 
  On the 5th of April, formations of helicopter gunships and 
transport helicopters of the puppet Army staged missile strike

flights in the skies above Paju and Yonchon areas. 
  Warplanes mobilized in various air war games against the 
North which were staged in skies above South Korea in two days

  Very ill-boding are provocative military moves of the U.S. 
imperialists and the South Korean puppets which are becoming all

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Political parties and 
representatives of many countries denounced the U.S. hostile 
policy toward Korea. 
  The national committee of the Workers' Party of Zaire in a 
statement on March 30 said that the situation of the Korean 
peninsula has become acute due to the provocative moves of the 
United States and vehemently denounced the bellicose U.S. 
administration's hostile policy toward Korea. 
  The statement demanded that the United States discontinue 
the 
"Team Spirit" joint military exercises as it promised to the 
DPRK and stop the deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea 
and the United Nations keep aloof from the U.S. moves of 
aggression. 
  The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ecuador in a 
statement on March 29 called upon the peaceloving people of the 
world to put a stop to the arrogant military action of the U.S. 
imperialists for deploying "Patriot" missiles in South Korea and 
igniting a new war and to extend firm solidarity with the Korean 
people's cause of justice. 
  A letter of protest was sent to the U.N. secretary general 
on 
March 28 by Guillermo Santiago, representative of the Dominican 
Communist Party; Camilo Gonzalez, representative of the Chilean 
Popular Unity Action Movement; Luis Agoes, representative of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party of Panama; Mauricio Castro, 
representative of the Salvadorian Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front; and Mauricio Santillana Oliva, representative 
of the Communist Party of Chile, who are resident in Cuba. 
  The letter demanded that the U.N. no more be used as an 
arena 
of bargaining among big powers and that the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula be resolved through DPRK-USA talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 5 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] -- 
Ho Chong-man, chief vice-chairman of the Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon), on April 5 was invited to address a general 
meeting and a roundtable talk on Japan-Korea Affairs of the 
Japan-Korea Committee of the Japan Social Democratic Party 
(JSDP). 
  Referring to the current situation surrounding the "nuclear 
issue", Ho Chong-man said the United States is entirely to blame 
for the situation in which the agreed conclusions reached at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York on Februray 25 and the Feb. 15 
agreement between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency had been reversed, and for the situation of the Korean 
peninsula which is rushing headlong to the brink of war. 
  He said that the "presidential statement" of the UN Security 
Council was another international pressure upon the DPRK and 
that such "threat" and "pressure" could never be a solution to 
the problem. 
  "The `nuclear issue' must be solved fairly in keeping with 
the special status of the DPRK in which it has temporarily 
suspended the effectuation of its announced withdrawal from the 
treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," he said, 
expressing the hope that the JSDP would play a positive role to 
this end.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
denounce the recent publication of a "presidential statement" by 
the UN Security Council [UNSC] urging the DPRK to accept an 
additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
as a very wrong act contrary to the aim and principle of the UN 
charter. 
  Stating that the DPRK's "nuclear issue" is not a matter to 
be 
discussed by the UN Security Council, a news analyst of NODONG 
SINMUN says: 
  The DPRK is in a special status after temporarily suspending 
the effectuation of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. Accordingly, it is not obliged to 
undergo routine and ad hoc inspections by the agency. 
  If the UN Security Council is willing to resolve the nuclear 
issue of the Korean peninsula, it should take issue with the 
United States that is laying hurdles in the way of the solution 
of the nuclear issue and wrecking peace and security with a huge 
quantity of nuclear weapons, and its underlings, the South 
Korean authorities. 
  When it caviled at the DPRK, the UN Security Council showed 
that it was applying a double standard and playing into the 
hands of the United States in its policy of stifling the DPRK. 
  It must bear due responsibility for the consequences of its 
illegal dealing with the DPRK's "nuclear issue" against the aim 
and principle of the UN charter. 
  A news analyst of MINJU CHOSON warns that when the United 
States and its followers are further expanding their anti-DPRK 
pressure kickup, taking the "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to the 
international arena, the DPRK cannot but take an appropriate 
measure. 
  It is the will and invariable stand of the DPRK to maintain 
an independent policy and not to allow any unwarrantable 
demands, declares the paper.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Korean National 
Peace Committee published a statement Wednesday in connection 
with the fact that peace and security of the Korean peninsula 
face a grave challenge. 
  The statement resolutely denounces the maneuverings of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean ruling quarters to deploy 
new-type missiles and provoke another war, branding them as an 
outrageous challenge to the sincere efforts of the DPRK and its 
people for peace and peaceful reunification of the country, as 
an unpardonable criminal act of driving the Korean peninsula 
into a whirlwind of confrontation and war. 
  The military moves by the U.S. imperialists and the South 
Korean puppets remind us of the situation on the eve of the 
Korean war in the '50s, it notes. 
  The shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea by the 
U.S. 
imperialists and their stooges can be justified on no account, 
the statement says, and stresses: 
  The entire fellow countrymen in the North and the South and 
overseas should turn out as one in an anti-U.S., anti-war, and 
anti-nuke struggle to smash by their united efforts the moves of 
the United States and the Kim Yong-sam group to introduce 
patriot and provoke another war, which will wreck peace of the 
Korean peninsula. 
  If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets dare 
to 
provoke a war against the North, the Korean people will mete out 
a severe punishment to the enemy, demonstrating the dignity and 
stamina of chuche Korea to the world.

<F P=106> ["Second Cocom Must Not Be Allowed" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Western 
imperialists including the United States and Japan are 
reportedly scheming to lay a new embargo on the anti-imperialist 
independent countries including the DPRK under the pretext of 
"prevention of terrorism and regional dispute" in the wake of 
the March 31 disbandment of the Coordinating Committee for 
Export to Communist Area (Cocom). 
  Japan is most zealous in this. The Japanese authorities 
openly declared they would strictly control the goods banned by 
the Cocom, charging some countries with "terrorism" and 
"dispute," the NHK reported recently. 
  This shows the Japanese Government is sticking to the 
hostile 
policy to the DPRK. It is an unpardonable challenge motivated 
by the urge to isolate and stifle the DPRK through pressure and 
"sanctions" and, at the same time, block the movement of the 
world revolutionary people for independence against imperialism. 
  The persistent effort of the imperialists of the West 
including the United States and Japan to fabricate a second 
Cocom for their sinister political purpose under the cloak of 
"prevention of terrorism" and "regional dispute" after the end 
of the Cold War is an anachronistic act of those who remain a 
captive to the concept of confrontation. 
  It is outrageous of them to use "prevention of terrorism" 
and 
"regional dispute" as a pretext to fake up a second Cocom. 
  It is the United States where terrorism is openly pursued as 
a state policy under the cloak of "prevention of terrorism," and 
it is also the United States that encourages regional disputes 
in the world and makes the situation more complicated through 
interference. 
  It is ridiculous of the masterminds of international 
terrorism and regional disputes to take a new measure of export 
ban, charging some countries with "terrorism and regional 
disputes." 
  Although the Western imperialists are working to fabricate a 
second Cocom after its disbandment and put a spoke in the wheel 
of the movement of the world revolutionary people for 
independence against imperialism, it is a foolish attempt. 
  They must revoke the new measure of embargo, clearly mindful 
that their criminal act against the trend of the times will only 
run up against strong criticism and rejection from the world 
people.

  [Text] The Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front [SKNDF] on 30 March published a white paper 
revealing that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are for nuclear 
development. 
  Saying that the Kim Yong-sam clique misled the public 
opinion by insisting that the experimental reactors of North 
Korea are for the development of nuclear weapons, so as to kick 
up anti-North smear campaign, the white paper pointed out that 
this is like an act of a thief turning on the victim with a club. 
  The white paper maintained that the reactors used for the 
development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula are not 
the experimental reactor of North Korea, which has generating 
capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, but the heavy water reactor in 
Wolsong with 678,700 kilowatt and the multipurpose research 
reactor in Taedok with 30,000 kilowatt. 
  Based on accurate materials, the white paper expressed that 
the Wolsong heavy water reactor is a reactor for the development 
of nuclear weapons disguised as one for commercial use. It added 
that it is a plutonium-producing reactor, introduced for the 
development of nuclear weapons and not for commercial use, in 
view of its purpose and structure. The white paper disclosed 
that the Wolsong heavy water reactor disgorges a large amount of 
spent fuel containing high-level plutonium and is used directly 
for the development of nuclear weapons. 
  In addition, the white paper pointed out that the 
multipurpose research reactor complex is a reactor exclusively 
for nuclear arms development under the veil of research. The 
white paper exposed that the multipurpose research reactor is a 
reactor for the development of nuclear weapons set up in the 
eighties as an alternate project as the attempt to introduce it 
for the key role in the nuclear development in the seventies had 
failed. 
  The white paper revealed on the basis of the accurate 
materials that the multipurpose research reactor is not an 
experimental reactor with a peaceful purpose but for military 
use which is used as a diazole in the production of nuclear 
weapons, and said the problem lies on the fact it is closely 
linked with reprocessing facilities. 
  The white paper insists that all these facts prove that the 
Wolsong heavy water reactor and the multipurpose research 
reactor in Taedok are for the military use, and it is South 
Korea, not North Korea, which confronts the denuclearization of 
the Korean peninsula. 
  The white paper said that the South Korean authorities are 
openly claiming the reexamination of the joint declaration on 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and eager to 
develop the nuclear weapons by openly calling for nuclear 
option. If this is not true, the white paper maintains, the 
South Korean authorities must give up the policy of nuclear arms 
development pushed ahead in accordance with the anti-North 
nuclear smear campaign, and declare the removal of the heavy 
water reactor and the multipurpose research reactor which are 
used for the production of nuclear weapons.

<F P=106> ["Crackdown on Trade Unions Condemned"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
group's suppression of South Korean trade unions is under fire 
in MINJU CHOSON today. 
  The analyst says: 
  The South Korean puppets a few days ago arrested a working 
member, the organizational section chief and two other core 
members of the Ulsan-based Hyundai Heavy Industries Trade Union 
on the suspicion of the violation of "the National Security Law" 
(NSL). Meanwhile, the puppet Labour Ministry put forward "a 
policy of intensifying investigation into the operation" of 
trade unions and announced that it "would be promoted from the 
viewpoint of reforms." 
  These facts clearly show how craftily and viciously the foxy 
traitor Kim Yong-sam is working to suppress trade unions. 
  The suppression is aimed at keeping the workers from being 
awakened and organized and from taking a massive action through 
trade unions. 
  Last year in which the traitor came to power, 2,590 workers 
were put on the "want" list and more than 3,000 workers were 
fired unjustifiably for their involvement in the labour movement. 
  As if it were not enough, the Kim Yong-sam group arrested 
core elements of trade unions by invoking the notorious "NSL" 
and is going to intensify "investigation into the operation" of 
trade unions. This reveals their consciousness of crisis. 
  The reality proves that, with the Kim Yong-sam group left 
alone, it is impossible for the South Korean workers to win the 
right to existence, let alone democratic freedom. 
  The South Korean workers will vigorously struggle to 
overthrow the traitor Kim Yong-sam engaged in anti-popular 
misrule and establish an independent, democratic government, 
concludes the analyst.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon), the 
vanguard organization of one million students in South Korea, 
reportedly contended, in a document adopted at a rally, that the 
United States should find a key to the solution of what it calls 
"nuclear issue" of the North in the improvement of relations 
with the North, not in pressure. 
  The document stated that "after it declared its withdrawal 
from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty the North has totally 
frustrated with its flexible and steadfast strategy the 
maneuverings of the United States and other imperialists to 
isolate it."

<F P=106> ["Hysterics of Dictator Under `Civilian' Mask" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- It is entirely 
unjustifiable that the South Korean authorities inflicted 
penalties upon the chairman of the General Student Council of 
Kwangju University, the ex-director of the department for 
solidarity of the general student council of Chonnam National 
University and the ex-chairman of the national reunification 
committee of the university on charges of exchanging letters 
with students of Kim Il-song University and leading 
demonstrations, says NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The reunification movement conducted by South Korean 
students 
to put a period to national division is a praiseworthy patriotic 
act and it can by no means be incriminated, the news analyst 
says, and goes on: 
  The criminal is none other than the Kim Yong-sam group 
itself 
which, seeking confrontation, not national unity, has broken up 
inter-Korean dialogue which continued even under the military 
dictatorship and has left no stone unturned in obstructing and 
suppressing the pro-reunification patriotic movement of students 
and people. It is a brutal act bereft of human nature, let 
alone an iota of national conscience, for the Kim Yong-sam 
traitor clique, the very criminal, to brandish the sword at the 
students who conducted righteous activities. 
  This time the Kim Yong-sam group again invoked the notorious 
"National Security Law" in imposing penalties upon the patriotic 
students. The "National Security Law" is a most reactionary 
anti-communist fascist law that violates all the freedom and 
rights of the people and defines the fellow countrymen in the 
North as an "enemy" and incriminates any contact with them. The 
Kim Yong-sam group still keeps that kind of law and uses it as a 
tool for maintaining "power", ignoring the unanimous opposition 
of the people at home and abroad. This proves that it is a 
group of human dregs and hooligans who are clean indifferent to 
the desire of the nation and the trend of the times. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is trying to find a way out in 
bringing anti-reunification storm, following outside forces. 
But it is a foolish dream. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must stop anti-reunification 
suppression at once.

war to the Korean peninsula and the Korean nation. 
  In a statement released on April 2, Kim Chong-su declared 
that Koreans in Japan would unite closely with the compatriots 
in the homeland and overseas on the basis of "10-point programme 
of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of 
the country" and strengthen solidarity with the justice-loving 
and peace-loving people around the world to invigorate the 
struggle for thwarting the nuclear war provocation moves of the 
U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique, definitely 
preserving peace on the Korean peninsula and promoting national 
reunification.

<F P=106> ["Japan's Desire To Become Military Power Unchanged"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa never let a chance pass by without claiming 
that "Japan would never be a military power" and "Japan should 
set the pace in worldwide arms cut." He is straining every nerve 
to convince the Asian nations in particular that Japan will not 
choose to be a military power. Commenting on this, a NODONG 
SINMUN analyst today says: But what Japan is doing totally 
gainsays this. In fact, its armed forces are being beefed up 
and its conversion into a military power is being hastened. 
  The analyst points out: 
  The Japanese Government decided to allocate 45,000 million 
dollars to military expenditure this year. 
  It must not be overlooked that Japan is arming the 
"self-defence forces" with long-range attack weapons. 
  Nuclear armament is an immediate main goal in converting 
Japan into a military power. Having completed material and 
technical preparations for the manufacture of nuclear weapons, 
Japan developed and launched even a nuclear-capable space rocket. 
  After paving the way for the dispatch of troops overseas, 
Japan has taken a mobilisation posture so that it may send 
large combat units anywhere and any time. 
  In categorically denying Japan's scheme to convert itself 
into a military power, the Japanese authorities seek to lull the 
concern of the Asian peoples over the danger of its aggression 
and dull their caution. 
  It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese ruling quarters 
to become a military power and realise their old dream of "the 
greater east Asia coprosperity sphere" with strength. 
  The Asian people are watching the movement of Japan with 
heightened vigilance. 
  The conversion of Japan into a military power and its 
overseas aggression will lead it to self-destruction. 
  Japan must act with discretion, not forgetting the lesson of 
history.

headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- A fast breeder reactor 
Monju built in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, Japan, went into 
operation on April 5, reported NHK. 
  The commissioning of Monju fully reveals Japan's undisguised 
scheme to become a nuclear power by securing a large quantity of 
plutonium for itself and manufacturing nuclear weapons any 
moment. 
  It is an open challenge to the Korean people and the Asian 
and world people who are desirous of peace. 
  Japan is already possessed of elements for the manufacture 
of 
nuclear bombs including electronic explosive devices and their 
technologies. Before commissioning Monju it launched the large 
long-range rocket "H-2" in February this year. Its nuclear 
armament has now reached the danger line. 
  Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities are now crying for 
"additional inspection" and "economic sanctions" over the 
fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. This is as base as a 
thief crying "stop thief " the Japanese authorities must give up 
their criminal nuclear design, mindful of the grave consequences 
to be entailed by their moves to make Japan a nuclear power.

  Speakers there said that one of the immortal exploits 
performed by the great leader in building trade unions is that 
he had provided deep roots of the federation by forming the 
anti-Japanese trade union, a mass political organization of the 
working class, during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. 
  They noted that another exploit is that he, basing himself 
on 
this tradition, founded the General Federation of Trade Unions 
of Korea after the liberation of the country, and has indicated 
in a scientific way the character and duty of the federation in 
each period and at each stage of the development of the 
revolution and wisely led the work to this end. 
  They also recalled that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il 
has further developed in depth the idea and theory of building 
the chuche-orientated trade unions and built up the 
organizations into a reliable assistant and defender of the 
Workers' Party of Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- It is 40 years since 
the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery was built. 
  The great leader President Kim Il-song saw to it that the 
cemetery was built on April 5, 1954. 
  The cemetery is located on top of the Jujak peak of Mt. 
Taesong in Pyongyang. 
  Lying buried there are anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs 
including Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist 
revolutionary fighter, who dedicated their precious lives to the 
anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and the struggle for the 
victory of the socialist cause under the wise leadership of 
President Kim Il-song. 
  In the cemetery there are a monument bearing the autograph 
of 
President Kim Il-song, bronze busts of martyrs, and a 
wreath-laying stand on which the medal of hero of the DPRK is 
embossed. 
  The cemetery was reconstructed on an expansion basis into a 
grand monumental edifice on the occasion of the 40th anniversary 
of the founding of the Workers' Party of Korea (October 10, 
1985) under the energetic and meticulous guidance of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  The cemetery is a symbol of the deep trust and sense of 
obligation of President Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim Chong-il for 
the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs, and high appreciation 
of the exploits of the martyrs who remained loyal to the party 
and the leader, the country and the people till their last 
moments. 
  A meeting was held to mark the 40th anniversary of the 
establishment of the cemetery. 
  At the meeting, Pak Song-chol, Politburo member of the C.C. 
[Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea and 
vice-president, conveyed a message of thanks of the WPK Central 
Committee to the officials and employees of the management 
office of the revolutionary martyrs' cemetery. 
  The message highly praises the officials and employees of 
the 
management office for their responsible management of the 
cemetery and education of people through the cemetery over the 
last 40 years.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Today marks the 14th 
anniversary of the enforcement of the law on public health in 
Korea. 
  This law adopted at the fourth session of the Sixth Supreme 
People's Assembly of the DPRK in April 1980, codifies the 
brilliant achievements made in the health care in the country 
and gives a theoretical systematization of the principles and 
requirements for developing it to a new, higher stage. This day 
is significantly commemorated as day of public health every year 
in the country. 
  The DPRK enforced a free medical care system 40 odd years 
ago 
in the thick of the fatherland liberation war. This complete 
and universal free medical care system grants to all people 
equal medical benefits. All the costs in health care such as 
diagnosis, treatment, surgical operation, hospitalization and 
recuperation are free. 
  In the DPRK where the advanced section doctor system is in 
force and preventive medicine is the key point, people are given 
enormous benefits through regular check-up, vaccination and 
other medical assistance. 
  Modern people's hospitals have been built in cities and 
rural 
villages and at industrial establishments and maternity 
hospitals, dental preventive hospitals and other specialized 
medical care bases are available everywhere. 
  Several dozen central pharmaceutical factories and thousands 
of local pharmaceutical factories in Sunchon, Nanam, Sinuiju and 
other parts of the country satisfactorily meet the demand for 
medicines. 
  The state ensures that mineral water resources abundant in 
the country are used effectively for the promotion of the 
working people's health. Now hundreds of mineral springs are 
available in 150 odd areas. 
  Public health workers have written many valuable scientific 
papers while engaging themselves in preventive and curative 
services, resulting in marked improvement of medical care. 
  Thanks to the popular policy of the party and the state and 
devoted efforts of the health workers, the average life 
expectancy at birth of the population has reached 74.5 years. 
  The number of the old folks above 90 is on the increase. 
Last year it was five times the 1980 figure.

wisely leading the overall socialist construction. 
  While making a remark on the current situation surrounding 
the nuclear issue, he said that the 25 February agreement 
adopted at the DPRK-U.S. New York contact and the 15 February 
agreement reached between the International Atomic Energy Agency 
and the Republic were overturned, and that the situation on the 
Korean peninsula is heading toward the brink of war. He pointed 
out that the one wholly responsible for this is the United 
States. 
  He said that the statement by the president of the UN 
Security Council is another international commotion to put 
pressure on the republic. He emphasized that by no means can 
the issue be resolved through this kind of threat and pressure. 
  He said that the nuclear issue must be resolved in a fair 
way 
in accordance with the special position in which the republic 
has temporarily suspended to take effect the withdrawal from the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. He expressed the position that 
the SDPJ will play a positive role in resolving the nuclear 
issue in a fair way.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Spring ploughing is in 
full swing in the Yonbaek plain. 
  The cooperative farms in the plain have tilled vast tracts 
of 
paddy and non-paddy fields in a few days by raising the 
operation rate of the tractors. 
  The plain, known as a granary on the West Coast, covers 
broad 
areas of Chongdan, Yonan and Paechon counties, South Hwanghae 
Province, the central western part of Korea. 
  In the preliberation days the peasants there toiled with 
dull 
hoes and wooden ploughs. 
  The comprehensive mechanization of agriculture, which began 
making a rapid development after the publication of the 
socialist rural theses in February 1964, has now reached the 
stage of completion. In Paechon County the number of the 
tractors increased 3.1 times, lorries 7.4 times, rice harvestors 
10 times and weeding machines 15 times over the past twenty 
years with the constant supply of modern farm machines. The 
agricultural working people of the plain do nearly all 
categories of farm work ranging from ploughing to rice seedling 
plucking, rice transplanting, weeding, manuring and harvesting 
with machines. 
  Each cooperative farm in the plain has nearly one hundred 
technicians and experts. 
  Of late the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent 500 
tractors and some 250 lorries to the cooperative farms in the 
plain so as to further consolidate the material and technical 
foundations of agriculture. 
  The rural villages of plain have turned into modern 
socialist 
rural communities good to work and live in; they hold a big 
share in the nation's grain production. 
  Last year tens of thousands of more tons of grain was 
produced than in the previous year in the plain.

  [Text] Vientiane -- To stimulate its tourism industry, 
Vientiane has dropped an almost two decade-long restriction on 
the movement of foreigners, allowing them to travel anywhere in 
Laos except for areas considered restricted and dangerous. 
  Tourists can also apply for entry visas at Laos' 
international checkpoints besides Laotian embassies. 
  Those international checkpoints are Vat Tai and Tha Nadeua 
at 
Vientiane in central Laos, Ban Houai Sai in Bokeo province, 
Sanakham in Sayaboury province in northern Laos and Ban Viang 
Savan in Savannakhet, all of which border Thailand. Another 
international checkpoint in Savannakhet's western frontier is at 
Ban Non Savan bordering Lao Bao in Vietnam. 
  Laos expects a hike in the number of foreign tourists, 
especially in the coming months after the opening of Mittaphap 
Thai-Lao bridge. 
  The relaxed tourism measures did not mention new freedom of 
movement for foreign diplomats in Vientiane. Vientiane-based 
diplomats from western countries have been restricted to within 
six kilometres of the capital and could travel to other 
provinces only with prior notification from Vientiane 
authorities. 
  To promote domestic tourism, Vientiane will also allow its 
citizens to travel within the country using only their identity 
cards. Before, they had to apply to provincial authorities for 
passes to other provinces. 
  However residents without identity cards will still have to 
seek passes from the provincial authorities. 
  The newly-formed National Tourism Organization has devised a 
motto, "Lao travel in Laos", to encourage domestic tourism. 
  To foster its new tourism plan for this year, the 
organization has divided the country into three zones. In the 
northern zone, destinations being touted are Bokeo, Oudomsai, 
Houaphan, Xiang Khouang and Luang Prabang. 
  In the central zone are Vientiane, Vientiane Municipality, 
Khammouane within a parameter of 20 square kilometres and 
Savannakhet in the orbit of Route 9, while in the southern zone 
are Champassak and Saravane. 
  The steps are being taken to prepare for a Laos Tourism 
Year, 
which Vientiane hopes will be in 1995. 
  The new set of immigration measures were approved by an 
intergovernment committee comprising representatives of the 
Foreign and Interior ministries and chaired by Minister of the 
Prime Minister's Office Phao Bounnaphon. 
  The announcement was made on Monday in the VIENTIANE-MAI 
WEEKLY, five days ahead of the inauguration of the Mittaphap 
Thai-Lao Bridge set for this Friday. 
  The newspaper said all authorities concerned in the 
provinces 
have been informed of the new regulations. 
  The move followed considerable debate over the past year 
between reformists and conservatives within the Lao People's 
Revolutionary Party over whether to relax immigration controls.

  [Text] Vientiane -- The opening of the first bridge 
between Laos and Thailand should not be seen as a threat to 
Laos' sovereignty or cultural identity, Laotian leaders said 
yesterday. 
  They also reaffirmed that continued political and social 
stability is a key factor in ensuring the further success of the 
country's economic reform. 
  Responding to reporters' questions at a rare press 
conference 
here here yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Khamphoui 
Keobuoalapha said the opening of the bridge should make it 
easier for foreign visitors to see, better understand and 
appreciate Laotian society, culture and national identity. 
  The press conference, also attended by Foreign Minister 
Somsavat Lengsavat and Seun Phetsanghan, the minister for 
transportation, post, communications and construction, was in 
response to several requests by the foreign press for interviews 
with key government leaders in the lead-up to the official 
opening of the bridge tomorrow. 
  Hundreds of foreign reporters were granted the entry to 
Vientiane to cover the event, which is seen as an important step 
in Laos' economic openness. In the past they have been allowed 
into the landed-locked country only during major events. 
Regular news cover of Laos has been restricted. 
  Khamphoui also rejected fears the bridge will facilitate the 
arrival of bad influences from "outside" -- especially from 
Thailand. 
  "Both Thailand and Laos have agreed to respect each other's 
laws and regulations, which are designed to protect national 
interest, sovereignty and cultural and national identity," said 
the deputy prime minister. 
  Instead, he said, the maintenance and preservation of the 
bridge -- a symbol of friendship between Thailand, Laos and 
Australia -- would meaningfully contribute to the preservation 
and maintenance of good bilateral relations and co-operation, 
and thus towards peace and stability in the region as a whole. 
  Khamphoui sidestepped many controversial questions including 
when the bridge will be opened to regular traffic after Friday's 
official inauguration, given that some problems remain. 
  "We have survived without the bridge in the past, please 
don't rush," he said jokingly. 
  Responding to the same question Phetsanghan said the purpose 
of the bridge was to facilitate border crossing by local people 
as well as for foreigners who want to visit and invest in Laos. 
  However as far as cultural preservation was concerned, the 
government had a clear policy to preserve the country's culture 
and identity but not to an extent which blocked other cultures. 
  Foreign Minister Somsavat yesterday said the date for 
opening 
of the bridge to regular use will be decided tomorrow, when a 
joint Thai-Lao committee meets. 
  The minister said there were two issues still to be settled. 
  Under the government-to-government agreement signed on April 
2, three working committees were set up -- one to administer the 
bridge, the others to operate the bridge and to rule on legal 
problems and jurisdiction. 
  Somsavat expressed optimism that the relaxation of 
immigration rules would bring-more investors to the country. 
Visa restrictions for foreigners have been eased to encourage 
investment and tourism.

  [Text] CHATURAT: Laos is a country rich in natural 
resources, especially timber and minerals. However, it has no 
money to tap these treasures. Will your government accept 
foreign investment and on what conditions? 
  Kaysone: Our government is ready to cooperate in economic 
development with all countries on the principle of equity and 
posing no threat to our independence. 
  CHATURAT: What is the top priority on the list of your 
government's economic development plan? 
  Kaysone: We will turn our country into an industrial nation 
based on agriculture and forestry. 
  Norman Pegam, special reporter of CHATURAT magazine, asked 
these two questions to Kaysone Phomvihan, former president of 
the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] and former head of 
the Lao People's Revolutionary Party [LPRP], 18 years ago. The 
answers were nothing but a plan which would take decades for its 
materialization. 
  The promulgation of the "New Economic Mechanism" or 
"Restructuring" policy was the first sign of the plan being 
materialized. Kaysone Phomvihan proposed the policy during the 
fourth party congress in 1986 to lay the foundation for 
decentralized economic development. 
  During the fifth congress in 1991, the LPRP announced the 
national socioeconomic development plan for the period from 1993 
to 2000. The plan encourages the application of capitalism 
rules but refuses to let the country plunge into the orbit of 
capitalism. However, the official opening of the bridge [linking 
Vientiane capital with Thailand's Nong Khai Province] this month 
will attach Laos to capitalism. 
  Although Laos' centralized economic system has been shifted 
to Lao-style capitalism, its political system remains 
"Lao-style" democracy or centralized democracy. It is apparent 
that the centralized power is in the hands of the group of 
"party leaders from southern Laos." 
  The Road of Power Stretches to the South [Subhead] 
  After the death of Kaysone Phomvihan in 1992, Nouhak 
Phoumsavan was named the new president of the LPDR while General 
Khamtai Siphandon became chairman of the LPRP. 
  The appointments of Kaysone Phomvihan's close comrades in 
arms to the highest posts to administer the country and party 
brought an abrupt end to the anticipation of a massive reshuffle 
of the power holders. 
  The allocation of important posts in the National Assembly, 
Council of Ministers, and party indicates an attempt to keep the 
power well balanced at a certain level. President Nouhak 
Phoumsavan has the power to appoint or dismiss the prime 
minister while Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon, in his capacity 
as chairman of the party, also has the power to propose to the 
National Assembly the appointment or dismissal of the president. 
  It should be noted that Nouhak Phoumsavan, a native of 
Savannakhet Province, is classified as a member of the political 
group of former President Kaysone Phomvihan; Phoun Sipaseut, 
deputy prime minister in charge of foreign affairs; and Phao 
Bounnaphon, minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office. 
  Meanwhile, General Khamtai Siphandon, a native of Khon 
District in Champassak Province, belongs to the Champassak power 
group. Defense Minister Lieutenant Choummali Sai-gnason and 
National Assembly President Saman Vi-gnaket also come from this 
group. 
  Gen. Khamtai belongs to the Lao Thoeng ethnic group. Other 
personalities belonging to this ethnic group include renowned 
economist Khamphoui Keoboualapha, deputy prime minister in 
charge of economic affairs and member of the Commission for 
Planning and Cooperation with Foreign Countries. The 
commission, in coordination with the other four economic 
agencies -- namely the Finance Ministry, Trade Ministry, Foreign 
Ministry, and the State Bank -- is fully responsible for the 
control and promotion of foreign investment. 
  Glancing at the list of members of the party's Political 
Bureau appointed by the fifth party congress, it appears that 
more than half of them are southerners, namely Nouhak Phoumsavan 
(No. 2), Gen. Khamtai Siphandon (No. 3), Phoun Sipaseut (No. 4), 
Saman Vi-gnaket (No. 6) Lieutenant General Choummali Sai-ngason 
(No. 8), and Kamphoui Keoboualapha (No. 10), as well as the late 
Kaysone Phomvihan (No. 1), and the late Somlat Chanthamat (No. 
9). 
  Maichantan Sengmani (No. 5), Oudom Khatthi-gna (No. 7), and 
Thongsing Thammavong (No. 11) are the three northerners 
appointed to the present Political Bureau. 
  The photos from the signing ceremony of the agreement on 
developing the Khon Phapheng Resort (Liphi Waterfall) between 
Khamphoui Keoboualapha on behalf of the Commission for Planning 
and Foreign Cooperation and Khun Somphop Piya-ui of T.U. Company 
Ltd tells the inside story of Laos' politics and economy. 
Everyone knows that the area to be developed is the home town 
of General Khamtai Siphandon. 
  Khong District of the Kha ethnic group has a long record of 
struggling for national liberation. The Kha people under the 
command of their chieftain Kommadan rose up against French 
colonialist rule and later the chieftain's son, Sithon Kommadan, 
led his people to join other minority groups in the struggle for 
national liberation. 
  General Khamtai Siphandon was born in a farming family in 
Houa Khong village. Like other youths in those days, he joined 
the revolutionary movement in Champassak Province by becoming a 
member of the Indochina Party (the first Marxist-Leninist 
Communist Party established by Ho Chi Minh in the region) and 
later shifted to the LPRP. 
  During the war against the U.S. imperialists, the name of 
Khamtai Siphandon was always mentioned after those of Kaysone 
Phomvihan and Nouhak Phoumsavan. 
  Immediately after the formation of the first government of 
the LPDR, Gen. Khamtai Siphandon was appointed deputy prime 
minister, defense minister, and supreme commander of the Lao 
Armed Forces. 
  Afterwards, he fully controlled power in the Lao People's 
Army until recently handing this power to Lieutenant General 
Choummali Sai-gnason. 
  Gen. Khamtai Siphandon took up the presidency during a time 
when Laos is being bombarded by the strong currents of 
capitalism. The party leader, a competent warrior on any 
battlefield, realizes the fact that "economic war is different 
from bloody political war." So he prudently rearranged his Army 
by posing "new-headed youths" as his front commanders to fight 
on the globalization battlefield. 
  In so doing, he appointed Somsavat Lengsavat, an 
international relations graduate from the United States, as the 
foreign minister of his government. Khamsai Souphanouvong, a 
son of the revolutionary prince who was an economics graduate 
who studied in France, was named finance minister. Sompadit 
Vorasan, an economist who studied in France, was appointed to be 
trade minister; and Butsabong Suvannavong, a finance and banking 
expert from England, became governor of the State Bank. 
  Political observers in Laos anticipate that a cabinet 
reshuffle will take place soon. President Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
78, will retire from politics and be replaced by Gen. Khamtai 
Siphandon, 66. 
  It is generally believed Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Choummali 
Sai- gnason will become the new prime minister and the post of 
defense minister will be given to General Sisavat Keobounphan, 
who was not appointed to the party's Political Bureau by the 
fifth party congress. 
  However, this speculation is based on the compromise between 
the northerners and southerners which is designed to keep the 
national economic development scheme moving ahead in line with 
the principle of "daring to accept capitalism, but not be 
enslaved by capitalism." 
  The directions of Laos' politics and economy from now on 
will 
be controlled by Gen. Khamtai Siphandon and his six southern 
compatriots in the party's Political Bureau. 
  This is the Lao People's Democratic Republic under the rule 
of "southerners."

  [Text] Seoul, April 7 (YONHAP) -- Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu hinted at a small change in Seoul's initial position 
that linked inter-Korean exchange of envoys to resolution of 
North Korean nuclear problem Thursday [7 April], saying that the 
nuclear issue has become an international problem in the wake of 
the statement by the United Nations Security Council, therefore 
cannot be limited to a problem of confrontation between North 
and South Korea. 
  In the summits in Tokyo and Beijing, it was recognized that 
the nuclear problem should be resolved by three approaches -- 
between International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and North 
Korea, South and North Korea, and North Korea and the United 
States, Han said in an expanded party-government meeting to 
discuss follow-up measures to President Kim Yong-sam's visits to 
Japan and China. 
  "At present, we will wait and see North Korea's response to 
the Security Council statement and continue with persuasion and 
pressure," Han said. 
  "Considering the effect of the North Korean nuclear problem 
on tourism, investment, trade, and our overall economy, we need 
more efforts to wipe out the understanding that the present 
situation in the Korean peninsula is critical," the foreign 
minister said. 
  Han reported that Seoul and Tokyo agreed to resolve 
repatriation of ethnic Koreans in Sakhalin as soon as possible 
at the initiative of Japan. Seoul will also present 
comprehensive measure to the matter within the year. 
  Seoul trusts Tokyo to resolve the comfort women issue and 
Japan is currently mapping out measures, Han said. 
  Trade, Industry, and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su said he 
will 
hammer out details of economic cooperation in motor vehicles, 
aircraft, and telephone exchange agreed in the Seoul-Beijing 
summit. 
  Korea will expand joint manufacturing of automobile parts 
before the summer and seek advancement in completed cars next 
year, Kim said.

<F P=106> ["Special article" contributed by ROK Foreign Minister Han </F>
Sung-chu, entitled "How Should We View the North Korean Nuclear 
Issue?" --date not given] 
  [Text] The burden in the hearts of people hoping for a 
satisfactory solution to the North Korean nuclear issue, has 
grown with each passing day. At the same time, the people are 
irate over the recent reckless remarks and acts of the North 
Korean delegation. 
  The people's view of the nuclear issue is motivated by their 
ardent patriotic sentiment. How then, has this situation 
developed? How can we break through this situation? 
  The world's nations are making efforts to join a new 
post-Cold War global order comprised of liberal democracy and 
the market economy. However, a mere handful of nations are 
spurning this trend. Unfortunately, and to our dismay, North 
Korea is one such nation, and may in fact be a most extreme case. 
  What kind of choice did Pyongyang, isolated from the 
international order, have? While the norm would be to pursue 
the citizens' welfare and peace, Pyongyang chose the opposite 
road. In other words, it invoked the nuclear problem. Will 
Pyongyang's rash gamble be successful? North Korea's adherance 
to nuclear development will ultimately lead to Pyongyang's 
defeat. The North Korean economy will sour even more and North 
Korea will become a helpless international orphan. 
  Pyongyang alone denounced the statement of the UN Security 
Council President that the world supported. 
  What is our strategy in dealing with North Korea? When the 
North Korean nuclear problem was raised, there were some who 
called for procuring nuclear arms. However, we know that this 
road leads to mutual destruction. The road to coexistence is to 
remove the suspicion of North Korean nuclear development. Our 
choice is to persuade North Korea to realize a solution to its 
nuclear problem and to join an international flow which is 
healthy to itself. 
  Only this strategy will not sabotage the peace and security 
of the Korean peninsula in the course of pursuing a resolution 
of the North Korean nuclear issue. This strategy will improve 
North-South relations and lay a foundation for national 
reunification. 
  In view of this strategy, our immediate goals toward the 
North Korean nuclear issue become clear. First, we should 
prevent North Korea from further extraction of nuclear 
materials. Second, we should make efforts to place nuclear 
materials already produced in North Korea under the control of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. Third, we should 
attempt to make North Korean nuclear facilities peaceful and 
safe like our energy facilities. 
  During the past year, these strategies and goals of ours 
were 
supported by the consensus of the people. I must frankly admit, 
however, that recently, public agreement on the method for 
achieving such aims has not been clear. The people's consensus 
on the solution method is more important now, with the North 
Korean nuclear problem pending at the UN Security Council, than 
ever before. 
  The approach we pursued during the past year for a solution 
to the North Korean nuclear issue, was to first resolve the 
problem through joint efforts by the North and the South, and to 
rely on international strength secondly, only when our efforts 
proved futile. Incentive and pressure (more commonly referred 
to as carrots and sticks) were the means used to resolve the 
nuclear problem. Up to the present, dialogue has been the 
preferred channel for solving the problem because, at the least, 
we would gain time for us to prepare the sticks. Now that the 
North Korean nuclear issue has been referred to the UN Security 
Council, a change began to take place in the of dialogue and 
sticks, and the importance of sticks is growing. 
  This means that the international aspect in resolving this 
issue is becoming more important. The role of the ROK and of 
allies including the United States and Japan was particularly 
important in the course of dialogue. However, the Chinese role 
is now growing and the attitude of Russia and nonaligned 
countries in the UN Security Council is also becoming important. 
  The number of nations looking to play a part in the 
nuclear issue, not to mention the nations directly concerned, is 
increasing. This means that we cannot effectively solve the 
nuclear problem by merely taking North-South relations into 
account. We must now be prepared for such changes in the 
situation. 
  The most important factor in our attitude for preparations 
is 
precise awareness of the essence of the problem. In other 
words, while keeping our strategy and goals firm, our methods 
and means should neither adhere to a single-track nor be 
hardline. 
  With the referral of the North Korean nuclear issue to the 
UN 
Security Council, and the apparent need for a long-range 
solution, we must discriminate between the essential and the 
marginal, and the more important from the less important. We 
should keep a long-term perspective on the situation, rather 
than going from elation to sorrow from one moment to the next 
over temporary developments in the situation. We should remain 
patient in applying means and methods and display wisdom in 
consolidating our internal unity. 
  While it is true that those who harbor deep feelings and 
concerns for a satisfactory solution to the North Korean nuclear 
problem are more likely to harbor brighter and more ardent 
expectations toward this, it is not reasonable to expect an 
immediate solution. In particular, we may be inclined to view 
North-South relations, which remains at its starting point, as 
being in a state of competition and confrontation. However, 
this viewpoint is not helpful for a solution to the nuclear 
problem. Moreover, if our feelings and self-esteem are affected 
by North Korea's attempts to regard a symbolic, worthless 
victory in confrontation with us as a great victory, we may 
easily be dragged into its psychological game, and the situation 
will become more complicated. 
  We are indeed in a difficult situation. However, we should 
recall our strategy and goals and consolidate them. It is also 
important for us to wait for the right opportunity by assuming 
flexible attitudes, means, and methods. This will only be 
possible when we balance principles and means, have a broad view 
on international affairs, and a long-term view on developments 
in the situation. We should cherish, above all, a sense of 
self-confidence and faith that time is on our side.

  [Text] Seoul, April 6 (YONHAP) -- Despite lingering tension 
on the Korean peninsula, trade between South Korea and North 
Korea rose sharply in March, the National Unification Board 
(NUB) said Wednesday. 
  Last month, 68 inter-Korean deals worth 21.28 million U.S. 
dollars were approved by NUB. 
  This compares with 53 cases amounting to 14.77 million 
dollars in February. 
  The monthly total for March exceeded 20 million dollars for 
the first time since last August. 
  The sharp increase was caused by North Korea's expansion of 
imports to offset a shortage of materials. 
  Inter-Korean deals approved by NUB in the first quarter are 
forecast to rise 10.3 percent from the same period last year.

  [Text] It was learned that smuggling in the border area 
between North Korea and China has increased rapidly, lately. 
  Major items for smuggling are China's chief daily 
necessities, such as training suits, fabric for Western clothes, 
underwear, and socks. These goods are smuggled into black 
markets in Pyongyang and other major cities of North Korea. 
  In cities bordering China, particularly in Sinuiju and 
Hyesan, even youth and students are involved in the smuggling. 
So much so that the saying "senior high school students are 
excellent smugglers" is very much in vogue in these cities. 
  The smuggling in the border area is being conducted mainly 
by 
the ethnic Koreans living in China, and it has rapidly expanded 
since it is possible to smuggle those Chinese articles into 
Pyongyang with only a small bribe. As a result, smuggled 
Chinese items have become so popular that almost all residents 
in Sinuiju and Hyesan are wearing at least one Chinese item of 
clothing. 
  Meanwhile, it has been learned that South Korean goods are 
among the contraband smuggled into North Korea from China. 
South Korean trademarks are torn off prior to being smuggled 
into North Korea, and training shoes and socks seem to be some 
of the major South Korean items being smuggled in, according to 
a source. Those South Korean goods sell at high prices -- two 
or three times the price of Chinese goods -- because of their 
good quality. 
  Those found to be using South Korean goods are regarded as 
political criminals and are sent to a camp for political 
criminals. Despite this regulation, the number of users of South 
Korean goods is ever increasing because of a shortage in daily 
necessities in North Korea.

  [Text] An ROK shipping company is promoting the opening of 
a triangular sea route connecting Pusan port and North Korea's 
Chongjin port through Mogi port located on the southwest coast 
of Japan. 
  According to the Korea Maritime and Port Administration, 
Changyong Maritime Company, an inshore shipping company engaged 
in shipping between the ROK and Japan, represented by Kim 
Chong-su, recently applied to the National Unification Board 
[NUB] for permission to contact North Korean residents to open a 
regular sea route between Japan and North Korea for transporting 
agricultural and sea products. 
  Accordingly, the NUB consulted with the Korea Maritime and 
Port Administration, the office mainly concerned, to determine 
if it is acceptable for an ROK shipping company to open a sea 
route between Japan and North Korea. The Korea Maritime and 
Port Administration has informed the NUB that it is necessary 
for a domestic company to open a sea route between Japan and 
North Korea because this would help domestic shipping companies 
secure shipment territory in the East Sea economic area in the 
future.

deployment of Patriot missiles to the ROK. In a news briefing 
this afternoon, Wu Jianmin, spokesman for the PRC Foreign 
Ministry, said that it is not considered desirable to conduct 
any exercises or deploy missiles that would harm the security of 
the Korean peninsula, and that they [United States and the ROK] 
should refrain from conducting an act that would heighten 
tensions on the peninsula. 
  Spokesman Wu Jianmin said that regarding the recent reports 
on China's envoy for Kim Il-song's 82d birthday, China would not 
send a high-level envoy to North Korea.

  [Text] The Citizens National Bank (CNB) is moving to file 
complaints with the Seoul district civil court against the Bank 
of China [BOC] for failure to pay 1.2 million dollars of letters 
of credit (LCs) on time. 
  According to the state-run CNB, the Bank of China's branch 
in 
Shenyang, China, opened LCs for a Korean exporter K.C. Sunil Co. 
last year and the CNB purchased trade bills from the Korean 
exporter in December. After buying trade bills from K.C. Sunil, 
a small-sized trading company which exports aluminum foil, the 
CNB asked the Bank of China to honor the LCs opened by the 
Chinese bank but was rejected. The CNB said the Bank of China 
refused to settle the payments, citing what it claims to be 
problems with shipping documents. 
  The incident came to light as a CNB branch manager involved 
in the transaction jumped to death from an apartment in southern 
Seoul Friday in despair of the alleged financial fraud. The CNB 
claimed that it is customary in international banking practices 
for a bank who issued LCs to honor them if there are no special 
problems with shipping documents. But the CNB yet failed to 
illustrate what was specifically wrong in the shipping documents.

  [Text] Seoul, April 5 (YONHAP) -- It will take at least two 
years for the South Korean Government to settle the repatriation 
of some 4,000 Koreans in Sakhalin, Radio Moscow reported Sunday. 
  The repatriation concerns the interests of South and North 
Korea as well as Russia, making the issue a difficult one to 
resolve, said the radio, monitored here by NAEWOE press. 
  Some 60,000 Koreans were taken to Sakhalin during World War 
II when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule, and about 4,000 
first-generation members remain, according to Radio Moscow. 
  More than expected said they wanted to return to Korea in a 
recent poll, apparently attracted by their mother country's 
economic growth and living standards, it reported. 
  Seoul insists that Tokyo is responsible for bringing them 
back to Korea since the majority were taken forcibly by the 
Japanese military to work at labor camps. 
  But many descendants of Koreans in Sakhalin have settled 
down 
with stable careers and Seoul officials predict the Russian 
Government would be unwilling to let them go.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The Korea-Russia Far East 
Siberia Association met Monday morning at the Korea Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry Building to discuss boosting cooperation. 
  The association is led by Maritime Province Governor 
Yevgeniy 
Nazdratenko of Russia and Chang Chi-hyok, chairman of South 
Korea's Kohap Group. 
  At the meeting, the association agreed to construct an 
industrial complex for Korean-Russian cooperation and an 
exclusive quay for South Korean ships at Vostochny port in the 
Nakhodka special economic zone. 
  The association will also recommend that the Governments of 
South Korea and Russia designate small special economic zones 
elsewhere in the Russian Far East and Siberia. 
  The association plans to obtain permission to establish a 
regular direct line between Seoul and Vladivostok and study ways 
to open another direct line between South Korea and Irkutsk, 
Novosibirsk and Kamchatka Provinces. 
  Meanwhile, the association decided to hold regular 
exhibitions of Korean goods in several Siberian and Far Eastern 
cities including Khabarovsk and Yuzhno Sakhalinsk as well as 
seminars and working-level talks between South Korean and 
Russian businesses.

  [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- Regular air service will 
open between Seoul and Khabarovsk, Russia, in June and Asiana 
Airlines will fly the route once a week, Transportation Ministry 
officials said Monday. 
  In addition, Korean Air [KAL] and Asiana will increase 
flights between Seoul and Singapore to 14 times and five times a 
week, respectively, from mid-April. 
  KAL will expand service between Seoul and Manila to four 
times a week in mid-April and Asiana will begin flying the route 
three times weekly in mid-May. 
  Korean Air's service on the Seoul-Moscow-Amsterdam route 
will 
be divided into Seoul-Moscow and Seoul-Amsterdam routes in May. 
  The Transportation Ministry asked the two national carriers 
to cooperate in selling tickets and carrying passengers on the 
Seoul-Manila route to avoid excess competition, but the two 
airlines refused and will fly the route separately. 
  Korean Air and Asiana will begin working-level contacts on 
allowing passengers to use both airlines' tickets on domestic 
routes and cooperating in carrying international travelers.

  [Text] The French government has recently included South 
Korea in a list of countries that can export marine products to 
France, the Foreign Ministry said yesterday. Cheap imported 
maritime products have been gobbling up the French market, 
prompting Paris to draw up a list of a handful of countries 
outside the European Union that can continue selling such goods. 
Only five countries, including Argentina and Canada, had been 
put on the list publicized in February. 
  Seoul had an existing agreement with France on fisheries 
exports effective until January next year but was excluded from 
the list, the ministry said. The French government belatedly 
added eight more countries, including South Korea, Thailand and 
Singapore, to the list carried in its gazette March 26, it said. 
  South Korean exports of maritime products to France, which 
reached $21.9 million in 1991, decreased to $14.4 million in 
1992 and $10.8 million last year, according to the Seoul 
government's statistics.

  [Text] The government has decided to form a Unification 
and Security Policy Coordination Council that will be in charge 
of summing up and adjusting policies on national unification and 
security to prevent confusion in policies on the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  The Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council was 
organized in a meeting on 7 April of security-related ministers 
presided over by President Kim Yong-sam. The council will hold 
meetings once or more a week with the vice unification minister 
as the chairman and the foreign and defense ministers, and the 
senior presidential aide on foreign affairs and security will 
analyze and examine the prevailing security situation and 
coordinate various offices' opinion. Anyone of the council 
members can immediately call a meeting of the council. 
  Proposing the organization of the Unification and Security 
Policy Coordination Council, President Kim Yong-sam asked 
security-related ministers to consult with one another more 
efficiently and to cope with situations promptly. 
  Regarding the rumor on North Korea's possession of nuclear 
weapons that was recently reported by some media, today's 
meeting came to the conclusion that there is no clear evidence 
to prove that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons at this 
point of time. 
  In addition, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported that 
there has been no particular moves by the military around the 
truce line or in other areas in North Korea.

  [Text] Seoul, April 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
instructed Thursday [7 April] a Unification and Security Policy 
Coordination Council be formed comprising National Unification 
Board [NUB], foreign, and defense ministers, National Security 
Planning agency director, chief presidential secretary, and 
senior secretary for foreign and national security affairs to 
effectively and consistently cope with the North Korean nuclear 
issue. 
  The deputy prime minister, concurrently the NUB minister, 
should head the coordination council for a meeting more than 
once a week and the meeting should be immediately held at a 
request from any member of the council, Kim ordered in a 
security-related cabinet meeting on Thursday morning. 
  The coordination meeting will ensure more cooperative and 
ready response to security issues, presidential spokesman Chu 
Ton-sik said afterward. 
  At Kim's instruction, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok is 
expected to detail out operations of the council. 
  Because the soon-to-be-formed coordination meetings will be 
held regularly at least more than once a week unlike the 
existing high-level strategic meetings headed by the president 
or prime minister that opens when necessary, they will prove 
more productive and practical, Chu said. 
  Depending on the significance of the agenda, President Kim 
will personally chair the meetings, he said. 
  Developments in North Korea and other major countries were 
discussed in Thursday's breakfast discussion, Chu said. 
  It was concluded at the meeting that there was no solid 
evidence that North Korea owns nuclear weapons at present, he 
said. 
  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported that there was no 
conspicuous military movement in North Korea.

  [Text] Pailin, Cambodia, April 6 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR] 
guerrillas have launched an attack from Thai territory on 
Cambodian Government troops stationed along the border to the 
west of the rebel faction's former Pailin headquarters, a 
government general said Wednesday. 
  "We were on the border when they came in," General Houl 
Savoan of the 5th Military Region said. The general said a 40 
strong group of Khmer Rouge, backed by a tank, attacked his men 
Monday. "But the Khmer Rouge were repelled back into Thai 
territory," he said. 
  The general, however, later admitted that the government 
forces had pulled back from the area and said journalists could 
not visit a former Khmer Rouge radio station because the area 
was "insecure." 
  A group of some 120 Khmer Rouge attacked government troops 
occupying Sala Krau, a former guerrilla jungle base around 12 
kilometers (7.5 miles) north of Pailin, Saturday, he said. The 
Khmer Rouge lost six men in the ensuing firefight while the 
government had one soldier dead and three wounded, he said. 
  Khmer Rouge radio, broadcasting from a new clandestine 
location, claimed their fighters killed 42 government soldiers 
Saturday in clashes in Sala Krau and adjacent areas. 
  Worn-out looking government soldiers, returning from jungle 
around Sala Krau, said there was relentless fighting every day. 
But despite these ongoing clashes, government officers rebutted 
Khmer Rouge claims that they had walked into a trap by seizing 
Pailin. They claimed the guerrillas' hit and run attacks did 
not jeopardise the government's hold on the resource rich region. 
  An AFP photographer saw soldiers stacking some of what Hul 
Savoan estimated to be around 100 tonnes of Khmer Rouge 
ammunition recently discovered by the government forces.

<F P=106> [By Sheri Prasso] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 7 (AFP) -- Cambodia's ailing King 
Norodom Sihanouk returns here Friday with what observers expect 
will be a new plan for talks with the Khmer Rouge, but the 
guerrilla's recent defeats on the battlefield give the 
government little incentive to negotiate. 
  The Khmer Rouge lost their ruby- and timber-rich 
headquarters 
of Pailin in a government offensive just over two weeks ago, and 
the government's call for a total ceasefire before roundtable 
talks can be held remains in force. 
  "If we want to have talks now, talks must be in a different 
mood," co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh said this week. "Now 
the Khmer Rouge have nothing." 
  The Khmer Rouge's public face, Khieu Samphan, has requested 
an audience with the king and is expected to arrive in the 
Cambodian capital within the next few days, Royal Palace 
officials confirmed. 
  His presence, however, is not likely to lead to talks unless 
he is willing to offer a surrender, that is if Prince Ranariddh 
and his co-Premier Hun Sen can maintain their strong positions 
militarily and politically. 
  But the 71-year-old king has cancer, and wants to be 
remembered as the uniting force of a divided Cambodia after he 
dies, according to diplomats and observers. 
  The cancer has spread to his bone marrow and King Sihanouk 
has been undergoing chemotherapy in a Beijing hospital. But he 
is returning to spend about a month in Cambodia in order to 
celebrate Khmer New Year with his compatriots on April 13-15. 
  Diplomats as well as Cambodian Government officials had 
believed that King Sihanouk was likely to die by mid-1994 and 
would return to Cambodia for his final days. 
  But recent reports from the Royal Palace say the king's 
cancer has gone into remission. However, they warn of a 
possible stroke from arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the 
arteries. 
  His arrival at Pochentong Airport on Friday will be shrouded 
in secrecy. Prince Ranariddh, Hun Sen and acting head of state 
Chea Sim will be the only people allowed to greet him upon his 
arrival, Royal Palace officials said. 
  The diplomatic corps, brass band, lines of bowing Cambodian 
officials and throngs of journalists who normally greet King 
Sihanouk at the airport have been told they are not invited. 
  Even the crowds of flag-waving schoolchildren who are 
normally trotted out to the roadside to cheer his speeding 
motorcade have been told not to come. 
  King Sihanouk has gone bald due to months of chemotherapy, 
and palace officials do not want him photographed. Whether he 
will walk of his own accord off his plane or be carried off, 
will be left to speculators or spies to say. 
  A special room has been set up at Calmette Hospital in case 
he needs emergency medical attention, and French doctors were 
asked to disinfect his room to cut down on the possibility of 
infection, [word indistinct] sources said. 
  The king will only be able to receive visitors for one hour 
each morning and one hour each afternoon during his stay. 
  The diplomatic corps hopes for at least one window of 
opportunity, as do chosen "representatives of the people" who 
traditionally ask the king to solve their problems during the 
Khmer New Year.

  [Text] According to a reliable source, a group of 12 
unidentified persons opened fire on Nim Kimsam, killing him and 
wounding Hun Mav as the two were riding on a motorcycle. 
  The killing took place in Prek Tuok village, Khporp Ta Nguon 
commune, in Kompong Cham Province's Stoeng Trang District. 
  According to a report by Kompong Cham provincial officials, 
Nim Kimsam was en route to his home town to attend his younger 
sister's wedding. 
  No motive for the killing has been provided or affirmed by 
any source. Some sources say that Nim Kimsam was an Interior 
Ministry bodyguard -- part of Samdech Hun Sen's bodyguard group 
-- and that he was gunned down with AK rifles by the 
unidentified group of people while riding a motorcycle to visit 
friends in his hometown. 
  It has not yet been determined if Nim Kimsam's murder was 
motivated by revenge or something else. 
  The authorities are investigating to unmask the murderers 
and 
forward the files to the tribunal.

<F P=106> ["Appeal of the Royal Government of Cambodia to the </F>
officers, the rank and file, and the compatriots living under 
the temporary control of the Khmer Rouge" [KR] dated 6 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] The Pailin region has a major economic, social, and 
cultural position in the Kingdom of Cambodia. The recalcitrant 
Khmer Rouge leaders still continue to occupy illegally this 
region and continue to cause considerable damage to national 
assets even after our country had entered the stage of national 
reconciliation, unity, and peace; after our most venerated 
monarch, His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varman, had ascended the 
throne to provide the coolest shade for all of us, his Cambodian 
subjects; and after the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] had 
come to power to lead and govern the nation in full legitimacy. 
Thus, with the noble intention of preserving peace and 
maintaining security for the people and preserving national 
unity and national reconciliation, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces 
[KRAF] made monumental efforts and braved all kinds of 
difficulties in entering and completely capturing the Pailin 
region on 19 March 1994. 
  With a high sense of responsibility toward the destiny of 
all 
Cambodians, the RGC would like to make another appeal to the 
officers, the rank and file, and the compatriots living under 
the temporary control of the Khmer Rouge. The brothers are 
asked to waste no time in finding all means to return to the 
national community and join the great family of Cambodians. 
  The RGC always has the fate and destiny of all of you at 
heart as already emphasized in previous appeals, especially in 
the statement made by the RGC on 25 March 1994. 
  1. As a matter of fact, the officers, noncommissioned 
officers, and men still serving in the ranks of the Khmer Rouge 
are urged to hurry up and present themselves before the KRAF and 
the competent authorities in the region. You will be accorded 
all due attention and your rights, privileges, grades, and 
duties will be assured in the same way as has been done by the 
RGC toward the thousands of former Khmer Rouge officers, 
noncommissioned officers, and men who have already awakened to 
the call and joined the national community and the RGC. 
  2. As for the civilians who have been forcibly taken along 
by Khmer Rouge leaders, they should hurry up and liberate 
themselves from the claws of the Khmer Rouge by immediately 
contacting the KRAF and the competent authorities protecting the 
region. You will be welcomed and given all necessary assistance 
by the RGC and you will receive land and houses in accordance 
with the law. 
  3. As far as the compatriots who take temporary refuge in 
Thailand are concerned, the RGC will continue to contact and 
negotiate with the representatives of the Thai Government in 
order to bring them back to our sacred Angkorian land with the 
assistance of various international organizations. Concerning 
the repatriation of these refugees, the RGC's good-will and 
sincere stance is that the repatriation should proceed through a 
negotiation between our RGC and the government of the country 
concerned on the basis of humanitarian principles, 
voluntariness, noncoercion, and respect for the right of the 
concerned brothers to make a choice. Any brothers who wish to 
remain in Pailin or to go to any other fully safe regions will 
be allowed to do so with the assistance of the RGC. 
  The RGC is confident that the country concerned will do its 
best to help and support this righteous cause by respecting 
Cambodia's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity 
and refrain from interfering in each other's internal affairs as 
stipulated in the 23 October 1991 Paris agreement.

<F P=106> ["Rejection of the Base and Stinking Lies by Ranariddh, Who </F>
is Excrement Underneath the House" issued in Phnom Penh on 6 
April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] 1. Ranariddh -- who is excrement underneath the 
house, a U.S. and French puppet, and a puppet of communist 
Vietnam's puppets -- has said there is a picture of Pol Pot on a 
nice road in Thailand accompanied by a car and a convoy of 
trucks. The shit Ranariddh has said this shows Pol Pot escaping 
from Pailin when the two-headed government's forces entered 
Pailin. The shit Ranariddh has also said that he is not going 
to show this picture; he will keep it to himself. Liar! 
Stinking shit! 
  2. This is really shit. He is really a U.S. and French 
puppet; he is really a puppet of communist Vietnam's puppets. 
He says whatever his masters order him to say. 
  In France recently, the chief of the French espionage agency 
(Coedes) and the American CIA brainwashed the shit Ranariddh 
into opposing King Sihanouk and the five-point plan for national 
reconciliation, continuing to fight the Khmer Rouge, and keeping 
this up. France and the United States say they will think about 
letting Ranariddh be a lecturer in France, that France and the 
United States will help him become king, and that France and the 
United States will not let Prince Sihakmoni reign. France and 
the United States have made efforts to spread propaganda about 
fighting against the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, and Thailand. They 
say: Keep fighting to thwart King Norodom Sihanouk's national 
reconciliation plan, especially ahead of and during the king's 
return to Phnom Penh. 
  3. Who does not know that the shit Ranariddh is afraid of 
the puppets Hun Sen, Chea Sim, and Sar Kheng, as if they were 
tigers? Who does not know that the shit Ranariddh is a lackey of 
the United States and France? Who does not know that 
Ranariddh's soldiers were created by the United States and are 
U.S. mercenaries who serve the United States like dogs in 
killing the Cambodian nation and people? Who does not know that 
the shit Ranariddh is killing FUNCINPEC [National United Front 
for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] 
and crawls at the feet of communist Vietnam's puppets? Who does 
not know that the shit Ranariddh is corrupt and has taken 
millions of dollars in bribes; sold himself and the nation; 
killed the people; and is serving the United States, France, 
foreigners, and evil wealthy people? Who does not know that the 
people and masses in Phnom Penh -- even children -- never refer 
to Ranariddh as prince; he is usually called the shit Ranariddh, 
the shit Ranariddh, the shit Ranariddh [repetition as heard], 
because he stinks even against the wind. People detest him 
almost to the point of vomiting. 
  As for the whereabouts and movements of Pol Pot, he is not 
going anywhere. He always remains on Cambodian territory. He 
can be found in Kampot, Phnum Kamchay, Phnum Kravanh, Kompong 
Speu, Kratie, Mondolkiri, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kompong Cham, 
Kandal, Phnom Penh, Pursat, Battambang, Kompong Chhnang, Siem 
Reap, Kompong Thom, Preah Vihear, Takeo, Prey Veng, and Svay 
Rieng. His houses are in Rumchang and Ampil. If the shit 
Ranariddh wants to meet Pol Pot, he can go to Rumchang and 
Ampil. Pol Pot will not meet Ranariddh, though, because 
Ranariddh really stinks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Lubbers: 'Relationship With Jakarta </F>
Now Mature'"] 
  [Text] "The new relationship between the Netherlands and 
Indonesia, which is no longer based on development aid, is 
better than the one wich existed before 1992." This was stated 
by Prime Minister Lubbers in Jakarta last Tuesday, after a 
meeting with President Suharto. "A development relation can be 
useful at a specific point in time," Lubbers said, "but at a 
certain moment, it is better to renounce this relation." 
  During his talks with Suharto, it became clear to Lubbers 
that relations between both countries had become more mature and 
better since Indonesia announced in 1992 that it no longer 
wanted development aid from the Netherlands. Relations between 
both countries are now based rather on various forms of 
cooperation which are profitable to both countries. 
  According to the prime minister, providing development aid 
is 
a temporary phase in a relationship, which must be abandoned at 
a certain moment. He found it an interesting idea that the 
Indonesian Government is presently considering to establish 
development relations with some African countries. These 
countries might, for instance, learn from the way in which 
Indonesia handled birth control. 
  Lubbers also announced that he welcomed the Indonesian 
Government's wish that Queen Beatrix would pay a state visit to 
the country. The prime minister refused to elaborate on the 
question whether such a visit should take place in 1995. During 
that year, Indonesia will celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of 
the proclamation of the independent republic. Netherlands India 
veterans claim, however, that the fiftieth anniversary should 
not be celebrated before 1999, because the formal transfer of 
sovereignty did not occur until 1949.

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 6 (ANTARA) -- Dutch Foreign Minister 
P.H. Kooijmans stated that the early return of the visiting 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers was caused by an emerging conflict 
in the country's parliament. 
  "It has nothing to do with Indonesia. Our country is busy 
with political campaigns in the run up to a general election. 
Prime Minister Lubbers' return before scheduled time was due to 
a conflict between two members of parliament of our country's 
two coalition parties," he told the press here Wednesday. 
  He was speaking to reporters after signing -- together with 
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas -- a memorandum of 
understanding on the improvement and protection over investments 
between Indonesia and the Netherlands. 
  The conflict, he said, is very sensitive as it involves two 
ministers, members of the two coalition parties: Democratic 
Christian Party and Labour Party. The two ministers took an 
issue of office and attorney problems. 
  "As the issue is very important, the Dutch parliament's 
lower 
house asked the visiting Prime Minister Lubbers to return early 
to his country. We regret his (Lubbers) returning home before 
the schedule time," said Kooijmans who will continue his visit 
as scheduled until Thursday afternoon. 
  Prime Minister Lubbers arrived here on Monday for a four-day 
official visit until Thursday. He left Jakarta on Wednesday 
afternoon after visiting the ship industry, PT [Company Limited] 
Pal in Surabaya and attending the ground breaking ceremony for 
the development of Philip Ralins plant in the East Java capital 
city. 
  He said, however, that although Prime Minister Lubbers cut 
short his visit to Indonesia, the Dutch leader's visit is very 
important and the two countries' bilateral relations are 
improving. 
  Minister Kooijmans was scheduled to hold meetings with 15 
non-governmental organizations [NGO's] in Jakarta's Dutch 
Embassy on Thursday. 
  When asked by reporters on the purpose of his meeting with 
the NGOs, he said that such a meeting has become his tradition 
every time he make a visit to foreign countries.

  [Text] Jakarta -- A consortium of 65 major banks has 
agreed to extend a standby loan of around U.S. $500 million to 
Bank Indonesia (Central Bank). 
  The agreement on the loan syndication was signed Monday at 
the headquarters of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, the Central Bank 
announced here Monday. 
  Paul Sutopo, the managing director of Bank Indonesia, said 
that the large number of participants in the loan syndication 
reflected the confidence of the international banking community 
in Indonesia. 
  He said that the bank had originally planned to raise only 
$400 million from the loan syndicate, but the syndication was 
oversubscribed to reach $500 million due to the larger-than 
expected response. 
  "The number of banks in the loan syndication is the highest 
so far. We initially anticipated only around 40 participants," 
he said. 
  The Central Banks press statement said members of the loan 
syndication, which was arranged by Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd., 
the Industrial Bank of Japan, Banque National de Paris, Bank of 
Tokyo, the Long-Term Credit Bank (LTCB), and Dresdner, included 
Asian banks such as Bank Bumiputera of Malaysia. 
  It said that the loan will mature in seven years and that 
the 
interest will be paid annually. In the first two years, the 
interest rate will be a 5 [as published] of a percent above the 
London Inter-bank Offered Rate, and 7/8 [as published] above 
thereafter. 
  The money is intended for use as standby reserves and will 
be 
drawn only when needed. Disbursement of the loan will be based 
on five days of prior notice. 
  The Indonesian Government annually seeks standby loans 
outside its creditor group -- the Consultative Group on 
Indonesia -- to maintain its contingency foreign exchange 
reserves minimally at $2 billion. 
  The standby loans, besides serving as contingency reserves 
in 
addition to the foreign and gold reserves held by Bank Indonesia 
to safeguard the balance of payments, usually are also used for 
counterpart financing for government projects funded with export 
credits.

  [Text] Bandung, REPUBLIKA -- The Nusantara Aircraft 
Industry Company Limited [PT IPTN] has handed over another 
CN-235 aircraft to the Indonesian Air Force. The CN-235 
aircraft manufactured by PT IPTN was the fourth of the six 
aircraft ordered by the Department of Defense and Security of 
the Republic of Indonesia as part of a contract for the 
realization of its third strategic plan. 
  A simple transfer ceremony was held at a hangar of the PT 
IPTN Production Area II in Bandung on Friday (25 March). The 
transfer documents were signed by Ir. [academic title] Hari 
Laksono representing the president director of PT IPTN and Major 
General I Made Sadha A.R., master of economics, director general 
for services of the Department of Defense and Security, who 
represented the commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic of 
Indonesia [ABRI]. The Department of Defense and Security will 
later hand over the aircraft to the Indonesian Air Force. The 
documents were also signed by Commodore Sugiarto, deputy chief 
of the Air Force for personnel affairs. 
  The transfer is part of the contract for the realization of 
the third strategic plan, which was signed by the minister of 
state for research and technology and concurrently president 
director of PT IPTN and the minister of defense and security in 
Jakarta in March 1988. The contract covers the purchase by the 
Department of Defense and Security of six CN-235 aircraft from 
PT IPTN -- two units used to transport paratroopers, 
two units of the low altitude parachute extraction system 
or LAPES type, and two units used for medical 
evacuation or medevac. 
  The two paratrooper units were handed over by PT 
IPTN to the Department of Defense and Security in January 1993. 
One LAPES-typed unit was handed over to the department in 
December 1993. 
  With the transfer of the other LAPES-typed unit on Friday 
(25 
March), only two medevac-typed units which are undergoing 
finishing touches are yet to be handed over to the department. 
The two remaining units are scheduled to be personally handed 
over by Prof. Dr. B.J. Habibie, president director of PT IPTN, 
to Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung in June 1994. 
  The aircraft, which have been handed over to the department, 
are specifically designed for ABRI operations. The Indonesian 
Air Force can rely on the capability and agility of the aircraft 
to carry out its major duties. For example, a 
paratrooper unit is superior because it can 
simultaneously transport military personnel and drop them in a 
designated terrain.

  [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- President Suharto cautioned Golkar 
[Functional Group] leaders yesterday not to be easily swayed by 
the political maneuverings of certain people. 
  Suharto, in his capacity as chief patron of the country's 
ruling political groupings, said in a written statement that 
there is talk of there being political undercurrents. He felt 
that these are subverting Golkar because they have created the 
impression that the group has been torn apart. 
  "These so called `undercurrents' don't exist," said Suharto, 
who chairs the council that has the last word in Golkar. "They 
are simply a few people who claim to speak on behalf of the 
masses." 
  "This is nothing but political engineering. Politics cannot 
be separated from engineering," he said in a keynote address to 
Golkar's working conference. The speech was read by 
Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare Azwar Anas, who sits 
in the council. 
  Golkar has been shaken in the past few months by dissension 
among some of its regional leaders in the elections of 
provincial governors and regents. 
  Reports from the regents suggested that the dissenters were 
responding to political engineering in those regions, and were 
therefore casting their votes for the more popular local 
leaders, instead of the candidates nominated by Golkar's central 
executive board. 
  The term "political undercurrents" first became popular last 
December with the election of Megawati Sukarnoputri as chairman 
of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), despite stiff 
opposition from the government and the Armed Forces. 
  Megawati Sukarnoputri, is the daughter of Sukarno, 
Indonesia's first president. 
  The three-day conference is the first since the appointment 
of Harmoko, minister of information in Suharto's cabinet, to 
chair Golkar's central board last October. 
  Golkar leaders have attributed the regional dissension to 
lack of discipline among the regional leaders, something which 
they hope to straighten out at the gathering in Jakarta. 
  Harmoko told reporters after the opening ceremonies that the 
central board will not tolerate disciplinary problems and will 
punish members who have stepped out of line. 
  However, he denied allegations that Golkar was falling apart 
just because some members refused to obey central directives in 
local elections. "We are solid," he said. 
  In his speech, Suharto also told the estimated 600 Golkar 
leaders to avoid debate on the presidential succession which has 
been widely reported by the media in recent weeks. 
  The Patron Council feels it is not worth debating because 
there is already a mechanism to deal with leadership 
succession," he said referring to the five-yearly election 
process through the People's Consultative Assembly. 
  Suharto, who is now 72, indicated several times this month 
that he would not be pursuing a seventh, five-year term in 
office but he stressed that he intends to stay till the end of 
his current term in 1998. 
  The president also told the Golkar leaders to make sure that 
the political grouping retains its majority position in the next 
general election of 1997, targeting the estimated 21 million 
young people who will be voting for the first time. 
  He said Golkar should ignore the allegations that the single 
majority status that it has enjoyed could turn out into a 
dictatorship. 
  "Five election victories have not turned us into a 
dictatorship. On the contrary we have always represented the 
views of the people and accommodated their aspirations." 
  He also said that Golkar should fight against any attempt to 
reform election law, apparently referring to the constant 
demands by PDI and the United Development party (PPP) for 
changes in the electoral system.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta (JP) -- Golkar [Functional Group] must 
be able to retain its independence from the government without 
ever becoming an opposition force, Minister of Home Affairs Yogi 
S. Memet says. 
  "Golkar cannot force itself to stand diametrically opposed 
to 
the government under the pretext of defending the public 
interest, because that is essentially the role of the 
government," Yogi said at a working conference of the ruling 
political group. 
  "Yet, on the other hand, Golkar must not ever become the 
government's mouthpiece in mobilizing support for its programs. 
  "Golkar as a socio-political organization has a different 
function and mission than the government," he added. 
  "Golkar must play out its role as the force that develops 
both the `bottom-up' and `top-down' approach to development," 
Yogi told the conference that is scheduled to wind up today. 
  Golkar must have the courage to take a leadership role in 
many issues, he said. 
  Golkar has been criticized by its opponents for its lack of 
independence from the government and the Armed Forces (ABRI). 
[passage omitted] 
  In October, the group broke tradition by electing Harmoko, a 
civilian, rather than a military man, as chairman. 
  Harmoko, better known a the information minister, has faced 
dissension from some regional Golkar leaders in recent months 
and this week's conference seeks to synchronize Golkar's 
programs in central and regional boards. 
  Officials in Jakarta blamed this dissension on the lack of 
discipline of its members, a theme that was also hammered home 
by ABRI Chief General Feisal Tanjung in his address to the 
conference yesterday. 
  Discipline is an essential criteria to measure the dynamics 
of an organization, Feisal said. "It must not be viewed as 
something which curbs freedom, creativity and human rights, but 
rather it is a measure of a mature behavior which keeps the 
organization solid and modern," he said. 
  All Golkar members must obey the rulings and procedures 
underlined in Golkar's statutes, and they must remain loyal to 
any decisions which have been reached through consensus. 
  This will prevent unnecessary dissension within Golkar in 
the 
future, he said. 
  Harmoko himself has warned that the central executive board 
will not tolerate disciplinary problems and will punish members 
who step out of line. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A New Political Trend"] </F>
  [Text] Golkar [Functional Group], the government-backed 
political entity, has been witnessing a number of tempests in 
its teacup recently. Many Golkar functionaries in the provinces 
have resorted to acts of defiance in the election of local 
regents by rejecting the candidates backed by its central board 
or the central government. 
  These acts within the Golkar rank and file in the provinces 
which have come to be dubbed "undercurrents", have been so 
frequent that many observers view them as positive phenomena in 
the development of the country's political system. 
  Although in nearly all of the cases, Golkar's local 
politicians lost the cause, the inspiring aspect of their 
rejection of directives is that they now have the boldness to 
say "no" in situations in which they would previously have 
responded with total passivity. Every citizen here -- outside 
and inside the ruling political organization -- is quite aware 
that Golkar leaders are supposed to toe the government line. 
  Most observers would probably agree that although provincial 
politicians might have been a bit extreme in expressing their 
views, the central government has not been totally right in its 
aggressive effort to make local legislators accept its 
candidates. Minister of Home Affairs Yogi S. Memet withdrew his 
gubernatorial candidate for Central Kalimantan after the latter 
won local election but was subsequently widely opposed by the 
local leaders. 
  However, President Suharto refuses to recognize the 
existence 
of a trend. The head of state, in his capacity as chief patron 
of the Golkar, said in written message to the party leaders on 
Monday that there was no such thing as "undercurrents". In his 
view, the situation reflects no more than the fact that a few 
people claimed to speak on behalf of the masses. 
  Suharto's notion could be viewed as a call for Golkar 
leaders 
to set the organization's house in order. It is their internal 
problem. 
  But because the tendency is becoming more popular here now, 
the question is whether all political engineering -- which 
Suharto said cannot be separated from politics -- has a negative 
connotation? To Suharto the tendency toward more vocal local 
stances in the Golkar hierarchy might look like old-fashioned 
politicking because it does not introduce any positive way of 
thinking. But in other places, such as within the Indonesian 
Democratic Party (PDI), this type of "political engineering" has 
managed to channel the aspirations of the younger generation who 
rejected any candidate for the party leadership with a clear 
leaning toward the establishment. They believed that this kind 
of person would not be able to make the PDI a viable party. 
  During its congress at the end of last year, many young 
leaders of the PDI were of the opinion that the congress must be 
able to elect a strong and popular leader who would be able to 
put an end to the party's long history of internal squabbles 
once and for all. And to achieve this, they should also lend 
their ears to the young people, who had become more and more 
expressive. The younger ones were making an effort to gain 
wider participation within the party, a legal and normal crusade 
within a democratic country, where leaders are expected to be 
open and wise. 
  Whether or not President Suharto specifically meant the 
recent extra high profile activities among Golkar leaders in the 
provinces when he spoke about undercurrents, when looking at the 
reasons behind the new tendency we believe that it is not 
political engineering but political professionalism which has 
begun to gain a foothold. And this can be expected to provide 
Golkar with a more colorful political spectrum.

  [Text] Malaysia hopes to get the support of other G-15 
[Group of 15] and South countries to oppose a wage-trade link 
proposal with a view to setting the minimum global wage 
standards at the upcoming General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, GATT, meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco. Foreign Minister 
Datuk Abdullah Haji Ahmad Badawi said he was hopeful that the 
G-15 and South countries could meet prior to the 15 April GATT 
meeting to establish a common stand against the proposal by the 
U.S. and France. The Uruguay round trade accord is to be signed 
by 120 countries at the meeting next week. The U.S. and France 
were proposing that a wage-trade link be discussed at the 
meeting, setting in motion a debate on the proposed minimum 
global wage standards. Datuk Abdullah was speaking to reporters 
after meeting China's vice minister for foreign affairs, Tang 
Jianxuan, at Wisma Putera [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] in Kuala 
Lumpur. The four-man delegation arrived on Tuesday for a 
three-day visit to Kuala Lumpur and Melaka. 
  Reiterating that linking workers' rights with trade was 
unjustified, he hoped the G-15 along with other South countries 
would be united in opposing the link. The G-15 needed to 
discuss and coordinate support from all countries of the South, 
adding that the proposal would have a serious impact on the 
economies of the developing countries.

  [Text] Malaysia does not consider as a security threat to 
the country the Royal Thai Navy's plan to purchase a helicopter 
carrier. This was stated by Chief of Navy Vice Admiral Datuk Sri 
Mohamed Sharif Ishak. He said any development of the armed 
forces of the ASEAN countries should not be considered as a 
threat because it could contribute to regional defense 
capability. He even revealed that the stronger the forces the 
better the grouping. He was speaking at a maritime security 
forum of the Malaysian Institute of Maritime Affairs in Kuala 
Lumpur. 
  Meanwhile, visiting Rear Admiral Thammanun Nathirot of the 
Royal Thai Navy said Thailand has no plans to buy an aircraft 
carrier or an attack warship, but will buy a helicopter carrier 
to provide support for its sea defense system.

<F P=106> [By Shaik Osman Majid] </F>
  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs -- Bank Negara [Central Bank] 
Governor Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein today admitted mistakes were 
made by the Central Bank in foreign exchange dealings that 
resulted in a loss of RM [Ringgit Malaysia] 5.7 billion over the 
past year. 
  "For the losses I take ful] responsibility. It is the most 
honourable thing to do," he said in a press conference here 
after presenting the Bank Negara Annual Report 1993. 
  Asked if in accepting responsibility he will resign Jaffar 
said: "If there is a move in that direction, you (the media) 
will be the third to know after the Prime Minister and the 
Finance Minister." 
  He also said: "Others down the line will also be held 
accountable, some have already resigned." 
  Asked to explain the absence of Nor Mohamed Yakcop, adviser 
and the man in charge of the foreign exchange dealings, at this 
year's press conference, Jaffar said: "He has gone on long 
leave." 
  The Governor made it clear that "there was no fraud" in the 
loss suffered by the Central Bank. 
  Despite a total loss of RM6.4 billion, including a loss of 
RM700 million in its ordinary operations, the Central Bank's 
balance sheet remained strong and the national financial 
strength was not affected. 
  Total assets of the Central Bank increased by 68 per cent to 
exceed, for the first time, RM100 billion at the end of 1993. 
  Foreign reserves increased sharply over the last year to 
RM76.4 billion which is sufficient to finance about eight months 
of retained imports and 1 1/2 times the size of the country's 
external debt. 
  Equally impressive was the growth of the economy. Gross 
Domestic Product [GDP] grew by 8.5 per cent which means an 
average growth rate of almost nine per cent for the last six 
years. 
  The buoyant growth was achieved on the back of an inflation 
rate below four per cent. 
  The Consumer Price Index [CPI] moderated to 3.6 per cent, 
compared to 4.7 per cent in 1992. 
  The forecast for 1994 is a high 8.4 per cent GDP growth 
provided costs, especially wages, can be controlled. 
  He said the Central Bank took forward positions in 
currencies 
like the US dollar, deutschmark, and the yen. The rates, 
however, did not move as anticipated by the bank, causing it to 
suffer losses. 
  This is the second year the Central Bank has incurred losses 
in the foreign exchange market. It lost RM9 billion in 1992 
though it was described as "loss on paper". 
  "The Central Bank has to deal in foreign exchange be cause 
of 
the need to maintain liquidity in other currencies for trade 
purposes,' he said. 
  "In hindsight it is apparent that we made the wrong 
decisions 
(buying into forward or long-term positions) but we had to act 
the way we did. If we did not take any action the loss might 
have been even more than RM5.7 billion. 
  "The loss will be written off against the Central Bank's 
future profits," he said, admitting that "it would take time." 
  The Central Bank will continue to deal in foreign exchange 
but "only at spot prices" that is buying and selling as and when 
the need for that particular currency arises. 
  Jaffar said the prospect of strong economic growth this year 
was bright. 
  If Malaysian businessmen continue to maintain and hopefully 
improve their competitive edge and consumers spend wisely 
Malaysians could easily look forward to yet another year of 
rapid growth exceeding eight per cent," Jaffar said in his 
introductory remarks. 
  Despite the inflationary pressures of the first month of 
1994 
when seasonal and festive consumer spending prodded the CPI by 
four per cent, Jaffar said the Government will put into place 
measures to ensure that inflation does not move beyond four per 
cent this year. 
  The manufacturing sector has been the main source of 
economic 
growth for the past seven years, contributing no less than 30.1 
per cent to the GDP in 1993. Indeed it will continue to be the 
Iynchpin of the economy. 
  The Federal Government achieved a remarkable financial 
performance last year when it recorded its first overall budget 
surplus since 1960. 
  The local stock market saw a record-breaking performance in 
terms of prices, turnover and market capitalisation. 
  Trading on the Kuala Stock Exchange [KLSE] in 1593 alone 
exceeded the amount of total trade undertaken during the past 20 
years in terms of both turnover (107.8 billion units) and value 
(RM387.3 billion). From 1973 to 1992, the total volume 
recorded on the KLSE was a mere 82 million units valued at RM197 
million. 
  In 1993, the KLSE emerged as the largest bourse in Asean and 
the fourth largest in Asia in terms of market capitalisation 
after Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong. 
  The bank system displayed the best performance on record 
last 
year, with pre-tax profit of the banks reaching almost RM4 
billion.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim says 
that Malaysia's sound economy was unshaken by losses incurred by 
Bank Negara [Central Bank] in its foreign exchange [forex] 
dealings. He said that Malaysia's reserves were very strong and 
that the country's assets which exceed 100 billion ringgit are 
very huge in the context of gross domestic product. The latest 
figure which showed 76 billion ringgit reserves was quite 
progressive. He pointed out that even if the Central Bank did 
not trade, the country would still have lost money simply 
because of the appreciating ringgit on the back of the robust 
economy. Datuk Sri Anwar, who is also finance minister, was 
responding to questions by Swedish journalists accompanying 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt on a three-day visit to 
Malaysia. The deputy prime minister said that he had in 1992 
ordered Bank Negara cease trading in the forex market after 
learning that the Central Bank had been incurring losses. 
Describing the forex losses of 9 billion ringgit in 1992 and 5.7 
billion ringgit last year by Bank Negara as a serious error in 
judgment, he said he had instructed the Central Bank at that 
time not to excessively trade in reserves. He said that the 
Finance Ministry became aware of the losses about one and a half 
years ago. 
  The Swedish journalists also posed several questions ranging 
from Malaysia-Sweden bilateral relations to human rights. Datuk 
Sri Anwar said Malaysia did not condone abuse of human rights by 
any country or government. But at the same time, Malaysia does 
not expect the Western countries to insist that certain 
countries should observe their rules. He said Western countries 
should learn to understand and appreciate the situation in 
certain countries in the East, especially Asia. It was true to 
some extent that developed countries in the West had a lot to 
offer developing countries in the East, but they should also 
learn to accept and respect the values and norms of the 
countries in the East, particularly in Asia.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "US must adjust to new realities in Asia"] </F>
  [Text] On the heels of Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's quietly humiliating trip to Peking, the United 
States was dealt another blow to its prestige when assistant 
secretary of state Robin Raphel spent several days in New Delhi 
late last month. The political dynamics of that visit bear 
study and shed light on emerging new realities in Asia. 
  On Mr Christopher's fiasco of diplomatic mission to assert 
US 
might on behalf of jailed Chinese dissidents, Paula R. Newberg 
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace put it perhaps 
the most kindly: "The China debacle exemplifies the difficulties 
of discussing rights issues with rights violators," she wrote. 
Ms Raphel's visit to Delhi was characterised by much forced 
jocularity on her part, and a field day fo India's lively, 
nationalistic Press. Kanchan Gupta of THE PIONEER newspaper 
chided Home Minister S.B. Chavan for "warmly greeting" Raphel, 
thereby "mortgaging our foreign policy to the quirks of 
political novices like Ms Raphel who would have been pushing 
files in anonymous offices had it not been for Mr Bill Clinton 
coming to power in the US." 
  The state of relations was well illustrated by a brief 
incident caught by the camera of THE ASIAN AGE, whose photo 
caption read: "Joint secretary Hardeep Puri, in best diplomatic 
demeanour, welcomes a cheery Robin Raphel at his office in South 
Block on Wednesday morning. Keen observers noted that he 
quickly camouflaged a wince as Ms Raphel took her fellow 
bureaucrat by the arm." 
  The matter of Kashmir -- the main topic on Ms Raphel's 
agenda 
-- is complex, and India is far from blameless. But the Indian 
Government has shown itself healthily disdainful of US 
protestations and machinations in the now-hackneyed "wake of the 
Cold War". The US must learn -- surely is learning, and quickly 
-- that it can no longer follow the dictum of former president 
Theodore Roosevelt by speaking softly and carrying a big stick. 
That reality is an ugly one: The US has been an important force 
for human rights as well as a major political and economic 
player in the world for some decades now. As long as America 
was a leading factor in the world economy, governments with 
which it has done business have had at least to pay lip service 
to democracy and human rights. 
  This is amply evident in the Clinton administration's 
diplomatic soft-shoe over Most Favoured Nation trading status 
for China. But with the Cold War yielding to multipolar entropy 
and the impending economic rise of Asia (especially China), this 
too will change. The failure of Soviet communism and the 
apparent decline in America's ability to live by its founding 
ideals have left the moral foundation of global politics 
dangerously weak. Brute power is becoming more decisive than 
ever both inside and among countries. 
  Much concern has lately been expressed over alleged human 
rights abuses by Indian armed forces in Kashmir. No doubt there 
is some, perhaps much, truth in the allegations made. Yet 
analyst Ajit Bhattacharjea in the India newspaper THE PIONEER 
makes a very good and welcome point when he writes: "The lesson 
to be learnt is that foreign pressure enables the Government to 
justify its policies, not to modify them. In the last analysis, 
the human rights of Kashmiris, as of every one else in this 
country, can be secured only by ourselves." 
  Mr Bhattacharjea's point is mature beyond almost anything 
else written or said by journalists or politicians anywhere. 
His extremely apt point is that if we, the citizens of a 
country -- say, Thailand -- believe human rights are important, 
then we, the citizens must insist on them. We must hold our 
government and our elected leaders accountable, constantly and 
rigorously. "The fact is," writes Mr Bhattacharjea "that civil 
rights, in this country or in China, or anywhere else, cannot be 
sustained by Washington. but only by the pressure of domestic 
opinion." 
  The question then becomes: Do we want civil rights? Do we 
want a democratic, accountable government? Do we want to know 
what is happening to our water supply, and the traffic on our 
city streets, and our villages, and our rivers? If so, we must 
rely on ourselves, as individuals and as organised groups of 
citizens. We cannot rely on the US. To quote Mr Bhattacharjea 
yet again: "There is much in the US record ... to show that 
human rights have been regarded as negotiable in exchange for 
strategic and economic facilities." In any case, in today's 
world the US doesn't seem to be the "superpower with clout" it 
used to be. Just ask Warren Christopher or Robin Raphel.

  [Text] Washington, April 6 KYODO -- A special Japanese 
envoy met a top U.S. State Department official Wednesday [6 
April] at the start of a private visit apparently designed to 
seek a breakthrough in stalled bilateral trade negotiations. 
  Nobuo Matsunaga, a veteran diplomat with extensive ties in 
Washington, has arranged several rounds of informal talks with 
senior officials in the Clinton administration during his stay 
here throughout the week. The appointments include meetings 
with trade representative Mickey Kantor, Robert Rubin, head of 
the White House National Economic Council, and presidential 
National Security Adviser Tony Lake. 
  Matsunaga began his round of calls after arriving in 
Washington on Wednesday with a meeting with Undersecretary of 
State for Economic Affairs Joan Spero. He said after emerging 
from his visit to Spero that they had only a "general 
discussion" on bilateral relations. 
  There was no discussion on the stalled "framework" trade 
talks between the two countries, he said. 
  State Department officials also said Matsunaga and Spero had 
a broad discussion of bilateral ties. Matsunaga "didn't bring 
any specific message from Japan," a State Department official 
said. 
  Matsunaga's trip to Washington came after Japan and the 
United States set up a meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata and Kantor for next week in Morocco. 
  Tokyo has urged Washington to resume the stalled framework 
talks, which have become a focal point of escalating tension in 
bilateral trade ties. 
  After the trade talks ruptured on February 11 at a summit 
between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, Washington reinstated the "Super 301" 
trade law provision which gives the U.S. Government broad 
authority to impose sanctions on countries accused of practicing 
unfair trade. 
  The Japanese Government last week offered a new package of 
market-opening measures, but Kantor rejected the proposals as of 
"little substance." Earlier this week, the U.S. Government 
turned up the heat by putting Japan on top of a list of 
countries accused of maintaining significant trade barriers 
against U.S. products.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- A top Japanese trade 
official said Thursday [7 April] he expects Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata to agree with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor on resumption of stalled bilateral talks on a new trade 
framework. 
  Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, on 
April 15 as the two visit there for the signing of a new global 
trade pact known as the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement. The 
Hata-Kantor meeting is expected to produce "good results" as 
there are signs that Washington is softening its stance on 
bilateral economic issues, said the top official at the Ministry 
of International Trade and Industry. 
  The official stressed the need to reach agreement by around 
June 10 when Emperor Akihito visits the United States and 
suggested that Japan should decide on "drastic" measures to do 
so. 
  As for U.S. policy on Japan, the official said the issue of 
how to deal with the nuclear problem in North Korea seems to be 
given top priority in U.S. policy on Japan. "It seems that the 
Clinton administration to date has separated security issues 
from trade issues in trade negotiations with Japan but recently 
they appear to have linked security issues with trade issues," 
the official said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Residents near the U.S. 
Yokota Air Base decided Tuesday [5 April] night not to appeal to 
the Supreme Court a ruling that rejected their demands for a ban 
on night flights but ordered compensation for their suffering. 
The plaintiffs also decided to ask the government not to 
appeal, said Ryuzo Fukumoto, leader of the residents. 
  The government has not expressed whether it will appeal or 
not. The deadline for appeal expires next Wednesday. 
  The Tokyo high court last Wednesday ruled that the 
government 
pay 710 million yen to 596 residents near the base, 40 
kilometers west of central Tokyo, for past suffering from noise. 
The court, though, rejected the suit's demands for a ban on 
night flights and compensation for future annoyance. 
  "To give up an appeal is regrettable... (but) the residents 
have aged too much," Fukumoto told reporters. 
  In November last year, Japan and the United States agreed 
that flights and ground activities at the base between 10 P.M. 
and 6 A.M. should be restricted to those which are essential to 
U.S. military operations.

<F P=106> [Opening speech by Yang Hyong-sop, chairman of the Supreme </F>
People's Assembly (SPA), delivered at the opening of the seventh 
session of the ninth SPA held at Mansudae Assembly Hall on the 
morning of 6 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Comrade Deputies: Today we are holding the seventh 
session of the ninth SPA at a time when all the people are 
upholding the party's call and the militant tasks presented by 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year's address 
and the 21st plenary session of the Sixth Central Committee of 
the Workers Party of Korea in vigorously waging a struggle to 
effect a new revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction and 
to smash [chitpusida] the anti-republic maneuvers of 
imperialists and reactionaries who are making more malicious 
efforts than ever before. 
  Overflowing with invincible faith and optimism, our people, 
who are single-heartedly united around the party and the leader 
[suryong], powerfully displayed the superiority and invincible 
might of the popular mass-centered socialism of our own style 
and firmly defended the socialist cause without any vacillation 
during acute confrontation with the enemies by effecting an 
upsurge in the construction and revolution, after the conclusion 
of the sixth session of the ninth SPA. [applause] 
  Our people, under the wise leadership of the party and the 
leader [suryong], vigorously waged the three revolutions -- 
ideological, technological, and cultural -- in every domain of 
socialist construction, holding aloft the revolutionary, 
socialist banner of the chuche idea. In so doing, our people 
brilliantly adorned the last year of the Third Seven-Year Plan 
by strengthening the country's political, economic, military 
power all the more, and triumphantly advancing the chuche 
socialist cause. 
  Observing the 30th anniversary of the publication of the 
great agricultural thesis, our people have proudly summed up the 
brilliant achievements and results scored in socialist 
agricultural construction, and are powerfully waging the 
struggle for the ultimate solution of the socialist agricultural 
problem, holding aloft the respected and beloved leader's 
[suryong] historic letter to the national agricultural meeting. 
  Our party designated the next three years as a period for 
adjustment based on scientific analysis of the present status of 
the situation today and our country's socialist economic 
construction, to set forth a revolutionary economic strategy in 
thoroughly implementing agriculture-first, light industry-first, 
and trade-first policy; to give priority to the leading sectors 
of people's economy; and to further develop the metal industry. 
  The economic strategy put forward by our party is a most 
just economic strategy of our style for renovating the nation's 
economic structure in compliance with the practical demands of 
changed international circumstances [pyonhwadoen kukjejok 
hwangyong] and our national economy and for effecting a change 
in direction [panghyang chonhwan] in foreign trade. [applause] 
  Today we are faced with the grave and honorable tasks of 
more 
satisfactorily resolving the problems pertaining to the people's 
living by thoroughly implementing our party's revolutionary 
economic strategy in accordance with the demand of socialism and 
of promptly upgrading [chukhyo seuda] the nation's overall 
economy. 
  Our people must fulfill tasks of the adjustment period of 
socialist economic construction amid fierce confrontation with 
the enemy. 
  By cherishing rock-firm faith that as long as there is the 
wise leadership of the party and the leader [suryong] who is 
leading the Korean revolution along the single road of victory 
with ironclad will and refined leadership, we will win victory 
without fail, our people today are vigorously accelerating the 
general march to carry out the works of the adjustment period of 
socialist economic construction. 
  Held during this historic time, the current SPA session will 
discuss issues with great significance in effecting a new great 
revolutionary upsurge in socialist construction and in 
consolidating and developing the systems of the state and 
society. Thus, it will greatly contribute to glorifying the 
socialist cause. [applause] 
  Six hundred and fifteen of the 653 SPA deputies are in 
attendance at the seventh session of the ninth SPA. Therefore, 
the session can be convened in accordance with Article 93 of the 
DPRK Socialist Constitution. 
  I firmly believe that with the active participation of all 
comrades deputies, the current SPA will satisfactorily discuss 
and decide agenda items put forward at the session. I now 
declare the seventh session of the ninth SPA open. [applause]

<F P=106> ["On Successfully Fulfilling Tasks of Socialist Economic </F>
Construction in Adjustment Period"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Deputy Kang Song-san, 
premier of the Administration Council, made a report on the 
first agenda item "On Successfully Fulfilling the Tasks of 
Socialist Economic Construction in the Period of Adjustment Set 
Forth by the Workers' Party of Korea" on the first day of the 
7th session of the ninth Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK 
which has opened here. 
  The reporter recalled that the 21st plenary meeting of the 
sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in 
December last year reviewed the fulfilment of the Third 
Seven-Year Plan and put forward an economic strategy, setting a 
three-year period of adjustment, on the basis of a scientific 
analysis of the present situation and the state of socialist 
economic construction in the country. 
  He quoted the great leader President Kim Il-song as saying: 
  "At the twenty-first plenary meeting of the sixth party 
Central Committee, the next three years were set as a period for 
adjustment in socialist economic construction and during this 
period we must implement the agriculture-first, light 
industry-first and foreign trade-first policies. Along with 
this, we must give precedence to the coal industry, power 
industry and rail transport, which must advance ahead of the 
other sectors of the national economy, while continuing to 
develop the metal industry." 
  The task of socialist economic construction in the period 
for 
adjustment is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, 
light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies and give 
precedence to the coal industry, power industry and rail 
transport, which must advance ahead of the other sectors of the 
national economy, while continuing to develop the metal industry. 
  The revolutionary economic strategy for the period of 
adjustment in socialist economic construction represents the 
steadfast determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea 
to radically improve the people's living standard in the next 
few years and develop the national economy into an economy 
strong in independence which can walk on its own feet, remaining 
unshaken under any circumstances. 
  When we, by implementing the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy, bring about a new turn in the development of 
agriculture, light industry and foreign trade and keep the 
preferential sectors of the national economy definitely ahead of 
the others while continuing to develop the metal industry, the 
departmental structure of the economy will be further improved 
and its independence and potential will grow immensely. 
  Our party's economic strategy is a just policy which makes 
it 
possible to more successfully implement the basic line of 
economic construction in conformity with the demand of the 
prevailing situation and the developing realities. 
  The agriculture-first policy is the primary task to be 
carried out in the adjustment period. 
  By implementing this policy to the letter, we must make an 
advance in all domains of agricultural production such as grain, 
meat, egg, fruit and vegetable production, thus satisfactorily 
solving the food problem for the people. 
  We must, above all, consolidate the achievements in 
irrigation and electrification to give full scope to their 
potential and raise the level of comprehensive mechanization and 
application of chemicals to a higher stage. 
  We must raise the utilization rate of the existing farm 
machines to the maximum and, at the same time, produce above 
30,000 tractors and 10,000 or more lorries and other farm 
machines of various kinds needed for mechanizing 
labour-consuming work in the adjustment period. 
  And the supply of nitrogenous, phosphatic and potassic 
fertilizers must be increased for the rural communities. 
  The green revolution must be pushed ahead to obtain 
high-grade strains of seed, which are high-yielding, suitable to 
the climatic and soil conditimns of our country, early-ripening 
and resisting storms, cold and moisture, blight and harmful 
insects, including the first filial generations of rice and 
maize which can yield 12 to 15 tons per hectare. 
  The per hectare yield in paddy and non-paddy fields must be 
raised to above 8 tons on an average and gradually to more than 
10 tons to produce 15 million tons of grain in the near future. 
  During the period of adjustment fruit and meat output must 
be 
raised 30 percent respectively. 
  A big effort must be directed to the implementation of the 
light industry-first policy. 
  Textile output must be boosted above 20 percent and the 
output of shoes more than 10 percent in the period. 
  Food processing industry must be further developed to supply 
more abundant and diverse food to the people and the quantity 
and variety of consumer goods must be continuously increased. 
  The chemical factories and industrial establishments 
producing raw materials for the light industry must lift the 
output of vinalon and other chemical fibres and synthetic resin 
more than 10 percent and produce enough raw materials for the 
light industry including paper, dyestuffs and basic chemical 
goods. 
  A new turnabout must be made in foreign trade to cope with 
the changed circumstances. 
  A brisk drive must be launched in all sectors of the 
national 
economy to expand the production bases of export goods and 
improve the quality of products for a radical increase of 
exports. 
  Efforts must be directed to the building of the 
Najin-Sonbong 
free economic and trade zone to fully ensure conditions for 
investment by foreign businesses. 
  We must expand and strengthen economic ties with countries 
which are on good terms with our country and further develop 
trade and economic dealings with Southeast Asian countries which 
are within easy reach geographically and favourable for 
transactions. 
  Coal and power output and railway freight turnover which 
should advance ahead of other sectors must be increased 30 
percent respectively during the period of adjustment. And 
investment in oil prospecting must be increased to discover more 
oil deposits. 
  The metal industry must be developed to satisfactorily meet 
the growing demand for irons and steels.

  [Excerpt] Vientiane -- Visiting Australian Prime Minister 
Paul Keating yesterday urged Laos, a close communist ally of 
North Korea, to help defuse nuclear tension in the Korean 
peninsular, said Foreign Minister Samsavat Lengsavat. 
  The request was raised during Keating's talks with his 
Laotian counterpart Khamtai Siphandon. Laos' response, however, 
was cautious. 
  Somsavat said despite the government's policy fostering 
world 
peace and stability, Vientiane respected countries' individual 
rights to find solutions to their own problems. 
  "We (Laos and North Korea) in fact have good relations. Our 
two countries were the victims of aggression in the past," said 
Somsavat. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said that it is hard 
to consider the North Korean nuclear issue a South-North issue 
because it has developed into an issue at the level of 
international cooperation since the UN Security Council took 
issued the president's statement. 
  While giving a briefing on the result of President Kim's 
recent visit to Japan and China at the Democratic Liberal 
Party's office today, Minister Han Sung-chu said the above and 
added that we should try to resolve the nuclear issue between 
South and North Korea through efforts between the International 
Atomic Energy Agency and North Korea and between the United 
States and North Korea. 
  Minister Han also said we should make efforts to remove the 
belief at home and abroad that the Korean peninsula is facing a 
crisis to prevent adverse influence upon our economy, including 
tourism, investment, and trade. He added that U.S. Secretary of 
Defense William Perry's recent remark that the United States 
would not hesitate to bring about war has been confirmed to be 
an exaggeration by reporters. 
  Regarding the Russian proposal for eight-party talks on the 
nuclear issue, Minister Han said that he basically welcomed 
[kibonjoguro hwanyonghanda] Russia's interest in the issue and 
that he would consult with countries concerned, watching their 
reactions.

  [Text] The second plenary session of the National 
Assembly's first legislature was opened on the morning of 5 
April 1994 and closed in the same morning because it did not 
agree on two of the four items on the agenda proposed by the 
National Assembly's Standing Committee. 
  The four items on the agenda of the Assembly meeting are: 1/ 
the message from Cambodia's king; 2/ the report by the National 
Assembly's Standing Committee; 3/ the discussion and decision on 
the invalidation of the status of the people's representatives 
and the validity of new assembly members; and 4/ other matters. 
  Before the opening of the session, the third item attracted 
the most attention because it was expected that the Assembly 
would discuss the cases of 17 members who will leave the 
assembly as they are taking up public positions which are 
incompatible with the role of assembly members. The assembly 
was also expected to examine the validity of 17 new members. 
Due to differences in the views concerning the wording of the 
agenda, the third item was withdrawn. This difference of views 
stemmed from the words "invalidity of assembly members' status" 
which many members thought improper, as the wording seems to 
look down on those who are leaving the assembly. Objection was 
also raised concerning the fourth item over the wording "other 
matters." A large number of assembly members demanded to know 
precisely what these matters are. 
  There were two conflicting views on the third and fourth 
items. A minority view held that the wording can be changed; 
however, the majority objected. This objection led to the 
withdrawal of items three and four and the meeting closed 
cheerlessly after listening to the king's message and the report 
by the National Assembly's Standing Committee. 
  It is worth noting that Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, 
first prime minister, attended this session but Samdech Hun Sen, 
second prime minister, did not, for health reasons. 
  His Excellency Loy Simchheang, acting National Assembly 
chairman, said at this meeting that it was almost the day the 
meeting was due to open and yet the National Assembly's Standing 
Committee seemed to have found nothing of importance to include 
in the agenda...[ellipsis as published] 
  This was probably why this session's agenda is so short. 
  Earlier, it was expected that the immigration law, the new 
investment law, the press law, the bill on the Supreme Council 
of Judges, the 1994 state plan ... [ellipsis as published] would 
also be discussed at this session. 
  However, what was planned and what some personalities have 
disclosed were not raised in the agenda of the second National 
Assembly's plenary session following a three-month recess. Some 
Assembly officials said that the fact that the session does not 
have any bills for the National Assembly to debate and decide 
upon was due to the delay in forwarding those bills from the 
government to the National Assembly's Standing Committee so that 
these can be included in the agenda. 
  Analysts say that there seemed to be something hidden in 
this 
movement to object to the third item concerning the switching of 
Assembly members. 
  An assembly member from FUNCINPEC [National United Front for 
an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] is 
of the opinion that this switching of Assembly members "is 
complex and that there is certainly no way out." However, what 
people did not expect was the fact that this issue has not even 
been resolved at its agenda stage.

  [Text] British Secretary of State for Education John Patten 
says he sensed a great desire on the part of Malaysia and 
Britain to bring business back on normal footing as soon as 
possible. He said this was his impression from meetings with 
various ministers and British businessmen during his three-day 
visit to Malaysia which ended today. He was anxious that the 
flow of investment from the United Kingdom into Malaysia 
continues because he thinks that it would be a benefit to both 
countries. Patten, the highest-ranking official to visit 
Malaysia since the Malaysian Government slapped a ban on 
awarding government projects to British companies in February. 
Patten said that once he returned home, he would try his best 
to give a picture that relations between the two countries were 
getting better again and that investment opportunities in 
Malaysia were too good for British investors to miss.

  [Text] Bangkok, April 7 (1993) -- A Burmese dissident group 
Thursday denounced the ongoing constitutional convention in 
Rangoon and revealed a split among opposition delegates. 
  The 702 delegates to the convention, which first met in 
January 1993, are drafting a document that will ensure continued 
military rule, the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) 
said in a statement. 
  "Such a constitution is merely backbone for the continued 
existence of military rule and the political system (being drawn 
up) is no more than a military-dominated one," said the 
statement by the ABSDF Central Committee. 
  It noted the 93 delegates from the main opposition National 
League for Democracy (NLD) had submitted a 47-page proposal to 
the convention on May 26, 1993, and it had been ignored. The 
NLD camp is split between those who want to continue attending 
the convention and those who want to pull out, it said. Last 
December, the NLD leadership ruled its delegates should remain. 
  Since then, "there has been high tension between the NLD 
delegates to the NC (national convention) who believe in 
attending the NC and others ... who object to the NC," the 
statement said. 
  The anti-convention group has since proposed standing by the 
NLD's 47-page proposal and has said that if the pro-convention 
group is not "courageous" enough to do so, the anti-convention 
delegates will resign from the drafting body, it said. 
  The majority of NLD delegates have said that if the 
convention does not adopt the party's proposal, they will send a 
written objection to the international community, it said. 
  No NLD spokesman could be reached Thursday for comment, but 
another dissident spokesman told AFP it was proper for the ABSDF 
to comment on the NLD's actions because the two groups have 
"many connections." 
  The NLD delegates essentially represent all dissident groups 
at the constitutional convention. The other delegates represent 
other sectors of Burmese society. 
  The NLD overwhelmingly won the May 1990 national elections 
in 
Burma, but the ruling junta [word indistinct] to turn over power 
and instead cracked down on the opposition.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists 
and the South Korean puppets staged a provocative air war 
exercise against the North Wednesday with overseas-based KC-135 
refueling tankers, F-15 fighter-bombers and AV-8 VTOL [vertical 
takeoff and landing] assault planes and hundreds of 
fighter-bombers, assault planes and observation planes belonging 
to the U.S. Airforce in South Korea and the puppet airforce, 
military sources said. 
  The air war exercise in the skies above Chongju and Wonju 
was 
aimed at testing the capacity of the overseas-based warplanes of 
the U.S. Airforce and Marines in non-stop quick deployment in 
the operational airspace and surprise bombing on the North. 
  An overseas-based E-3 early warning plane, two RC-135 
strategic reconnaissance planes, U-2 high-attitude strategic 
reconnaissance plane, RV-1 tactical reconnaissance plane and 
three RF-4C airforce reconnaissance planes committed an aerial 
espionage on the frontline area, coastline area, the inland and 
strategic in-depth areas of the North. 
  Fifteen reconnaissance planes were involved in the aerial 
espionage on the North in the South Korean airspace that day.

<F P=106> ["S. Korean `National Security Law' Must Be Scrapped </F>
Immediately" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Voices strongly urging 
the abrogation of the "National Security Law [NSL]" in South 
Korea are ringing out from different countries. 
  J.O. Adeloju, chairman of the Nigerian Committee for 
Supporting the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, said in a press 
statement that the "National Security Law" of South Korea is the 
fascist law which defines North Korea as "an anti-state 
organization", barring free travels and exchange between the 
North and the South. 
  If the North-South dialogue is to progress successfully and 
peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula to be achieved 
at an early date, it is necessary to immediately and 
unconditionally scrap the NSL, he contended. 
  The Mozambican Committee for Friendship with the People of 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said in a statement 
that the South Korean authorities must know clearly that they 
can never evade the blame for their treason in blocking the 
national reunification, if they refuse to repeal the "National 
Security Law" despite warnings from the world people. 
  The Indonesian paper IN O SIAN OTSERVER carried an article 
branding the "NSL" as an obstacle to the materialization of 
democracy in South Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the 
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland 
[CPRF] published its Information No. 647 Wednesday, in which it 
accused the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique of more frantically 
intensifying fascist crackdown upon patriotic students who rise 
in the struggle for independence against the United States and 
for national reunification. 
  According to the information, the South Korean fascist 
clique, some time ago, arrested about 450 students affiliated 
with Hanchongnyon (the South Korean Federation of General 
Student Councils), who had staged a demonstration urging a 
peaceful solution to the "nuclear issue" and protesting the 
deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea. And they 
walked away students affiliated with the Pusan and South 
Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils, who 
had protested against the rice market opening and shipment of 
Patriot in South Korea and urged a total dismantlement of the 
U.S. military bases. 
  They also imposed heavy penalties upon students, who had 
exchanged messages with students of Kim Il-song University in 
the North and taken the lead in demonstrations calling for 
anti-U.S. independence and national reunification, on "charges" 
of violation of the "National Security Law". 
  The puppet clique's brutal suppression and harsh punishment 
are an open challenge to the patriotic students of South Korea 
who aspire after independence, democracy and reunification, the 
information says, adding: 
  "We strongly hold that such anti-reunification, 
anti-democracy fascist laws as the `National Security Law' 
should be abrogated in South Korea and all the patriotic 
students arrested on unwarrantable charges be released without 
delay."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) declared 
Thursday afternoon that students of more than 140 universities 
and colleges across South Korea would go on a strike all at once 
from April 8 in an effort to check a "parliamentary 
ratification" of the farm market opening and as an expression of 
protest against signing of the "Uruguay Round Accord" due in 
Morocco this month, a radio report from Seoul said. 
  Along with this, a more than 200-member "hunger-strike team 
of Hanchongnyon for national salvation" will launch into an 
indefinite hunger sit-down at the "National Assembly Hall" in 
Youido, Seoul, and fasting will be staged in different areas and 
at universities for an indefinite period, it announced. 
  Hanchongnyon took a vote on the farm market opening and the 
signing of the "Uruguay Round Accord" among 350,000 students of 
145 universities and colleges, and 90.5 percent of the voters 
expressed opposition to them.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- "All the forces opposed 
to division and confrontation, all the classes and strata 
aspiring after national reconciliation and unity should turn out 
as one to open up a decisive phase for carrying into practice 
the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation," 
said the Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in an open letter to the people 
from all walks of life in South Korea on April 5, the 
Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported. 
  The letter was published on the lapse of one year since the 
great leader President Kim Il-song put forward the "10-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the 
reunification of the country". 
  It said if the 10-point programme of the great national 
unity 
is to be realized, it is important, above all, to wage a 
vigorous struggle to remove the forces of war and confrontation, 
the separatist forces that block reconciliation and great unity 
between the South and the North of the country and also to fight 
for the abrogation of the "National Security Law", an 
anti-national, anti-reunification evil law. 
  "The entire people," it stressed, "cherishing deep in mind 
the pride of having sagacious Comrade Kim Chong-il, the 
distinguished leader of the present times, at the head of the 
nation, should unite under the grand banner of great national 
unity and dynamically advance towards the establishment of a 
confederal, unified state, independent, peaceful and neutral."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Cho Il-min, chief of 
the Pyongyang mission of the South Korean National Democratic 
Front (Hanminjon), issued a statement Tuesday on the lapse of 
one year since the great leader President Kim Il-song put 
forward the historic "10-point programme of the great unity of 
the whole nation for The Reunification of the country." 
  The statement says: 
  The internal and external situation urgently demands that 
the 
Korean nation implement on a higher level the ten-point 
programme of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by 
respected President Kim Il-song. 
  Now that the Kim Yong-sam regime is totally blocking the 
people's movement for independent reunification and persisting 
in confrontation with the North, the entire Koreans in the 
South, North and overseas must unite more closely than ever 
before, smash the separatist moves of the anti-reunification 
forces and make a breakthrough for reunification with their own 
efforts. 
  Especially, the people in the South must demand an immediate 
end to the anti-North nuclear racket and "international 
cooperation system" of the United States and its followers which 
may lead to a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula. 
  When the entire nation courageously rises up in struggle to 
implement the ten-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation under the leadership of general Kim Chong-il, 
closely rallied around President Kim Il-song, the lodestar of 
national reunification, a new phase for national reunification 
will be opened up. 
  The entire members of Hanminjon, together with the 70 
million 
compatriots in the South, North and overseas, will vigorously 
fight to valiantly smash the nuclear war provocations and 
separatist acts of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam 
group and promote peace and independent reunification of the 
country in hearty response to the ten-point programme of the 
great unity of the whole nation put forward by the great 
president.

<F P=106> ["Indictment Against Nuclear Warmaniacs"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
describes the white paper recently issued by the Central 
Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front 
(Hanminjon) on the nuclear arms development of the South Korean 
authorities as one more stern indictment against the nuclear 
warmaniacs. 
  The news analyst says: 
  According to the white paper, the South Korean puppets have 
long since promoted the development of nuclear weapons under the 
nuclear umbrella of the United States. 
  The heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose 
research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, are, to all intents and 
purposes, military facilities for nuclear arms development 
disguised as "commercial" and "research" reactors. 
  The heavy water reactor in Wolsong is not for "generating 
electricity." It was introduced for the production of plutonium. 
The reactor's structure is so designed as to change spent 
nuclear fuel any moment without stopping its operation. 
  The multipurpose research reactor in Taedok can be easily 
remodeled into a reactor producing plutonium any moment. 
Moreover, it is closely attached to a semi-reprocessing 
facility. 
  It must not go unnoticed that nuclear arms development is 
being promoted in secrecy at South Korea's atomic reactors and 
research reactors which are claimed to be undergoing routine 
inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  It is only too natural that Hanminjon raised a question why 
the IAEA, while taking issue with the pilot reactor of the 
North, had not published the results of its inspection of South 
Korea's heavy water reactor and multi-purpose research reactor 
used for military purposes, whose capacities are scores of times 
and several times greater than the North's. 
  The South Korean people are now fighting against war and 
nuclear weapons and resolutely rejecting the Kim Yong-sam 
bellicose group's development of nuclear weapons. They will mete 
out a punishment to the Kim Yong-sam group.

<F P=106> ["Japan's Intelligence Gathering on Korea Denounced" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Japan is intensifying 
intelligence gathering while strengthening military tieup with 
the United States and the South Korean puppets against the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  Commenting on this, MINJU CHOSON today says the Korean 
people 
cannot remain an onlooker to this but are keeping tabs on 
Japan's moves. 
  The analyst says: 
  The Japan defence agency has set it as a primary task to 
"increase the capacity of intelligence gathering.",it is putting 
fresh muscles into the system of gathering information on the 
Korean peninsula and training in secrecy information-gathering 
experts with the help of the U.S. CIA. 
  Though the Cold War has ended Japan is now showing extra 
zeal 
in gathering information about the DPRK and other countries by 
using even satellite photographs provided by the United States. 
This is a tell-tale sign of its preparations for overseas 
aggression. 
  The top political and military quarters of Japan are 
attempting to overpower the DPRK with strength in league with 
the United States and the South Korean puppets. This is an 
anachronistic and foolish design. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must clearly know that their 
scheme to fulfil their design of overseas aggression, 
intensifying information gathering against the DPRK, will lead 
them to destruction.

  [Text] A decision of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly 
[SPA] on the successful fulfillment of the task of socialist 
economic construction in the period of adjustment set forth by 
the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] was adopted at the session 
with the unanimous approval of the deputies. The decision of 
the DPRK SPA adopted at the session is as follows. 
  The decision of the DPRK SPA on the successful fulfillment 
of 
the tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of 
adjustment: 
  The 21st plenary session of the Sixth WPK Central Committee 
has set 1994 through 1996 as a period of adjustment for the 
socialist economic construction and has put forward a strategic 
task to be fulfilled during that period. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In the 
socialist economic construction, we should set the upcoming 
three years as a period of adjustment as decided by the 21st 
plenary session of the Sixth Party Central Committee and 
thoroughly implement the agriculture-first policy, light 
industry-first policy, and trade-first policy during that 
period. Along with this, we should firmly give priority to the 
coal industry, power industry, and railway transport--which are 
the leading sectors of the national economy--and should continue 
to develop the metal industry. 
  The task of socialist economic construction in the period of 
adjustment is to thoroughly implement the agriculture-first 
policy, light industry-first policy, and trade-first policy; to 
firmly give priority to the coal industry, the power industry, 
and railway transport; and to continue developing the metal 
industry. 
  The WPK's presentation of the task of socialist economic 
construction in the period of adjustment is a wise step, 
enabling our socialist construction to be further deepened and 
developed at a new higher level, while consolidating the success 
gained during implementation of the Third Seven-Year Plan. 
  The WPK's revolutionary economic strategy is to totally 
comply with the basic interest of our revolution and 
construction, as well as to correctly reflect the aspirations 
and demands of our people. Also, the strategy is a just policy, 
which makes it possible to significantly raise our people's 
standard of living to extraordinarily strengthen our country's 
independence and the might of the socialist economy in 
conformity with the demands of socialism. 
  Only when the revolutionary economic strategy is embodied, 
will the long-cherished desire of our people to eat rice and 
meat soup, wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house be 
brilliantly achieved within the near future. At the same time, 
the country's self-reliant economic foundation will be 
consolidated as firm as a rock and a firm prospect to occupy a 
higher hill of socialism will be opened. 
  The DPRK SPA will decide as follows to successfully fulfill 
the tasks of the socialist economic construction in the period 
of adjustment put forward by the WPK. 
  1. The DPRK SPA will thoroughly implement the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first policy. 
Thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first policy, light 
industry-first policy, and trade-first policy is a basic 
guarantee for significantly raising the people's standard of 
living in the demands of socialism. It will effect the 
industrialization and modernization of agriculture at a higher 
level by thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first policy. 
Also, it will satisfactorily solve the issue concerning the 
people's food [inmindului mongnunmunjelul wonmanhui haegyol 
halgosida] by more greatly increasing all agricultural products, 
including grain production. 
  It will greatly develop the country's irrigation system by 
repairing and reinforcing irrigation facilities and by more 
effectively adopting the irrigation method [kwansu pangbop], 
while consolidating the success made in irrigation and 
electrification [surihwawa chongihwaui songgwa]. It will 
satisfactorily meet the demands of electricity by repairing and 
newly establishing power supply facilities and by improving the 
power supply system. 
  It will raise the utilization rate of the existing 
agricultural tools in the rural communities to the maximum and 
newly produce and supply various agricultural tools, including 
more than 30,000 tractors and 10,000 cargo trucks. Also, it 
will produce various kinds of chemical fertilizer and 
agricultural chemicals. As a result, it will raise the 
comprehensive mechanization and chemicalization in the national 
economy to a higher level. 
  Crops of rice and corn per chongbo [one chongbo equals 
2.45 acres] will be further increased by thoroughly implementing 
the demands of rural technological revolution and chuche-based 
farming method so that the grain production target of 15 million 
tonnes may be achieved in the coming years. 
  All domains of rural economy, including livestock, fruit 
cultivation, and sericultural sectors will be developed so that 
demands for meat, fruit, and vegetable and raw agricultural 
products demanded by industries can be satisfactorily guaranteed. 
  Innovations in the production of people's consumer goods 
will 
be accelerated through the development of light industry. 
  Textile factories will be repaired, reinforced, and 
modernized so that fabric production can be increased by over 20 
percent during the period of adjustment. Knitting and 
clothes-processing industries will be developed so that various 
kinds of clothes suitable for our people's figure and socialist 
lifestyle can be produced in large volumes. 
  The shoe industry will be modernized and production capacity 
will be utilized reasonably to increase shoe production by over 
10 percent during the period of adjustment, thus, people's 
diverse demand for shoes will be satisfactorily guaranteed. 
  The food industry will be developed and production of 
popular 
foods will be increased to enrich and diversify people's dietary 
life. The volume and kinds of daily necessities will be 
increased and their quality will be further improved. 
  Local industry will be developed by modernizing local 
industry plants and reinforcing local resource bases. 
Production of various quality daily necessities and food will 
be significantly increased by reinforcing the production of 3 
August people's consumer goods in all domains of people's 
economy including plants, enterprises, and cottage industry 
cooperatives and units. 
  Various areas of the people's economy will sufficiently 
produce and guarantee various raw materials for light industry, 
including chemical textiles and plastic. 
  A new turn will be made in foreign trade in conformity with 
the changing circumstance. All areas of people's economy will 
actively mobilize export resources, reinforce export bases, 
actively increase production, and improve the quality of export 
items of large foreign demand, including steel material, 
nonferrous metal, machinery equipment, batteries, magnesia 
clinkers, cement, processed stone, silk products, and 
traditional Koryo medicine. 
  Overseas markets will be actively developed, credit will be 
earned, and external trading transactions will be expanded and 
developed in various forms and methods, including processing 
trade, reselling trade [toegori muyok], commission trade, joint 
venture and management, economic and technological 
collaboration, and overseas construction. 
  Investment conditions for foreign companies will be 
satisfactorily guaranteed and investment inducement activities 
will be promoted by strengthening management in the Najin and 
Sonbong free economic trade zones. 
  2. Coal and electricity industries, and railway 
transportation, which are the leading sectors of the people's 
economy, will be assured that they are given priority, and the 
development of metal industry will be continued. 
  Continuously developing the metal industry and assuring that 
priority is given to the leading sectors of the people's economy 
are important demands for expanding and developing agriculture, 
light industry, and foreign trade, and for strengthening the 
self-reliance and independence of economy. 
  Coal production will be increased by 30 percent during the 
period of adjustment with the strengthening of the coal industry 
by giving precedence in tunneling and removal of soil and rocks, 
modernizing mining and transportation equipment, accelerating 
construction of new mines and new pits, carrying out 
construction work ahead of schedule, and giving priority to 
providing materials and equipment. 
  Investment in the crude oil industry will be increased so 
that more oil fields can be discovered by using reinforced 
exploring facilities and equipment, and by focusing efforts on 
exploring potential areas. 
  In the electricity industry, electricity production will 
be increased by 30 percent during the period of adjustment by 
repairing and reinforcing power plants, improving technological 
management, and accelerating power plant construction. 
Thermoelectric power plants will be in full operation through 
sufficiently supplied coal, hydroelectric power plants will 
increase the efficiency of water pressure, and factory 
thermoelectric power plants and small-to-medium hydroelectric 
power plants will normalize electricity production. 
  The construction of large-scale power plants will be 
actively 
accelerated so that they can begin operation ahead of schedule. 
An increased number of power plants using waste heat, 
small-to-medium hydroelectric power plants, and wind-power 
generating stations will be built, and nuclear power plants will 
be built on a large scale. 
  Daily railway cargo transportation will be increased by over 
30 percent by strengthening the material and technological basis 
of railway transportation and organizing transportation 
organizations and command. Main lines will focus on railways, 
more trains and engines will be manufactured, and transportation 
organizations and command will be modernized and will be more 
scientific. 
  In the metal industry, priority will be guaranteed for iron 
ore production by reinforcing the tunneling and mining capacity 
of metal mines, including the Musan mining complex. The 
production of steel materials will be further increased by 
repairing and reinforcing the production procedure of iron and 
steel stations with modern technology. 
  3. Economic organizational works will continue to be 
properly 
carried out and economic management will be carried out well. 
Properly carrying out economic organizational works and economic 
management is a prerequisite for successfully implementing the 
tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of 
adjustment by highly displaying the revolutionary enthusiasm and 
active creativity of the masses. 
  In conformity with the demands of the party's revolutionary 
economic strategy, the State Administration Council will improve 
economic operations and organizational works, and further grip, 
guide, and control all sectors and units of economic society. 
  On the basis of the firm guarantee of the state's unified 
guidance on economic works, the creativity of committees, 
ministries, and provincial, municipal, and county plants and 
enterprises will be highly displayed. Particularly, provinces, 
cities, and counties will do their utmost to produce and 
guarantee people's consumer goods on their own by mobilizing 
local resources and reserves to the maximum. 
  The people's economic plan will be practically drawn up 
under 
the principle of making everything obedient to implementing 
revolutionary economic strategy. All areas and units will 
implement without fail the daily, monthly, quarterly, and 
indexical national plan. 
  Material and equipment will be provided to agriculture, 
light 
industry, and export production with priority by properly 
carrying out material supply works. The all-people support 
movement to these sectors will be vigorously carried out. 
  Along with this, the material and equipment for the leading 
sectors of the people's economy and metal industry will be 
thoroughly guaranteed. 
  In conformity with the demands of the Taean work system, the 
management of labor, equipment, and material will be improved, 
economic assets will be properly maintained, the economic 
efficiency of production and management activities will be 
maximized, economic leverages such as cost, price, profit will 
be properly utilized, the independent accounting system will be 
correctly implemented, and control by won [Korean currency] will 
be intensified. 
  By vigorously carrying out the movement for production 
increase and conservation as an all-mass movement, we should 
discover all reserves for production increase and should 
actively save raw materials and materials including electricity, 
coal, and fuel, thus thoroughly eliminating various phenomena of 
wastefulness. 
  We will see to it that valuable scientific and technological 
inventions, technical innovation plans, creative designs, and 
rationalization plans be worked out by inspiring the patriotic 
passion and abilities of the producing masses, scientists, and 
technicians so that they are effectively used in production. 
  4. We will further strengthen the single-hearted unity of 
the revolutionary ranks and will highly display the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. 
  It is a decisive guarantee for successfully implementing the 
tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic 
construction that all the people highly demonstrate the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle in 
firm unity with the party and the leader. 
  We will see to it that all functionaries and workers firmly 
arm themselves with the chuche revolutionary outlook and 
vigorously display the might of single-hearted unity of our 
revolutionary ranks in implementing tasks of the period of 
adjustment in firm unity with the party and the leader. 
  All domains and all units of the national economy, upholding 
the militant slogan, "Let us vigorously accelerate the socialist 
general march with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
arduous struggle!" will effect a new upsurge in socialist 
economic construction by discovering what is in shortage and by 
producing what is not available and by assuming the attitude and 
position worthy of masters to carry out works with their own 
strength even without help from the upper echelon, although such 
help is better than none. 
  All economic guidance functionaries and workers will break 
through difficulties laid before them by their own strength with 
such spirit as one with which our working class and people 
produced hand-grenades with empty hands during the arduous days 
of war; restored the economy on the empty land after the war, 
and effected the great Chollima upsurge. They will successfully 
carry to accomplishment the tasks of the period of adjustment of 
socialist economic construction by continually innovating and 
advancing with the spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to 
Chollima. 
  5. We will further enhance the responsibility and role of 
guiding functionaries of the state economic organizations. 
  Successful implementation of tasks of the period of 
adjustment of socialist economic construction depends on the 
sense of responsibility and role of the state economic guiding 
functionaries, who are the commanding staff of the revolution. 
  The state economic guiding functionaries should cherish 
thoroughgoing faith and determination to entrust their destinies 
to our party and to die at the post of duty while defending 
their revolutionary outposts, and should become the 
standard-bearers and vanguards in upholding the party and the 
leader. 
  Through practical struggle to successfully implement the 
tasks of the period of adjustment of socialist economic 
construction, the guiding functionaries will highly display the 
sense of loyalty to the party and the leader. 
  With a sense of confidence and optimism that they will win 
victory without fail on the road of upholding the leadership of 
the great leader and great party, the guiding functionaries will 
always think creatively, will boldly and revolutionarily carry 
out works, will stand at the van of difficult tasks, and will 
fulfill their responsibility and role assigned by the party and 
the leader by fully demonstrating all of their wisdom and 
passion. 
  The guiding functionaries will deeply mingle with the 
producer masses according to the demand of the revolutionary 
slogan, "We serve the people!" and should share joy and sorrow 
with them. Thus, they will skillfully organize and mobilize the 
masses to the implementation of the tasks of the period of 
adjustment. 
  6. The establishment of concrete execution measures for 
these decisions will be entrusted to the DPRK Administration 
Council.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The ordinance "on the 
endorsement of `the law on the preservation of cultural relics 
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea'" was adopted at

<F P=106> ["Let Us Pave the Way to Peace and Reunification With Great </F>
Unity of Whole Nation"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Papers here today 
dedicate editorials to the first anniversary of the publication 
of the work of the great leader President Kim Il-song "10-Point 
Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the 
Reunification of the Country" (April 6, 1993.) 
  The ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole 
nation put forward by the great leader is a patriotic one which 
embodies the noble desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen to 
achieve the reunification and prosperity of the Korean nation 
with a 5,000 year-long history through the firm unity of the 
whole nation, transcending the differences in ideology, idea and 
social system; it is a great banner of national reunification 
which indicates a short-cut to tide over the difficulties in 
the way of reunification by the strength of the internal force 
of the nation and achieve the independent, peaceful 
reunification of the country, NODONG SINMUN says, and goes on: 
  An unprecedented danger of war is being created in the 
Korean 
peninsula by the adventurous anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of 
the United States and the South Korean puppets, its followers. 
  The United States reversed the agreed conclusion reached at 
the contact with the DPRK in New York, led the third-round of 
the DPRK-USA talks to a rupture, and brought the "nuclear issue" 
to the UN Security Council to produce a "presidential statement" 
and is now resorting to the military adventure to stifle the 
DPRK, more undisguised in a row of international pressure on the 
DPRK. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, dancing to the tune of war 
against the North turned by the United States, its master, is 
fanning up war fever, clamouring for "tough countermove" and 
"strong retaliatory punishment" against the DPRK. 
  The prevailing situation is making it more incumbent upon 
the 
Korean nation to unite in one mind to defend peace and security 
of the country at the risk of their lives, irrespective of 
residence, ideology and idea. 
  All the fellow countrymen in the North, the South and 
overseas should turn out as one in the patriotic struggle to 
achieve peace and reunification of the country with the great 
unity of the whole nation transcending the differences in 
ideology, idea and social system, bearing deep in mind the high 
aim and noble patriotic idea of the great leader President Kim 
Il-song reflected in the ten-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation. 
  The principle of national independence should be maintained 
in order to implement the programme and achieve peace and 
reunification of the country. 
  The South Korean people should never pardon the Kim Yong-sam 
group which is hindering the great unity of the nation, trying 
to outlive in reward for selling off the dignity and interests 
of the nation to the outside forces, without independence. 
  The editorial calls upon the whole nation to hold in high 
esteem the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the centre of unity and 
leadership and achieve the great unity and thus open a new 
epochal phase in removing the danger of a nuclear war, 
preserving peace and hastening reunification in the 90s.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- "Kim Il-song's Works" 
Vol. 40 was recently published by the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK] Publishing House. 
  This volume contains 27 classical works, including highly 
important speeches, conclusions and talks of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song from May 1986 to December 1987. 
  The immortal classical work "Historical Experience of 
Building the Workers' Party of Korea" indicates the character 
and mission of the Workers' Party of Korea as a new-type party 
of the working class, a revolutionary party of chuche type, and 
the basic principles of party building. 
  It also expounds the question of fully guaranteeing the 
guidance of the party over the revolution and construction. 
  The work "For the Complete Victory of Socialism" explains 
the 
reason why the complete victory of socialism is the lawful 
requirement of the socialist and communist construction, and the 
characteristics and features of a completely victorious 
socialist society. 
  It clarifies the question of building a classless society by 
transforming man and social relations on the pattern of the 
working class, the basic question in achieving the complete 
victory of socialism, and the questions of laying solid 
socialist material and technical foundations by accelerating the 
economic construction and of strengthening the people's power 
and enhancing its function and role. 
  President Kim Il-song in his works "Let Us Accelerate the 
Socialist Economic Construction by Highly Displaying the 
Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Reliance", "On Thoroughly Carrying 
Out the Tasks of the Technical Revolution Set Forth in the 
Socialist Rural Theses" and other works indicated the tasks and 
ways of further consolidating the foundations of the socialist 
independent national economy by bringing about new constant 
upsurge in production and construction in the revolutionary 
spirit of self-reliance. 
  Besides, the volume contains the ideas, theories and 
policies 
of briskly accelerating national reunification and the cause of 
making the whole world independent and clear answers to the 
question of further expanding and developing the overseas 
Koreans movements of the General Association of Korean Residents 
in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan, and to other 
theoretical and practical questions arising in various fields of 
the revolution and construction.

<F P=106> ["National Meeting Commemorates First Anniversary of Comrade </F>
Kim Chong-il's Election as Chairman of DPRK National Defence 
Commission " -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was 
held at the February 8 house of culture today to celebrate the 
first anniversary of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
election as chairman of the National Defence Commission of the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The meeting was attended by Marshal O Chin-u, member of the 
Presidium of the Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central 
Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], first 
vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and 
minister of People's Armed Forces; Premier Kang Song-san and 
Vice-presidents Yi Chong-ok and Pak Song-chol who are Politburo 
members of the WPK Central Committee; other senior party and 
state officials and working people in the city. 
  Overseas Koreans staying in the socialist homeland were also 
present. 
  Vice Marshal Choe Kwang, Politburo member of the C.C., the 
WPK, vice-chairman of the National Defence Commission of the 
DPRK and chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's Army, 
made a report at the meeting. 
  The reporter said the election of supreme commander of the 
Korean People's Army Comrade Kim Chong-il as chairman of the 
National Defence Commission of the DPRK at the Fifth Session of 
the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly in April last year was the 
realisation of the unanimous desire of the Korean people and 
People's Army officers and men to have their leader at the head 
of the defence forces and follow him, and another historic 
landmark in firmly defending the security of the people and the 
revolutionary cause and victoriously advancing the Korean 
revolution. 
  The reporter quoted the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song as 
saying: 
  "Comrade Kim Chong-il has an indomitable will and grit and 
outstanding intelligence and commanding art as befits the 
supreme commander of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This 
guarantees the constant strengthening and development of our 
revolutionary Armed Forces and their ever-victorious advance." 
  The reporter continued: 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il, our supreme commander, formulated the 
military doctrine of the great leader as an integral one with 
chuche military idea, theory and tactics as its keynote and has 
comprehensively developed it in depth, thus brilliantly solving 
the urgent questions raised by military practice in the present 
times. 
  With an outstanding and tested commanding art, he has wisely 
led the whole party, the entire people and the whole Army to 
implement our party's line of self-reliant defence so that the 
defence capabilities of the nation have been consolidated 
rock-firm in all spheres. 
  Today our People's Army has grown in strength and developed 
into invincible revolutionary Armed Forces with all services and 
arms, powerful means of strike and defence and unique tactics of 
chuche, which are sufficient for any modern warfare. 
  The ever-victorious might of the People's Army lies in that 
the whole Army has one loyal heart to defend the party and the 
leader with death, closely united with one idea and one purpose, 
and are firmly prepared militarily and technically to defeat any 
formidable enemy. 
  Today our worker-peasant red guards, young red guards and 
other civilian Armed Forces are all firmly built up and the 
whole country has literally turned into an impregnable fortress. 
And, with a powerful self-reliant defence industry, we have 
become able to further modernize the defence power of the 
country with our own efforts, if we decide to. 
  And the traditional beautiful traits of unity between the 
Army and the people are in full bloom on a new, higher level and 
the unity of the Army and the people in ideology and purpose has 
become closer. 
  It is a brilliant fruition of the outstanding and tested 
leadership of our supreme commander that we have built the self- 
reliant defence power which no enemy dare provoke, even under 
the particularly difficult condition in which we are building 
socialism in the constant danger of the U.S. imperialsts' 
aggression and war. 
  The tense situation in which a war may break out at any time 
has been created in our country owing to the vicious 
anti-socialist, anti-DPRK campaigns of the imperialists and 
other international reactionary forces. 
  No machinations of the enemy can frighten our people and 
People's Army that are under the outstanding leadership of a 
great brilliant commander. 
  The reporter stressed: 
  If the enemy dare ignite a war, our people and People's Army 
unshakably determined to share the destiny with the party will 
meet them courageously and wipe out the enemy relentlessly. 
  It is our unshakable will and policy to answer strength with 
strength, and dialogue with dialogue. 
  The U.S. imperialists and their stooges must not 
misinterpret 
this unshakable will and policy and act with discretion, looking 
squarely at the trend of the times. 
  The reporter called upon the entire people and men and 
officers of the People's Army to fight more staunchly to hasten 
the day of national reunification, resolutely smashing the moves 
of the anti-reunification forces with the conviction that 
national reunification in the 90s is certain as they are led by 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.

<F P=106> [Report by Choe Kwang, member of the Workers' Party of Korea </F>
Central Committee Political Bureau and chief of Staff of the 
Korean People's Army, to the central report meeting marking the 
first anniversary of the appointment of Kim Chong-il as chairman 
of the DPRK National Defense Committee held at the 8 February 
cultural hall in Pyongyang -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] A tense situation in which a 
war may break out anytime prevails in our country at present 
because of the vicious antisocialist, anti-Republic maneuvers by 
the U.S. imperialists and other international reactionary forces. 
  The U.S. imperialists, who had broken up [patan] the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks, had the UN Security Council release 
the president's statement, which makes unjustifiable 
[tangchiannun] demands on us, and are more openly maneuvering to 
crush [apsal] us. 
  Moreover, the U.S. imperialists are more frantically kicking 
up commotions for military pressure, while saying that they 
would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that 
they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war. 
  In step with them, the puppet South Korean clique intends to 
stage the nuclear war exercise against us at all cost and 
babbles that it would offer punitive retaliation [ungjing pobok] 
against us and use this as an opportunity to achieve 
reunification if it is necessary. 
  The South Korean puppets put all the puppet armed forces on 
special alert and even made public a dangerous new plan to 
invade the North. 
  Teaming up with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets, the Japanese reactionaries, as well, got more deeply 
involved in the maneuvers to ignite a fuse to a new war on the 
South Korean peninsula. [sentence as heard] 
  All facts show that the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists 
and other reactionaries to isolate and crush [apsal] our 
republic have reached their extreme and that, as a result, a war 
may break out on the Korean peninsula anytime. 
  However, any maneuver by the enemy cannot frighten our 
people 
and the People's Army, under the outstanding leadership of the 
great commander [yongjang]. 
  If the bastards ignite a fuse to a war after all, our people 
and the People's Army, filled with a firm resolve to share the 
same destiny with the party, will resolutely tackle them head on 
and mercilessly sweep out [mujabihage ssuroborilgut] the enemy. 
[applause] 
  Responding to the use of force with force and dialogue with 
dialogue is our firm will and policy [himenun himuro taehwaenun 
taehwaro tappyonhanun kossi uriui hwakko pudonghan uijiimyo 
chongchaegimnida]. 
  The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys must not 
miscalculate 
[osan] our firm will and policy and act with discretion after 
clearly seeing the trend of the times. 
  All the people and People's Army officers and men must 
vigorously wage the struggle to reliably defend the socialist 
fatherland and the revolutionary gains from the enemy's 
infringement [chimhae], build the country's defensive forces 
impregnable, and strengthen the People's Army into an invincible 
revolutionary army. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade 
Kim Chong-il, in his historical work "On Some Questions in 
Understanding the Chuche Philosophy" published on April 2, 1974, 
gave a comprehensive exposition of the basic characteristics of 
the chuche philosophy, the chuche-based viewpoint of man, the 
chuche-based outlook on the world, a scientific understanding of 
independence and other theoretical and practical questions 
arising in the development of the chuche philosophy. 
  In a by-lined article dedicated to the 20th anniversary of 
the publication of the work, NODONG SINMUN today says it is a 
monumental work that newly formulates all the fundamentals of 
the chuche philosophy and systematizes them in an integral whole 
and an immortal famous work greatly conducive to the development 
of the philosophical idea of the working class. 
  It says: 
  The dear leader expounds that the chuche philosophy is an 
anthropocentric philosophy which is elaborated and systematized, 
focussing on man. This is a scientific formulation of the basic 
characteristics and originality of the chuche philosophy. 
  The chuche philosophy is fundamentally different from the 
human philosophy. It does not explain the human question only 
but raises such fundamental questions as the relationship 
between the world and man and the position and role of man in 
the world and elucidates the man-centred outlook on the world. 
  The work is a precious ideological and theoretical treasure 
which newly raises and explains the human question and a great 
textbook of the chuche idea which gives a new correct outlook of 
the chuche philosophy on the world. 
  The dear leader defined man as a social being with 
independence, creativity and consciousness, thus making it clear 
that the chuche philosophy and the bourgeois human philosophy 
are diametrically opposed to each other in their view of man. 
  By elucidating the view of the world that nature and society 
are dominated and transformed by man, the chuche philosophy 
brilliantly fulfilled the philosophical task of our time in 
which the popular masses are masters of their own destiny and 
history. 
  It is a noteworthy event in the history of human philosophy 
that the dear leader gave a scientific exposition of the 
formation and development of man's independence and its 
characteristics. 
  The chuche philosophy explains that independence is not a 
product of evolution but a social product. As a result, it has 
been made clear that man is not a simple biological being that 
represents on the highest level such natural attribute as desire 
for existence which other living matter in general has, but the 
most developed social being that represents such social 
attribute as independence which other living matter cannot have.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting 
marking the 20th anniversary of the publication of "On Further 
Developing Health Care for the People", a work of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, on April 9, 1974 was held here 
Thursday. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work expounded 
on 
a scientific basis upon the essence, character and main duty of 
socialist medicine which meets the demand of the chuche idea, 
stressing that hygienic propaganda, hygienic culture and 
hygienic and preventive work must be energetically conducted for 
the implementation of the party's policy of prophylactic 
medicine. 
  Saying medical service for the people is not a mere 
technical 
work but an important political work, he elucidated detailed 
questions arising in the development of health care such as 
waging a vigorous movement for kind service, widely introducing 
Koryo therapy, consolidating the material and technical 
foundations of hopitals and improving health care by upgrading 
the level of specialization. 
  Vice-Premier of the Administration Council Chang Chol 
delivered a report at the meeting. 
  He said the work of the dear leader serves as a highly 
important guideline for developing health service in conformity 
with the demand of the developing revolution when the modelling 
of the whole society on the chuche idea has surfaced to the fore 
and thus defending and exalting the health care system of 
anthropocentric Korean-style socialism and is an immortal 
classic work that gives flawless answers to all theoretical and 
practical questions arising in the ultimate solution of the 
health care problem. 
  Reviewing the achievements registered in health service over 
the past 20 years since the publication of the work, he stated 
the people's right to medical treatment is ensured on a high 
level as the people enjoy ever greater benefits of the 
communistic health care policy of the Workers' Party of Korea 
[WPK]. 
  The meeting was attended by secretary of the WPK Central 
Committee Kim Chung-nin, officials concerned and health workers.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Koryo insam (ginseng) 
of Kaesong, a speciality of Korea, enjoys a world-wide fame as a 
medicinal plant. 
  For the distinctive qualities of the local soil and water, 
the meteorological features and unique cultivating and 
processing methods, Koryo insam of Kaesong has exceptional 
medical values. 
  The root of insam, the main part of medical use, usually 
resembles the human shape. 
  According to the method of processing, Koryo insam of 
Kaesong 
is classified into three kinds: hongsam (red ginseng) paeksam 
(white ginseng) and thangsam (sugared ginseng), which are of 
high medical effect. 
  Insam contains some ten kinds of glucoside helpful for 
health 
and longevity. It also contains essential oil, amino acid and 
other organic acids, vitamins, a proper amount of radium and 
microelements. 
  Insam protects the five viscera, has a good effect on the 
brain, the heart and blood vessels, stimulates the glands of 
internal secretion and promotes metabolism. It serves as a 
cure-all medicine and so is used as the main ingredient of 
traditional Koryo medicines. 
  Insam has an invigorating and fatigue-relieving effect and 
increases mental and physical labor capacity and is especially 
effective in promoting health and longevity. 
  Koryo insam of Kaesong has been proved of late to be 
effective against radiation and cancer for its inherent 
ingredients and pharmacological function. This has broadened 
the scope of its application. 
  Insam contains 0.05 per cent of aromatic matter, which gives 
it special spice. 
  The state makes several hundred kinds of tonics from Koryo 
insam of Kaesong such as insam sugar, insam extract, insam 
injection and insam nutritive to promote the health of the 
working people. 
  Insam products are popular on foreign markets.

<F P=106> ["`When the Party Is Determined, We Can Do Anything'" -- </F>
KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The slogan "When the 
Party Is Determined, We Can Do Anything!" is seen anywhere in 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. 
  The slogan reflects the revolutionary will and stamina of 
the 
people who are determined to share the destiny with the Workers' 
Party of Korea (WPK) forever. 
  The Korean people have moved mountains and harnessed the sea 
to carry out the party's decisions, displaying a revolutionary 
spirit in the historical course of socialist construction. 
  Suffice it to take a glance at economic construction. 
  When the WPK initiated the construction of the West Sea 
barrage which is of great importance for socialist economic 
construction, the Korean people and People's Army soldiers 
accepted the initiative as their own and turned out in its 
construction. 
  It was a vast and difficult project which would have taken 
dozens of years with the established method. The project 
included the building of dam eight kilometres long across the 
sea scores of metres deep, three locks which can let ships of 
2,000 to 50,000 ton class pass simultaneously, tens of sluice 
gates, railways and motorways on the dam. 
  The soldiers and civilian builders moved ten odd mountains, 
disposed of 15 million cubic metres of earth, tamped two million 
cubic metres of concrete and collected and transported 16 
million cubic metres of stones and gravels to build the dam of 
eternal value in five years with their own design, technology, 
materials and strength. With the construction of the barrage, 
the coastline diminished 20 kilometres and nine islands 
including Ok and Horang islands disappeared. 
  The West Sea barrage is a precious product of the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work of the 
Korean people who unconditionally accept and carry out the 
decisions of the party. 
  When the party intended to make a 10,000-ton press, workers 
of Korea did it without hesitation. The workers of the 
Ryongsong combined general bureau of machinery wrought a miracle 
by completing the processing and assembling of the 10,000-ton 
press and successfully test-operating it in one year or more, 
though it would have taken 4-5 years according to the experience. 
  When the party decided to launch a "200-day campaign" to 
glorify the 40th anniversary of the DPRK founding as a grand 
festival of victors, "200-day campaign youth death-defying corps 
of loyalty" were organised at more than 3,000 units across the 
country in the first ten days of the campaign. The entire 
people rose up as one and achieved great successes in all 
sectors of the national economy, giving full play to the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work. 
  Dressing plant No. 3 of Komdok with a capacity of 10 million 
tons built in one year on top of a mountain 1,200 metres above 
sea level, the Sangwon cement complex with a capacity of 
millions of tons, the Pyongbuk smeltery, a powerful non-ferrous 
metal producer, and many other edifices of eternal value are all 
associated with the feats of the Korean people and People's Army 
soldiers who accept the party's decisions as their revolutionary 
will.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- A national memorial 
service took place here Tuesday on the tenth anniversary of the 
death of O Paek-yong, a communist revolutionary fighter who was 
intensely loyal to the great leader President Kim Il-song, (on 
April 6, 1984). 
  O Paek-yong was a steadfast communist revolutionary fighter 
who fought all his life for the freedom and independence of the 
country and the accomplishment of the cause of socialism and 
communism and a courageous and talented military commanding 
officer who performed great feats in the revolutionary wars 
against U.S. and Japanese imperialism. 
  Choe Kwang, Politburo member of the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea and chief of the general staff of the 
Korean People's Army, in his memorial address referred to the 
brilliant life of O Paek-yong and precious feats he performed in 
struggle. O was born into a poor peasant's family in Hoeryong 
county, North Hamgyong Province, on October 24, 1914, he joined 
in the revolutionary struggle in the 1930 and firmly defended 
the great leader politically and ideologically and with his life 
as an ordinary soldier, then a platoon leader, a company 
commander and a regimental commander in the whole period of the 
anti-Japanese armed struggle. 
  After the liberation of the country he worked hard to 
strengthen the People's Armed Forces and defend the gains of 
revolution from the aggression of the enemies, upholding 
President Kim Il-song's line of Army building and, during the 
fatherland liberation war, made a great contribution to 
repelling the invasion of the U.S. imperialists and defending 
the independence of the country as a divisional commander of the 
Korean People's Army. 
  Later, holding important posts of the Ministry of Interior, 
the Ministry of National Defence, the Central Committee of the 
Workers' Party of Korea, the Central People's Committee and the 
National Defence Commission, he performed big feats in defending 
the headquarters of the Korean revolution and implementing the 
party's military line of self-reliant defense. 
  In the memorial address Choe Kwang said the life of O 
Paek-yong was a brilliant life of a communist revolutionary who 
dedicated his all to the party and the leader, the country and 
the people and the accomplishment of the cause of socialism and 
communism, and the intense loyalty to the party and the leader, 
a high degree of revolutionary spirit and devoted services for 
and modesty toward the people which ran through his whole life 
serve as a valuable example for all the party members and 
working people. 
  Attending the memorial service were O Chin-u, member of 
presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee 
and minister of People's Armed Forces, Yi Chong-ok and Pak 
Song-chol, Politburo members of the WPK Central Committee and 
vice-president, Kim Pyong-sik, chairman of the C.C. [Central 
Committee], the Korean Social Democratic Party and 
vice-president, and other senior party and government officials 
and anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters. 
  Papers here today dedicate articles to the occasion.

<F P=106> [By Sheri Prasso] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 8 (AFP) -- Australia's foreign 
minister arrived here Friday expressing support for the 
Cambodian government's sovereignty, as Cambodian Foreign 
Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut hinted at UN Security Council 
(UNSC)action against Thailand for its alleged support of the 
Khmer Rouge. 
  Cambodia has accused Thailand on a number of occasions of 
continuing to support the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in their war 
against the elected Phnom Penh government. The Thai government 
denies it, but acknowledges its (?military) has business links 
with the guerrillas across the border in Cambodia. 
  "As for Thailand, my prime minister is not happy," Prince 
Sirivut said at the airport while awaiting the arrival of 
Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. 
  "If we must go to the Security Council, we will go," he 
said, 
without stating what kind of action, whether resolution or 
sanctions, against Thailand would be appropriate. 
  Asked if the Cambodians would ask Evans' support for such a 
move, Prince Sirivut said: "I ask everybody to support the 
Cambodian Royal Government and not the Khmer Rouge." 
  France already indicated support for action against Thailand 
during a visit last week by deputy premier Simone Veil. 
  Evans said he believed the Thai government was "absolutely 
sincere" about its resolve "not to give aid, comfort and 
support" to the Khmer Rouge, but that central control may not be 
total. 
  "I mean, there may be some individuals who continue to play 
some kind of a supporting role in the Thai business community 
and some areas of the Thai military," he said. "That's 
perfectly possible, because that's historically been the case, 
and it's not always easy to address these issues." 
  He said he discussed Cambodian border issues with Thailand's 
top officials during a recent visit to Bangkok, but that it was 
not for Australia to interfere. 
  "I think it's an issue that has to be resolved bilaterally 
between the two countries, and the sooner they get into a frank, 
comprehensive dialogue on the issue, with all the necessary 
mechanisms and strategies that go with that... the better," 
Evans said, expressing support for Cambodia's government elected 
by the UN peace plan that he was instrumental in putting forward 
in 1991. 
  Evans, due to leave Sunday, also announced a doubling of 
foreign aid to Cambodia over the next four years in line with 
pledges made at previous aid conferences in Tokyo. 
  Areas of concentration include building bridges, demining, 
human rights promotion, English-language training and health. 
Australia will also provide 2.5 million to three million 
Australian dollars for defense cooperation, part of which will 
go to Cambodia's demining coordination agency. 
  Evans was also scheduled to meet co-premier Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, acting head of state Chea Sim and deputy premier Sar 
Kheng. 
  He was also scheduled to open the Australian Centre for 
Education, which teaches English to Cambodians.

<F P=106> ["Communique by the Party of Democratic Kampuchea spokesman </F>
rejecting the base accusations made by Prince Ranariddh, first 
prime minister of the two-headed government, who fabricates 
stories and accuses the Thai military of providing assistance to 
Democratic Kampuchea" issued on 6 April; place not given -- read 
by announcer] 
  [Text] I. There have been reports that on 5 April, Prince 
Ranariddh, first prime minister of the two-headed government, 
said there is a photo of Democratic Kampuchean leaders leaving 
the Pailin battlefield in a car and entering Thai territory with 
an escort of Thai troops. 
  II. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] spokesman 
vehemently and most categorically rejects Prince Ranariddh's 
accusation, which has dirty and dark political goals. This 
concocted and dirty story certainly will not deceive anyone. 
  III. The Cambodian nation and people, like the international 
public in general, know and are well aware of the tricky way of 
the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets and 
lackeys. The communist Vietnamese aggressors and their puppets 
and lackeys have been using this dirty method incessantly since 
1978-79 to cover up the war by the communist Vietnamese 
aggressors and their great criminal and brutal activities in 
killing the Cambodian nation, people, and race. These are 
intended to transform Cambodia into a second Kampuchea Kraom 
[former Cambodian territory now part of Vietnam] according to 
the communist Vietnamese Indochinese Federation strategy. 
  Prince Ranariddh concocted all the above stories on the 
orders of his masters; namely, the alliance between communist 
Vietnam and the communist Vietnamese puppets. Their goals are 
the following: 
  1. The two-headed government, the communist Vietnamese, and 
their allies have taken turns making accusations concerning the 
situation on the Pailin battlefield. This is to cover up the 
fact that communist Vietnam has brought nearly 4 million 
Vietnamese settlers into Cambodia and annexed tens of thousands 
of square kilometers of Cambodian territory in eastern Cambodia. 
  2. To cover up their defeat on the Pailin battlefield; the 
two- headed government, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and 
their allies are beginning to smell utter defeat on the Pailin 
battlefield. The invading forces of the two-headed government 
are being attacked by the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
and the Cambodian people. Their transport lines around Pailin 
-- which are their lifelines -- are being cut and their troops 
are being attacked and trapped within Pailin's perimeter. Their 
soldiers are constantly being killed and wounded. They are 
running around like rats caught in traps. 
  IV. The Cambodian nation and people and the international 
public have clearly seen who is good and who is bad; who wants 
peace and national reconciliation and which warmongers are 
fueling the war. The communist Vietnamese oppose national 
reconciliation and the king's five-point national reconciliation 
plan. 
  It is clear that Democratic Kampuchea wants genuine peace 
and 
national reconciliation in line with the king's five-point plan. 
As for the two-headed government and the communist Vietnamese 
puppets, they constantly shout about war and about fighting 
against Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people. 
  National and international opinion inside and outside of the 
country predicts that the two-headed government will certainly 
be defeated on the Pailin battlefield, just like at Anlung Veng.

  [Text] 1. On 29 March 1994, after receiving news that King 
Norodom Sihanouk and the queen would return to the motherland on 
8 April, His Excellency [H.E.] Khieu Samphan, chairman of the 
Party of Democratic Kampuchea, sent a message to his majesty the 
king. Here is the essence: 
  I am very happy to learn that his majesty the king has been 
discharged from the hospital in good health and that the king 
and queen will return to meet with the children of our 
motherland on 8 April. 
  The entire Cambodian nation and people very much rejoice 
over 
this great event. I will be in Phnom Penh on 8 April to join 
our nation and people in welcoming the king on this joyous 
occasion. As the king has a tight schedule and his health is 
not yet fully back to normal, I do not dare ask to see the king 
and the queen at this time. Please allow me to meet with you 
and the queen on a day you deem appropriate. 
  2. On 1 April, the king and queen answered H.E. Khieu 
Samphan's message through the king's Secretariat in Phnom Penh. 
The king said he would be pleased to receive H.E. Khieu Samphan 
and a delegation at the Royal Palace at 1000 on 13 April. 
  3. On 2 April, after learning that the king and the queen 
had agreed to receive H.E. Khieu Samphan and a delegation on 13 
April, H.E. Khieu Samphan addressed another message to his 
majesty the king. Here is the essence: 
  Please allow me to express my most profound gratitude to the 
king and queen for agreeing to receive me and a delegation at 
the Royal Palace at 1000 on 13 April. As I informed the king in 
my message dated 29 March, my colleagues and I want to express 
our respect, fond sentiments, and warmest welcome directly upon 
the arrival of his majesty the king and the queen at Pochentong 
Airport. My presence could cause some protocol difficulties, 
however, as well as security problems. 
  For this reason, please allow me to send a delegation to 
Phnom Penh, with H.E. Chan Youran as my representative, to 
express directly my warmest welcome to the king and queen at 
Pochentong Airport and to contact the king's Secretariat to 
prepare for my 12 April trip to meet the king and queen at the 
Royal Palace on 13 April at 1000, as scheduled. 
  4. On 5 April, his majesty the king sent another message to 
H.E. Khieu Samphan through the king's Secretariat, informing 
H.E. Khieu Samphan that there are many problems concerning his 
planned trip to Phnom Penh. These problems result from the fact 
that the Cambodian state authorities -- whether the police or 
the force accompanying the visit -- do not have the goodwill to 
give any consideration to the arrival, escort, or return of H.E. 
Khieu Samphan. They also will not give any consideration 
whatsoever to H.E. Khieu Samphan's security in Phnom Penh. 
  On top of this, there is no guarantee -- even 60 percent -- 
of H.E. Khieu Samphan's security, or for that of the Democratic 
Kampuchean delegation as it is traveling from Pochentong to 
Phnom Penh, during its stay in Phnom Penh, or in the Royal 
Palace. 
  The king said: I cannot find any trusted person to accompany 
the Democratic Kampuchean delegation from Pochentong to Phnom 
Penh and back. With such a bad situation, it is better for you 
to meet me in Beijing in June.

  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] On the night of 6-7 April, the 
people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] 
cooperated to fight in self-defense in order to defend their 
villages, houses, cattle, crops, and land. They fought against 
the invading forces and the war materiel that has been brought 
in to prepare for successive offensives in the area between 
Routes 69 and 68 and the area east of Route 68. Here are the 
preliminary results: 
  I. Liberation and destruction of positions: 
  1. The Banteay Chhma position was completely liberated and 
destroyed. Two big warehouses containing weapons and ammunition 
have been burning for five hours already. All the villages 
around Banteay Chhma have been liberated. 
  2. The big garrison (?at Soeng) and the Kouk Mon township 
have been liberated and destroyed -- all the way from Beng and 
Kou to Rumchang townships -- along with all the positions in the 
surrounding communes and villages. Two big warehouses at 
(?Banteay Soeng) were burning throughout the night, until 0900 
on 7 April. 
  II. Liberation and [words indistinct] people: 
  1. Nearly 2,000 families -- a total of over 90,000 people -- 
have been liberated. 
  2. Eighty-nine villages have been liberated. 
  3. The people -- who have been the victims of the war of 
aggression by the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their 
puppets for three years, particularly victims of the two-headed 
government and UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] and 
of the burn- all-kill-all campaign of August 1993 -- have risen 
up and cooperated with the NADK. They have attacked the 
invading forces and enlisted as soldiers by the hundreds. The 
people are moving in throngs to meet the NADK. They have 
embraced the NADK with tears flowing to express their sentiment 
at meeting with them. It was as if they had been reborn. 
  III. Seizure of weapons: 
  1. According to preliminary reports, two T-54 tanks, a 37-mm 
antiaircraft gun, a 122-mm D-30 gun, a 100-mm gun, and a 120-mm 
gun were seized at (?Banteay Soeng); 
  2. A DK-82 gun, an 82-mm mortar, and a 12.7-mm gun were 
seized in Kouk Mon. 
  3. A DK-75, a DK-82, an 82-mm mortar, a 12.7-mm gun, a big 
central field radio, and so on were seized in Banteay Chhma. 
  4. A fully-stocked warehouse with assorted ammunition was 
seized, including AK's, AR-15's, B-40's, B-41's, grenades, 
12.7-mm ammunition, and so on. The people are taking this 
ammunition out of the warehouse. A BM multiple rocket battery 
was also seized. 
  IV. Nhoek Bunchhai's [government general] villa was 
attacked, destroyed, and reduced to ashes. The people say they 
fed him for over 10 years, but he became a U.S. mercenary 
following the July 1993 merger of the Para soldiers and the 
communist puppet troops. He has been biting and cutting the 
throats of countless people. The people are looking for Nhoek 
Bunchhai to try him for his great crimes. 
  V. Our forces control all strategic roads. The people and 
the NADK are in control of all strategic roads and are waiting 
to ambush the invading forces' reinforcements. 
  On the morning of 7 April, two tanks left Samraong 
accompanied by 40 soldiers. When they were east of Tonle Sar, 
we ambushed them and forced them to retreat. Leaders of the 
communist Vietnamese puppets such as Nhoek Bunchhai and other 
Para leaders are shouting in panic. They shout: The United 
States, France, Australia, and Japan have gathered dollars to 
buy over 1,000 tonnes of weapons and ammunition from communist 
Vietnam and Russia so Nhoek Bunchhai and Dien Del can continue 
fueling the war against the NADK. Now the people and the NADK 
have taken everything. A quantity of this ammunition has been 
reduced to ashes. 
  They talked to one another in panic over the field radio, 
saying that this attack by the people and the NADK has affected 
Divisions 3, 9, 7, 8, 11, and 12. 
  The people shouted these insults back: You are all 
mercenaries waging war to kill the people. You have sold 
yourselves to foreigners to kill Cambodians. Countless people 
-- the old, the young, men, and women -- have been killed by 
warmongers. Villages, cattle, paddy, and rice have all 
vanished. You do not even spare baby diapers. You have 
undressed and raped hundreds of our daughters like animals. 
Each of our daughters was gang-raped to death. You bayonetted 
and pumped bullets into the girls after raping them. You are 
evil! You are Cambodians; how can you kill Cambodian people 
like this? Your blood is so dark! How similar your blood is to 
that of the black-tooth communist Vietnamese and the blood of 
communist Vietnamese puppets Hun Sen, Chea Sim, Sin Song, Sin 
Sen, and Sar Kheng! 
  The anger of the people will become as strong as a prairie 
and bush fire; nothing can stop it.

  [Text] Heavy fighting between Phnom Penh forces and the 
Khmer Rouge at Khao Preah Vihear on the Thai-Cambodian border 
continued for a second day yesterday. 
  Cambodian government soldiers moved to seize the ancient 
landmark from the Khmer Rouge this week. 
  More than 400 government soldiers supported by artillery and 
mortars, began to storm Khao Preah Vihear on Wednesday [6 April] 
to capture a Khmer Rouge stronghold on top of the ancient 
remains but they failed to gain control since the faction fought 
back with heavy gunfire. 
  The Phnom Penh forces had to back down and lay siege at the 
foot of the mountain. 
  Details of casualties are unavailable. Heavy shelling by 
government soldiers however, was believed to have caused some 
damage to Khao Preah Vihear itself. 
  During the clash, four artillery shells reportedly strayed 
across the border and landed near a Thai rangers' base in 
Kantharalak district but no one was injured. 
  The sound of gunfire was heard in Kantharalak district 
yesterday. 
  A Thai soldier yesterday said Thai forces were on alert and 
had reinforced para-military troopers near Khao Preah Vihear. 
The Suranari Task Force had prepared to fire back if more 
shells from the fighting landed in Thailand.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 8 -- Four sets of anti-tank 
missile were seized in Siem Reap Province on April 5. Police 
said the four missiles known as "Bruss" were found in a boot of 
a taxi driving from Banteay Meanchey to Siem Reap. One man on 
board, suspected to be an owner of the missiles, was arrested 
when the police found the missiles at their checkpoint. 
  The taxi driver Yoeun Yang, 43, said the arrested man had 
ordered him to pick up a well-wrapped package, in which the 
missiles were found, at a place in Banteay Meanchey Province. 
  Besides the arrested man, there were one woman and two 
children on board. 
  Police said the four missiles were expected to be used for 
destroying tanks of the Regional Military Unit 4 stationed in 
Siem Reap Town. 
  Chea Sophat, the two-star police general, said he believed 
that the missiles, if not found, would have been used for not 
only destroying tanks but also for other purposes.

  [Text] The second session of the first National Assembly 
opened on the morning of 5 April and closed cheerlessly at noon. 
According to those watching the situation, this was a work 
failure. They have compared this session to the opening session 
of the constituent assembly on 2 July 1993. This is because 
nothing of importance happened at this session, except that 
assembly members -- some standing and some sitting -- listened 
to the message from His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk and a 
report by the National Assembly Standing Committee. 
  Sar Sa-at, a member of the Commission for Interior, National 
Defense, Investigation, and Suppression, admitted that this 
session was useless because one of the major items was withdrawn 
from the agenda. He believes, however, that there will be many 
major items at the next session relating to the debate and 
adoption of a number of bills the government is forwarding to 
the National Assembly. Sar Sa-at further said that because of 
differing views, this session seemed unimportant. It was 
legally correct, however, which is something necessary for the 
National Assembly. 
  What was termed a failure was the disagreement during 
adoption of the agenda on examining the validity of new people's 
representatives. The mistake of using improper words in the 
third item created a problem that caused the last two items to 
be withdrawn without hesitation by a number of assembly members. 
On this occasion, 41 were in favor of the items being withdrawn 
and 15 against; 44 abstained. There were 100 members present 
with 20 absentees. 
  A National Assembly official from FUNCINPEC [National United 
Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative 
Cambodia] said: The withdrawal took place because there was no 
compromise. If there was a compromise along with the legal 
factor, a way out could have been found... [ellipsis as printed] 
What this official said seemed reasonable, based on what the 
National Assembly did earlier. It is still remembered that 
during the election of the National Assembly's second vice 
chairman, voting had to be done in four rounds. His Excellency 
Son Soubert was a candidate three times after failing to get 
support twice. Taking democracy into consideration, this is 
unacceptable! Compromise, however, is an important factor in 
undoing a hidden knot. 
  Be that as it may, the National Assembly was widely 
criticized by outsiders and by its own members for the loss of 
full democracy due to this compromise. The National Assembly 
was perhaps trying to answer this criticism at this session by 
not advocating compromise to solve the issue of the third item 
on the agenda. The National Assembly tried to adhere seriously 
to the law and democracy. It was noticed that the session was 
conducted solely on legal grounds. 
  Some have criticized the National Assembly Standing 
Committee 
and the government for the adjournment and unimportance of the 
session. The Standing Committee did not do its work properly and 
clearly. The government was late in forwarding bills to the 
National Assembly, which in turn caused problems for the 
National Assembly Standing Committee in organizing the agenda. 
One obvious fact, though, is this: The two major political 
parties, which have about the same number of people's 
representatives, did not have any intention of examining and 
adopting the issue of the validity of the new people's 
representatives during this session. 
  Some analysts hold that if the two parties were willing to 
find a way out on the issue of new people's representatives, it 
would not have been difficult. There could be some intrigues 
between the two political parties behind the shelving of this 
issue for a while, even for a short while. 
  A FUNCINPEC official said that the validity issue is a 
complex one. He refused to elaborate to our correspondent on 
what this complexity is. We know that the validity issue 
concerns 18 people's representatives -- five from the Cambodian 
People's Party [CPP] and 13 from FUNCINPEC -- who are to replace 
18 people's representatives who are taking up public functions, 
which is incompatible with the role of people's representative. 
  There are hints that FUNCINPEC does not like two CPP 
people's 
representatives -- namely, Prince Kromkhun Chakkrapong and Sin 
Song -- because the two already renounced their people's 
representative status when UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia] was still in Cambodia. Furthermore, the case of Nguon 
Non, who is replacing Khin Yean, could also cause some problems. 
The same FUNCINPEC official also said that FUNCINPEC will 
support the inclusion of Nguon Non despite some difficulties. 
  Some analysts think that the inclusion of the new people's 
representatives could be done if the two parties make mutual 
concessions. Another noteworthy point is that FUNCINPEC may not 
want its men who were elected in the first place to leave the 
National Assembly. 
  Some clues have been uncovered that this is also connected 
with monetary benefit. It is known how big the salary of a 
people's representative is compared to that of ministers and 
provincial and municipal governors and deputy governors... 
[ellipsis as printed] 
  Whatever the reasons, we hold that the Constitution should 
be 
respected and the National Assembly Standing Committee ought to 
be courageous in its decision on this issue based on the law. 
Now that the two political parties think of themselves as 
democratic, they ought to be genuinely so.

  [Text] Jakarta, Apr 7 (ANTARA) -- Dutch Foreign Minister 
P.H. Kooijmans during his visit in Indonesia gained the 
impression that much progress has been made in the country's 
political development, particularly where political openness is 
concerned, an Indonesian human rights official said. 
  Marzuki Darusman, member of the National Commission on Human 
Rights, said Kooijmans spoke about Indonesia's political 
development at an informal meeting with representatives of a 
number of Indonesian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 
Jakarta Thursday. 
  "There has been a wind of change in Indonesia which could be 
clearly observed. It is certainly a good sign for the country's 
future," Darusman quoted Kooijmans as saying. 
  According to Kooijmans a change for the better was 
noticeable 
in the country's political atmosphere compared to the time when 
he visited Indonesia a few years ago as a representative of the 
UN secretary general, Darusman said. 
  Kooijmans arrived in Jakarta on Monday as a member of Dutch 
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers' party for a four-day state visit. 
  Lubbers had meanwhile suddenly cut short his visit by one 
day 
and left Jakarta on Wednesday. 
  Referring to Lubbers' shortened visit, Kooijmans said at the 
meeting with the Indonesian NGOs, the Dutch prime minister had 
to return home sooner than planned because of an emergency 
stemming from a conflict in the Dutch Parliament. 
  Kooijmans expressed the hope Indonesian NGOs would be able 
to 
see to it that the wind of change in Indonesia's political life 
would benefit the efforts to create better human rights 
conditions, Darusman said. 
  The Dutch minister had concluded there was more political 
openness in Indonesia among other things from the "more 
democratic" way in which the Indonesian press was reporting 
events, according to Darusman.

  [Text] Indonesia has urged Britain and Norway not to 
increase oil production from the North Sea oil fields because 
this will result in a drop in oil prices. Indonesia has also 
called on OPEC Secretary General Subroto to contact officials of 
the two countries about the matter. Mining and Energy Minister 
I.B. Sujana told reporters after meeting President Suharto at 
the Bina Graha Presidential Office in Jakarta this morning that 
North Sea oil production has now reached 5 million barrels per 
day. 
  Faisal Abda'u, president director of the State Oil and Gas 
Company, who accompanied Minister I.B. Sujana during the meeting 
with the head of state, said the prices of Indonesian oil during 
the 1993-94 fiscal year averaged U.S. $16.42 per barrel. 
Indonesia produces about 1.3 million barrels of oil per day in 
accordance with the OPEC quota.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta, Apr 8 (ANTARA) -- Britain has signed up 
an agreement to provide a soft loan of 80 million pounds (250 
billion rupiah) to help finance some of Indonesia's projects on 
transportation and environment. 
  Its fourth financial assistance to Indonesia since 1986, the 
agreement was both signed by the British Commonwealth State and 
Foreign Minister Alastair Goodland and Indonesia's Foreign 
Affairs Minister Ali Alatas on Thursday. 
  "Britain has been involved in Indonesian projects since 1986 
with the total funding of some 224 million pounds," Goodland 
said, adding that all of it were in the form of soft-loans". 
  According to the agreement, the 80 million pound will 
finance 
the building of a two-way railway system connecting Cikampek and 
Cirebon, a technological and industrial pollution research 
centre, and a traffic regulation system in Medan, North Sumatera. 
  Some funds will also be used to finance the installation of 
oceanic navigation equipments to further develop basic 
scientific studies in the field, as well as some projects which 
involve the environment and transportation. 
  Goodland noted that Britain has always monitored the 
development of its funded projects. 
  "I am satisfied with the implementation of the projects 
here. 
It does not only help economic growth but promotes the British 
goods and services as well," he added. [passage omitted] 
  Meanwhile, Minister Alatas said that the projects were 
chosen 
to prove that the two countries are committed to developments 
which directly have an impact on the public. 
  He expressed the hope the developments will improve 
Indonesia 
human resources and its products, as well as the continuity of 
the resource development.

<F P=106> [PASASON 8 Apr Editorial: "Wholeheartedly Welcome His </F>
Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet of the Kingdom of Thailand"] 
  [Text] Today, all Lao people nationwide together with the 
residents of Vientiane, are elated and highly honored at the 
opportunity to welcome His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet and 
Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of the Kingdom of Thailand, who are 
scheduled to pay their first official, friendly visit to the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] from 8 to 9 April at an 
invitation of LPDR President His Excellency [H.E.] Nouhak 
Phoumsavan. During the visit, His Majesty King Phumiphon 
Adunyadet, together with H.E. LPDR President Nouhak Phoumsavan, 
will jointly preside over the inauguration ceremony of the 
Lao-Thai friendship bridge across the Mekong river. The bridge, 
built with gratis aid from the Australian Government and people, 
will be handed over as a gift to the LPDR and the Kingdom of 
Thailand. His majesty the king of Thailand will also meet with 
our Lao leaders and visit some of our establishments of economic 
and cultural significance. 
  The visit by His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet and Her 
Majesty Queen Sirikit on this occasion is a very significant 
event in the history of Lao-Thai relations. It is an important 
milestone in the new era of bilateral ties -- an era of mutual 
understanding and sincerity serving as the basis for cooperation 
in building and developing the countries and raising the 
standard of living and prosperity of the two peoples of Laos and 
Thailand. 
  Laos and Thailand are neighboring countries bound to one 
another by race since ancient times. They have maintained 
similar customs, religions, cultures, and languages. Their 
peoples have maintained neighborly, fraternal relations, and 
have together earned their living in a civilized way in this 
part of the world for a long time. With time, Laos and Thailand 
developed as independent countries. In the history of their 
ties, though there had been some disturbing incidents at certain 
periods, there were many other times when the two nations 
enjoyed friendship, mutual assistance, and solidarity in 
defending their respective countries. Regarding this, the late 
President Kaysone Phomvihan said in his speech at a dinner 
hosted by His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet in his honor 
during his visit to the Kingdom of Thailand in early 1992: 
Should we only uphold the spirit of fraternity and 
neighborliness, refrain from being partial or prejudiced against 
one another, and together adhere to Buddhist ethics and the five 
principles of peaceful coexistence, it is believed that we can 
settle each and every problem that arises to disrupt Lao-Thai 
relations. The facts about Lao-Thai relations in the recent 
past have clearly proved these words. As a result, steps of 
developments in many fields have been achieved in bilteral ties. 
  All Lao people wish His Majesty King Phumiphon Adunyadet and 
Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of the Kingdom of Thailand glorious 
success in the official, friendly visit to the LPDR. It is 
certain that the success of the visit will worthily contribute 
to promoting and expanding, ever more extensively and 
fruitfully, the relations between the two countries to bring 
about benefits to the two peoples of Laos and Thailand as well 
as the interest of peace, friendship, and cooperation in this 
region and the world.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 7 (KPL) -- Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating, yesterday morning handed over to Lao 
Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon the border control building on 
the Lao side of the friendship bridge. 
  Mr. Vang Lattanavong, Lao ambassador to Australia and Mr. 
Michael Mann, Australian ambassador to Laos were among high 
ranking officials from both sides at the solemn hand-over 
ceremony. 
  In his speech, Prime Minister Paul Keating said that 
speaking 
on behalf of the Australian Government and people, he was 
pleased to hand over the border control building to the Lao 
Government and people. He referred to the bridge as a door 
opening up to the development in the country and the adjacent 
facilities were regarded as the key of the development door. 
The building houses immigration, customs, police, banks and 
postal offices. He said that the border control building and 
the Mekong bridge itself could best serve to testify, in the 
concrete term, the fruitful Australian-Lao cooperation and 
friendship. Mr. Paul Keating congratulated both Australian and 
Lao technicians and workers whose high sense of responsibility 
fullfilled the construction targets in terms of time and budget. 
Australian prime minister touched upon the significance of the 
Australian-Lao agreement for the promotion and protection of 
investment which would help establish confidence for potential 
Australian investors. 
  Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon of Laos in his return 
address, speaking on behalf of the Lao people, said that the 
facilities were built with Australian grant. Apart from the 
Mekong bridge, the border control building, the gifts of the 
Australian Government and people to Laos, would facilitate the 
work of the Lao personnel. 
  Mr. Khamtai Siphandon expressed thanks once again to the 
Australian side for its generosity and good intention. He said 
that the Australian aid projects for Laos were highly 
appreciated. They were the symbol for the ever increasing 
traditional relations of friendship the two countries had 
enjoyed. The Lao prime minister attached great importance to 
the Australian aid which had instrumentally helped building the 
country's economic infrastructure and helped free Laos from a 
state of economic difficulties. 
  After delivering their speeches, both prime ministers 
officially lifted the veil off the building foundation plate. 
  Mr. Paul Keating and his delegation left Laos on board of a 
special plane for an official visit to the Kingdom of Thailand. 
The Australian prime minister paid a two-day official visit to 
the Lao PDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] on April 5 and 6.

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Paul Keating, prime minister 
of the Commonwealth of Australia, met with H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon at the Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane at 
0900 today. On this occasion, H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai 
Siphandon expressed pleasure over and highly appraised the 
official, friendly visit to the Lao People's Democratic Republic 
[LPDR] of H.E. Prime Minister Paul Keating. He said the visit 
is an event of historic significance in the friendly relations 
and good cooperation between Laos and Australia. 
  H.E. Khamtai expressed the hope that his consultative 
meeting 
and exchange of views with his excellency the Australian prime 
minister will enable both sides to understand ever more 
profoundly the internal situation and policies of each country. 
He said the understanding will serve as a firm basis for 
effective enhancement of cooperation for the benefit of the 
peoples of the two countries, and that it will also contribute 
to common trends for the establishment and promotion of peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among various countries 
in the region and the rest of the world. H.E. Khamtai also 
informed his excellency the Australian prime minister about 
certain problems in the socioeconomic development of the LPDR 
which is entering the eighth year of the implementation of 
comprehensive restructuring. He said: Through the 
implementation of the restructuring policy, the national economy 
has been progressively developed; the average rate of economic 
growth per year is as high as 6.58 percent; the prices of 
commodities and the kip currency are stable; the living 
conditions and cultural life of the people have explicitly 
improved; and the assistance and cooperation given to Laos by 
foreign countries and international organizations have also 
increased. There are now as many as 410 direct investment 
projects valued at $580 million by foreign countries in Laos, 
excluding investment in large-scale hydroelectric projects. 
  Regarding Lao-Australian relations, H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon noted that efforts have been made by the two 
countries to promote relations in various fields. He pointed 
out that as of now, bilateral relations between Laos and 
Australia have expanded ever more extensively and rapidly. H.E. 
Khamtai expressed gratitude to the Australian Government and 
people for their precious assistance given to the Lao Government 
and people in carrying out the socioeconomic development cause 
in the LPDR, in particular in building the communications 
infrastructure as well as training technicians of various 
branches and in community development. H.E. Khamtai reiterated 
that the LPDR is ready to increase cooperation with Australia in 
the economic, cultural, scientific, and technical fields. He 
also expressed the hope that the Australian Government will 
continue to support and encourage more and more Australian 
businessmen to invest in the LPDR. 
  Replying, H.E. Prime Minister Keating expressed thanks to 
the 
Government and people of Laos for the warm welcome accorded him 
and his delegation during the visit. H.E. Keating noted: 
Australia and Laos have maintained diplomatic relations for 
more than 40 years. It can be assured today about the great 
potential of the friendship. We are two different countries 
which have endured similar problems, for example problems in the 
areas of trade and investment, with a view to making our people 
enjoy security and prosperity. The Australian Government 
pledges to support Laos in carrying out its reform to achieve 
development in the same way other countries do. Regarding 
implementation of reform, the LPDR has put into force the law on 
investment, a law which guarantees security for foreign 
investors. Various Australian companies are now ready to invest 
in Laos. 
  In conclusion, the Australian prime minister said: We can 
contribute to the construction and development of Laos, and on 
the basis of this spirit the Australian Government has decided 
to render aid to Laos for the construction of this bridge across 
the Mekong River. In addition, beginning in 1994, the 
Australian Government has decided to set up a four-year 
assistance and cooperation project for Laos. This project costs 
more than 40 million Australian dollars. Besides, Australia has 
given Laos gratis aid in the form of food worth one million 
Australian dollars, and another one million dollars of gratis 
aid to preserve the environment in the LPDR. 
  The meeting lasted one hour. Later, H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon and H.E. Prime Minister Paul Keating attended 
the signing ceremony of a Lao-Australian agreement on investment 
promotion and protection, and a memorandum of understanding on 
the development project of the Se Kaman hyrdoelectric power in 
Attopeu Province and the Namcha 1 and 2 hydroelectric works in 
Vientiane Province. Signing the agreement and the memorandum for 
the Lao side was Leun Sombounkhan, vice chairman of the Planning 
and Cooperation Committee; and signing for the Australian side 
was Michael Mann, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary 
of Australia to Laos. Also signing the memorandum on the 
Australian side was Peter Ray, chairman of the Hag Enterprise 
Corporation Company of Australia. The agreement on investment 
promotion and protection between Laos and Australia will serve a 
significant basis in the legal aspect for the two countries to 
march forward to a new level which can bring about ever greater 
benefits to the peoples of the two countries. It will also 
serve as a basis which creates confidence for Australian 
investors to invest in the LPDR.

  [Text] The United States is satisfied with Thailand's 
consistent efforts to solve the labour problem, notably that of 
child labour, in the country, Labour and Social Welfare Minister 
Phaithun Kaeothong claimed on Wednesday. 
  He said the message was conveyed to him during a courtesy 
call by US Ambassador David Lambertson. 
  The ambassador met him to discuss developments in Thailand's 
efforts to solve the problem, particularly as it affected 
children, women and work safety. 
  The labour issue was used by the US as a trade barrier, Mr 
Phaithun said. 
  He said the Thai Government had brought clauses on child 
labour up to international standards with the banning of any 
child under 13 from the work force. 
  The law also specified the type of work children could or 
could not do, he said. 
  Many revolutionary decrees were lifted and the state 
enterprise labour law was amended to allow state employees to 
set up unions, he said.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry is waiting for facts from the 
Cambodian prime ministers concerning the accusation by the 
Cambodian foreign minister about Thailand supporting the Khmer 
Rouge [KR] . 
  Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri was asked 
by 
news reporters about Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom 
Sirivut's charge, which he made when he was in Malaysia that 
Thailand supported the Khmer Rouge and that there are pictures 
substantiating the charge. Prasong told reporters that he had 
instructed the Thai ambassador in Phnom Penh to seek a meeting 
with the Cambodian prime ministers in order to get facts from 
them so the Thai Government could take a proper course of 
action. Prasong said he did not understand why Prince Norodom 
Sirivut did not tell Thailand directly when he visited Thailand 
last time. 
  [Begin recording] [Prasong, in progress] ... this is not 
good for our relations -- existing and future relations. I will 
wait for information from the ambassador. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Prince Sirivut said he brought up 
this matter when he was in Malaysia. He said he wanted Malaysia 
to convey his concern to Thailand as Malaysia is an ASEAN friend 
of Thailand. 
  [Prasong] Why didn't he discuss it with us when he was in 
Thailand? We would like to ask him this question? [end

<F P=106> [Article by Caoimhin O. Bearain: "P. Penh's smoking photos </F>
turn out to be hot air"] 
  [Text] Even by the usual shaky standards of Phnom 
Penh-Bangkok relations, Cambodia's first Prime Minister Prince 
Norodom Ranariddh dropped a diplomatic hydrogen bomb when he 
said that the notorious Khmer Rouge [KR] boss, Pol Pot, had 
escaped the government's recent offensive on Pailin by driving 
into Thailand. 
  When faced with accusations of support or assistance to the 
Khmer Rouge, Bangkok's indignant response has always been to 
dismiss them as groundless and to challenge the accuser to 
provide proof. 
  Prince Ranariddh, speaking to reporters during a break in 
Tuesday's first meeting of the second session of the country's 
parliament, didn't brandish any proof on the spot but said he 
had photos that Thailand would not be too happy about. 
  The prince's photos allegedly show Pol Pot fleeing Pailin in 
a convoy of cars and trucks. 
  While this did not immediately seem like damning and 
conclusive evidence of Thai collusion, the Prince said it was 
the escape route that was the giveaway -- a smooth tarmac road. 
  "Cambodia does not have such roads," he said. 
  Later on Tuesday, the prince denied he had photos on 
state-run television and jokingly tried to down-play the whole 
affair. 
  The prince said that if he had such photos, he would have 
sold them. "The Japanese press said they would give a million 
dollars for photos of Pol Pot." 
  In Thailand, meanwhile, the allegations were creating 
predictable fallout, but given their high-level origin, the Thai 
response was tempered. 
  "Groundless," and potentially destructive to Thailand's 
image, said army spokesman Lieutenant General Anuson 
Kritsana-seni. 
  The prince's cabinet issued a clarification stating the 
prince had said that he had photos of "Pol Pot's men travelling 
on a road that we do not have." 
  But three of the Cambodian reporters who were present when 
the prince spoke told THE NATION they stood by the original 
translation of the prince's remarks although they added the 
prince was speaking quickly and digressing a lot. 
  Listening to a tape-recording of the comments, a senior 
Cambodian news editor expressed his surprise: "Oh my God, he 
really did say it." 
  One of the prince's advisors, however, said he used the `Pol 
Pot' in a commonly used generic manner. 
  Prince Ranariddh's reference to the photos did not come in 
an 
isolated outburst. 
  The prince strongly criticized Thailand for its repatriating 
Khmer Rouge refugees, who had fled into Thailand from Pailin, 
back into guerrilla-controlled zones. 
  The move had already drawn angry words from Foreign Minister 
Prince Norodom Sirivut. 
  Despite the joint communique signed by the prince, fellow 
co-premier Hun Sen, and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai which 
reaffirms Thailand's recognition of the royal government, the 
prince once again called on Thailand to clarify whether Bangkok 
supported the guerrillas or the government. 
  Referring to the photos, a government official said it may 
have been a genuine slip of the tongue or the prince may have 
been using the advance-retreat style of verbal politics, which 
his father King Norodom Sihanouk is famous for. 
  The prince made the comments to perhaps put the limelight on 
Thai-Khmer Rouge connections and then denied the comments for 
diplomatic damage control, the officials said. 
  If that was the intention it was rather poorly or 
strategically co-ordinated because once Prince Ranariddh backed 
off, Foreign Minister Prince Sirivut entered the fray. 
  Speaking in Kuala Lumpur Wednesday, Prince Sirivut accused 
the Thais of playing a double game". 
  Diplomats here said the Thai government is probably sincere 
in recognizing Phnom Penh and wishing to cut off links with the 
recalcitrant Khmer Rouge faction but he questions whether 
Bangkok's sway extends all the way along the border, large 
tracts of which are under martial law. 
  The foreign minister reflected this attitude when he asked 
whether the Thai government and Thai army were "speaking the 
same language." 
  One Western diplomat said he thought the Thais were not 
getting fair deal as the Cambodian government portrays the Khmer 
Rouge as outlaws and expects others to act in a similar way but 
at the same time the government allows the radical faction to 
maintain a legitimate presence in Phnom Penh -- the Khmer Rouge 
have an office in the grounds of the city's royal palace where 
officials pour through the local media looking for tales of 
corruption in high places which they then fax to their jungle 
colleagues who use the information in anti-government diatribes 
on the guerrillas' clandestine radio. 
  They noted that this latest diplomatic tempest blew up just 
after the Thais brought the Phnom Penh press corps on a 
three-day all-expenses-paid visit to border areas in an attempt 
to lay to rest rumours and allegations of Thai support for the 
Khmer Rouge. The trip, however, got off to an ominous start 
when the army chief of the psychological operations [psy-ops] 
division pointed to a map to show the various posts and 
checkpoints on the itenerary. 
  The Map, which was just a sketch had Thailand written on one 
side of the frontier and Democratic Kampuchea on the other. 
Democratic Kampuchea was the name given to Cambodia by the 
Khmer Rouge during their 1975-79 reign of terror and is still 
the faction's official title. 
  Since the Khmer Rouge were ousted from power by a Vietnamese 
invasion, the country has been called the People's Republic of 
Kampuchea, the State of Cambodia and now the Kingdom of Cambodia. 
  When a reporter queried the blunder on the map the officer 
looked puzzled. 
  An official from the embassy in Phnom Penh was seen to 
cringe 
as the psy-ops officer was updated by his colleagues. 
  The border trip itself proved inconclusive as, in keeping 
with a frontier, there were two sides to most of the stories 
told.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Bridging decades of mutual mistrust"] </F>
  [Text] Today marks an important milestone in the long 
history of relations between Thailand and Laos. The Thai-Lao 
Friendship Bridge, which was conceived more than three decades 
ago and whose construction was funded by Australia, will be 
formally opened today in a ceremony to be jointly presided over 
by Their Majesties the King and Queen and Laotian President 
Nouhak Phoumsavan and Mrs Phoumsavan. His Majesty will also 
take this auspicious opportunity to visit Laos -- his first 
foreign visit in almost 30 years -- and to inaugurate a 
Royally-sponsored agricultural centre. 
  His Majesty's visit to Laos today shows the importance the 
Thai monarchy attaches to relations between Thailand and its 
landlocked neighbour which, in most of the past two decades, 
have been marred by suspicion, misunderstanding and conflicts 
which, at times, have turned violent and resulted in bloodshed 
on both sides. 
  The opening of the bridge will certainly facilitate 
communication and transport links between Thailand and Laos. It 
will also improve contacts between Thai and Lao peoples who 
share several cultural and ethnic similarities. Foreign 
visitors will also have a better chance to explore the pristine 
Laotian environment and traditional cultures and experience the 
friendliness and gentleness of the Lao people. 
  The friendship bridge symbolises the cooperation between 
Thailand, Laos and Australia which funded the bridge 
construction. It also stands as testimony that, despite 
political ideological differences, countries can overcome 
suspicions and work together for their mutual benefits if they 
are genuinely sincere enough and willing to set aside their 
mutual distrust. 
  But it would be totally unrealistic to believe that the 
first 
bridge across the mighty Mekong River will suddenly bring to an 
end all the problems that have long existed between Thailand and 
Laos. It would also be self-deceiving to expect the two 
countries to suddenly bury the hatchet, embrace each other 
affectionately and walk hand-in-hand together towards economic 
prosperity. 
  Bangkok and Vientiane need to hold talks on a regular basis 
to settle some outstanding problems which still stand as an 
obstacle to the improvement of relations between the two 
neighbouring countries. One sticky problem is the Laotian 
resistance movement. Vientiane has always harboured the 
suspicion that Bangkok is clandestinely giving support and 
asylum to the resistance rebels, several of whom are suspected 
of having taken refuge in refugee camps in Thailand. However 
when Thailand suggested that Laos take back all the Laotian 
refugees in order to remove suspicion, this was rejected by 
Vientiane, claiming it is not in a financial position to accept 
them all. 
  Endowed with abundant natural sources, Laos is an ideal 
source of energy and raw materials for Thai industries. But 
Thai businessmen who wish to invest in Laos must tread a careful 
path and must not repeat the exploitative business practices 
employed by their predecessors who were branded as "ugly" Thais. 
The days when Thai businessmen could plunder at will and 
exploit Laos' natural wealth are over. Business deals should be 
done in a mutually beneficial manner. 
  The opening of the Friendship Bridge should usher in a new 
era of cooperation, friendship and relations between the two 
neighbouring countries which are based on the principle of 
respect of sovereignty and independence, mutual benefit and 
trust. And to achieve these goals, a lot has to be done by both 
sides earnestly and sincerely. The task will prove to be more 
difficult -- yet not insurmountable -- than just building a 
bridge.

  [Text] During their formal meeting at Government House 
today, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai and Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating discussed expanding bilateral trade and 
investment cooperation and promoting free trade practices. 
  Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's 
Office, disclosed that in addition to trade and investment 
policies, the Australian side expressed its desire to use 
Thailand as an aviation center for Qantas Airlines. The Thai 
side asked the Australian delegation to protect Thai products 
which have difficulties when imported to Australia and those 
products which were once accused of market dumping by asking 
Australia to use various cautious measures. Aphisit said: 
  [Begin recording] Besides bilateral issues, the two sides 
exchanged views extensively on how to use the multilateral 
cooperation framework to serve the two countries' trade, 
investment, and economic interests. In particular, the two 
sides have recognized the important role of the economic 
cooperation forums such as the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation, or APEC, and discussed possible ways to further 
expand cooperation in different areas. They discussed the 
possibility of linking economic cooperation between the ASEAN 
Free Trade Area and the economic cooperation zone, the so-called 
CER, of which Australia and New Zealand are members. This issue 
has never been brought up for official discussion previously. 
However, both the Thai and Australian sides agreed that further 
actions must be taken in this regard. Thailand itself can bring 
up this matter during ASEAN meetings, while Australia seeks 
consultations with New Zealand as well as members of ASEAN, AFTA 
[ASEAN Free Trade Area], and other groupings. Multilateral 
economic cooperation itself is very significant. The two sides 
agreed that it is a framework that can effectively prevent and 
discourage any country from resorting to unilateral trade 
measures which threaten and cause damage to the economies of 
others. Moreover, the stability is also a byproduct of 
multilateral cooperation. Despite the end of the Cold War, the 
two sides deemed it necessary to continue consultations on the 
security issue. [end recording] 
  Speaking to reporters during an interview after the meeting, 
Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak disclosed that the 
two sides agreed to turn APEC into a multilateral economic 
cooperation grouping. Suphachai said: 
  [Begin Suphachai recording] We discussed multilateral 
cooperation with APEC. The Australian side reiterated its 
concern over this issue. It noted that the United States is 
moving toward multilateral cooperation and that this is the 
right move. A multilateral basis means many countries are 
involved in any agreement. Australia does not want the United 
States to resort to bilateral actions similar to what it is 
doing with Japan. Therefore, Australia asks Thailand to help to 
build up the strength of APEC because APEC was established with 
support from U.S. politicians and economists who support the 
principle of multilateral trade. They do not want to see APEC 
lay idle for fear that certain elements in the United States 
might turn to practicing trade harassment on a unilateral basis. 
Prime Minister Chuan reaffirmed that Thailand has always 
supported and wants to see a strong APEC. However, he suggested 
that APEC apply GATT agreements as soon as possible and try to 
comply with GATT rules. He also noted that APEC members are not 
equally developed like countries in the European Union. This 
issue must also be considered. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai hosted a banquet in 
honor of visiting Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, his 
wife, and his delegation at Government House yesterday evening. 
The Australian prime minister and his entourage are currently 
on an official visit to Thailand as guests of the Thai 
Government. 
  In a welcome speech delivered at the banquet, Prime Minister 
Chuan said that the meeting between the Thai and Australian 
delegations during the visit will provide a good opportunity for 
both sides to develop their existing friendship, create better 
understanding, and expand cooperation between the two countries 
in the exploitation of their energy and potentials. The meeting 
will also enable both sides to find ways to enhance their roles 
in increasing the regional dynamic and collaboration. In 
addition, the prime minister expressed his admiration for 
Australia's constructive role in the Southeast Asian and 
Asia-Pacific regions. Australian participation in the opening 
of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge is an historic event that 
reflects a great achievement resulting from international 
cooperation. Australia is thereby considered to have a role in 
the process of establishing peace and progress in Southeast Asia.

  [Text] Australia is to discuss formally with New Zealand a 
plan to extend the free trade zone in the Asia-Pacific. Graeme 
Well reports Prime Minister Paul Keating is enthusiastic about 
Thailand's idea of linking Australia and New Zealand into the 
ASEAN free trade agreement: 
  [Begin recording] [Well] Mr. Keating says the existing ASEAN 
regional trade area is about the same as the combined GDP of 
Australia and New Zealand, so including those two countries 
would double the market. Thailand says the idea's been received 
positively by other ASEAN member states. Now Mr. Keating's been 
invited to discuss it formally with them and New Zealand. He 
says wherever the motion of freer trade can be extended, it 
ought to be: 
  [Keating] It would further on depend on trade efforts in the 
area and more rapidly [words indistinct] the prospect of higher 
economic growth and more employment. [end recording] 
  A federal opposition trade spokesperson, National Party 
leader Tim Fischer, said Australia should proceed with caution 
towards linking Australia and New Zealand with the ASEAN free 
trade agreement. Mr. Fischer says while the coalition sees 
advantages in some relationship between the closer economic 
relations, CER, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA], it must 
not create an exclusive or discriminatory trade bloc.

  [Text] Uganda's visiting Trade and Industry Minister 
Richard Kaijuka has urged Thai investors to help develop his 
country's untapped natural resources, saying the African state 
has enjoyed nearly a decade of political and economic stability. 
  He said the country is economically attractive and full of 
economic opportunities and that the government has introduced a 
number of incentives including investment codes and certain 
tax-free periods to promote foreign investment. 
  Despite its plentiful resources and steady economic growth, 
the landlocked nation of 17 million people still lags behind for 
lack of expertise and experience. He specified the agriculture 
and food processing, textile and garment, hotel and tourism 
industries, telecommunications, stones and gems, leather 
industry, mining and hydro energy as the main sectors which are 
open to Thai businessmen. 
  "Uganda's (economic) performance is outstanding but we could 
do better with Thai experience and expertise. We would like to 
invite serious Thai businessmen and manufacturers to invest in 
our country because of your experience and expertise... The sky 
is the limit," he said. 
  Uganda was one of the fastest growing African states after 
its independence from Britain in October 1962. But 10 years 
later the country plunged into political turmoil with a 
dictatorial regime and civil war ravaging the country's economy. 
  After the national resistance movement under Yoweri Museveni 
toppled the dictatorship in 1986, the country embarked on a 
market-oriented policy. Financial reform, a free-market economy 
and privatization have helped revive the sagging economy. Since 
1991, the average annual growth has stood at 5 per cent and 
inflation has gone down from 360 per cent to around 3 per cent. 
About 80 per cent of workers are engaged in agriculture and 96 
per cent of the national income comes from coffee production. 
  Kaijuka said Uganda is blessed with a moderate climate and 
its geographic location in the heart of Africa makes it a good 
springboard for manufactured goods into other central, eastern 
and southern African nations. The country, he said, is a member 
of the 250-million-people Common Market for Eastern, Central and 
Southern African States (COMESA), which was established last 
year and includes countries from Ethiopia down to Swaziland. 
With the expected new membership of South Africa, the COMESA 
will expand to 300 million people. 
  The trade minister, who stopped in Thailand on his way to 
Singapore, said his country has adopted a number of incentives 
including tax-free import of equipment and a tax-free grace 
period of five years. He said other privileges will be added. 
The country's currency is also fully convertible and can be 
exchanged without limit at any time, he said. 
  Kaijuka made a courtesy call on Deputy Foreign Minister 
Surin 
Phitsuwan on Tuesday and introduced James Mulwana, who was 
appointed honorary consul-general of Thailand in Uganda, to the 
Thai minister. 
  According to Dr Suraphon Siwithe, director of the Foreign 
Ministry's African Division, two Thai candidates are being 
proposed by the Industry Association as honorary consul-general 
of Uganda in Thailand. The names are being submitted to Uganda 
for final approval and selection. 
  The two countries established diplomatic ties in 1985 and 
Thailand has assigned its ambassador to Nairobi, Kenya, as envoy 
to Uganda, while the latter has assigned its high commissioner 
to New Delhi, India, as ambassador to Thailand.

  [Text] Police have enough evidence to issue warrants for 
the arrest of two men believed responsible for the truck-bomb 
discovered in Bangkok last month, city police chief Chaisit 
Kanchanakit said yesterday. 
  Chaisit said police had photographs of the two suspects, but 
he did not identify them as Thais or foreigners. He said 
information gathered by police was the same as that received by 
the National Intelligence Agency. 
  Police discovered a truck wired with explosives in Bangkok 
last month. They speculated it was destined for the Israeli 
Embassy in Soi Langsuan before it was involved in a minor 
traffic accident. Witnesses said the truck driver, who later 
fled, was of Middle Eastern appearance. 
  Chaisit said he could not say whether the bomb had anything 
to do with international politics. 
  "I can say only that police already know who the culprits 
are 
and their intention. The suspects may still be in Bangkok," he 
said. Police would discuss with the Interior Ministry whether 
arrest warrants should be issued.

  [Text] President Ramos took a direct hand in his 
administration's waste management program yesterday and created 
a top-level committee composed of six Cabinet secretaries to 
ensure the protection of the environment and the proper disposal 
of waste materials. 
  At the same time, the Chief Executive disclosed that the 
country received a total of $32.71 million worth of assistance 
from the European Community (EC) for 1994. The money will be 
used on projects that will protect the environment and preserve 
the country's natural resources. 
  The president's move was contained in Memorandum Circular 
(MC) No. 88 which reconstituted the Presidential Task Force on 
Waste Management to ensure effective implementation of its 
various programs and projects. 
  The new memorandum amended MC 39-A issued by then, President 
Corazon C. Aquino on 19 January 1988 which designated the 
Presidential Management Staff as the task force coordinator. 
  Under MC 88, President Ramos designated Environment and 
Natural Resources Secretary Angel Alcala as chairman, with 
Public Works and Highways Secretary Gregorio Vigilar, Health 
Secretary Juan Flavier, Economic Planning Secretary Cielito 
Habito, Trade Secretary Rizalino Navarro and Interior and Local 
Government Secretary Rafael Alunan III as members. 
  The reconstituted task force, the president said, will have 
the following modified functions and responsibilities: 
  -- Ensure the implementation of the Integrated National 
Solid 
Waste Management Systems Framework as approved for adoption 
during the Cabinet meeting on 19 October 1993; 
  -- Ensure the continuous coordination and compliance by 
concerned agencies on the matter as well as on the various 
policies and presidential directives issued on waste management; 
  -- Formulate and recommend to the president all policies 
pertinent to the framework plan; 
  -- Serve as policy and management board for the Project 
Management Office on Solid Waste Management created under 
Administrative Order No. 90; 
  -- Source the financial and technical requirements of the 
plan from appropriate entities; 
  -- Create the necessary Technical Working 
Groups/Committees to assist the task force in the plan's 
implementation; 
  -- Submit quarterly reports to the president; and 
  -- Perform other functions as maybe directed by the 
president. 
  President Ramos tasked the DENR [Department of Environment 
and Natural Resources] to provide technical and administrative 
support to the task force. 
  In a report to the president, National Economic and 
Development Authority (NEDA) Director General Cielito Habito 
said the EC assistance will go to the preservation of natural 
parks, integrated protected areas and industrial pollution 
abatement. 
  Aside from boosting the government's environmental 
protection 
program, the EC assistance for 1994 will enhance institutional 
linkages, investment promotion, agrarian reform implementation 
and coconut processing, Habito reported. 
  The Chief Executive was also informed that a high-level 
business conference is expected to be held in Europe in 
September or October this year. 
  "This will explore possible business opportunities between 
the Philippines and EC countries. Hopefully, the conference 
will bear fruitful results in upgrading Philippine-EC trade 
relations," Habito said. 
  The EC infused a total of $75.37 million in the country last 
year which mostly financed rural development projects in Western 
Samar, Catanduanes, Aurora, Guimaras, Biliran, Bantayan, the 
Camotes and Pitogo. 
  The private sector also received grant financing for a 
packaging center and assistance to the computer software 
industry, which reflected greater private sector access to 
official development assistance," Habito said. 
  Habito also informed the president that the EC has expressed 
interest in initiating regular high level consultations to 
review pipeline projects as well as its ongoing projects. 
  The first consultation might be held this May, he said.

  [Text] The Board of Investments (BoI) reported over the 
weekend a 5.6 percent drop in investment last year, from P96.6 
billion [Philippine pesos] in l992 to P94.086 billion in 1993. 
  The figure represented the total cost of investments in 
2,000 
projects approved by the BoI. 
  "But it is not too bad," the BoI said, "given the power 
generators, and iron and steel investment projects during the 
year were to be excluded, the total project cost of investments 
in 1993 would amount to P43.2 billion." 
  This was 62.5 percent higher than the corresponding amount 
of 
P26.6 billion in 1992. 
  Specifically, the BoI said investments in energy-related and 
power generator projects rose from P19.4 billion in 1992 to 
P30.4 billion in 1993, or an increase of 56.7 percent. 
  Investments in iron and steel projects dropped from P53.8 
billion in 1992 to P43.2 billion in 1993, or a hefty growth of 
62.5 percent.

<F P=106> [By Almira R. Hernandez] </F>
  [Text] The country's overall balance of payment (BOP) 
position worsened during the first nine months last year, 
registering a deficit of $843 million represented a turnaround 
from a $158-million surplus during the comparable period in 1992. 
  Based on the latest Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) 
statistics, the improved performance in capital account failed 
to compensate for the widened deficit in the aggregate current 
account . 
  As of September last year, total capital account surplus 
amounted to $1.033 billion, more than double the $454 million 
recorded during the same period in 1992. Specifically, net 
foreign investment reached $401 million, 45.6 percent less than 
the year ago level. 
  This developed as more Filipinos invested their funds in 
different countries abroad as a result of the foreign exchange 
liberalization program. Under this program, prior approval of 
the BSP is no longer needed when Filipinos invest abroad. This 
scheme further provides that outward investments would be less 
than $1 million per investor a year if funded by resources from 
banks. 
  Thus, with such deregulation, outward investment jumped to 
$1.802 billion, more than four times the $368 million posted in 
the previous year. 
  This marked increase in outward investments offset the hefty 
61.5 percent hike to $2.203 billion in the inflow of foreign 
funds to the country. These inflow comprised mostly of 
portfolio investments, which rose from $366 million in 1992 to 
$1.532 billion during the period in review. 
  Likewise, the medium- and long-term account posted a 
reversal 
to a surplus of $1.252 billion from a negative balance of $204 
million as of September 1992. This positive performance was 
brought about as loan availments grew 3.6 percent from $3.033 
billion to $3.141 billion. 
  Furthermore, loan repayments to foreign creditors 
drastically 
dropped to $1.889 billion, 41.6 percent lower than the previous 
year's outflows. 
  Meanwhile, the current account balance registered a 
$2.294-billion deficit during the first nine months of 1993. 
This deficit further expanded from the $905-million deficit 
recorded during the same period in the earlier year. 
  The continued widening of this component can be primarily 
traced to the growing merchandise trade gap. Despite the 
improved performance of the export sector, it was not able to 
outpace imports, thus, swelling the deficit further. 
<H5>  Exports </H5>
  During the period in review, exports reached $8.119 billion, 
an additional $892 million or 12.3 percent from $7.227 billion 
registered in the same period in 1992. However, imports 
likewise rose 19.2 percent to $12.644 billion from the $10.608 
billion recorded previously. 
  As a result, the balance of trade deficit widened 33.8 
percent to $4.525 billion during the first nine months last year 
from the $3.381-billion shortfall in the same period in 1992. 
  In contrast, the service account had a net balance of 
$1.691-billion surplus. This developed as the increased total 
receipts compensated for the decline in the payments for 
non-merchandise trade. 
  In particular, total receipts from the service account rose 
2.9 percent to $5.54 billion from $5.382 billion. This was 
largely traced to the 4 percent increase in personal income from 
abroad to $1.703 billion. This made up the bulk of total 
earnings from services rendered. 
  Meanwhile, the country paid an aggregate $3.849 billion for 
non-merchandise trade during the period in review, $325 million 
less than the payments for the first nine months in 1992.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 (YONHAP) -- North Korea is building 
missile launching sites along the Chinese border, the ASAHI 
SHIMBUN reported in a Seoul-datelined story on Friday. 
  In an interview with the Japanese newspaper, former North 
Korean Army 1st Lt. Yim Yong-son, who defected to South Korea 
last September, said Pyongyang had selected areas along the 
Chinese border as missile launching sites, judging that an 
attacker would avoid these areas for fear of hitting China by 
accident, the report said. 
  Saying he was quoting fellow soldiers at an Army engineering 
unit engaged in construction of missile bases where he worked 
before defecting to Seoul, Yim said that although North Korea's 
missile launching sites are located along the eastern coastlines 
of North Hamgyong and Kangwon Provinces and Wonsan city, the 
Stalinist North recently started building additional sites along 
the Chinese border. 
  Some 5,000 people are working at such sites at Chunggangjin 
in Chagang Province and the job will be completed next year, the 
Japanese newspaper quoted Yim as saying. 
  "I heard that North Korea, presuming that the United States 
and South Korea would not attack missile sites along the Chinese 
border for fear of hitting China if war broke out, began 
constructing the sites along its Chinese border," he was quoted 
as saying.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 8 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean 
ambassador warned Friday that his country will go nuclear, 
accusing Japan of posing an atomic threat to the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The threat of Japanese nuclear weapons development is being 
actualized, North Korean envoy to India Cha Pong-chu said in a 
keynote speech to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
and the Pacific (ESCAP). 
  Tokyo currently possesses enough plutonium to make 6,500 
nuclear weapons, Cha claimed, demanding that the Japanese 
Government announce to the world it will not go nuclear. 
  If Japan did choose the nuclear option, the inter-Korean 
agreement on denuclearization would become meaningless, he said, 
reasoning that North Korea would then have to pursue its own 
nuclear program. 
  Cha, a former vice foreign minister, said in an earlier 
interview with YONHAP News Agency that Pyongyang would decide 
whether to produce nuclear weapons after considering all 
external threats.

  [Text] The government held the first meeting of the 
Unification and Security Policy Coordination Council presided 
over by Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok this morning. It was 
decided to hold a meeting of this council every Friday to 
coordinate the government's position on the North Korean nuclear 
issue and other security-related issues. It was also decided to 
promptly call a special meeting whenever it is needed to cope 
with changing situations. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok; Foreign Minister Han 
Sung-chu; Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae; Kim Tok, head of the 
Agency for National Security Planning; Pak Kwan-yong, chief 
presidential secretary; and Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential 
aide on foreign and security affairs -- who are core figures in 
charge of unification and security affairs -- were present at 
the meeting. They have decided to seek an effective way to 
actively cope with unification and security matters by pursuing 
a one-voice policy [hanmoksori chongchaek] through close 
coordination of related offices' opinion, being reminded of the 
fact that this council was organized mainly because the people 
have come to distrust the government's confused unification and 
security policy. 
  In today's meeting, they shared the view that the 
Unification 
and Security Policy Coordination Council will play the role of a 
virtual control tower in charge of generalizing [tonggwal] and 
coordinating opinion to prevent confusion in government policy, 
and that high-level strategic meetings and unification-related 
ministers meetings will be held continuously. 
  In addition, after determining that a working-level body is 
needed to support the council's activities, they decided to form 
a working-level organization chaired by the deputy minister of 
the National Unification Board. 
  In particular, the participants reconfirmed in today's 
meeting the government's fixed position [chongnidoen ipchang] 
that the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks cannot be held 
unless North Korea allows nuclear inspections and complies with 
the exchange of special envoys.

  [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- The government held the 
first meeting on unification and security policy coordination at 
the South-North dialogue office on Friday to review its overall 
policy toward North Korea. 
  The meeting, presided over by Minister of the National 
Unification Board (NUB) Yi Yong-tok, decided to discuss all 
unification matters, diplomacy related to the North and security 
to coordinate the opinions of different ministries. 
  The various ministries and secretaries will also push ahead 
with unification- and security-related policies under the 
principle that the government must seek progress in inter-Korean 
relations. 
  President Kim Yong-sam Thursday instructed that a 
Unification 
and Security Policy Coordination Council be formed. The council 
comprises the minister of the National Unification Board, the 
foreign and defense ministers, the director of the Agency for 
National Security Planning, the chief presidential secretary and 
the senior secretary for foreign and national security affairs. 
  NUB Minister Yi said after the meeting, "We looked into the 
overall situation on unification and security after adoption of 
the U.N. Security Council's presidential statement and rupture 
of inter-Korean working-level contact." 
  "We will discuss every policy to adjust differences between 
ministries." 
  The coordination meetings will be held regularly more than 
once a week, and President Kim himself will chair the sessions 
when necessary.

  [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Russia has asked North 
Korea to allow its loggers in Siberia to carry passports and 
move freely through the logging yards, a lawmaker said Wednesday. 
  Rep. Kang Sin-cho, chairman of a fact-finding subcommittee 
of 
the National Assembly's Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
Reunification, made the remark after attending a closed-door 
meeting with government officials. 
  He said Moscow is demanding that Pyongyang improve the human 
rights of North Koreans working at logging yards in Siberia. 
  "On-the-spot examination by the fact-finding subcommittee of 
the Siberian logging yards is a delicate matter related to 
diplomatic relations between South Korea and Russia as well as 
inter-Korean relations. Therefore, we plan to decide on when to 
go to Siberia after fully consulting with the government," he 
said. 
  Pyongyang is negotiating with Moscow to renew their forestry 
agreement which expired at the end of last year, but Russia is 
demanding that a new provision securing the human rights of 
North Korean loggers be added to the new pact. 
  Some 16,000 to 20,000 North Koreans are working in 
Pyongyang-run logging yards in Siberia, with hundreds having 
escaped to roam throughout Russia or seeking asylum in South 
Korea.

  [Text] New Delhi, April 8 (YONHAP) -- Russian Vice Foreign 
Minister Aleksandr Panov said here on Friday that if South Korea 
wishes it, Russia would send all those North Korean loggers who 
had escaped from their logging yards in Siberia to South Korea. 
  Panov, now here to attend the 50th U.N. Economic and Social 
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) meeting, told the 
YONHAP news agency that there would be no problem in permitting 
their asylum in South Korea. 
  Saying that talks were going on with North Korea over 
whether 
to continue to keep North Korean logging yards in Siberia, the 
Russian vice foreign minister said a new agreement could be 
concluded before long taking into account the views of human 
rights organizations concerned about the rights of North Korean 
loggers. 
  With regard to his recent remarks that Russia would support 
North Korea if it is invaded, Panov said that Russia is the 
successor to the former Soviet Union and that the agreements 
signed between the USSR and North Korea still remain valid. 
  "If we repeal USSR-North Korea agreements overnight, it 
would 
lead to a great confusion," he said. "But, we are 
re-interpreting some of the clauses of such agreements now that 
things have changed." 
  Russia is seeking ways to cope with the changed reality 
while 
keeping the existing agreements without offending North Korea if 
possible, Panov said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 8 (YONHAP) -- The North Korean 
Government has announced a 1994 national budget amounting to 
41,525,190,000 won (18.8 billion U.S. dollars based on a 
current exchange rate of 2.20 won to one dollar.) 
  The announcement was made by Finance Minister Yun Ki-chong 
at 
the Seventh Session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly 
Thursday, North Korea's Central News Agency (KCNA) said, 
according to NAEWOE PRESS, Seoul's official monitor of North 
Korean press reports. 
  The budget represented an increase of 2.4 percent in 
revenues 
and a rise of 3.2 percent in expenditures, KCNA said. 
  The North Korean Government plans to hike budget 
expenditures 
for the "people's economy" by 3.2 percent, and for social and 
cultural projects by 2.8 percent, compared with rises last year 
of 3 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, from the year 
earlier. 
  In 1993, the North Korean Government had budget revenues of 
40.5 billion won (18.8 billion dollars based on an average 
exchange rate in 1993 of 2.15 won to one U.S. dollar). Of the 
total, the government spent 40.2 billion won (18.7 billion 
dollars), leaving a surplus of 328 million won (152 million 
dollars), KCNA said. 
  The fact that Pyongyang increased the 1994 budget by a 
relatively small margin from 1993 was seen as a virtual 
admission that it has failed to fulfill its third seven-year 
economic plan (1987-93), analysts at NAEWOE said. 
  The Pyongyang government has apparently set the next three 
years (1994-96) as an adjustment period for construction of a 
socialist economy, they said. 
  Pyongyang increased military spending 4.1 percent from 1993 
to 11.6 percent of the total budget. But a considerable 
proportion of its actual military outlay is believed to be 
hidden in the sector called expenditure on the people's economy, 
NAEWOE said. 
  If everything was taken into consideration, the North's 
military spending would amount to more than 30 percent of the 
total, it said.

  [Text] Students who had restrained themselves from staging 
demonstrations for some time took to the streets again to demand 
renegotiations on the revised Uruguay Round implementation plan. 
  Approximately 5,000 students of 22 Seoul universities, 
including Hanyang and Kyonghui Universities, gathered at 
Chongnyangni Station, Chongmyo Park, and other places in Seoul 
and held meetings to oppose the ratification of the Uruguay 
Round implementation plan. The students called the revision of 
the Uruguay Round implementation plan an antistate act that 
would crush agriculture. They demanded renegotiations with the 
United States on basic agricultural products. They also 
demanded that the National Assembly not ratify the 
implementation plan and opposed the adoption of the Morocco 
protocol composed of implementation plans of each state 
scheduled for 12 April. 
  Approximately 5,000 students of some 110 regional 
universities, including Pusan, Chonnam, and Kyongbuk 
Universities, held meetings this afternoon to oppose the 
adoption of the Uruguay Round protocol and the National 
Assembly's ratification and staged street demonstrations. 
  In particular, students of eight universities in Pusan and 
South Kyongsang Province, including Pusan and Tonga Universities 
declared a class boycott for today and tomorrow. 
  Most of today's gatherings were peaceful, and there was no 
confrontation between police and students.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa renewed his call on Friday to create a new large 
parliamentary group of various political parties within the 
House of Representatives with his Japan New Party serving as its 
core. 
  Hosokawa made the appeal at a plenary session of his party's 
38 legislators a few hours after announcing his decision to give 
up the premiership, JNP legislators said. 
  "We have to assemble people with the ideal of reform while 
making our party the core of the new group," Hosokawa said. 
  The premier proposed naming the new group "Reform." 
  The JNP legislators agreed to give Hosokawa a mandate to 
decide how to proceed with the project to form the new 
parliamentary group. 
  The idea had earlier come under a barrage of criticism from 
the new party Sakigake (Harbinger) and the Social Democratic 
Party, which charged that such a proposal, if realized, would 
lead to the formation of a new large party amalgamating the JNP, 
Shinseito and Komeito. 
  The premier's renewal of the call may add fuel to a 
simmering 
intracoalition rivalry between the Sakigake-SDP camp and the 
JNP- Shinseito-Komeito camp at a time when the coalition is 
moving to pick a successor to Hosokawa, political analysts said. 
  Hosokawa also told the plenary session he had decided to 
dissolve the current JNP-Sakigake parliamentary group, the 
legislators said. 
  Meanwhile, JNP executives said the party had decided to 
report the formation of the new parliamentary group "Reform" to 
the Secretariat of the lower chamber. 
  In addition to the 38 JNP legislators, two United Social 
Democratic Party legislators had decided to join the new group, 
they added.

<F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The abrupt announcement on 
Friday of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's intention to resign 
is likely to deal a severe blow to Japanese diplomacy as it 
comes at an important time on the international front. 
Hosokawa's announcement comes as Japan is seeking ways to 
resume the failed trade "framework" negotiations with the United 
States and as tensions run high on the Korean peninsula over 
North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons. 
  "It would, of course, have an effect on diplomacy," a senior 
Foreign Ministry official said of the resignation decision. 
"But all we can do is go ahead with diplomacy calmly. For the 
time being, we will watch developments on the political scene." 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata was more blunt, saying the 
latest development would have a detrimental effect on Japan's 
relationship with the world. "Japan has become a country which 
can have some influence on various other countries," Hata told a 
press conference Friday evening, and expressed concern that the 
world would be anxious about the future course of Japanese 
politics. 
  Hosokawa's resignation announcement sparked concern among 
Japanese diplomatic officials, especially with regard to Japan's 
relations with the U.S. since ties have soured following the 
collapse of trade negotiations at a meeting between Hosokawa and 
U.S. President Bill Clinton in February in Washington. 
  "We will pay close attention to how the U.S. Government 
reacts" to Hosokawa's resignation, a senior ministry official 
said. 
  The U.S. Government was said to have great expectations of 
the government, which emerged last August after nearly four 
decades of rule by the Liberal Democratic Party. Washington 
highly regarded the Hosokawa government as a promoter of 
political and economic reforms and Hosokawa himself had a 
trusting personal relationship with Clinton based on common 
experience and policy goals, according to ministry officials. 
  Although Hosokawa told a press conference he wants to 
support 
reform even after stepping down, there is no guarantee the U.S. 
will be satisfied with the efforts of Hosokawa's successor. 
  The officials saw next week's signing ceremony for a global 
trade accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) in Marrakech, Morocco, as a crucial opportunity to seek a 
breakthrough in resuming trade talks with Washington. Hata was 
expected to go to Marrakech and hold talks with U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor, but it is not yet clear whether he 
will go as scheduled as he is touted to be Hosokawa's successor. 
  Japan wants stable and firm relations with the U.S., 
particularly at present, given the suspicion that North Korea is 
developing nuclear weapons. North Korea has repeatedly said it 
wants to hold dialogue only with the U.S. and has refused to 
hold talks with Japan. 
  Although Hata said there will be no problem in coping with 
the issue even if the government changes, as Japanese 
administrations are consistent in continuing policies, 
cooperation among Japan, the U.S., South Korea and China is 
crucial to solving the problem. 
  Upcoming diplomatic events also included Hosokawa's planned 
trip to Europe in early May to meet the European leaders of the 
Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers. The ministry officials 
considered the trip essential to getting to know the leaders 
ahead of the G-7 summit meeting in July in Naples, Italy. 
  Hata was also scheduled to visit Middle East countries from 
late April to early May. 
  As for visitors to Japan from abroad, Deputy Foreign 
Ministry 
Spokesman Kishichiro Amae said the upcoming visit by Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak will go ahead as scheduled since it has 
already obtained cabinet approval.

<F P=106> [By Jocelyn Ford] </F>
  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's resignation announcement Friday may keep Japan-U.S. 
relations in the deep freeze just as a thaw seemed to be in the 
offing, political analysts said. 
  But some analysts said bilateral relations could take a new 
twist in the not too distant future, depending on who replaces 
Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa's resignation announcement amid allegations of 
financial misdeeds came a week before Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata was expected to call for early resumption of the stalled 
trade talks in a meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor. 
  The two were scheduled to meet at a multilateral ministerial 
meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 
Marrakesh, Morocco. 
  But Hata's name has emerged as a likely successor to 
Hosokawa. 
  "Everything will have to wait until after the formation of a 
new cabinet. We will have to make another fresh effort to 
explore ways to resume trade talks," said an official involved 
in Japan-U.S. trade relations. 
  While Japan is unlikely to change its support for a free 
world trading system or rethink its rejection of U.S. demands to 
introduce numerical indicators to guide trade, the next leader 
could take a different approach, the official said. 
  If leadership reverts to a more experienced politician, the 
old- style power structures could come back into play, namely 
collusive deal-making among politicians, bureaucrats and 
business that Hosokawa vowed to break, he said. 
  While this could make it easier for the United States to 
pressure Japan into delivering on demands, it could also slow 
down Hosokawa's efforts to free business from heavy-handed 
government controls -- a move also applauded by Washington. 
  The U.S. has been fumbling in its relations with Japan in 
part because it could not grasp the power structure of 
Hosokawa's seven- party coalition government, the first 
non-Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) government to rule in 38 
years, claimed Ikuo Kabashima, professor of Political Science at 
Tsukuba University. 
  If Hata, a close associate of Ichiro Ozawa, the key 
behind-the- scenes player in the coalition government, emerges 
as next prime minister, "the U.S. can feel comfortable because 
it knows it can deal with him," said Kabashima. 
  That has some bureaucrats worried. 
  Although Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton failed in 
February to come up with an agreement on contentious trade 
issues, some Japanese diplomats regard the breakdown in trade 
talks as an opportunity to establish a new style of working 
relationship. 
  "Ozawa likes the traditional type of management where he 
resolves friction by pressuring interest groups, and he is not 
the type of person who really pushes for market principles," 
said the government official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
  "If we go back to the traditional way it would not be 
instrumental in making a new partnership," he said. 
  But other sources here are confident that no new leader can 
reverse the legacy Hosokawa established during his brief 
eight-month stay in office. 
  Hosokawa, a former governor who rocketed to power last 
summer 
after the LDP lost its majority in the House of Representatives, 
leaves office with support ratings hovering around 50 percent. 
  While this is down over 20 percentage points from his early 
ratings, Hosokawa remains more popular than many of his LDP 
predecessors who were at the height of their careers. 
  Merle Okawara, vice president of the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Japan, lauded Hosokawa for ushering in many reforms 
that more experienced LDP prime ministers had failed to achieve. 
  "At least he got the machinery going in the right direction, 
which is good for U.S. businesses in Japan," she said, noting he 
partially liberalized the rice market, achieved political reform 
and was making headway on tax reforms. 
  Political reform had unseated Hosokawa's two immediate 
predecessors -- Kiichi Miyazawa and Toshiki Kaifu, both of the 
LDP. 
  Hosokawa said he was resigning because the budget was 
blocked 
in parliament by the opposition LDP, which demanded he respond 
to allegations over questionable handling of stock and real 
estate deals, not because the people wanted him to resign, said 
Okawara. 
  "The machinery is in place and whoever follows him will have 
to continue because otherwise he will be very unpopular," she 
said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The resignation of Japanese 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is unlikely to lead to a major 
change in Tokyo's economic ties with the United States, a senior 
trade ministry official said Friday. 
  However, Hosokawa's surprise announcement may set back the 
resumption of the stalled trade "framework" talks between Tokyo 
and Washington, said the official at the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, who declined to be named. 
  But he quickly added the fundamentals of the accord reached 
between the previous Japanese administration of Kiichi Miyazawa 
and U.S. President Bill Clinton last July to establish a new 
framework are still valid. 
  Hosokawa took over Miyazawa's trade policy toward the U.S. 
that rules out the use of numerical targets to measure the 
results of Japan's efforts to boost imports and the next prime 
minister is likely also to respect the policy, the MITI official 
said. 
  Although optimistic about the fundamental framework of 
Japan's economic ties with the U.S., the official confirmed that 
prospects for an early breakthrough in the bilateral trade talks 
have become clouded following the latest political developments 
surrounding Hosokawa. 
  Japan regarded the planned meeting between Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in 
Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15 as "the best opportunity" to 
open the way for resumption of the framework talks, the official 
said. 
  "But the situation is now completely fluid," the official 
said, noting it is "impossible to foresee developments still to 
unfold," including even whether or not Hata will go to Morocco. 
  Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a major 
coalition member, has been tipped as a candidate to succeed 
Hosokawa. 
  The premier's resignation also casts a shadow over Japan's 
pledge to announce concrete market-opening measures by the end 
of June or before the July summit of the seven major 
industrialized countries in Naples, the MITI official said. 
  It is too early to say whether a schedule change regarding 
the June market-opening package is necessary, but any prime 
minister replacing Hosokawa should have "a stronger power base" 
in order to get the framework talks rolling again, the official 
said. 
  The official said Hosokawa's successor would not likely 
"reverse the trend of deregulations" established by the Hosokawa 
administration.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Japan's trade minister on 
Friday [8 April] stressed the urgent need to create a new 
political framework to prevent a further stall in Japan-U.S. 
trade talks. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
called an emergency press conference after Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa offered his resignation earlier in the day. 
  "The situation surrounding Japan-U.S. ties requires urgent 
action," Kumagai said. "There is not much time left before 
June." 
  Japan pledged to show concrete market-opening plans in June 
or before the leaders of the world's seven major economies 
gather in Naples in July for their annual summit meeting. 
  Kumagai said he understands Hosokawa's resignation offer, 
saying the prime minister must have reached the decision as a 
way to take responsibility for his financial dealings which have 
paralyzed Diet discussion of the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Hosokawa's coalition government was formed with top priority 
on establishing high ethical standards for politicians, Kumagai 
said. 
  The trade minister said the Hosokawa administration has 
broken through many difficult problems its predecessor, the 
Liberal Democratic Party, was unable to handle, Kumagai said, 
citing political and administrative reforms, rice market 
opening, deregulations and tax reforms. 
  What Hosokawa achieved is worthy of being remembered in an 
historical context, Kumagai said. 
  Kumagai severely criticized the LDP for boycotting debate 
over this year's budget. "The LDP is committing a suicidal act 
that denies the fundamental function of the parliament," he said. 
  Kumagai said he is uncertain whether the planned meeting 
between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor in Morocco on April 15 will take 
place as scheduled. 
  The meeting was intended to seek a breakthrough in the 
stalled trade "framework" talks between Tokyo and Washington. 
  "Paving the way for resumption of the framework talks is 
something that should be taken care of by our cabinet but I 
don't know what will happen," Kumagai said. 
  Hata, the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a major 
coalition party, is tipped as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. 
  Concerning a government to succeed the Hosokawa 
administration, Kumagai said it should be formed after parties 
concerned agree at least on the controversial tax issue. 
  The current ruling coalition parties were sharply divided 
over how to finance tax cuts. This created political confusion 
earlier in the day that delayed formulation of the fiscal 1994 
budget.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Japan-U.S. trade talks will 
remain deadlocked due to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
announcement that he intends to resign, a high-ranking official 
of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Friday 
[8 April]. 
  "Though the bilateral trade framework talks are likely to 
resume between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor next week, the development will be 
unclear," said the official. 
  Hata is expected to meet Kantor in Marrakech, Morroco, next 
week at the signing ceremony for the global trade pact concluded 
in the Uruguay Round last December under the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade. 
  "I had believed Hosokawa may announce his intention to step 
down around weekend but today's sudden announcement is a 
betrayal against expectation of most Japanese," the official who 
asked not to be identified.

  [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Embattled Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa made a surprise announcement Friday [8 April] 
of his intention to resign because of controversy over personal 
financial deals and the resultant parliamentary paralysis 
crippling his eight-month-old administration. 
  Hosokawa's bombshell announcement prompted the seven 
coalition parties to scramble to the task of picking his 
successor. 
  Although Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean 
Government Party], key parties in the coalition, voiced support 
for Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata who 
leads Shinseito, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) expressed disaffection with the 
proposal. 
  The 56-year-old Hosokawa told a hurriedly-arranged news 
conference he had decided to give up the office of prime 
minister to take "moral and political responsibility" for a 
fresh financial scandal and the current stalemate of the Diet. 
  "A new problem has come to light. New suspicions emerged 
that my political office entrusted a certain person with 
managing my personal financial means, raking in profits for a 
few years since 1981," the premier said. 
  "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some 
illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked 
for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would 
definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said. 
  He said the new revelation came on top of controversy about 
100 million yen that Hosokawa described as a loan from a 
trucking company already at the center of a money-and-mob 
scandal. 
  The opposition camp held up Diet debate on the fiscal 1994 
fiscal budget, saying Hosokawa should first agree to the 
opposition demand to have his financial aide Masatoshi Miyama 
testify as a witness to clear up suspicions on the allegedly 
questionable finances. 
  Hosokawa officially offered his resignation at an emergency 
cabinet meeting after making a surprise announcement to a 
hastily summoned meeting of leaders of the coalition partners. 
  In a second get-together of the coalition leaders later in 
the day, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa insisted that 
the coalition parties first narrow the differences in their 
defense and diplomatic policies before making a decision on 
whether to maintain the current combination of parties. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a behind-the-scene 
strategist, Japan New Party leader Masuo Matsuoka and DSP 
Secretary General Takashi Yonezawa threw their weight behind the 
Komeito proposal, while the Socialists vehemently opposed it. 
  The coalition leaders only agreed to resume discussion 
Saturday afternoon, coalition officials said. 
  Political analysts pointed to the possibility that the 
coalition might try to form a new coalition by integrating some 
legislators from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
even at the risk of alienating the SDP. 
  However, the LDP quickly vowed to block any attempts by the 
coalition to win over its legislators and instead to establish a 
new coalition government led by itself. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The No. 1 opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party vowed Friday [8 April] to topple the 
current ruling coalition of Prime Minister Horihiro Hosokawa and 
establish a new coalition government led by itself. 
  "The Liberal Democratic Party is determined, as a 
responsible 
party, to act with unity and solidarity to establish a 
government that can meet public expectations," LDP President 
Yohei Kono said in a prepared statement. 
  "Japan now faces a mountain of problems that cannot be 
solved 
by the current ruling coalition consisting of political parties 
with conflicting policies," Kono said. 
  He made the remarks following emergency meetings of the 
LDP's 
top five executives and then of former prime ministers at the 
very moment when coalition partners were moving to pick a 
successor to Hosokawa from among their ranks. 
  In a related development, Kono quickly persuaded former 
Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe not to take any action 
that might trigger an intraparty schism, LDP officials said. 
  Instead, the two agreed to act in solidarity to deal with 
developments in the political community following the imminent 
demise of the Hosokawa administration, they said. 
  Watanabe, a former foreign minister, has been deemed one of 
the most promising candidates to succeed Hosokawa if he would 
break with the LDP and opt to form an alliance with the ruling 
parties. 
  Minutes after Hosokawa expressed his intention to step down, 
Watanabe, chief of the LDP's second-largest faction, suggested 
he is ready to form an alliance with the ruling coalition. 
  "Japan is in a crisis," he said. "We should join forces with 
people that have the same ideas to surmount the crisis." 
  However, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone moved 
quickly to block a possible second breakup of the LDP, which 
suffered defections by dozens of legislators last June. 
  "Do not take action at this moment," Nakasone was quoted by 
party officials as telling Watanabe. "Adopt a wait-and-see 
attitude with steadfast confidence." 
  Meanwhile, the LDP's top five executives decided to create a 
new administration free from payoff scandals if the LDP once 
again sweeps to power, the officials said. 
  The LDP was stripped of its 38-year lock on power last 
summer 
amid public outrage over a string of bribery scandals, one of 
which seemed to demonstrate the party executives' link with 
gangsters. 
  The executives also decided not to allow the ruling 
coalition 
to pick a new premier from among their own ranks, while closely 
monitoring moves to be taken by the ruling parties, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata brushed aside suggestions Friday [8 April] that he become 
the next prime minister in the wake of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's announcement that he will resign. 
  Hata, who concurrently serves as the deputy prime minister, 
told a hastily arranged press conference at the Foreign Ministry 
that he considers it important to play the role of making 
adjustments within the coalition government rather than becoming 
the next prime minister. 
  Hata also indicated he may go ahead with his planned trip to 
Marrakech, Morocco, next week to attend the signing ceremony of 
a global trade accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT). 
  Since Hosokawa instructed cabinet ministers to fulfill their 
duties until the end, his scheduled trip to Marrakesh has not 
been totally scrapped, Hata said. 
  As for Hosokawa's successor, Hata said he wants the person 
to 
be someone who has the "same ambition to further promote 
reforms" and who wants to create a more stable government. 
  Turning to the possible effects the latest development would 
give to international affairs, Hata said it would give negative 
influence not only on Japan-U.S. relations, which has been sour 
over trade disputes, but on the rest of the world. 
  He said it would give the world anxiety concerning Japanese 
politics so that it is important to stabilize the government as 
early as possible. 
  He also said Japan should explain about the course of 
Japanese politics at the Marrakech meeting. 
  "Japan has become a country which could influence various 
countries," Hata said. "So there should not be a delay in 
politics not even for a day." 
  Hata, who was expected to meet U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, said he thinks it possible 
to hold "frank" discussions with Kantor since Japan's 
determination to promote free trade and to make efforts to make 
a more open market remains unchanged no matter how the domestic 
political situation is. 
  "There aren't many options concerning what Japan can do," he 
said. 
  The foreign minister also indicated there will be no problem 
in dealing with the problems involving North Korea's alleged 
development of nuclear weapons because the Japanese 
administration has the consistency and continuity of policies. 
  Hata, also the leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] 
which broke away from the Liberal Democratic Party, said he told 
an extraordinary cabinet meeting that he wants Hosokawa to stick 
to the post. 
  But Hata said he cannot dissuade Hosokawa because he has 
already officially announced his intention to step down. 
  He described Friday's development as one of the 
"aftershocks" 
from a major "diastrophism" last June, when Shinseito split from 
the LDP, which led to the birth of the coalition government, 
indicating that it may be a chance toward a major reorganization 
of the political world. 
  He reiterated the need to create two stable political 
forces, 
saying the coalition government of seven parties had difficulty 
in making a single decision.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei 
Kono said Friday [8 April] that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
is resigning because of his responsibility for the monthlong 
stalemate in the Diet's budget business. 
  "Diet business has been at a total halt, for which his 
responsibility is considerable. It apparently led to his 
intention to resign," said Kono, president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP). 
  Kono did not say whether the LDP will now aim to take over 
power. The LDP surrendered its 38-year grip on power to the 
seven-party coalition led by Hosokawa in August last year. 
  "I am now anxious about the life of the people," Kono said, 
adding that the LDP wants to deal with the situation responsibly. 
  Following Hosokawa's remarks that he intends to resign, Kono 
called senior LDP officials for a meeting at the LDP 
headquarters in Tokyo. 
  Fiscal 1994 budget bills were submitted to the Diet in early 
March, but the Diet has not been able to begin deliberations for 
over a month because of wrangling between the ruling coalition 
and the opposition camp over Hosokawa's alleged shady 
fund-raising. 
  Hosokawa rejected the demand by the LDP to summon as a 
witness his former aide, who was in charge of Hosokawa's 
finances when he borrowed 100 million yen from Sagawa Kyubin, a 
scandal-tainted trucking business group. 
  Top LDP officials refused to take part in the budget 
committee debate unless the seven-party coalition promised to 
bring the witness before the Diet. 
  Sadatoshi Ozato, the LDP's Diet Affairs Committee chairman, 
called Hosokawa's resignation an "ultimate decision." 
  "His resignation has been expected, but it is too early," 
Ozato said. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori canceled his scheduled 
trip to Kyoto aimed at supporting an LDP-backed candidate for 
the Kyoto gubernatorial election. 
  Mori said Hosokawa will resign because he could not answer 
the allegations over his funds. 
  Earlier in the day, Hosokawa suddenly summoned the leaders 
of 
the coalition partners to his official residence and told them 
he intends to resign. 
  Hosokawa said he bears responsibility for the row between 
the 
ruling coalition and the opposition camp over his loans from 
Sagawa Kyubin.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's abrupt decision to resign took the business community 
by surprise Friday [8 April], drawing words of regret from many 
business leaders while raising worries of a political vacuum. 
  "It's very regrettable because he has set a new current in 
politics," said Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co. 
  Many executives gave high marks to Hosokawa's political 
achievements since he took office eight months ago. 
  "He set out to relax regulations in order to promote 
administrative reform," said Toshiomi Uragami, chairman of the 
Life Insurance Association of Japan. 
  "I believe many people are disappointed because there were 
high expectations of fiscal and administrative reforms from now 
on," said Kenji Maeda, chairman of the Japan Federation of 
Construction Contractors. 
  But Tadahiro Sekimoto, president of NEC Corp., criticized 
Hosokawa for evading responsibility for bringing the economy 
back to health. 
  "It's not a responsible act to resign now that there is the 
need to secure economic recovery," Sekimoto said. 
  Many business leaders voiced concern about a political 
vacuum 
that could dampen a budding economic recovery and appealed for 
early Diet passage of the fiscal 1994 budget and an early setup 
of a new cabinet. 
  "We hope a new government will be established quickly," said 
Hiroshi Saito, chairman of the Japan Iron and Steel Federation. 
  Hosokawa offered to resign earlier in the day to take 
responsibility for a Diet stalemate in the wake of allegations 
of corruption over his loan from a scandal-ridden parcel 
delivery company. 
  None of the business people commenting on the resignation 
called for pursuing the corruption allegations.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- The "new suspicions" that 
prompted Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to announce his 
decision to resign concern "shady loans" made using 60 million 
yen of Hosokawa's own personal funds, informed sources said 
Friday [8 April]. 
  The allegedly illegal loans were made by a person close to 
the late Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to whom Hosokawa lent the 
60 million yen, the sources said. 
  The person in turn lent the money from Hosokawa to other 
people in a manner that may have violated a law governing the 
legal qualifications for making such loans, they told Kyodo News 
Service. 
  "There is the likelihood that the Hosokawa side entrusted 
the 
60 million yen to a person well versed in financial asset 
management who was close to former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka 
and then the person made the shady loans using the money," a 
source said. 
  Hosokawa told a news conference Friday at which he made a 
bombshell announcement of his intention to resign, "A new 
problem has come to light. New suspicions have emerged that my 
political office entrusted a certain person with managing my 
personal financial means, raking in profits for a few years 
since 1981." 
  "The suspicion is that his management may have involved some 
illegalities, although the person, who is my old friend, asked 
for permission to manage my personal money, saying it would 
definitely be invested in a profitable manner," he said. 
  However, he declined to elaborate further on the specifics 
of 
the new suspicions, saying the investigation by his political 
office was still under way. 
  The sources said Hosokawa and two of his relatives obtained 
"some 400 million yen" from the 1982 sale of the Tekigaiso 
estate of the wife of Hosokawa's grandfather, former Prime 
Minister Fumimaro Konoe. 
  Hosokawa and the two relatives, including his younger 
brother, Tadateru Konoe, decided to sell part of the Konoe 
estate in March 1982 after the three inherited the estate 
following the death of their grandmother Chiyoko Konoe in 
September 1980, they said. 
  Hosokawa received some 202 million yen as his portion of the 
400 million yen sale, the sources said. 
  After paying inheritance taxes, Hosokawa received 186 
million 
yen and placed it in a personal savings account. 
  Hosokawa then lent 64 million yen out of the money to one of 
his political funds-raising organizations, while setting aside 
the remaining 100 million yen as reserve funds from which he 
planned to pay the income tax on the profits from the land sale, 
they said. 
  However, Hosokawa spent 77 million yen out of the 100 
million 
yen to purchase a condominium in Tokyo's Moto-azabu [district] 
in July 1982, they said. 
  After Hosokawa received 100 million yen from the Sagawa 
Kyubin trucking group firm in late 1982, he made up the 77 
million yen in order to return his tax payment reserve fund to 
the original 100 million yen level, they said. 
  In March 1983, Hosokawa paid some 40 million yen in income 
taxes on the sale of the estate and turned the remaining 60 
million yen over to the person close to Tanaka in order to 
profit from the person's asset management, the sources said. 
  "I think Prime Minister Hosokawa developed anxieties that 
the 
financial management of his personal funds by this person might 
have violated the law regarding the qualifications of persons 
allowed to lend money to others," one of the sources said. 
  In 1982, Hosokawa was a member of the Tanaka faction in the 
House of Councillors. The following year, with Tanaka's 
backing, Hosokawa ran a successful campaign to become governor 
in Kumamoto Prefecture.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The governing coalition 
parties kicked off debate Friday on a possible successor to 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "The timing of the mass resignation of the Hosokawa cabinet 
will be set after our candidate to replace him is decided and 
elected as premier at the House of Representatives plenary 
session," Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), told a news conference. 
  The No. 2 man of the largest coalition contingent also 
revealed that the ruling coalition leaders decided at a Friday 
evening meeting to further coordinate their basic policies 
before launching a new government. 
  While basically agreeing to form a fresh government under 
the 
framework of the current coalition, the coalition leaders also 
agreed on the need to narrow down differences over their basic 
policies in order to push for new reforms, Kubo said. 
  "Now that we are entering a second phase of the coalition 
government, it is necessary for us to reach a fresh accord on 
our basic policies," he said. 
  Inaugurated last August as a "political reform 
administration," the Hosokawa government almost succeeded in 
seeing through political reform aimed at weeding out rampant 
political corruption in Japan. 
  Hosokawa, who heads a seven-party coalition government, 
announced earlier Friday he will step down in taking political 
and moral responsibility for his allegedly shady finacial 
dealings. 
  The 56-year-old premier, a scion of a distinguished Samurai 
family in southwestern Japan, swept into power as a standard 
bearer of various reforms, including reform intended to 
transform the scandal-prone Japanese political system. 
  The leaders of the ruling parties will resume talks on the 
selection of a candidate for the premiership on Saturday 
afternoon, Kubo said. 
  Kubo spoke of the need for the coalition to choose a 
successor to Hosokawa and form a new government as quickly as 
possible so as to win Diet approval for the budget for fiscal 
1994, which started April 1. 
  It is widely believed among coalition members that Deputy 
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is the best 
candidate to succeed Hosokawa. 
  But some are cautious about the idea of Hata becoming the 
next premier, because he is the leader of Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party), a major component of the coalition. 
  Shinseito, along with Komeito, has been criticized within 
the 
coalition for its allegedly forceful manner in the policy-making 
process. 
  Kubo said SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama is also a potential 
candidate to succeed Hosokawa as he heads the biggest force in 
the coalition. 
  "Our party chairman is qualified for the job," he said. 
  Questioned about the possibility of the current coalition 
joining hands with the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), Kubo said only, "I don't think there is any party and 
political group contemplating a tie-up with the LDP." 
  The once-dominant LDP lost the reins of government last 
August after a 38-year uninterrupted lock on power. It has 
refused to participate in Diet budget debate until Hosokawa 
clears himself of allegations about his personal finances.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, hounded by a controversy over his financial deals and 
a stalemate in the Diet, announced Friday [8 April] he is 
stepping down to take responsibility for the current political 
confusion. 
  Hosokawa officially offered his resignation to an emergency 
cabinet meeting after he made a surprise announcement to the 
hastily summoned leaders of the coalition partners, coalition 
officials said. 
  Hosokawa, explaining his decision to the coalition leaders, 
cited the stymied Diet business due to scandal charges over his 
two dubious financial deals. 
  He also said a new problem has been uncovered about his 
personal financial management. He did not specify the issue. 
  It is not known when the cabinet will resign en bloc, the 
officials said. 
  Hosokawa, who was swept to power last August with a vow to 
clean up corruption, has been under attack over a shady loan 
from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm, 
and the purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
[NTT] Corp., a telecommunications giant. 
  The row over the deals have led to a stalemate in 
parliament, 
paralyzing the deliberations on the budget for fiscal 1994, 
which started April 1. 
  Hosokawa's public approval rate, which hit 70 percent 
immediately after he took the helm, has been plummeting in 
recent weeks, according to various media surveys. 
  Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and foreign minister, is 
viewed among many coalition members as the most plausible 
candidate to succeed Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa made the announcement only two days after a media 
frenzy over reports on his joking about quitting, which Hosokawa 
strongly denied. 
  The dogging corruption charges concerning the financial deal 
makings have taken a heavy toll on Hosokawa's public support and 
undermined his already-shaky leadership in the seven-party 
coalition, political sources said. 
  Hosokawa reiterated at a meeting with the coalition leaders 
that he repaid the 100 million yen loan in 1982 from Sagawa and 
dismissed any corruption charges over an NTT share purchase, 
which the premier has claimed was a deal by his late 
father-in-law. 
  But he said he should take the responsibility for the 
current 
Diet turmoil that has been caused by his personal affairs. 
  The opposition Liberal Democratic Party has been boycotting 
the debates at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, 
demanding a Diet testimony of Hosokawa's former aide, who was in 
charge of his financial affairs when he borrowed the money from 
Sagawa. 
  Revelations that Sagawa was at the center of a 
money-and-mobster scandal involving some LDP members helped 
topple the party from power after nearly four decades of 
often-corrupt rule, and paved the way for Hosokawa's alliance of 
conservative LDP splinter groups and traditional opposition 
parties like the Social Democratic Party (SDP). 
  Pursuing his avowed goal of cleansing the nation's politics 
of corruption, Hosokawa pushed through a political reform 
package in January that replaces multiseat districts with a 
combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional 
representation seats. 
  But his political standing was weakened after he was forced 
by strong opposition from within his own coalition to withdraw 
his announced plan to introduce a new value-added tax to replace 
the current consumption tax. 
  Recent corruption allegations came on top of the tax fiasco 
and an aborted plan for a cabinet reshuffle, which widened the 
hiatus between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura. 
  Hosokawa's announcement Friday took both coalition partners 
and the opposition camp by surprise although speculation has 
been rife over his resignation. 
  Foreign Minister Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan Renewal 
Party), told reporters he had heard nothing about Hosokawa's 
intention. 
  Asked if he was surprised, Hata said, ''of course.'' 
  Michio Watanabe of the LDP, a former foreign minister, said 
he was surprised at the prime minister's abrupt decision. 
  Coalition leaders are still uncertain about the issue of 
Hosokawa's successor, but some Shinseito officials mentioned 
Hata. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said the coalition partners 
will immediately start discussing a replacement to avoid any 
political vacuum. 
  Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive in charge of election 
affairs, said he favors Hata as the person to succeed Hosokawa. 
  "It is a natural course for our party to seek Hata's 
premiership," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The ruling parties will not 
agree on naming Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as a new prime 
minister, the head of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), said 
Friday. 
  DSP Chairman Ouchi Keigo said, "the cabinet should not be 
formed upon the initiative" of Ichiro Ozawa and Yuichiro 
Ichikawa, major strategists in the coalition. 
  Ozawa is secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] 
led by Hata and Ichikawa is secretary general of Komeito, a 
Buddhist-backed party in the coalition. 
  Ouchi said placing Hata as successor to Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his intention to resign, will 
stem objection within the coalition as such a decision would be 
made upon Shinseito's leadership.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [of Japan, SDPJ], the largest group in the coalition, will 
accept a consensus among ruling parties on who should succeed 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, party head said Friday. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met reporters shortly after 
Hosokawa announced he would step down. 
  The SDP differs from Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], 
another 
powerful party in the coalition, over major policies including 
defense and tax. 
  However, asked what the SDP would do if Shinseito leader 
Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, is named as new premier, 
Murayama said that if the coalition parties' representatives 
agree, "we will cooperate with the agreement." 
  A meeting of representatives is currently under way. 
  Asked whether the SDP would object to a prime minister from 
Shinseito, Murayama said the most important thing now is to form 
a government that can deal with the nation's domestic and 
foreign problems. 
  "An agreement will not be made if each party sticks to its 
own opinion," he said. 
  Murayama also said the coalition government should not 
change 
its current seven-party structure. 
  Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member and former Economic 
Planning Agency chief, said the party would push for Hata as the 
next premier. 
  Funada also said there may be some regrouping in the ruling 
coalition, apparently referring to rumors that former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe, a member of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, may join the cabinet.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, beset by dogging corruption charges over his financial 
deals and a Diet stalemate, said Friday [8 April] he will step 
down to take "moral" responsibility for the political turmoil. 
  Hosokawa said he will bow out after only eight months in 
office because personal affairs have stymied Diet business, 
saying it is a problem concerning "morality of politics." 
  Hosokawa officially offered his resignation at an emergency 
cabinet meeting after making a surprise announcement to a 
hastily summoned meeting of leaders of the coalition partners, 
coalition officials said. 
  He told a press conference that fresh revelations about 
"legally suspicious" financial dealings involving his private 
office prompted him to make the decision. 
  The new revelations came to his attention Thursday night, 
the 
premier said. 
  Hosokawa said the new allegations include receiving interest 
on a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a scandal-tainted 
trucking business group, as political contributions and gaining 
profits from dealings using political donations. 
  It is not yet decided when the cabinet will resign en bloc, 
the officials said. 
  Hosokawa, who was swept to power last August with a vow to 
cleanse the nation's political scene of corruption, has come 
under attack over a controversial loan from Sagawa Kyubin and 
another financial deal related with the purchase of shares in 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). 
  The row over the dealings has led to a stalemate in 
parliament, paralyzing deliberations on the budget for fiscal 
1994, which started on April 1. 
  Hosokawa's public support, which was at over 70 percent 
immediately after he took office, has been on a steady decline 
in recent weeks. 
  Hosokawa's announcement has sent coalition leaders 
scrambling 
to find his successor and prompted some members of the 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to utter interest in 
taking part in the new cabinet. 
  Some coalition kingpins mentioned the name of Tsutomu Hata, 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, who heads Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party]. 
  Hajime Funada, a Shinseito executive in charge of election 
affairs, said he favors Hata as the person to succeed Hosokawa. 
  "It is a natural course for our party to seek Hata's 
premiership," Funada said. 
  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa also supported the 
idea. 
  "I think Hata is acceptable (as the new premier)," he said. 
  Michio Watanabe of the opposition LDP, a former foreign 
minister, hinted at a possible alliance with the ruling 
coalition. 
  "Japan is in a crisis," he said. "We should join forces with 
the people that have the same idea to surmount the crisis." 
  Koji Omi, another LDP policy-maker, said, "it is an 
emergency. We should establish the conditions to cope with the 
situation through nonpartisan efforts." 
  Hosokawa's bombshell announcement came only two days after 
he 
strongly denied news reports that he jokingly said he wanted to 
quit. 
  The unabatable corruption charges concerning the two 
financial deals have taken a heavy toll on his public support 
and undermined his already-shaky leadership in the seven-party 
coalition. 
  Hosokawa reiterated that he repaid the 100 million yen loan 
in 1982 from Sagawa and dismissed any corruption charges over 
the NTT share purchase, which he has claimed was conducted by 
his late father-in-law. 
  The LDP has been boycotting debate in the House of 
Representatives Budget Committee, demanding Diet testimony of 
Hosokawa's former aide over the Sagawa loan issue. Hosokawa has 
rejected the demand. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono said Hosokawa's responsibility for 
the Diet stalemate is "heavy." 
  Some coalition members dismissed the possibility of linking 
up with the LDP. 
  Shusei Tanaka, a senior policy maker of new party Sakigake 
[Harbinger], said, "there is no chance that the coalition will 
contribute to an LDP government or lend a hand to the LDP under 
current conditions." 
  The Sagawa scandal helped topple the LDP from power after 
nearly four decades of often corrupt rule, and paved the way for 
Hosokawa's alliance of conservative LDP splinter groups and 
traditional opposition parties like the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP). 
  In pursuing his avowed goal of cleaning up Japan's political 
system, Hosokawa pushed through a political reform package in 
January that replaces multiseat districts with a combination of 
single-seat constituencies and proportional representation seats 
for the lower house. 
  But his political standing weakened markedly after he was 
forced in February by strong opposition from within his own 
coalition to withdraw his announced plan to introduce a new 
value-added tax to replace the current consumption tax. 
  Recent corruption allegations came on top of the tax fiasco 
and an aborted plan for a cabinet reshuffle, which widened the 
hiatus between Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi 
Takemura.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], a powerful party in the coalition government, hopes to 
push to replace Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with its own 
leader, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, a senior party official 
said Friday [8 April]. 
  Hajime Funada, a senior Shinseito member and former Economic 
Planning Agency chief, said the party would push for Hata as the 
next premier, but added, "there is the question on how we should 
go about this with the current coalition framework. It is a 
delicate matter in finding a balance." 
  He also said there may be some regrouping in the ruling 
coalition, apparently referring to rumors that former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe, a member of the opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party, may join the cabinet. 
  Funada was speaking to reporters at a press conference after 
an emergency meeting of executive members of Shinseito. 
  At the gathering, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito who is considered to be the coalition's top 
strategist, said, "we have to be as quick as possible in 
electing a new prime minister to succeed our goals...so as not 
to frustrate the reform process." 
  Hosokawa announced earlier in the day that he would step 
down 
and an emergency cabinet meeting later accepted his decision to 
resign.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Kazakh President Nursultan 
Nazarbayev warned Friday [8 April] that some leading Russian 
politicians' attempts to stir up nationalistic sentiments among 
Russians residing in Kazakhstan and other former Soviet 
republics may trigger an exodus of refugees. 
  "If Russians, Ukrainians and Germans residing in Kazakhstan 
took Russian politicians' campaigns at face value and opted to 
move to Russia or other areas, they would plunge into a more 
severe situation than now," Nazarbayev said. 
  "Although such an exodus has not yet begun, my biggest 
anxiety comes from this issue," Nazarbayev told the Japan 
National Press Club on the final day of his four-day visit to 
Japan. 
  At present, some 5 million Russians, or more than a quarter 
of Kazakhstan's population, reside in the country which has a 
population of 17 million. Germans and Ukrainians each account 
for some 5 percent of the populace. Under the 19-century 
colonial policy of Czarist Russia, Russians were ordered to move 
to the central Asian country. 
  Nazarbayev accused Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
and other politicians of having tried to rekindle Russian 
nationalist sentiments in a bid to lure Russian voters during 
1993 parliamentary election campaigns. 
  Kozyrev said last November 22 -- three weeks before the 
parliamentary vote -- that Moscow would "protect the Russian 
population and Russia's interests in a tough manner, wherever it 
is needed and whoever is concerned, even if it (concerns) our 
friends." 
  "The treatment of official Russian representatives, 
servicemen and our compatriots on the territory of any state, be 
it near or far abroad, is the litmus paper on which good 
neighborly relations with any state will be tested," Kozyrev 
said. 
  Nazarbayev told the press conference, "these Russian 
politicians tried to draw strength from the theme of the 
interests of 'Russia' in view of the December 11 parliamentary 
election." 
  Nazarbayev said there is no rationale for any calls for an 
exodus of Russians from Kazakhstan, as the Kazakh Government has 
taken a "policy of providing free plots of land to enable all 
residents to build homes and plow fields," whatever ethnic group 
they may belong to. 
  Nazarbayev refused to comment on press reports that Russia 
and the former Soviet Union bought U.S. security secrets from 
alleged U.S. Central Intelligence Agency turncoat Aldrich Ames

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- The government moved Friday 
[8 April] to minimize the possible damage to the economy of 
planned hikes in utility and other public service charges by 
adopting what it called a set of "basic policies" on the 
proposed increases. 
  Key cabinet members agreed that the suggested hikes in 
telephone, taxi, medicine and many other public service charges 
should be permitted if they are "really inevitable" and only 
after due consideration is paid to their possible impact on the 
economy. The timing and scale of such hikes should be 
determined so they will not hurt the economy, the ministers said. 
  They also agreed that the charges should be raised on 
condition that services operators implement thorough 
restructuring in the future, officials said. 
  The meeting brought together Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, and other related 
government officials. 
  It came as public concern mounted over a string of proposed 
hikes of charges for public services that some critics say will 
erode the benefits of the government's planned tax cuts and 
hamper the recovery of the economy. 
  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), for instance, 
has 
applied for government permission to raise the basic rate it 
charges telephone owners by an average 18 percent, as well as 
hiking its directory inquiries rates. 
  The planned rate hikes run against the Hosokawa government's 
much-touted policy of paying greater attention to consumers' 
interests. 
  The cabinet ministers stressed the need to bring Japan's 
public services rates into line with those of other countries, 
which are generally lower, officials said. 
  They said the ministers also agreed that the "basic 
policies" 
should be complied with when local governments give permission 
to raise bus fares and other public services charges in their 
areas.

  [Text] HANOI, April 7 (AFP) -- Swedish Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt accused Hanoi Thursday of being "unduly slow" in improving 
its human rights situation, following what he indicated were 
difficult talks on the issue with Vietnamese officials. 
  "We have to use that phrase `a frank and open discussion' on 
this matter," Bildt told a press conference here using the 
diplomatic euphemism for a strong disagreement. 
  Bildt said he had told Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet that 
"dialogue with Vietnam on human rights was making unduly slow 
progress" and urged him to look again at a number of cases 
raised by Sweden. 
  "He said he would do this, but it remains to be seen if it 
has any effects," Bildt said, adding that Sweden would "stand 
firm on the issue". 
  Bildt is the first Swedish premier to visit Vietnam despite 
close links between the two countries, which established 
diplomatic relations in 1969, long before most Western nations 
did so. 
  His visit has focused on "broadening a relationship based on 
aid" and moving it towards trade and investment, he said. 
  Sweden -- which has given a total of 1.2 billion US dollars 
in aid to Vietnam -- would no longer hand over large sums of 
money and then decide how it was to be used, but would instead 
target areas that would help the country's economic reforms, he 
said. 
  Mistakes had been made in Sweden's aid policies in Vietnam, 
Bildt said. The Swedish-funded Bai Bang paper mill northwest of 
Hanoi has become a development white elephant, draining away 450 
million dollars and only running at a fraction of its capacity. 
  "Some of the countries around the world that have received 
the most economic assistance have faired the worst," Bildt said, 
while many countries that had received no aid "had achieved 
spectacular economic and social results". 
  "There is no reason whatsoever why Vietnam, given the right 
policies, should not be able to achieve what other nations in 
the region have managed to achieve," the fervently 
free-marketeer premier said. 
  Bildt said he believed he was witnessing "what might come to 
be called the start of the real Vietamese revolution." 
  Dismissing a suggestion that Vietnam might be disappointed 
by 
his stand after years of almost unconditional support from the 
Scandanavian nation, Bildt said he wanted to build ties based on 
business and economic cooperation. 
  "There was a time when countries signed communiques and 
pledged eternal friendship but it doesn't work that way in the 
modern world," he said. 
  Sweden has been slow to capitalise on its position here, 
ranking 17th among international investors, with projects worth 
60 million US dollars. Trade has been minimal, reaching only 10 
million US dollars last year. 
  Bildt, who visited Ho Chi Minh City before arriving in 
Hanoi, 
held talks with several other officials including President Le 
Duc Anh and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. 
  He is to leave for Hong Kong Friday on the last stop of an 
Asian tour that has taken in Singapore and Malaysia.

Wednesday.

minister, State President Le Duc Anh reaffirmed that Vietnamese 
state and people have fully supported the struggle of the 
Palestinian people for the establishment of an independent and 
sovereign state of Palestine on its territory.

Cam, and the Palestinian counterpart condemned the recent 
massacre of Palestinians in Hebron by the Israeli extremists, 
considering it an obstacle to the peace process in the Middle 
East.

  [Text] Ho Chi Minh City, April 6 KYODO -- Business leaders 
from Japan and Vietnam differed on ways to promote Japan's 
direct investment in Vietnam as they opened a joint economic 
session Wednesday [6 April], conference sources said. 
  The sources said the Vietnamese side urged Japan to 
accelerate direct investment in the country to help promote its 
economic development. 
  The Japanese delegation took a cautious stance on the issue, 
seeking Hanoi to consolidate legal and infrastructural measures 
to promote the inflow of Japanese capital, they said. 
  The Japanese panel expressed disappointment at slow progress 
in improvement particularly in electric power, transportation 
and communications industries, and the double pricing system for 
public utilities rates, the sources said. 
  The conference, the second session of a joint Japan-Vietnam 
economic conference, drew attention as it took place amid the 
changing international situation in favor of Vietnam, such as 
resumption of aid by international financial institutions and 
the lifting of economic sanctions by the United States, they 
said. 
  The 117-member Japanese delegation consists of 
representatives from about 60 major corporations. The 
Vietnamese panel was led by Vice Premier Tran Duc Luong.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia will pay an 
official visit to Vietnam shortly. This event is taking place 
nine months after the visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime 
Minister Vo Van Kiet. Here is our comment on the event: 
  The visit to Australia by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet in last year is considered a historic event in bilateral 
relations and so it will be the coming visit to Vietnam by 
Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating. [sentence as heard] 
  These significant events taken place in less than a year 
prove that relations between Vietnam and Australia have reached 
a turning point in cooperation for mutual benefit. 
  During the last two years, the relations between the two 
countries have seen wonderful developments. In 1992, the trade 
turnover between the two countries was less than $2 million and 
the figure is 120 times now, reaching $252 million. At present, 
Australia is the sixth biggest investor in Vietnam with 23 
projects worth $2.65 billion. However, leaders of the two 
countries will wish to further develop bilateral cooperation, 
especially in trade. These wishes are likely to be achieved. 
  On his visit to Australia last year, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet reaffirmed that the Vietnamese Government welcomes and will 
create favorable conditions for Australian companies wishing to 
do business with Vietnam. 
  For his part, the Australian prime minister also affirmed 
that his country is ready to help Vietnam in transport, 
telecommunications, infrastructure, energy, and (?oil and gas) 
exploration. 
  It is expected that there will be new and positive decisions 
made during the coming visit to Vietnam by the Australian prime 
minister to make the bilateral cooperation and relationship more 
fruitful.

<F P=106> [Second installment of the "basic content" of the Hanoi </F>
20-25 January Midterm Party National Conference Resolution] 
  [Text] 4. To what dangers did the political report refer? 
  There are four dangers: 
  -- The most outstanding danger is the possibility of being 
left further behind economically. We are already behind when 
compared to our neighbor countries. We will be left further 
behind if we do not perform well in leadership, management and 
in many other tasks. This could lead to lagging economic 
development, low efficiency, and backward industry. This will 
make our life more difficult, jeopardize political stability, 
and limit our ability to consolidate national defense and 
security. 
  -- The risk of being disoriented from socialism will happen 
if we are not able to overcome the deviations in the lines and 
policies as well as in the implementation of those policies and 
lines. 
  The aforesaid achievements proved that we basically have 
been 
moving in the right direction. At the same time we have 
nurtured many deviations that are not acceptable in socialism. 
  On the ideology front, the struggle against misguided and 
hostile viewpoints is slow and shows a lack of profound 
awareness about the dark scheme and sabotage activities of 
hostile forces, which are aimed at scrapping the party and 
socialism. A low level of vigilance prevails. Deviations from 
socialism have led to the birth of straying trends denying the 
revolutionary achievements on culture and literature and arts, 
claiming that literature and arts should be separate from the 
political lines of the party. 
  In the economic context, the state-managed and the 
cooperative economic sectors are slow to renovate and 
consolidate. The state-managed economic sector has not played 
well its leadership role in both production and distribution. 
In many localities, cadres do not exercise thrift to save more 
for national construction, thus causing big losses and waste to 
the state and collective properties. 
  We have to do our utmost to avoid this danger, not only at 
the level of grassroots management, but also at the levels of 
policy making and orientation. Errors made in the phases of 
guiding or steering the implementation of lines and policies may 
lead to wrong lines and policies. 
  -- The danger of corruption and authoritarianism. Corruption 
has become a national disaster, a hot and urgent issue that is 
wearing down our people's confidence. 
  Authoritarianism makes the party and state distant from the 
people. It can produce actions that run counter to the 
interests and aspirations of the people thus damaging the trust 
of people in the party and state. 
  -- The plots and activities of "peaceful evolution" 
initiated 
by hostile forces constitute a major and serious danger. To 
prevent and counter "peaceful evolution," we have to fight this 
violent subversion plot, which is a class struggle, a struggle 
between capitalism and socialism at a very complicated and 
decisive stage. This struggle has a vital meaning to the 
survival of our party and political regime, and to the 
independence of our country. 
  The four dangers have, between themselves, inter-related and 
dialectical relations. Successful suppression of one danger 
will limit the development of the others, and vice versa. The 
danger of "peaceful evolution" has effected, and is effecting 
vigorously internal dangers. Elimination of internal dangers 
means the failure of the "peaceful evolution" plot of hostile 
forces. 
  We will firmly grab our opportunity to develop advantages 
and 
strength. We are capable and we will repel all four dangers 
  5. What is the background of our achievements? 
  The party midterm national conference has affirmed that the 
most basic, vital reason for our achievements is our party's 
determination to maintain a leadership role, reject pluralism 
and a multiparty system, safeguard our independence, and 
innovatively set up lines and policies that suit the rules and 
realities of Vietnam. This will successfully motivate the 
comprehensive strength of the national unity bloc and expand 
international cooperation. 
  Our party is a party of the worker class, the representative 
for the interests of the worker class, the laborers, and the 
people as a whole. This reality has been proved through the 
great victories scored by our people under the leadership of the 
party. Taking advantage of the current complicated situation in 
the world, the reactionaries, those hostile forces attacking us, 
are attempting to overthrow our regime in various ways. The 
most dangerous of them is the call for pluralism, a multiparty 
political system, and the legitimization of the opposition and 
reactionary forces. Realities in other socialist countries 
showed that the practice of pluralism and multiparty system is 
the prelude to a loss of leadership by communist parties, to the 
fall of people's governments, to the demise of social order, and 
to the growth of ethnic hatred and a difficult life for people. 
  In order to obtain further successes in our renovation, our 
party has to continue to develop Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi 
Minh Thought, especially Lenin's thought on the new economic 
policy and state capitalism. The party has to work out 
innovative transition models and intermediate steps that suit 
our concrete circumstances in order to firmly bring the country 
to socialism. 
  II. The New Development Stage and Major Tasks 
  In evaluating achievements and analyzing weaknesses, the 
conference has come to an important assessment: In spite of the 
shortcomings we need to overcome, there have been important 
achievements created. We need to create the premises for the 
country to shift to a new development stage, one of 
industrialization and modernization. 
  Those premises include many elements in both stature and 
strength, in both physical and spiritual contexts, as well as in 
economic, political, cultural, and social fields from both 
inside and outside the country. 
  The conference determined the transition phases to the new 
development stage. We have not had all the premises yet, and we 
should not hastily advance to the new stage. We have to advance 
carefully as we continue to solve remaining issues. This way we 
will avoid economic crisis and create more premises for 
industrialization and modernization.

<F P=106> [Third installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi 20 </F>
to 25 January Midterm National Party Conference Resolution] 
  [Text] To gradually shift to a new stage of development 
full of opportunities as well as of dangers and challenges and 
continue to realize the general objectives set by the seventh 
party congress, the conference defined the tasks to be completed 
during the remaining part of the seventh CPV [Communist Party of 
Vietnam] Central Committee's term as follows: It is necessary 
to motivate the entire party, people, and Army to display 
single-mindedness; make outstanding efforts; uphold the spirit 
of independence, self- sufficiency, and self-reliance; broaden 
international cooperation; respond to the movement for thrift, 
impartiality, and righteousness; make use of all advantages and 
opportunities; repel dangers; overcome challenges; and step up 
efforts to achieve the objectives of the economic stabilization 
and development strategy for the period until the year 2000, 
thereby realizing the goals of making the people rich and the 
nation powerful and of bringing about justice and civilization 
in society. 
  There are eight key tasks to carry out as follows: 
  1. Effecting changes in the economic structure based on the 
need for industrialization and modernization. 
  -- It is necessary to combine industrialization with 
modernization because we must carry out not only the 
industrialization program, but we must also change the 
structures of all sectors, areas of activities, and the national 
economy as a whole based on the need for the acquisition of 
modern technologies. It is important not only to go through the 
stages of mechanization, automation, and computerization, but 
also to apply scientific- technological innovations to different 
areas of activities and make efforts to seize opportunities to 
shorten our process and to form spearheads of development to 
catch up with scientific and technological progress in the 
world. It is necessary not only to apply modern technologies, 
but also to make full use of and modernize traditional 
technologies. 
  -- Do we have enough money to carry out the 
industrialization and modernization program? 
  The important premises rest with the fact that the 
renovation 
undertaking has recorded many achievements and the socioeconomic 
situation in our country has been stabilized to an important 
extent. The practical results are as follows: 
  The grain problem has been resolved in a relatively 
comprehensive manner. 
  There has been an increase in the supply of agricultural, 
forestry, and sea products to support processing industries. 
  The domestic market has been broadened a step further. 
  The national economy has begun to achieve some capital 
accumulation. 
  The export index has increased considerably and provided 
enough foreign currency to import materials and staples. 
  Diplomatic relations have been broadened, thereby enabling 
us 
to have access to many sources of capital from foreign countries 
and international organizations. 
  The period from now until the year 2000 is not yet a stage 
of 
far-reaching and large-scale developments, but only a step 
forward in which efforts will be concentrated on projects that 
are necessary and that can yield effective results and create 
momentum for fast economic growth in the next decade. 
  What is the significance of our efforts to accelerate the 
industrialization and modernization program a step further? 
  -- Effecting changes in the economic structure based on the 
need for industrialization and modernization constitutes a key 
task of primary importance in the days ahead. This move helps 
create more jobs, quickly increase the economic growth rate, 
improve the material and spiritual life of the people, firmly 
maintain political stability and social order, safeguard 
independence and sovereignty as well as socialist orientations, 
and eliminate the danger of being left farther behind compared 
with neighboring countries. 
  Based on past experiences, what are the concepts that we 
must 
firmly grasp to enable the industrialization and modernization 
program yield effective results? 
  The political report clearly puts forth a number of concepts 
on industrialization and modernization as follows: 
  -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty 
must go along with the broadening of international cooperation, 
building an open-door economic development policy both at home 
and abroad, multilateralizing and diversifying relations with 
other countries, combining economic activities with national 
defense and security, and linking economic growth with the 
achievement of social progress and social justice as well as 
with cultural development and environmental protection. 
  -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous efforts 
at exports while at the same time replacing imports that can be 
produced locally. It is necessary to take socioeconomic results 
as a fundamental standard for determining the course of 
development and for selecting investment projects and 
technologies. 
  -- Appropriately gathering resources for the various fields 
of activities and various key areas to promptly produce high 
results while paying attention to meeting the essential 
requirements of localities which have difficulties. 
  -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size 
projects that require small investment capital or capital that 
can be recovered quickly. It is necessary to build a number of 
necessary, large-scale projects that can yield effective results. 
  -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the 
fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an 
emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness. From 
now until the end of this decade, great attention must be paid 
to agricultural industrialization and to the rural economy. We 
must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and fishery 
development in conjunction with efforts to develop processing 
industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine products and 
for consumer goods manufacturing and exports. 
  Is it true that if we regard industrialization and 
modernization as a key task of primary importance in the days 
ahead, we will belittle the role of agriculture? 
  This concept is not at variance with the strategy of 
directing vigorous efforts at agricultural development. 
Agricultural production still remains one of the decisive 
factors for stabilizing the socioeconomic situation and for 
creating the groundwork for industrial development. 
Nonetheless, agricultural development should be understood in a 
broad sense, not as development that is based solely on 
agriculture or worse still, on backward agriculture. The party 
Central Committee Fifth Plenum has pointed out: It is necessary 
to take comprehensive measures to promote agricultural 
development and rural socioeconomic development, regarding this 
move as a very urgent task. To this end, we must necessarily 
accelerate agricultural industrialization and modernization; 
develop the rural economy; and boost agricultural, forestry, and 
fishery development in conjunction with efforts to promote 
processing industries and other industrial and service sectors 
in the countryside itself, bearing in mind the need to 
coordinate action and achieve cooperation with other sectors and 
areas.
