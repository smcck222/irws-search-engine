  [Text] The tug of war between the DPRK and the United 
States seems to be reaching break point. Both sides have made 
threats and neither wants to give in. Today, DPRK Ambassador to 
Angola Kang Sun-yong called the press to comment on the problem. 
Reporter Antonio Alves compiled this report: 
  The Patriot missiles which the United States recently set up 
in the Korean Peninsula and the pressure that it has been 
applying on the DPRK through the United Nations to have that 
country's nuclear installations inspected, have irritated the 
DPRK even more. 
  [Begin Kang Sun-yong recording in Korean, with 
passage-by-passage translation to Portuguese] Our country is a 
sovereign country. Though it is a small nation, if the United 
States should use its might to exert pressure on us, we will 
confront the Americans and counter their machinations. [end 
recording] 
  The DPRK has long been on alert and its people are only 
waiting for one blade of grass of their territory to be touched. 
  [Begin Kang Sun-yong recording] If they start shelling the 
Korean peninsula, they will disappear forever. [end recording]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Public organizations of 
different countries denounced the anti-DPRK acts of the United 
States which reversed the agreed conclusions reached at the 
DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and is aggravating the situation 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  The Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification, the 
Peace 
Action Committee and 14 other organizations of Nepal in a joint 
statement criticized the United States for reversing its 
commitment and massing its Armed Forces around the Korean 
peninsula in a hasty move to resume the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises and deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea, 
in disregard of the expectations and hope of the world public. 
  The statement strongly urged the United States to desist 
from 
complicating the situation of the Korean peninsula any longer by 
sincerely implementing its commitment to the DPRK on the 
principles of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement, not going against 
the trend of the times. The Jordanian Committee for Solidarity 
with the Korean People in a statement voiced opposition to the 
U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Korea, urging an 
immediate halt to the frantic anti-DPRK campaign. 
  The Central Committee of the Organization of Workers of 
Mozambique in a statement denounced as unreasonable and unfair 
the act of the United States and the International Atomic Energy 
Agency in transferring the "nuclear issue" to the UN Security 
Council. 
  The National Liberation War Veterans Committee of Zimbabwe 
demanded in a letter to the U.S. chief executive that the United 
States to [halt] at once it preparations for a war of 
aggression and embark on a negotiated settlement of the nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Students of Kim Il-song 
University and Pyongyang University of Agriculture held rallies 
and voiced support to the struggle of the South Korean students 
and people for checking rice market opening by the authorities. 
  Speakers at the rallies noted that, with the market of farm 
and livestock products including the rice market sold off to the 
United States by the South Korean Kim Yong-sam group, South 
Korean agriculture is facing a total bankruptcy, the 6 million 
peasants will lose the means of livelihood soon and its 
catastrophic effect will sweep the economy as a whole. 
  Referring to the staunch struggle of the students belonging 
to the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils 
(Hanchongnyon), the peasants and other people of South Korea 
against rice market opening by the Kim Yong-sam group, they said 
this was an explosion of anger and grievances against those who 
seek to prolong their despicable power by selling the people's 
right to existence and a righteous patriotic action to defend 
the dignity and interests of the nation. 
  They said the treacherous Kim Yong-sam puppet regime must be 
overthrown and an independent democratic government be 
established, if rice market opening is to be checked in South 
Korea and the dignity and interests of the nation be defended.

  [Text] Phnom Penh 8 Apr (AKP) -- Accompanied by his wife, 
Queen Monineat Sihanouk, His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
arrived in Phnom Penh today, 8 April, from the DPRK. 
  Norodom Sihanouk, reenthroned as king of Cambodia last 
September, has since been hospitalized in Beijing for cancer 
treatment. He travelled to Pyongyang early this month before 
returning to Cambodia. 
  According to a schedule arranged by the Royal Palace 
cabinet, 
the king will preside over a people's audience on 12 April to 
solve five urgent problems from among the grievances aired by 
the Cambodian people as selected by his high privy councillors. 
  A roundtable meeting between government leaders and the head 
of the Khmer Rouge faction under the king's lofty chairmanship 
has also been arranged. 
  Last month, government forces took control of several Khmer 
Rouge-held bases, including Anlung Veng and Pailin, in the 
region bordering Thailand. King Sihanouk launched an appeal 
from Beijing calling on the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] 
and the Khmer Rouge faction to put a halt to their fighting. 
  Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen, 
respectively first and second prime ministers, have declared 
that the RGC has adopted an "open-door" policy toward the Khmer 
Rouge, allowing them a chance to reintegrate themselves into the 
national community.

<F P=106> [Article: "Laos... The Gold Mine on the Mekong River's </F>
Bank"] 
  [Summary] "Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice chairman of the 
Laos Commission for Cooperation and Planning, confirmed that the 
LPDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] is quite rich in natural 
resources compared to other countries in this region. At 
present, forests cover 47 percent of the total area of the 
country. Geographically speaking, Laos can build as many as 18 
hydroelectric dams with a combined production of electricity of 
14,000 megawatts. Forty percent of the water in the Mekong River 
comes from Lao territory." French geologists have confirmed 
that huge deposits of over 10 precious minerals were found in 
different parts of the country. 
  Dr. Wiraphong Ramangkun, former economic advisor to the Lao 
Government and secretary of the Thai-Lao Friendship Association, 
disclosed that the lignite deposit discovered in the area of 
Hong Sa Special Zone "is three times larger than that of 
Thailand's Mae Mo mine and sufficient for electricity production 
for up to 60 years" 
  Moreover, zinc, tungsten, and gypsum can also be found in 
large quantities in Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Xieng 
Khwang Provinces while blue sapphire is also plentiful in Bokeo 
Province. Phadaeng Industry Company of Thailand reported the 
discovery of additional huge deposits of zinc and other minerals 
in southern Laos, while a French oil exploration company is 
considering the commercial viability of tapping the country's 
petroleum resources. 
  "Speaking about the advantage of Laos' geographic location, 
Somnouk Khaiy-gnavong, deputy secretary general of the Lao 
National Trade and Industries Council and former director 
general of Laos' National Economic and Social Development 
Planning Department, said Laos shares common borders with five 
countries namely Thailand, China, Burma, Vietnam, and Cambodia. 
Therefore, it can serve well as a trade center for this region." 
  Laos' first four-year economic development, covering the 
period from 1981 to 1985 was designed to heal the wounds of war. 
The second economic development plan, 1986 to 1990, 
concentrated on promoting the free trade system and establishing 
a strong currency. The year 1989 saw bright economic prospects 
as a result of the influx of foreign investment. The current 
third development plan, according to Somphong Mongkhonvilai, 
emphasizes the endeavors to tap and fully exploit the country's 
natural resources and bring about self-sufficiency to Laos. 
Under this development plan, 1991-1995, Laos will find ways to 
attract more foreign investors and promote production of goods 
for domestic consumption to alleviate the country's dependence 
on imports. 
  "The drafting of the fourth economic development plan 
(1996-2000) is complete. The blueprint is currently under 
scrutiny by the National Assembly. The major contents are 
likely to be left untouched. The plan must pass through the 
National Assembly before its promulgation." 
  Somnouk Khai-gnavong, also a member of the committee in 
charge of drafting the development plan, revealed that "the 
fourth plan opens the door wider because the Lao Government's 
objective is to turn the country into the energy and free trade 
center of the region. The LPDR will use Singapore as a good 
example in doing trade." 
  "Under this development plan, Laos will divide the country 
into five development zones. The northern region with Xieng 
Khwang Province as its center will emphasize animal husbandry. 
The central region including Vientiane Municipality will 
concentrate on tourism and industrial development. Khammouane 
Province will stress electricity production and processing 
industries while the two southern provinces -- Savannakhet and 
Champassak -- will pursue agricultural development and trade." 
  Moreover, the economic development programs for the 
northern region comprising Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, 
Oudomsai, and Phong Saly are also designed to be compatible with 
the Northern Quadrangle Economic Development Scheme. Bokeo, 
Phong Saly, and Luang Namtha are classifed as trade zones, 
whereas Luang Prabang and Oudomsai will become a special zone 
for tourism and mining industry. 
  Following the opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, 
Vientiane Municipality will be turned into a trade and 
investment center. A cultural and arts center inside the 
municipality will help promote tourism. A business area will be 
located in Tha Naleng near the bridge. The industrial zone will 
be in Saithani District along Road No. 13 from kilometer markers 
18 to 27. The industrial area in the southern region will be 
located at Nakai in Khamouan Province because of its proximity 
to the seaport in Vietnam. 
  Savannakhet Province will become the free port town, a 
transit point for the transportation of goods from Danang port 
to Thailand and vice versa. Savannakhet's trade system will be 
similar to those of other free port towns elsewhere. There will 
be tax-free shops, wholesalers, and retailers. Champassak 
Province, after the construction of Pakse Bridge, will be able 
to trade with both Thailand and Cambodia. 
  In its attempts to review economic management, the LPDR has 
passed an economic law for the promotion and protection of 
foreign investment in the LPDR. 
  However, common shortcomings observed by business people who 
went to explore investment opportunities in Laos are: 
  1. Laos has no laws for protecting the operation of 
financial institutes, insurance, and real estate businesses. 
The revenue of financial institutes in Laos comes from fees 
collected from loan transfers and related services. 
  2. Investors are left to face inconveniences caused by 
bureaucratic red tape, bribery, and a sluggish attitude among 
officials concerned. 
  3. The country lacks a quality work force and has no 
business administration schools to produce qualified graduates. 
  4. Public facilities such as roads, electricity, and running 
tap water are insufficient. 
  5. The government is unable to control the unrealistically 
high cost of living. The cost of living is incompatible with 
the people's income and may later become a major problem in the 
country. 
  "The present LPDR might resemble Thailand 30 years ago. But 
in 2000, Laos might be able to compete with Brunei in terms of 
per capita income. But this depends on how well the Lao 
Government can build the country's economy. If everything 
proceeds as planned in the fourth economic plan, the realization 
of such a dream is not beyond the reach of the Lao Government.

  [Text] Liu Shuqing, president of the Chinese People's 
Institute of Foreign Affairs, who is visiting the ROK, said 
today that China will oppose to resolve the North Korean nuclear 
issue by applying sanctions, stressing that to take a 
countermove of sanctions against North Korea will only 
complicate the issue. 
  President Liu came to Seoul to hold discussions with the ROK 
on the detail of forming the ROK-PRC Forum, which will be 
inaugurated in June. His remarks attract the public eye because 
he is a core person in charge of China's diplomacy who was vice 
foreign minister and occupied other important posts. 
  President Liu asked back if any problem had ever been 
resolved through international sanctions and said that, although 
the North Korean nuclear issue had occasionally faced obstacles, 
progress was truly made in resolving the issue through dialogue 
between North Korea and the United States and between North 
Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency. He continued 
to say that on the ground of this progress, China believes 
firmly [hwaksin] that the North Korean nuclear issue will be 
resolved through dialogue. 
  President Liu also said that he had met North Korean 
President Kim Il-song many times, but he would not play the role 
of a mediator between South and North Korea for resolving the 
nuclear issue because there are dialogue channels between the 
two.

<F P=106> [Opening statement at news conference by Prime Minister </F>
Morihiro Hosokawa at the prime minister's official residence -- 
live] 
  [Text] At a meeting of chairmen of the ruling coalition 
parties and at an extraordinary session of the cabinet that were 
held just a while ago, I expressed my intention to resign as 
prime minister and received their approval. Since I took office 
last August, I have expressed my feelings about problems related 
to Japan's wartime past, and worked on such major tasks as 
political reform, the Uruguay Round, several packages of 
measures to stimulate the economy, the relaxation of 
regulations, and Japan-U.S. framework talks. I have put into 
effect several reforms the government of the Liberal Democratic 
Party was unable to carry out. For Japan's future, I worked out 
plans for the reform of the current tax system, the reform of 
the current pension system, decentralization, and the freedom of 
information within 1993, and some of them were successful, 
thereby paving the way for carrying out reforms. I feel very 
grateful and I would like to express my gratitude to the people 
for their understanding and cooperation. 
  To my regret, I was not able to fully work on the bold 
reform 
of the current education system and the reform of the current 
administration system in order for Japan to prepare itself for a 
new era. Japan was unable to play an aggressive part in 
disarmament. For example, Japan was unable to play an aggressive 
part for promoting the UN registry system for conventional 
weapons. There is also the Minamata diseases trial which 
remains a symbolic environmental problem. I had intended to 
work on them but it is regrettable that I will now be unable to 
do so. 
  Over the past eight months, I have driven myself to work on 
tasks at home and abroad, day and night, without taking a rest. 
As I said at the outset of this news conference, I have 
expressed my resolve to quit as prime minister. In this news 
conference I would like to explain why I resolved to step down 
as prime minister. The deliberation of the 1994 budget that 
directly affects the people's livelihood has remained stalled, 
and this situation is truly worrisome. My personal problem -- 
it does not matter whether it is being used as a tool in a 
political strife -- has become an obstacle to promoting Diet 
debates. I have to honestly reveal all the facts unearthed so 
far to the people. 
  First, I would like to refer to the problem about my loan 
from the Sagawa Kyubin parcel delivery group. As I explained in 
documents I submitted to the Diet, I got the loan of 100 million 
yen from the group, and I certainly repaid it. But the report I 
received from my office last night revealed that under an 
agreement reached between my office and the group, the interest 
on the loan was treated as political donations from companies 
belonging to the group. The report said these political 
donations were properly handled in accordance with the Political 
Funds Control Law, and those which exceeded the limit set by the 
law were reported in a statement of income and expenses. 
  Regarding the problem concerning the purchase of NTT 
[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone] stocks, as I have repeatedly 
said, my father-in-law bought them on his own and my former 
secretary Miyama was involved in the investment. I heard that 
revenues from the sale of the stocks were sent to my 
father-in-law through my office account. But I think this is 
not basically a problem. I personally made efforts to help 
unearth facts about these problems in a bid to dispel suspicion 
on me. But, in the process of investigating them, it has become 
clear that there is another problem. There is the problem that 
for several years since 1981 my office entrusted my personal 
funds to a person for investment, thereby deriving profits. 
That person is my old friend. He reportedly asked my office to 
entrust my personal funds to him for a sound investment. I have 
learned that such investment activities might have dubious 
legality. I cannot say more about this matter at the present 
because the whole affair is still under investigation. Although 
the affair took place many years ago, and my office was 
responsible, I have concluded that I should take moral 
responsibility as a top political leader who always has to be 
straight himself. To assume political responsibility for the 
facts which have come to light, and for the stalled Diet 
business, I have decided to resign as prime minister. 
  I deeply apologize for resigning at a time when further 
political stalemate should be avoided so the government can pass 
the budget bill as early as possible, and tackle many domestic 
and foreign issues. I earnestly hope my resignation will 
somehow contribute to restoring the people's trust in politics. 
  I have decided to resign for the reasons I have just 
explained. The reforms are only half complete. Although I will 
be serving in a different capacity, I am determined to continue 
upholding the torch of reform. I again apologize to the people 
who have supported reform efforts for my having to resign in 
such a way. I sincerely ask you to understand my decision.

<F P=106> [Question &amp; answer session at Prime Minister Morihiro </F>
Hosokawa's news conference at the prime minister's official 
residence -- live] 
  [Text] [unidentified reporter] As you have said, Japan is 
in a very critical situation. It seems to me that you felt you 
could no longer remain in the post of premier because of the 
issue of ethics. You said that not even a single day of 
stagnation can be allowed in politics. Under the current 
situation, your sudden announcement may confuse the political 
situation and invite further distrust of politics, depending on 
circumstances. As a leader of Japan, what do you think of your 
decision to resign? Also, when did you make the decision? 
  [Hosokawa] You are quite right. As I have said earlier, 
there are many diplomatic and domestic tasks which need to be 
settled. Also, deliberations on the budget, which is closely 
linked to the people's livelihood, has been stalled. Indeed, I 
have said earlier that not even a moment of stagnation can be 
allowed in politics. However, I have decided to resign as prime 
minister. This is a decision made after much careful thought. 
The moral responsibility of a top political leader is heavier 
than anything. On that basis, I came to the conclusion that it 
was necessary to straighten myself up. Based on this decision, 
I considered various possibilities and came to the conclusion on 
my own. 
  [Unidentified reporter] As you were explaining the reasons 
for making the decision to step down, you said that a new 
problem had been found. You also said that this was a legal 
problem. It seems to me that your explanation regarding the 
decision to resign as prime minister -- who is the most 
responsible planner -- while the deliberations on the budget 
remain paralyzed are not adequate. Can you explain in concrete 
terms what you were trying to say? 
  [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, we are seeking to find out the 
truth. I want to reveal the details of the problem after the 
investigations are finished. I explained earlier that such a 
doubt came out. 
  I forgot about answering the question asked earlier. I was 
asked when I decided to resign. The details I revealed were 
reported to me by my office late last night. I made the 
decision late last night. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Your resignation will certainly 
create some sort of vacuum on the political scene, and your 
resignation over the scandal will seriously damage the public's 
confidence in political circles since your administration was 
inaugurated to carry out political reform. I would like to have 
your comment on that point. Also, could you explain your 
standpoint as a party head, or an individual politician, on the 
future direction of a political party realignment? 
  [Hosokawa] Concerning the first question, I think the most 
important point is that a person should sincerely reflect on his 
or her own problems and correct them if necessary. So I decided 
to candidly acknowledge the presence of such problems, and to 
make them public. I believe my decision will be somehow helpful 
for easing public distrust of politics. To win back the 
public's confidence in politics, I think my decision was much 
better than covering up the fact. That is why I took this 
action, and I have stressed this is a bed-rock principle of my 
party. I wanted to match my actions with my words. 
  With respect to future realignment of political parties, I 
cannot say too much about that issue right now because I still 
have responsibility as prime minister. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The Hosokawa administration was 
inaugurated eight months ago amid the great expectations of the 
public. How do you evaluate the eight-month rule of the 
Hosokawa administration? 
  [Hosokawa] I have fully referred to that in my statement. As 
a reform-oriented administration, my cabinet has been fully 
grappling with internal and external problems which have been 
pending for decades. Fortunately, we have reached some 
noteworthy achievements owing to public support. While these 
are still incomplete, we have at least gained some clue to 
settling long-pending issues. I personally have a sense of 
satisfaction right now, and I suppose both the Japanese public 
and the international community would give me a certain level of 
credit for my work. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Could you describe the schedule for 
your formal resignation? And, could you explain your opinion on 
the qualifications of the next prime minister to replace you? 
  [Hosokawa] Regarding the future political schedule, I have 
responsibility to pass the budget bill, and I would like to 
consult with the ruling and opposition parties on this matter. 
Concerning favorable characteristics of my successor, I think 
it is inappropriate for me to comment on that. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Before you made the decision, did 
you 
consult with some politicians, friends, or your family? 
  [Hosokawa] I talked with my wife last night. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that basically the 
framework of the current coalition government should not be 
changed even after your resignation, or do you think you do not 
mind even if the framework of the coalition government is 
changed as part of the regrouping of political parties -- in 
other words, do you think it is possible to reorganize the 
framework of the coalition government on condition that the new 
government take over the tasks the Hosokawa government has left? 
  [Hosokawa] I think it desirable that the new prime minister 
take over the tasks my government has set. But I do not think I 
should comment on this. 
  [Unidentified reporter] My question relates to the question 
you have just answered. Your government is the first 
non-Liberal Democratic Party government in 38 years. You have 
managed the government for eight months. Are you confident in 
saying that coalition is the desirable way to form a government? 
  [Hosokawa] It is a very difficult question. I think it has 
both good and bad aspects. 
  [Unidentified reporter] A while ago you said it is your 
responsibility to have the budget bill passed. Do you mean you 
intend to remain in your current position until the bill is 
adopted? 
  [Hosokawa] I think it depends on when and how the succeeding 
prime minister will be chosen. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Would you please state your 
present.... [interrupted by another reporter] 
  [Unidentified reporter] I think the people are very 
interested in knowing the main reason for your resignation. 
Would you please explain a little bit more about the newly 
surfaced problem? 
  [Hosokawa] It is just as I explained to you a little while 
ago. Investigations are underway now to throw light on the 
problem. I want to swiftly reveal the details of the problem 
upon completion of investigations. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Would you please state your present 
state of mind? 
  [Hosokawa] I commented on my state of mind a little while 
ago. Basically, my government has attained its goals to a 
certain extent, but I am personally dissatisfied with what the 
government has achieved. I deeply regret that in the current 
situation, where we face a lot of problems both at home and 
abroad, I have failed to fully meet the people's expectations. 
I apologize to the people because, at this juncture wherein 
there are a host of domestic and foreign important issues, I had 
to decide on resignation in this way. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when do you 
intend to dissolve the cabinet? 
  [Hosokawa] I have no idea at all. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] How about the timing of choosing 
your 
successor? 
  [Hosokawa] I have no idea. It is completely beyond my scope. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When do you think it is desirable? 
  [Hosokawa] As soon as possible. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, [word 
indistinct] 
are you thinking of accepting the opposition parties' call for 
summoning to the Diet those concerned with your pecuniary 
relations with Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co? 
  [Hosokawa] I have already stated my position on this matter. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, when you assumed 
the office of prime minister, you said it is necessary to join 
forces in politics mindful of the people. Do you think you have 
achieved this goal and satisfactorily answered the people's 
expectations? 
  [Hosokawa] I think there are various ways to interpret the 
phrase "politics mindful of the people." I, with the mandate of 
the people, am confident that I have directly tackled and 
fulfilled my task of carrying out responsible reform without 
hesitation. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, I want to ask 
about choosing your successor. How do you think the framework 
of the succeeding cabinet should be, and is there any 
possibility of tying up with the LDP to cope with internal and 
external problems? 
  [Hosokawa] I cannot make a prediction. I have no idea. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Please answer this question as head 
of the Japan New Party [JNP]. Is there any possibility that the 
JNP will join the opposition camp depending on the line-up of a 
succeeding cabinet, or will the JNP still remain with the ruling 
parties to fulfill its duty? 
  [Hosokawa] Of course, it depends on who will be the next 
prime minister, but I think our party members have a strong 
desire to continue to come to grips with domestic and foreign 
problems as members of the ruling parties. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Who is investigating the newly 
surfaced problem of 1981? 
  [Hosokawa] My office is conducting the investigations. 
  [Unidentified reporter] How about you, Mr. Prime Minister? 
  [Hosokawa] Of course, I have been informed of the details. 
However, there are minute details, and each item is being 
checked one by one. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When do you think most of the facts 
will be revealed? 
  [Hosokawa] I do not know. I hope they will be revealed as 
early as possible. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Do you plan to continue your 
political activities as the head of the Japan New Party after 
you resign as prime minister? 
  [Hosokawa] Yes, I do. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [passage indistinct]. 
  [Hosokawa] What did you say is in a delicate situation? 
  [Unidentified reporter] The economy. 
  [Hosokawa] Oh, the economy. Of course, there are signs of 
economic recovery but the most important thing is for the 
government to implement its pump-priming packages in such a way 
that they will steadily yield the desired results so the economy 
will be put on track toward full recovery. Needless to say, it 
is also an important task for the government to have the fiscal 
1994 budget bill passed as early as possible. Until the next 
prime minister is elected, we will do our utmost to fulfill this 
task. I am sure the next prime minister will make his own 
efforts toward this. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Will your resignation affect [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Hosokawa] I can hardly say my resignation will not affect 
them at all. But basically, they are moving in a favorable 
direction. I am confident that the current political 
difficulties will soon be resolved. You do not have to worry 
about them. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, you have said 
you 
plan to continue your political activities as JNP head after 
your resignation but you reportedly plan to form a new party 
together with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean 
Government Party]. Will you promote this plan after your 
resignation? 
  [Hosokawa] I want to refrain from making comments on this 
matter. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You expressed regret that you have 
to 
resign in this manner, before fulfilling your duties. But I 
cannot dispel a concern that your resignation might affect 
efforts for three reforms, including economic and administrative 
reforms. I wonder if you have to [words indistinct]. Do you 
attach importance to realizing these reforms in selecting the 
next prime minister? 
  [Hosokawa] I think I should not say anything about the 
selection of my successor. As I said earlier, We are still 
uncertain when we can achieve economic and administrative 
reforms, but we have clearly indicated measures to achieve them. 
What the government should do next is to steadily implement 
them. When the Hosokawa government was inaugurated last August, 
it planned to compile bills on decentralization of political 
power and on public information disclosure before the end of the 
year, and to submit them to an ordinary Diet session. This plan 
has not changed. 
  [Unidentified reporter] You earlier explained about your 
100-million-yen loan. Did you say that you have not paid the 
interest on the loan? You also said investment activities are 
legally questionable. Which law are you talking about? Is it 
the law that deals with tax and tax evasion? 
  [Hosokawa] As I said earlier, I cannot tell more because the 
whole affair is still under investigation. I said such 
investment activities might have dubious legality. I will 
clarify everything when all the facts are unearthed. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister. 
  [Unidentified dean of press corps] Your question will be the 
last. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Just as you set a time limit for the 
enactment of political reform bills, I hope you will set a 
deadline for disclosing the facts, rather than saying you will 
clarify things as early as possible. If all of them are not 
revealed by the deadline, you can disclose the facts unearthed 
by that time. 
  [Hosokawa] I cannot decide on a deadline by myself because I 
have to hear others' opinions. We have worked hard to discover 
the facts, and as a result we learned new details yesterday. 
Although we intend to make further efforts, we cannot tell when 
all the facts will be revealed. 
  [Dean of press corps] We will accept one more question. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Prime Minister, countries such 
as 
the United States and South Korea put their expectations on you 
because you are young. You said you will continue political 
activities as JNP head. Do you have a desire to take the 
premiership again if you have such an opportunity in the future? 
  [Hosokawa] I am not thinking of this at all. 
  [Dean of press corps] We now conclude the news conference.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Business leaders expressed 
concern Friday [8 April] over the effects of Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to step down on the domestic 
economy and Japan-U.S. relations. 
  Hosokawa's abrupt decision, announced Friday, sent a shock 
wave through the business community as it came at a time when 
the Japanese economy showed signs of recovery. 
  Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of 
Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), expressed serious concern 
that Hosokawa's decision may cause adverse effects on the 
domestic economy. 
  He expressed hope that a new government will be installed as 
soon as possible to prevent a further delay in the enactment of 
the fiscal 1994 budget. 
  Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry, stressed the need for Japan to maintain political 
stability at a time when Japan-U.S. economic relations have 
entered a delicate stage. 
  Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic 
Organizations (Keidanren), appreciated the Hosokawa 
administration for its achievements in a short period, such as 
political reforms and the decision to open Japan's rice market. 
  Masaru Hayami, president of the Japan Association of 
Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said he will continue to 
seek political reforms by the next administration. 
  Osamu Uno, head of the Kansai Economic Federation, urged the 
ruling coalition to form a new government as soon as possible.

inspectors were not allowed to have access to Vietnamese 
prisons. The U.S. State Department statement asserted that 
members of the Hanoi-based Task Force for U.S. Servicemen

detention camps in six weeks and had been allowed to go to all 
of those camps.

<F P=106> [Fourth installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi </F>
20-25 January Midterm National Party Conference Resolution] 
  [Text] Industrialization and modernization must first of 
all come in agriculture to improve agriculture. The political 
report confirms that from now until the end of this decade, 
industrialization and modernization must pay special attention 
to the industrialization of agriculture and the rural economy. 
  Where do we exploit the capital resources for our 
industrialization and modernization? 
  To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must 
mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with 
effective efforts to manage our capital, with domestic sources 
of capital being regarded as crucial and foreign sources of 
capital as important. 
  We confirm that foreign sources of capital are important, 
especially in the first stage. It is necessary to introduce 
structures and policies to attract more foreign capital, put it 
to more effective use, and invite in modern technology and 
equipment. 
  But foreign capital resources are limited and the demand on 
capital for the entire industrialization and modernization is 
very great, even in the intermediate period. The capital from 
development aid is not much and is normally attached to certain 
conditions. Moreover, in order to use foreign resources, it is 
necessary to have the same amount of domestic capital. In 
obtaining foreign loans, moreover, we must consider our 
repayment capacity and requirements to ensure our independence 
and economic and political sovereignty. Therefore, domestic 
capital is still a decisive factor. 
  The newly industrialized countries, despite receiving much 
external financial support, still have to mobilize 70 to 80 
percent of their domestic capital in the first stage and 
maintain a total investment of more than 30 percent of their GDP 
for many consecutive years. If we want to overcome the danger 
of further lagging behind in our economy, there is only one way: 
We must be diligent and economical in production, be thrifty in 
consumption, save for development investment, and increase the 
total annual investment to more than 20 percent of our GDP in 
the years ahead. 
  2. We must strive to implement the policy on developing the 
multisectoral economy consistently and give various economic 
components and business establishments more headway to develop 
quickly and attain strong economic results. 
  Our party uniformly applies a policy of multisectoral 
economic development. It considers this a long-term strategic 
duty to encourage all sectors and people to invest for 
production and business. It protects the legitimate interests 
of all owners. At the same time, it strives to build and 
consolidate the state-run economy and develop the cooperative 
economy, giving the state-run economy a leading role and 
gradually turning the cooperative economy into a foundation for 
our economy as outlined by the party platform. 
  All economic components are equal. That means they are equal 
under the law and are encouraged by the government to develop 
within the bounds of the law. That does not mean the roles of 
all economic components are the same in our new socio-economy. 
  How does the leading role of the state-run economy manifest 
itself? 
  The state-run economy is a force that controls all important 
economic industries, dominates the economy, and ensure the 
stable development of our economy. It is also a force that 
creates conditions and helps unite all economic components for 
common development. It has the ability to intervene and 
regulate the development of other economic components and of the 
entire national economy. It guides the market-oriented economy 
along the socialist direction. It sets examples of productivity 
and efficiency for other economic components. 
  According to those requirements, at present the state-run 
economic sector is running enterprises in the most important 
production areas. Therefore, it is playing the leading role and 
dominating the national economy. But its leading role has many 
limits. First of all, its productivity and efficiency are still 
low. In some cases, they are worse than those of the individual 
economy. The state-run economy is not operational in certain 
business areas that it should be. These weaknesses need to be 
overcome in the future. 
  What lines and policies need to be applied to continue 
rearranging and building a state-run economy sufficient to 
ensure its leading role in the national economy? 
  In order to consolidate and build the state-run economy, on 
the one hand, we have to rearrange state enterprises and deal 
with those that run perennial losses with different measures. 
On the other hand, we have to build new enterprises. The most 
important thing is that we have to find measures to improve 
state-run enterprises' performance. 
  We have to introduce the share holding system gradually, 
depending on the nature and field of the enterprise. We must, 
however, ensure the state holds the majority of shares. 
  We have to sell a certain number of shares in different 
stages to people who work at the enterprise. We will also 
experiment with selling some shares to organizations and 
individuals outside the enterprise. 
  We have to study, experiment, and gradually apply profit 
sharing in state enterprises (after paying taxes and allocations 
for production savings and the social welfare fund) with workers 
and officials at the enterprise. 
  On the basis of introducing the share holding system, we 
will 
organize a board of management that includes representatives of 
the state, workers, and other share owners. We have to outline 
regulations and requirements for the board of management to 
select managers. 
  We have to perfect and apply different contractual forms in 
state enterprises, gradually change federated enterprises and 
general companies to corporations, and slowly eliminate the 
systems of managing ministries and managing administration 
authorities and the distinction between centrally managed 
enterprises and locally managed enterprises. 
  The aforementioned measures are aimed at: 
  -- Making sure state enterprises and state properties are 
owned by a concrete and direct owner who has a definite 
responsibility for the efficient use of the property. 
  -- Creating power for the worker to identify with the 
enterprise, participate in business policies, and prevent and 
eliminate corruption. 
  -- Guaranteeing the enterprise's sovereignty and the 
state's control and attracting more capital resources.

<F P=106> [Interview with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye by </F>
unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo on 5 April; 
first paragraph is NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye gave an 
interview to a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo on 5 
April, during which he pointed out that "there are signs of 
economic recovery in Japan." However, he also expressed concern 
that if the value of the yen continues to appreciate, exports 
will stop growing, and there might be a delay in economic 
recovery. He indicated that to expand domestic demand, "the 
Japanese Government should implement income tax reductions for 
more than one year." Paye also stated during an interview with 
KYODO NEWS AGENCY reporters at the Japan National Press Club 
that the estimated real economic growth rate of the 24 OECD 
members in 1994 (averaging 2.1 percent) "will probably be 
revised upward in June." 
  The following is a summary of the interview with Paye: 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you look at the present world 
economic situation? 
  [Paye] It is heading in a good direction. The U.S. economy 
is expanding, and the economies of Britain, Canada, and the 
other English-speaking OECD members are turning for the better. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the Japanese 
economic situation? 
  [Paye] The economy has hit bottom. Certain signs of 
recovery can now be observed. If the yen exchange rate remains 
stable, economic recovery can actually be seen within this year. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you thinking of revising the 
December 1993 projection of economic growth rate of the 24 OECD 
member states? 
  [Paye] We are working on it, and hope to do that in June. 
Considering the economic expansion in the United States, we may 
have to revise the previous estimate slightly upward. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think is the appropriate 
yen exchange rate? 
  [Paye] It is hard to pinpoint such an exchange rate. 
However, if yen appreciation goes any further, exports will 
suffer, and this may delay economic recovery. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What steps do you think the Japanese 
Government should take to expand domestic demand? 
  [Paye] It will be important to implement income tax 
reductions for more than one year. Some people say the reduced 
taxes will only go into savings, but these savings should be 
used in investment to stimulate more domestic demand. 
  Furthermore, to build a consumer-oriented economy, it will 
be 
necessary to actively relax government regulations. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States is asking for 
numerical targets to increase Japan's imports as the solution to 
bilateral trade frictions. 
  [Paye] I am against unilateral measures, and laying down 
trade rules through bilateral negotiations. I can understand 
that the enormous U.S. trade deficit is a problem, but the 
solution has to follow multilateral trade rules. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What will be the major items on the 
agenda of the OECD ministerial meeting in June? 
  [Paye] There are three major agenda items. First, 
employment. Second, building a better multilateral framework to 
deal with economic globalization. Third, promoting cooperation 
with China, Russia and other nonmember states. I am looking 
forward to the ROK's membership in the OECD in the near future. 
  [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In relation to employment, the 
European countries are critical that the economic growth in 
Asian countries is built on sacrifices resulting from low wages 
paid to the workers. 
  [Paye] The question of wage level is not a problem for the 
OECD, but should be discussed mainly by the International Labor 
Organization (ILO). However, personally, I do not think we 
should penalize a country for having a wage level lower than the 
average wages in OECD countries. Even though such countries may 
enjoy a temporary advantage over the advanced nations in terms 
of wages, such an advantage will be lost quite rapidly with 
economic growth.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, 9 Apr -- It was disclosed on 9 April 
that North Korea (DPRK) had supplied, as a grant to Cambodian 
Government forces, armored personnel carriers and tons of arms, 
including shells. It was further reported that in late march 
Government forces used the arms to successfully seize Pailin, 
the Pol Pot faction's major stronghold. The disclosures to the 
SANKEI SHIMBUN came from a Cambodian Army source in Phnom Penh, 
and it can be seen that in doing this favor to the Cambodian 
Government, North Korea aims to secure a beachhead which it can 
use to break free of international isolation in the future. 
  The Cambodian Army source said six armored personnel 
carriers 
and tons of arms, including shells for howitzers, mortars and 
small weapons, were and supplied to Cambodian Government forces 
as a grant. The vehicles and arms were flown to Cambodia in 
mid-February. He said North Korea has decided to provide tons 
of additional ammunition by early April. 
  Cambodian Minister of National Defense Tie Banh has 
reportedly flown to Pyongyang in profound secrecy to express 
gratitude. 
  With North Korea's military assistance, Cambodian Government 
forces started intensive shelling of the Pailin area in 
mid-March and were able to seize Sala Krau, one of the Pol Pot 
faction's strongholds, on 19 March, and then Pailin on 21 March. 
  The same source said: "Making a low assessment of the morale 
and ammunition supplies of the government forces, the Pol Pot 
faction stationed only 280 guards in Pailin city. The 
government forces were, therefore, able to bring the city under 
their control very quickly by surprise attack. Without North 
Korea's supply of ammunition, it would have been impossible for 
the government forces to subdue Pailin, and without its 
additional assistance, they would not have been able to maintain 
control over the city." 
  The same source disclosed that government forces worked out 
a 
plan to attack Anlong Veng, a stronghold in the northern 
province of Siem Reap, and Pailin, the major stronghold in the 
south, to mop up those members of the Pol Pot faction that 
rejected any form of dialogue. 
  Anlong Veng was attacked first. However, lax discipline 
within the government forces caused weapons and ammunition to 
flow out onto the black market in large amounts. They subdued 
Anlong Veng, but paid the price for allowing weaponry to be sold 
off when they lost it again in February due to a shortage of 
supplies. 
  The government, meanwhile, tried to get assistance from 
neighboring allies, Vietnam and Laos. However, they turned down 
the request, saying "nothing can be done to help Cambodia." 
  Desperately, the Cambodian Government called on North Korea 
to assist by supplying arms through the North Korean embassy in 
Phnom Penh. North Korea's response was to say that it would 
provide "two shipments of arms in the form of a grant." 
  Asked why North Korea decided to provide arms to Cambodian 
Government forces, the same source said: "Due to the nuclear 
inspection issue, North Korea has become further isolated in the 
international community. By doing a favor to Cambodia, which is 
now the focus of international attention in Southeast Asia, 
North Korea intends to obtain a future ally." 
  North Korean President Kim Il-song and Cambodian King 
Norodom 
Sihanouk have long maintained a relationship as allies since 
President Kim provided support for King Sihanouk when he was 
forced to flee the country because of a coup. 
  Every year King Sihanouk would visit Pyongyang and stay at a 
luxurious villa reserved exclusively for him. North Korea's 
decision to supply of arms to Cambodia at short notice was 
likely made against the background of the "honeymoon 
relationship" between President Kim and King Sihanouk.

<F P=106> [Article signed ARS: "Netherlands Prime Minister Lubbers </F>
Returns Early From Indonesia"; as released by The Hague ANP 
Database] 
  [Text] Surabaya, 6 Apr (ANP) -- Netherlands Prime Minister 
Ruud Lubbers will cut short his Indonesian trip and return to 
the Netherlands Wednesday evening to participate in the debate 
on the Interregional Research Team. By so doing, Lubbers is 
complying with the express wish of the Chamber that the prime 
minister, in addition to Justice Minister Ernst Hirsch Ballin 
and Interior Minister Ed van Thijn, attend its debate on the 
matter. Consequently, the originally limited four-day visit by 
the prime minister will be further shortened by one day. 
  According to the Netherlands prime minister, there is no 
reason for the Indonesians to feel offended at his early 
departure. He said he was convinced that he had managed to 
explain this clearly to his hosts.

  [Text] It has been learned that in an agreement statement 
for the Japan-U.S. negotiations on mobile phones released by the 
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on 6 April, there is an 
expression that might be interpreted as that the Japanese 
Government has guaranteed the implementation of the agreement. 
  The expression in question is the word "oversee" used in an 
official statement written in English. The word is used in the 
expression that the Japanese Government will "oversee" [kantoku] 
to help the Nippon Idou Tsushin Corporation [Japan Mobile 
Communications Corporation] (IDO) complete actions to enlarge 
the U.S. Motorola-compatible mobile phone system. In its 
Japanese- language version tentatively translated from the 
English original released on the same day, the Ministry of Posts 
and Telecommunications translated the word "oversee" as "watch 
it to the end" ["mitodokeru"], thus using a weaker nuance than 
in the original. Therefore, the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications maintains its position that "the government 
will not guarantee the private sector's implementation of 
investment in mobile phone systems and facilities" (according to 
a senior Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications official). 
  It seems, however, that the United States is basing its 
contention that the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has 
guaranteed the private sector's numerical targets on the word 
used in the agreement. It has also been disclosed that in the 
recent accord, it is specified that Japan "will take all 
available measures" if IDO fails to implement its pledged 
action. Such a difference between the two nations's ways of 
interpreting the statement described in the accord on mobile 
phones is another "vague" point in a Japanese-U.S. agreement. 
It is likely that such a difference in interpretation will have 
a delicate impact on Japan-U.S. negotiations on other trade 
sectors.

  [Text] On 5 April, the Ministry of International Trade and 
Industry [MITI] decided to include, in a list of unfair trade 
practices in a report to be compiled in May, U.S. accusations 
against foreign countries of dumping which are based on its 
customs act clause concerning multinational corporations. In 
the "report on unfair trade practices," MITI will also refute 
the provisional finding of the U.S. Department of Commerce at 
the end of March that the Fuji photo film company's Dutch 
subsidiary is dumping color photographic paper on the U.S. 
market. Because the random use of the clause may affect 
Japanese companies' inroads [setting up factories] into foreign 
countries, MITI will consider making a complaint to Washington 
about the unfairness of the dumping accusation after seeing what 
action the Dutch Government and the EC Commission take. 
  The clause on multinational corporations is special 
legislation attached to the customs act that allows for the 
imposition of dumping charges on goods produced by multinational 
companies and imported to the United States. When it is 
impossible to compare a multinational company's sales in the 
United States to sales in the country of origin, the clause 
allows the U.S. Government to make dumping accusations based on 
production costs in the company's home country or any other 
country where the company sells the same product. 
  In the case of Fuji photo film's subsidiary, the U.S. 
Department of Commerce provisionally ruled on 30 March that "the 
Dutch company has sold a small amount of its photographic paper 
in the Netherlands." And based on the clause on multinational 
corporations, it used Fuji photo film's own production costs in 
Japan and calculated that the dumping rate for the goods 
produced by the Dutch subsidiary was 321.23 percent. 
  In refuting the decision, Fuji photo film said, "The Dutch 
subsidiary sells goods throughout Europe, and the small amount 
of sales in the Netherlands is due to the country's small 
market." The Dutch Government also protested unofficially to 
the U.S. Government over its decision. 
  The Dutch company was the third Japanese subsidiary charged 
under the clause. A Japanese subsidiary in South Korea was 
charged in 1982 for dumping steel wire and a Taiwan subsidiary 
in 1989 for dumping telephone receivers. However, because this 
was the first time for a European subsidiary to be charged, MITI 
is more cautious in the Fuji case. A MITI official said, "The 
random use of the clause may affect Japanese companies' inroads 
into foreign countries which have been boosted by the yen's 
appreciation." Thus, MITI has decided to include the case in 
its report on unfair trade practices. 
  The report is to be compiled by MITI's Industrial Structure 
Council (an advisory panel to the international trade and 
industry minister) to investigate whether Japan's main trading 
partners' trade policies and practices violate international 
rules such as those of the GATT. It is a Japanese version of 
the annual U.S. National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade 
Barriers.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Hiroaki Ito] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor, who has made "Japan bashing" a daily task, recently 
stopped making critical comments on Japan. He is believed to 
have changed his comments on Japan out of concern that if his 
criticism of Japan spurs further appreciation of the yen against 
the U.S. dollar, this may result in higher interest rates and 
lower stock prices in the United States at a time when fears are 
rising of a crash on the New York Stock Exchange. 
  In his lecture to a gathering of medium and small businesses 
on 5 April, Mr. Kantor only cited the Japan-U.S. economic 
framework talks as an example of U.S. efforts to open foreign 
markets. In his lecture he did not mention the "closed nature 
of the Japanese market," a term that he has frequently used. 
  Foreign investors rushed to U.S. stock markets in search of 
profits from a rise in stock prices after interest rates were 
lowered last autumn in the United States, but they recently 
began suffering losses in their stock holdings in the wake of a 
recent rebound in interest rates and a plunge in stock prices. 
  If the yen appreciates further against the U.S. dollar in 
this situation, foreign investors would suffer another loss from 
the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the yen and dollar. 
A major Japanese securities firm says, "Under the present 
situation, we want to pull out of U.S. stock markets after 
selling off our stock holdings even if we risk losses." 
  The U.S. Government is conspicuously jittery about the rise 
in interest rates and the plunge in stock prices. Robert Rubin, 
chairman of the National Economic Council (NEC), appearing on 
television on 3 April; Tyson, chairman of the Council of 
Economic Advisers; and President Clinton, speaking on television 
on 4 April, appealed to investors to respond calmly to plunging 
stock prices. Mr. Kantor appears to be "taciturn" about Japan as 
a result. 
  If the present situation continues, the U.S. Government will 
be pressed to alter its strategy toward Japan that aims at using 
the Super 301 provision to apply pressure on Japan. 
  It has been said within the U.S. Government that the "United 
States should pursue closer policy coordination with Japan and 
European nations to keep the rise in long-term interest rates in 
check, and curb further plunges in stock prices." Hence, there 
is a possibility that the low stock prices and the high interest 
rates in the United States will be taken up as an agenda item 
for discussion at the talks of G-7 financial ministers and 
central bank governors scheduled to be held in late April.

  [Text] Lieutenant Governor Mitsuki Tomon of the Okinawa 
Prefectural Government is now in Tokyo for an exchange of 
greetings with officials in government ministries and agencies 
upon the assumption of her post. In connection with the crash 
of an F-15 fighter that was taking off from Kadena Air Base, the 
lieutenant governor visited the headquarters of U.S. Forces 
Japan [USFJ] in Yokota on the morning of 6 April. During a 
meeting with officers of the command, the lieutenant governor 
stated: "The U.S. military aircraft crashed near fields in 
which farming has been tacitly approved and near the Southeast 
Botanical Garden, which at the time had many tourists visiting 
it. Had one thing gone wrong, the crash could have resulted a 
terrible disaster involving Okinawans. We regret the occurrence 
of such a crash." She also asked that the command conduct a 
thorough investigation into the cause of the crash, that it 
report its results to the Okinawa Prefectural Government, and 
that it operate U.S. military bases safely and take measures to 
prevent a recurrence of the crash. 
  After deciding that "it is effective to make a request 
directly to the USFJ command," the Okinawa Prefectural 
Government asked the lieutenant governor to visit the command. 
The lieutenant governor is now coordinating a visit to the U.S. 
Embassy in Tokyo to make the same request. Okinawa Prefectural 
Governor Ota, who has considered visiting Tokyo, will fly to 
Tokyo on 7 April. During his stay in Tokyo, he intends to ask 
the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency, and other related government ministries 
and agencies to request the USFJ to investigate the cause of the 
crash. 
  Lieutenant Governor Tomon told officers of the U.S. command: 
"A total of 111 crashes involving U.S. military aircraft have 
occurred since Okinawa reverted to Japan, and of the crashes, 12 
involved F-15 fighters. In the past year, four crashes 
occurred, and F-18 Hornet fighters assigned to Kadena Air Base 
collided in the air over Mike-Mike [as published] waters in 
December." In this way, the lieutenant government cited a 
series of crashes which had taken place on Okinawa.

  [Text] In response to a series of crashes involving U.S. 
military aircraft, Okinawa Prefectural Governor Ota hastily flew 
to Tokyo on the morning of 7 April to ask the government to take 
measures to prevent a recurrence of such crashes. The Ginowan 
city assembly and political parties and labor organizations on 
Okinawa are increasingly reacting against the crashes by taking 
measures to protest the crashes. The Futenma Air Station is 
located in the middle of Ginowan city, and the Ginowan city 
assembly has held a session of the Committee on U.S. Military 
Bases. The assembly is expected to hold an extraordinary 
session on 8 April at the earliest to adopt a resolution 
protesting against the crashes. At Naha airport, Governor Ota 
expressed his firm resolve to strongly ask the Foreign Ministry, 
the Defense Agency, and the Defense Facilities Administration 
Agency to take measures to prevent a recurrence of such crashes, 
saying, "If the government does not take a more serious view of 
the crashes, it will be too late for the government to take 
steps to prevent them after disasters have occurred." 
  Labor organizations and the Federation of Okinawa 
Prefectural 
Trade Unions have staged rallies near Kadena Air Base to protest 
against the crashes, and this unprecedented situation in which 
two crashes in a row have occurred is heightening anger and 
apprehension among Okinawans. 
  Commenting on the crash of a medium-type CH-transport 
helicopter, the Okinawa Public Affairs Office of the Marine 
Corps explained on the morning of 7 April that the helicopter, 
which was involved in emergency landing training, crashed into a 
runway just prior to landing. The Public Affairs Office said 
that four crewmen were slightly injured, and that the Marine 
Corps has begun investigating the cause of the crash after 
having received reports from the helicopter's pilots. 
  As for the cause of the crash, the Public Affairs Office 
repeated its conventional line, saying, "The Marine Corps does 
not make public the results of investigations into this kind of 
crash. The release of the results is up to negotiations between 
the Governments of Japan and the United States." 
  In an interview with the OKINAWA TIMES at Naha airport prior 
to his departure for Tokyo, Governor Ota expressed his anger 
over the crashes, saying: "The U.S. Forces on Okinawa have 
repeatedly said that such accidents would not occur. We can no 
longer permit such accidents to occur near Okinawans' 
residential areas." In the interview, Governor Ota stressed the 
need for the government to speedily take measures to prevent 
such crashes from occurring in the future, saying, "I intend to 
let the government ask the U.S. side to fundamentally resolve 
problems arising from U.S. military bases on Okinawa and to ban 
military aircraft considered to be dangerous from flying over 
Okinawa." 
  The Okinawa prefectural governor will call on the foreign 
minister and on the director generals of the Defense Agency and 
the Defense Facilities Administration Agency to ask the U.S. 
side to succeed in having U.S. Forces on Okinawa operate their 
military bases safely and to work to prevent a recurrence of 
such crashes. 
  The Okinawa chapters of the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan, and the Japan Communist Party have protested to 
the Naha Defense Facilities Administration Agency over the 
crashes involving U.S. military aircraft.

April the crash of a USMC helicopter at Futenma Air Station] 
  [Text] The statement of Governor Masahide Ota is as 
follows: 
  I have not yet fully been informed of the details of the 
accident, but I am greatly frustrated with repeated accidents by 
U.S. Forces. My impression is that the increase in accidents is 
part of a sequence caused by U.S. defense budget cuts. If so, I 
cannot help feeling great fear about the recurrence of such 
accidents. The U.S. Forces say their training must continue to 
fulfill their duties defined in the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. 
I am wondering if we cannot be free from the danger and 
problems until the security treaty is scrapped.

  [Text] Ginowan--In reaction to the crash of a medium-type 
CH-46E transport helicopter at the Futenma Air Station in the 
afternoon of 6 April, Ginowan city held an extraordinary meeting 
at 0930 on the morning of 7 April to discuss how to deal with 
crashes in the future. The city, which considers the crashes 
involving the helicopter and an F-15 fighter to be an issue 
arising from U.S. military bases existing in central Okinawa, 
decided at the extraordinary meeting to call on cities, towns, 
and villages in central Okinawa to take actions to protest the 
crashes. 
  Meanwhile, the Special Committee on U.S. Military Bases 
(chaired by Seiei Chimen) of the Ginowan City Assembly (chaired 
by Harunobu Nakamura) held a session at 1000 on the morning of 7 
April to decide that the assembly holds an extraordinary session 
to adopt a resolution and a statement demanding a halt to flight 
training by U.S. forces over residential areas and an early 
return of the Futenma Air Station. The extraordinary session is 
scheduled to open at 1400 on the afternoon of 7 April. 
  Members of the Special Committee on U.S. Military Bases took 
a look at the crash site from outside of the Futenma Air Station 
and confirmed that debris from the crashed helicopter landed on 
the roof of Mr. Kiuma's house. They then entered the air 
station through the Oyama gate to tour the crash site. 
  On 7 April, one day after the helicopter crash, Ginowan city 
remained relatively calm with almost no helicopter noise being 
heard. The helicopter in question broke into two pieces when it 
crashed, and it remains that way, with only its debris having 
been recovered. 
  In the past, the Ginowan City Assembly adopted resolutions 
protesting against the crash and overturning of a CH-46 
helicopter on Futenma Air Station runway in October 1992 and 
against the dropping of a set of repair tools by a UH-1 
helicopter onto the prefectural highway in Nakagutsuku town in 
October 1993.

Station on 6 April. In reaction, Mitsuki Tomon, lieutenant 
governor of the Okinawa Prefectural Government, called on 
Donald. R Gardner, commander of U.S. Forces on Okinawa, at Camp 
Zukeran on the morning of 7 April to deliver to the commander a 
letter demanding a thorough investigation into the cause of the 
crash and the prevention of a recurrence. The helicopter 
crashed after an F-15 fighter crashed while taking off from 
Kadena Air Base on 4 April. Therefore, she strongly protested to 
the commander about the helicopter crash. She also protested to 
the U.S. Consulate General in Okinawa.

  [Text] Tokyo -- [Okinawa Prefectural] Governor Masahide 
Ota, who traveled to Tokyo in haste because of the successive 
crashes [in Okinawa] of U.S. military aircraft, visited the 
Foreign Ministry, the Defense Agency, the U.S. Embassy, and 
other offices on 7 April. He stressed during his visits that, 
"The problem it that accidents involving U.S. military aircraft 
continue to occur, and this is extremely unfortunate. Moreover, 
military training has been resumed even before the causes of the 
accidents have been determined. This gives rise to growing ill 
feelings among the prefecture's people." He strongly demanded 
that the U.S. forces be asked to report the causes of accidents 
to the prefectural government promptly, to implement safety 
measures thoroughly, and to prevent the recurrence of accidents. 
  During his meeting with the governor, Foreign Minister Hata 
said, "The Japan-U.S. security setup can only function with the 
local people's cooperation." He demonstrated a positive 
attitude with regard to the submission of reports on accidents 
to the Okinawan Government. 
  During this meeting, Ota said: "Every time an accident 
occurs, they promise that they will implement safety measures 
thoroughly. However, there has been no end to the accidents. 
That is the problem. Moreover, it is an affront to the popular 
sentiment in Okinawa to resume military training two days after 
an accident occurred. We have not received any report on the 
accident, although we have asked for it." He expressed his 
strong anger at and distrust of the U.S. forces. 
  In response, Hata said, "It is regrettable that the 
helicopter accident occurred even after we had complained about 
safety management, immediately after the F-15 fighter crash, to 
the U.S. forces." He expressed the view that reports on the 
causes of accidents should also be given to the Okinawan 
Government. 
  On the other hand, Atsushi Tokinoya, director general of the 
Foreign Ministry's North American Affairs Bureau, and Ichiro 
Yoneyama, director general of the Defense Facilities 
Administration Agency [DFAA], said: "It is not that we take the 
Okinawan people's sentiments lightly. The Foreign Ministry and 
the DFAA have always asked that safety measures be fully 
implemented and that causes of accidents be reported. However, 
we are not in a position to demand that training be suspended 
until the causes of accidents are determined." 
  Meanwhile, Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi told 
Ota, "I take this seriously" and "I would like to visit Okinawa 
as soon as possible." 
  At the U.S. Embassy, Ota was met by Deputy Chief of Mission 
Ross Deming. Deming stated that the consulate general in 
Okinawa has been instructed to carry out an investigation. 
  Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Okinawa Development 
Agency and who was also present at the meeting with the foreign 
minister, revealed that he is considering including this issue 
in the agenda of the liaison meeting of the Foreign Ministry, 
the Defense Agency, and the Okinawa Development Agency. 
  On the other hand, at the meeting of the Japanese-U.S. Joint 
Committee on the Status-of-Forces Agreement on the same day, 
Tokinoya made an official statement on behalf of the Japanese 
Government. He asked the United States to also give the 
Japanese Government a report once the causes of the accidents 
are clarified.

  [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], who is in Okinawa to campaign 
for local election candidates, gave a news conference at the 
prefectural government building on 7 April at which he commented 
on the two recent U.S. military aircraft crashes. 
  He said: "I will report the facts of the accidents and the 
Okinawan people's sentiments to the prime minister, the foreign 
minister, and the director general of the Defense Agency. The 
government will take appropriate measures." 
  He indicated the government and the ruling parties might 
discuss suitable responses, including the suspension of flights 
by F-15 fighters and CH-46 helicopters until the causes behind 
the two accidents were determined. 
  During the news conference, Kubo talked about issues 
affecting Okinawa, such as the proposed bill on the utilization 
of returned military land, and the plan to combine the Okinawa 
Development Agency, the Hokkaido Development Agency, and the 
National Land Agency. He also gave his views on national 
political developments and the realignment of political parties. 
  The fact he chose to mention the accidents involving U.S. 
military aircraft is interpreted as an indication that the 
government and the ruling parties may take action. 
  Commenting on the accidents at the news conference, Kubo 
expressed his shock, saying: "It has been reconfirmed to me 
that the overwhelming concentration of bases here in Okinawa 50 
years after the end of the war forces residents to endure 
anxiety and fear." 
  He said: "We have to deal with this problem as a major issue 
for Japan as a whole." 
  He also said, though, that the chances were slim of the 
proposed bill on the utilization of returned military land, a 
key issue on Okinawa, being passed in the current Diet session. 
  He said: "There is very little time left in the current 
session and legislation will be difficult." 
  However, he also said: "I think the (military land use 
system) is an important issue because it concerns land use after 
military land has been returned, and the revitalization of local 
communities." 
  He pledged to work for the submission of the bill by Diet 
members [most Japanese bills are submitted by the government] 
during the current Diet. 
  Commenting further on the planned integration of three 
government agencies, including the Okinawa Development Agency, 
Kubo said: "Its role in assisting the national and local 
governments will remain important for some time to come." 
  This was taken as an indication that he believes it would be 
premature to integrate the three agencies. 
  Talking about the mayoral elections in the cities of Okinawa 
and Gushikawa, the purpose of his visit, Kubo said: "These are 
important elections which will affect the forthcoming 
simultaneous local elections, and the upper house elections and 
general elections next year." 
  He stressed that the SDPJ would do its utmost to retain 
reformist control of the prefectural government at the 
gubernatorial election in November.

  [Text] Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], met with Okinawa Governor 
Masahide Ota at the Okinawa Prefectural Office on 6 April. 
During the meeting, Kubo pledged that the SDPJ, as a member of 
the ruling coalition, would do its utmost to resolve the issue 
of the bases on Okinawa. He said: "We regard the issue of the 
bases on Okinawa as a problem that should concern the whole 
nation. We will work to resolve the issue." Kubo arrived in 
Okinawa the same day to solicit opinions. 
  Concerning the passage of a bill on special measures for 
promoting diversion of military-occupied land, Kubo said: "We 
could not have expected the current Diet confusion. 
Nevertheless, the passage of the bill is a commitment." In 
this way, he indicated that the SDPJ would make an all-out 
effort for the legislation. Okinawa hopes that the bill, which 
will be submitted as a legislator-sponsored bill, should be 
enacted during the current Diet session. 
  At the meeting, Governor Ota referred to the crash of a U.S. 
F-15 jet fighter which occurred on 4 April, saying: "The 
prefectural office has asked the Governments of Japan and the 
United States to work to resolve the issue of the bases before 
1995, which will mark the 50th anniversary of the end of the 
Pacific war. Since you work in the center of the ruling 
coalition, I hope you will tell the government about the crash." 
  Also, with regard to U.S. Forces' facilities such as the 
Naha 
Military Port, whose return has been agreed upon by the Japanese 
and U.S. Governments, Ota said: "I expect the government to 
satisfy the Okinawan people by achieving tangible results." 
  In response, Kubo said: "The Hosokawa government has 
expressed deep regret over the war since its inauguration. We 
understand the Okinawan people's feeling." He then noted that 
the Hosokawa government would tackle the Okinawa base issue as 
its own task and that the SDPJ would discuss it at a meeting of 
party members of prefectural assemblies to be held in Okinawa in 
June. 
  After the meeting, Kubo headed for the spot where the F-15 
fighter crashed for inspection. On the way, he was informed of 
another crash by a helicopter belonging to U.S. Forces, and he 
was apparently shocked by the fact that Okinawa is always 
exposed to danger. 
  At the spot, Kubo looked at the burnt fuselage of an F-15 
fighter while being briefed on the crash by Okinawa City Deputy 
Mayor Eiken Kayo. Kubo said: "Duties of the government include 
protecting the lives and assets of the people. I will report 
the accident to the government. We have to consider what 
measures should be taken to resolve the issue of the bases."

<F P=106> [John Burton report: "North Korea in Nuclear Warning to </F>
Tokyo"] 
  [Text] A North Korean official warned yesterday that if his 
country was to develop nuclear weapons, they would be primarily 
aimed at Japan, rather than at South Korea or the US. 
  The warning, one of the most explicit made by North Korea 
about the intent of its possible nuclear weapons programme, is 
likely to heighten concern in Tokyo that Pyongyang poses a 
serious military challenge. However, North Korean officials 
claim they suspect Japan's nuclear motives, and the statement 
yesterday came a day after the start-up of Japan's first 
fastbreeder nuclear reactor, which began a self-sustaining chain 
reaction. 
  Mr Cha Bongju, the North Korean ambassador to India, again 
said his country did not intend to develop nuclear weapons, but 
told the South Korean news agency YONHAP the North feared that 
Japan would eventually become a nuclear power. 
  "Our nuclear arms, if developed, would be primarily designed 
to contain Japan," Mr Cha said. 
  He added that a North Korean nuclear weapon would never be 
used against South Korea or the US. 
  The statements could increase pressure on the Japanese 
government to take a tougher line against North Korea over the 
issue of nuclear site inspections. They will also provide 
support for Japanese officials arguing that the country must 
boost its defence capability. 
  North Korea has already developed a missile, the Rodong-I 
[Nodong-1], that can reach most of Japan, although military 
analysts believe that Pyongyang does not yet have the capability 
of building a sophisticated nuclear warhead small enough to fit 
on the missile. 
  But the ambassador's comments appear to confirm some 
analysts' fears that North Korea might use the Japanese 
fast-breeder reactor, which generates plutonium, as a pretext 
for proceeding with its own production of plutonium, used in the 
making of nuclear weapons. 
  It was the second North Korean warning this week that it 
might be ready to resume plutonium production. 
  Some analysts in Seoul believe Mr Cha's comments might be an 
attempt to allay South Korea's fears about the development of a 
North Korean nuclear weapon by appealing to the traditional 
Korean dislike of Japan. 
  North Korea has come under growing pressure to open up its 
nuclear facilities to full international nuclear inspections to 
dispel suspicions that it is developing nuclear weapons. 
  Pyongyang rejected a request by the UN Security Council last 
week that it accept new inspections of nuclear sites by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency.

  [Text] A Japanese Government source said on 6 April: 
"North Korea is not expected to arm itself with nuclear 
weapons, but in framing Japanese defense policy, the government 
must take into account the possibility that Pyongyang could arm 
itself with nuclear weapons." 
  His comments came in response to North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons development, an issue that heightened tensions 
on the Korean peninsula after Pyongyang refused to allow 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to check 
nuclear sites. 
  His remarks indicated that the government should take into 
account the situation in North Korea in its continuing review of 
the Guidelines for Defense Build-Up. 
  On the need to defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, the 
government source stressed the need to think of ways which would 
lead North Korea to act moderately. 
  He said: "North Korea is currently in a state of starvation 
and Chinese food aid is needed."

  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden 
announcement of his intention to resign has aroused extensive 
concerns over a possible political vacuum connected with 
security and diplomatic issues. In particular, concerns about 
the government's handling of the DPRK (North Korea) nuclear 
inspection issue are all the more serious because this issue, in 
a sense, involves the cabinet's crisis management capabilities. 
Here, we would like to bring up a few measures that Japan may 
be expected to take in case the UN Security Council should 
decide on imposing economic sanctions. They are: suspension of 
remittances, trade control, control of exchanges, and actions 
taken to prevent maritime activities. 
<H5>  The Remittance Issue </H5>
  The United States has severely criticized remittances from 
Japan to North Korea, maintaining the money "has been used to 
develop nuclear weapons." Reportedly, a total of 60-80 billion 
yen is remitted every year, but the actual details are unknown. 
It is stipulated in the Act on Control of Foreign Exchange and 
Foreign Trade [ACFEFT] that payment can be prohibited "when it 
is deemed necessary to faithfully perform international treaties 
signed by our country or other international commitments." In 
practice, the act is implemented through the Ministry of Finance 
[MOF] issuing notifications on the basis of regulations on 
controlling foreign exchange. 
  Moreover, even if these regulations are enforced, it will be 
very difficult to control remittance through third countries 
such as China. Regarding keitai-sokin [remittance by asking 
visitors to carry money into the country], it is said that 
"control cannot be effectively enforced unless visits are also 
prohibited" (stated by a senior MOF official). If the 
government should enforce stricter checking of Korean residents 
in Japan, there is a danger the issue may develop into a serious 
human rights issue. 
  It has been firmly stated that enforcement of such 
regulations should be based on the "UN resolution." It has also 
been pointed out that if China should exercise its veto right, 
and if Japan, the United States, and the ROK should decide on 
imposing their own sanctions, "control would hardly be 
effective" (stated by a senior MOF official). 
<H5>  Trade Control </H5>
  It is stipulated in the ACFEFT that "if it should be deemed 
that maintenance of international peace and security is 
hampered," the government can control foreign trade by 
authorizing the minister of the Ministry of International Trade 
and Industry [MITI] to issue permits. MITI takes the position 
that "there are no legal impediments at all to imposing 
sanctions connected with trade." Should the United Nations 
decide on commodities on which sanctions will be imposed, the 
government will deal with the issue by enforcing the ordinance 
on controlling export and import trade. 
  In 1993, Japan exported to the DPRK such commodities as 
textile products, vehicles, and household appliances, amounting 
to approximately $220 million, and imported from the DPRK such 
commodities as men's suits, mushrooms, and fish amounting to 
approximately $250 million. "Since both exports and imports 
amounted to a relatively small sum, it will not decisively 
damage the DPRK even if its contacts with Japan were cut off" 
(stated by a MITI source). 
  Total DPRK exports reached $1.29 billion while imports 
reached $1.52 billion (according to an estimate of the Japan 
External Trade Organization [JETRO] in 1992). Major trade 
partners are China, Japan, and the former Soviet Union. Its 
trade with the former Soviet Union, including crude oil, has 
dropped sharply since 1991. It has been noted that "since North 
Korea is suffering from a serious shortage of energy and 
foodstuffs, it would be a serious blow if sanctions were to be 
imposed on such commodities as oil and grains" (according to a 
Foreign Ministry source). Since most of these commodities are 
imported through China, it is expected that the "efficiency of 
the sanctions will depend largely on how China deals with the 
issue." 
  Control of Exchanges 
  In 1992, 15,129 Korean residents in Japan reentered Japan 
after visiting North Korea, and 4,287 Japanese visited North 
Korea. Meanwhile, a total of 756 Koreans from North Korea 
visited Japan. 
  Due to the Rangoon incident in 1983, as well as the Korean 
Airlines aircraft explosion accident in 1991, the government has 
taken the following measures: prohibition of contacts with North 
Korean diplomats, and of government officials' visits to North 
Korea; stricter examination of applications by North Korean 
civilians for entry into Japan; and prohibition of exchanges of 
flights by chartered planes between the two countries. 
  The government is also studying the possibility of rejecting 
reentry to Japan of those Korean residents of Japan who are 
currently visiting their home towns in North Korea. However, it 
has been pointed out that "it will be against humanity to reject 
reentry to those Koreans who have resided in Japan as members of 
Japanese society." Therefore, "it will be impossible to 
prohibit Korean residents from visiting their home towns." 
<H5>  Actions To Prevent Maritime Activities </H5>
  If the United Nations adopts a resolution that, for the 
purpose of ensuring economic sanctions, moves should be made to 
prevent maritime activities, it can be expected that the U.S. 
fleet and other units will request Japan's logistic support such 
as refueling. In this case, however, it is pointed out that "the 
Self-Defense Forces [SDF] Law should be revised so as to clearly 
state the SDF's authority" (according to a Defense Agency [DA] 
source). It is also anticipated that Japan and the United 
States may sign an "acquisition and cross-servicing agreement 
(ACAS)." 
  Moreover, since no existing laws have any regulations on 
conducting maritime inspections, such as boarding 
investigations, it will be impossible to carry out such 
inspections "unless there should be legislation of new laws 
similar to the UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) Cooperation 
Bill" (according to the same DA source). Nevertheless, in that 
case, it is feared the new law may be contrary to the 
Constitution, which prohibits acts of collective self-defense.

  [Text] Russia has planned to construct storage tanks for 
radioactive waste leaking from its nuclear-powered submarines 
with financial assistance from Japan, but their construction has 
largely been delayed, and as of 2 April, no prospects are seen 
for their construction. This delay has fueled fears that Russia 
might resume the dumping of radioactive waste into the Sea of 
Japan. Faced with this situation, Japan has proposed: 1) in the 
first stage, it provide approximately 100-500 million yen in 
financial assistance to Russia for the construction of tanks 
with storage capacity of 2,000 tons of radioactive waste during 
April in Vladivostok, and 2) in the second stage, it provide 
approximately 500-1,000 million yen in financial assistance to 
Russia for the construction of radioactive- waste processing 
facilities within one-half year. Japan is now awaiting Russia's 
answer. 
  The Russian side says the answer to Japan has been delayed 
because of the time-consuming coordination of views between the 
central government and the Maritime Kray local government. 
  Japan has repeatedly asked Russia to speedily coordinate 
domestic views both in Tokyo and Moscow, and it is highly 
doubtful that the construction of storage tanks in the first 
stage will be completed within April. A Foreign Ministry source 
expresses deep concern over the delay in constructing the 
storage tanks, saying, "Russia is responsible for the delay." 
  Last October, Russia stopped dumping the radioactive waster 
into the Sea of Japan. It has since stored the radioactive waste 
in TNT-5 tanker (with the capacity of storing 500 tons) and 
TNT-27 tanker (with the capacity of storing 1,500 tons) in 
Vladivostok. 
  The two obsolete tankers are closer to reaching their 
limits, 
raising the fear of the tankers leaking radioactive waste into 
the sea. The Committee on Check of Radioactive Safety in the 
Maritime Kray local government recommended to the governor on 31 
March that the dumping of radioactive waster into the Sea of 
Japan be resumed beginning May when ice begins to thaw. 
  Japan, fearing that if Russia resumes the dumping of 
radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan, it would fan 
anti-Russia feelings among the Japanese, is continuing to urge 
Russia to speedily coordinate its domestic views.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI] have taken pains for the 
early resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that 
have been suspended since they were broken off at the February 
Japan-U.S. summit talks. The government announced a package of 
external economic measures in March, and Foreign Minister Hata 
and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor are set to hold 
talks in Morocco. Just when the two countries were about to 
take steps to resume the framework talks, the prime minister 
expressed his intention to step down. A majority of Japanese 
officials in Kasumigaseki believe that with the prime minister 
announcing his resignation, "clues to the resumption of the 
framework talks have disappeared and the prime minister's 
resignation is a negative factor in improving Japan-U.S. 
relations" (according to a senior MITI official). The 
possibility is growing that Japan-U.S. tensions sparked by their 
trade friction could be prolonged. 
  It remains unclear whether Foreign Minister Hata will now 
visit Morocco. A senior Foreign Ministry official said, "even 
if the foreign minister goes ahead with his planned visit to 
Morocco, we do not know how the United States will treat a 
foreign minister who is about to resign." A top MITI official 
said if a new foreign minister visits Morocco, "he would be hard 
pressed to negotiate with Mr. Kantor." In any case, the prime 
minister's resignation is inevitably expected to have an adverse 
impact on resumption of the framework talks. 
  The Japanese Government had intended to use the Hata-Kantor 
talks as an opportunity to sound out Mr. Kantor, who is in 
charge of the framework talks, on the U.S. assessment of the 
package of external economic measures; how it plans to resume 
the framework talks; and specifically how Japan should move 
forward the three priority sectors of insurance, government 
procurement, and automobiles-auto parts to satisfy U.S. demands 
for resuming the framework talks. The Foreign Ministry takes 
the view that if the Hata-Kantor talks are shelved, there will 
be no cabinet ministerial contact between the two countries 
before "June, when the ministerial talks of the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are held" (according 
to a senior Foreign Ministry official). Hence, momentum for 
resuming the framework talks is likely to come a long time after. 
  The government has planned to map out a package of other 
external measures by the end of June, but the future of the 
package remains unclear. Continued tax cuts and deregulation 
are an issue, the solution of which requires a difficult process 
of opinion coordination and political leadership. A Foreign 
Ministry official said, "There is growing concern that if the 
government is unstable, it will have an adverse impact on 
mapping out the package." 
  The personal relationship between Prime Minister Hosokawa 
and 
President Clinton was good because they took office on the 
platform of "reforms." Although the recent Japan-U.S. summit 
talks broke off, it has not hurt their personal relationship of 
trust, and the U.S. administration takes the rather firm view 
that "Japanese bureaucrats stand in the way of resolving 
bilateral issues." There is a possibility, however, that the 
United States will step up its criticism of Japanese bureaucrats 
after Mr. Hosokawa resigns as prime minister, clouding prospects 
for improved Japan-U.S. relations.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Resignation of Hosokawa Cabinet and </F>
Expectations of the Successor Cabinet"] 
  [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa suddenly announced 
his resignation as prime minister. He did this to assume 
responsibility for a Diet deadlock caused by suspicions 
surrounding his receipt of political funds which has prevented 
the discussion of the fiscal year 1994 budget for one month. 
However, nothing was clarified at a news conference regarding 
the suspicions themselves, which are a vital point and the 
direct cause of his resignation. 
  Prime Minister Hosokawa, who called for politics that were 
fresh and easy to understand and who pledged to promote 
political reform, entered the political arena by obtaining 
overwhelming support from the Japanese people. It is ironic 
that he had to resign only eight months after he became prime 
minister due to suspicions concerning his political funds. It 
is true that the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] launched a 
strong campaign designed to undermine the Hosokawa 
administration. However, the prime minister became a target of 
suspicions concerning his political funds, and he was unable to 
give adequate explanations. Because of this, it turned out that 
his credibility was damaged. This was a fatal blow to the 
administration, whose primary goal was to realize political 
reform. 
  We have pointed out repeatedly the fact that deliberations 
on 
and the subsequent approval of the fiscal year 1994 budget were 
of vital importance to the current economic situation. We have 
been urging the prime minister to break the deadlock by allowing 
his former secretary to testify before the Diet as a witness and 
by actively disclosing documents to clarify suspicions over such 
issues as the 100 million yen loan from the Sagawa Kyubin group. 
We did this because we felt that the aforementioned 
countermeasures were the first step that the prime minister, who 
sought to realize politics that is open and easy to understand, 
should have taken. 
<H5>  Resignation Announcement Was Sudden, Lacked Explanations </H5>
  However, the prime minister maintained a firm stand. The 
fact that Hosokawa suddenly announced, without adequate 
explanations regarding the suspicions, his resignation was an 
action by a prime minister who likes doing unexpected things. 
However, we have to say that the announcement was too abrupt. 
Logically speaking, the prime minister could have decided to 
resign after paving the way for deliberations on the budget, 
which is closely linked to the people's livelihood, or in 
exchange for normalizing the Diet situation. Because of its 
hastiness, however, the recent abrupt announcement gives us the 
impression that suspicions still exist. 
  In a way, by giving up deliberations on the budget, the 
prime 
minister's sudden announcement appears to the people to be an 
irresponsible act. The prime minister should have explained in 
clear terms what created the circumstances under which he was 
forced to resign. Now the people's distrust of politics will 
increase. Also, it leaves a bad precedent in which a prime 
minister of a nation was replaced without clarifying the truth. 
We just cannot understand why the prime minister maintained his 
cold stand from start to finish, in refusing to shed light on 
the suspicions. 
  We expected that Japanese politics would be refreshed and 
become capable of settling problems by regaining the people's 
trust. In this sense, we welcomed the birth of the Hosokawa 
administration, which put an end to the LDP's one-party 
domination. The vices of the Hosokawa administration -- 
including discord within the coalition government, a lack of 
leadership, and reliance on bureaucrats -- stood out. However, 
it is regrettable that the curtain descended on the Hosokawa 
administration all too soon. It is regrettable because we 
believe that one of preconditions for getting rid of the ill 
effects of the money-mad politics -- which is known for the 
collusive ties between politicians, bureaucrats, and businessmen 
and zoku Diet members [influential Diet members concerned with 
specific issues] -- is to have a non-LDP administration for a 
while. 
  The birth of the Hosokawa administration changed in one 
stroke the postwar political system--in which the LDP, which 
benefited from the 1955 regime of Japanese politics, and the 
Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] played central roles. 
It drove both parties into a de facto dissolution and started 
the realignment of the political world. The eight-month rule of 
the Hosokawa administration was of great significance in that 
the politics of the LDP collapsed and that the realignment of 
the political world actually began. The realization of 
political reform, which was the Hosokawa administration's 
greatest task, and the liberalization of the rice market are the 
coalition government's achievements which symbolize the end of 
postwar politics. 
  Conversely, however, the fact is that the political reform 
measures were approved after twists and turns weakened the 
centripetal force that had united the Hosokawa administration. 
This brought the divided opinions--which existed within the 
coalition government over fundamental policies such as tax 
reform and other important tasks, including the realignment of 
the political world and the adoption of measures concerning 
general elections--to the attention of the public. Disputes 
over the concept of a national welfare tax, the formation of a 
new new party, and other issues weakened the foundation of the 
Hosokawa administration and became the causes of Hosokawa's 
resignation. 
<H5>  The Possibility of Reorganizing the Coalition by Attaching </H5>
Importance to Policies 
  Because of the unexpected announcement of the prime 
minister's resignation, the government has to settle two issues 
in a hurry. First, the government has to start Diet 
deliberations on the 1994 budget and approve it as soon as 
possible. Although a tentative budget which is good for 50 days 
was approved, the approval of the 1994 budget, which contains 
economic measures, is a matter of urgency. Needless to say, 
Prime Minister Hosokawa should clarify the truth about the 100 
billion yen loan and other matters that hampered Diet 
deliberations on the 1994 budget. But the LDP no longer needs 
to insist on linking these issues to budget discussions. The 
LDP bears the responsibility of immediately starting budget 
deliberations. 
  Second, following Prime Minister Hosokawa's decision to step 
down, the coalition is faced with the task of selecting the next 
prime minister and his cabinet members. During the LDP's 
domination, which continued for many years, a prime minister (or 
LDP president) was selected in rotation from different LDP 
factions because that party had the majority of seats in the 
Diet. However, the next prime minister will be chosen from the 
coalition parties. Will the coalition parties be able to 
maintain the coalition government? Will they return power to 
the LDP? Will a new coalition group form the next 
administration by inviting the LDP to join it? Forming the 
framework of the next administration is a precondition which 
needs to be clarified prior to answering these questions. 
  The Hosokawa administration was not necessarily able to meet 
the people's expectations when it was formed because the 
coalition parties did not share common views on important 
policies except for political reform. In this sense, the 
parties that will form the next cabinet need to have similar 
policies, characteristics, and political lines. It is wrong for 
the coalition parties to attempt to maintain the coalition 
government or for the LDP to aim to recapture political power 
merely for the sake of taking power. If they did that, the 
realignment of the political world will be nothing but an 
attempt to gain enough numbers or enough seats in the Diet. 
  The formation of the next administration will have a major 
impact on the future of Japan. The situation should be settled 
by attaching importance to policies and the opinions of the 
people. Who will become the next prime minister is a secondary 
issue. The task of political parties and political leaders is 
to clearly explain to the people what kind of policies they will 
promote. They also need to come up with an ideal combination of 
political parties to promote their policies as a coalition 
group. It is a good opportunity for political parties to get 
rid of the framework of the coalition versus the LDP and thereby 
to form a coalition government by attaching importance to policy 
issues.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Stepping Down of Prime Minister Hosokawa Is </F>
Inevitable"] 
  [Text] On 8 April, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
officially announced his intention to resign as prime minister. 
  In explaining the reason for his resignation, the prime 
minister revealed that a "new fact concerning a legal problem 
has come to light" in connection with the management of his 
personal funds which he had entrusted to one of his friends for 
several years since 1981. He added that he would take moral 
responsibility in his capacity as the country's highest-ranking 
political leader. 
  The prime minister made bold to announce a new political and 
ethical issue concern himself; this had not been mentioned in 
arguments over the so-called "Hosokawa suspicions," which 
include his 100 million yen loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin 
company. He cited the new issue as the reason why he will 
resign as top state leader. In a sense, this approach left a 
clean impression. 
  However, let us think about this for a while. How many 
people in Japan are satisfied with the reason the prime minister 
gave for his resignation? 
  Over the past several months, Prime Minister Hosokawa 
continued to refuse calls by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] 
and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] for his cooperation in 
revealing the truth regarding his 100million yen loan from 
Sagawa Kyubin and the alleged purchase of shares in Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), which he reiterated was 
conducted by his late father-in-law. Specifically, the prime 
minister has rejected demands that new documents concerning the 
suspicions be submitted to the Diet and that Masatoshi 
Miyama--former secretary to the prime minister whom the prime 
minister himself admitted was deeply involved in those 
activities--be summoned to the Diet as a sworn witness. 
<H5>  A Palliative Reason for Resignation </H5>
  We had asked why the prime minister refused to cooperate 
with 
the opposition parties in summoning his former secretary if he 
denied all allegations and had no qualms of conscience. 
Moreover, we maintained that the prime minister should have 
positively dispelled suspicions surrounding himself and put 
state affairs, including budget deliberations, on the right 
track as soon as possible. 
  Nevertheless, the prime minister had stuck to his refusal to 
summon his former secretary to the Diet. When the prospects for 
breaking the impasse in Diet business became quite uncertain, he 
had no choice but to step down. 
  Judging from these circumstances, it is quite obvious that 
the direct reason for the prime minister's resignation lies in 
"Hosokawa suspicions" themselves, which have been discussed at 
Diet sessions. 
  Nevertheless, the prime minister's stance of bringing up 
another case, of which he cannot give clear details, and citing 
it as the reason for his resignation is far from "clean"; it is 
nothing other than palliative. 
  The prime minister is to resign. However, it does not follow 
that suspicions regarding the prime minister have been cleared. 
It is unforgivable to use the resignation for "concealing 
suspicions." The prime minister bears political and moral 
responsibility to cooperate in making public the truth regarding 
all issues of concern, including the new item he has brought up, 
in the future as well. 
  Amid the public outcry over corruption concerning 
money-oriented politics under the LDP administration, the 
Hosokawa coalition administration was established under the 
banner of "political reform." Prime Minister Hosokawa is, so to 
speak, a "child of political reform," whose largest mission is 
the carrying out of political reform. The prime minister 
gallantly emerged at the forefront of the political arena, 
enjoying the expectations and trust of the general public, who 
were quite disgusted at the LDP's tainted, corrupt politics and 
maximized their distrust of politics. 
  We cannot help saying it is an irony of history that Prime 
Minister Hosokawa himself stumbled due to his own problems 
concerning political ethics, and that he has been forced to step 
down, digging his own grave. 
  The prime minister himself probably feels regret. However, 
for the people whose hopes have been disappointed, the current 
situation is probably more than they can possibly bear. 
  Although it seems that we are trying to attack an already 
overwhelmed prime minister who announced his intention to 
resign, we have one more thing to say. His receipt of a 100 
million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, alleged purchase of NTT 
shares, and the new issue regarding management of his personal 
funds are incidents which occurred several years before Mr. 
Hosokawa accepted the offer to become prime minister. 
  At a time when the Sagawa scandal became a focus of 
attention 
and the scandal involving former LDP Vice President Kanemaru 
gave a severe shock to the political world, why did he make the 
decision to become prime minister before closely examining his 
own private affairs? 
  Although the prime minister had a close relationship with 
one 
of the central figures of the Sagawa scandal involving persons 
in the center of the political world, and he acknowledged the 
existence of a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa, he became the 
master of the "political reform administration." We are 
completely baffled by the ethics of such a situation. 
  When looking at the matter from a different angle, we have 
to 
point out the questionable fact that the "political reform 
administration" itself was formed centering on those who were in 
the center of the LDP's money-oriented political world, and that 
they still occupy leading posts even after the establishment of 
the administration. 
<H5>  Prime Minister Hosokawa's Last, Valuable Legacy </H5>
  "The stepping down of Prime Minister Hosokawa" has proved 
that the inverse logic of the situation--that as long as the 
prime minister masquerades under the good name of "political 
reform" and endorses "political reform," he is exempt from 
responsibility for his past misdeeds--is unjustifiable. 
  The selection of a "successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa" 
will probably face difficulties in connection with a struggle of 
party interests among the coalition parties. The parties 
concerned should decide on a new administration to replace the 
Hosokawa administration while keeping the above in mind as Prime 
Minister Hosokawa's valuable legacy. 
  Following the prime minister's declaration to step down, the 
Hosokawa administration will come to an end only eight months 
after its inauguration. 
  The administration has been generally regarded from its 
inception as an interim administration for materializing 
political reform. It was still unable to pave the way for 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget after enacting political 
reform bills. The administration will go out of power after 
truly carrying out its mission as an "administration that 
carries out one task." 
  LDP-led administrations tackled political reform for the 
past 
six years, but failed to carry it out. Both the Kaifu and 
Miyazawa administrations collapsed due to their failure to carry 
out political reform. 
  While experiencing many twists and turns, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa, at any rate, maintained the unity of a carriage being 
pulled by eight horses [seven parties and one parliamentary 
group of the coalition] under the banner of "political reform," 
and carried out the enactment of political reform bills, which 
the LDP administrations were unable to do. We should 
straightforwardly appraise this achievement. 
  There was little possibility that without Mr. Hosokawa, 
seven 
parties and one parliamentary group could have been united amid 
complicated bargaining concerning party interests and policies 
in the course of establishing the coalition administration. 
Taking this into consideration, we are sure that Mr. Hosokawa 
will leave his name in history as a person who brought about a 
great change in postwar politics by putting an end to the LDP 
administration which had enjoyed one-party rule for 38 years. 
  Among the achievements of the "Hosokawa administration," for 
which the people could not cherish expectations under the LDP 
administration, are the following: the opening of the rice 
market; a new sense of history, which neighboring nations highly 
evaluated; and the adoption of welfare policies which reflect 
the voices of labor groups. 
  The Hosokawa administration, which has ushered in a new wind 
of "change" in Japan's politics, is to close its short life. 
However, a political vacuum and stagnation in state affairs are 
no longer unforgivable. At this juncture, we would like to urge 
each party and parliamentary group not to waste time by vainly 
pursuing party interests and polices, but to make efforts to 
establish a new administration as soon as possible.

  [Text] SANKEI SHIMBUN conducted a survey in late March of 
59 members of the Diet belonging to Sakigake [Harbinger], the 
Japan New Party [JNP], and the United Socialist Democratic Party 
[USDP] on the future realignment of political parties, including 
the formation of a parliamentary group and a new political 
party, which has now been argued within the ruling coalition. 
The results of the survey were compiled by 3 April. 
  Sakigake and the JNP have formed an intraparliamentary group 
within the House of Representatives. Because all Sakigake 
members refused to respond to the survey, SANKEI SHIMBUN 
received responses only from some members of the JNP and USDP. 
In the survey, a little less than one-half of the respondents 
supported a merger between Sakigake and the JNP, which is 
currently a focal issue, and not many supported the idea of 
forming a new party among the ruling parties. 
  Thirteen clearly stated that the JNP and Sakigake "should 
merge into one party," while only one strongly opposed the 
merger. Eleven said, "I do not know," indicating that they are 
wavering in their judgment. The results show that although the 
JNP and Sakigake formed a parliamentary group in the lower house 
on the condition that they would merge into one party in the 
future, the majority of the JNP members have begun to feel 
scruples about the merger due to confrontation between the 
leaders of the two parties over a cabinet reshuffle and 
differences in opinions on methods to promote political 
realignment. 
  Concerning the ideal structure of the ruling parties in the 
future, nine of the respondents said the parties should form a 
"parliamentary group," four favored the idea of the ruling 
parties merging into a "new party," and one said they should 
only "cooperate in elections." The results show that one-half 
of the respondents think it is necessary for the ruling parties 
to strengthen their unity in some ways. On the other hand, nine 
said it was too early to consider forming a parliamentary group. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has proposed forming a 
policy study group among the ruling parties. Asked whether they 
would participate in the policy study group, 10 said they would, 
while 12 said, "I do not want to participate" or "I do not 
know." Those who said, "I do not know" pointed out that "the 
prime minister has not proposed forming a policy study group." 
  They were also asked what would constitute the "nucleus of 
future political realignment." Most of the respondents said 
"foreign and security policies" and some mentioned "tax 
reforms." But as a whole, their answers to this question had an 
erratic pattern, indicating that it has not yet been decided 
which policies should constitute the nucleus of the political 
realignment. 
  SANKEI SHIMBUN conducted the survey in late March. It sent 
questionnaires to 59 members of both houses of the Diet 
belonging to Sakigake, the JNP, and the USDP (42 JNP, 15 
Sakigake, and two USDP members) and received responses from 26 
JNP and two USDP members. At a general meeting of party members 
on 30 March, Sakigake decided not to respond to the survey, 
concluding that "because now is a delicate time, it is better 
not to respond."

  [Text] The "Foreign Policy Forum" headed by House of 
Representatives member Hajime Ishii, a ruling coalition policy 
study panel, held its second round of meetings in the Diet on 6 
April. Issei Inoue, vice chairman of the ruling Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], briefed the forum on the 
results of his recent visit to China and the situation in North 
Korea. 
  During the meeting, Mr. Inoue said: "In an effort to resolve 
the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development, I 
propose sending a delegation composed of legislators from the 
ruling coalition parties to the United States, China, North and 
South Korea. I also want to work for the stability of Northeast 
Asia by arranging a meeting between President Clinton and North 
Korean President Kim Il-song." 
  It was decided at the meeting that senior legislators of the 
ruling coalition parties would discuss the proposal.

  [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] 
announced on 7 April that it plans to include mobile telephone 
systems (car and portable phones) in projects to improve 
communications infrastructures in developing countries which it 
plans to support through its official development assistance 
(ODA) programs. The MOPT made its decision upon receiving a 
report compiled the same day by the Research Council on the 
Utilization of Wireless Systems for the Improvement of 
Communications Infrastructures in Developing Countries 
(chairman: Naohisa Goto, Tokyo Institute of Technology 
professor), which is a private study panel under the director 
general of the MOPT's International Affairs Department. The 
ministry plans to launch specific projects as early as within 
fiscal year 1995.

  [Text] The contents of the "Draft Policy Outline on Reform 
of the Tax System," which the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
[SDPJ] has drawn up to prepare for discussions on the issue, 
have been revealed. In addition to indicating it is ready to 
reexamine the balance among taxes on income, consumption, and 
assets, the party has also suggested that, in view of the aging 
of society, "the times require a shift in the balance with more 
weight on consumption taxes," as well as a permanent source of 
revenue to make up for shortfalls resulting from income tax 
cuts. In its draft policy outline, the SDPJ wants, as 
conditions for its endorsement of a consumption tax rise, a 
strategic welfare policy to be drawn up, the implementation of 
administrative and fiscal reforms, the removal of current 
shortcomings in consumption tax, and the redressing of 
inequities in the tax system. 
  In the draft document, the party says: "It is inevitable 
that indirect taxes will be the major sources of revenue." 
  It also stresses the need to raise indirect taxes to help 
finance local government welfare programs. However, the party 
fails to touch on the issue of turning the consumption tax into 
a "tax intended for the financing of pensions program," although 
this has been a party demand in the past. The omission seems to 
be part of the party's attempt to find a compromise with its 
ruling coalition partners, so the draft outline can be expected 
to have a big impact on debates within the ruling coalition 
parties' council on reform of the tax system. 
  As a prerequisite to discussing tax reform, the SDPJ 
document 
stresses the following points must be considered in addition to 
working on a strategic policy for social welfare: 1) to redress 
inequities in the tax system completely, such as through 
consolidated taxation; 2) to remove shortcomings in the current 
consumption tax, such as by reexamining the simplified tax 
system and relaxing the regressive nature of consumption tax; 3) 
to redouble efforts to promote administrative and fiscal reform, 
such as through spending cuts; 4) to maintain taxation on land 
and rationalize taxation on assets; and 5) to improve indirect 
taxation as an independent source of revenue for local 
governments. 
  The draft outline also points out that "we must tackle the 
problem of securing necessary revenue sources, taking into 
account the effect on revenue sources of the implementation of 
administrative and fiscal reforms and the redressing of 
inequities in the tax system." 
  The SDPJ is thereby tacitly acknowledging the need to seek 
new revenue sources to offset shortfalls due to income tax cuts 
and to finance future social welfare. The draft outline also 
says that "considering the likely details of any future welfare 
policy, it seems inevitable that indirect taxation will be a 
revenue source," indicating that the party believes there must 
be a debate on the issue of a increasing consumption tax. 
  On the balance among income, consumption, and assets taxes, 
the draft outline clearly states that "the times require a shift 
in the balance with added weight on consumption tax, which 
should be levied at the time goods are purchased." 
  The outline also stresses the need to debate the issue of 
raising consumption tax, saying "it is the responsibility of the 
party as the largest group in the ruling coalition to hold 
in-depth discussion on whether to make a consumption tax rise 
the centerpiece of taxation reform once its shortcomings have 
been corrected. 
  In the recent uproar over the announcement of a national 
welfare tax, the SDPJ opposed its introduction, saying "it has 
not been discussed sufficiently." 
  In particular, the party firmly asserted that the revenue 
generated by the consumption tax rise should be used "to finance 
the pensions program." The party, however, failed to touch on 
this issue in the draft outline, merely saying it plans to "make 
a constructive, responsible judgment on such matters as the 
propriety of designating taxes for certain purposes." 
  The party has clearly tried to avoid clashing with the other 
ruling coalition parties, which oppose the SDPJ's idea. 
Instead, it makes only a passing reference to a 
"medicare-oriented" approach on the issue of improving welfare. 
It stresses the need to study plans to introduce a local 
consumption tax which have emerged among other ruling coalition 
parties. It says that, from the point of view of the local 
governments which actually handle the services, it is essential 
to "improve consumption taxation (indirect taxes) which places 
the emphasis on local governments." 
  As far as income tax cuts are concerned, the SDPJ spells out 
in its draft outline that it plans to maintain the fixed tax 
rate reduction in the drastic tax system reform plan at the same 
level set for this fiscal year. 
  The party also proposes to reconsider tax rate 
classifications, as well as raising the minimum taxable income, 
mainly through raising earned income deductions and basic 
deductions. 
  At the same time the draft outline proposes that the 
possibility of reducing corporate taxes should be studied. On 
the issue of securing a source of revenue to offset shortfalls 
resulting from such tax cuts, the SDPJ intends to allocate 
"revenue garnered by reviewing the corporate tax system to 
offset expected shortfalls." For example, the party proposes 
reexamining various kinds of special tax exemptions, in which 
corporations already have vested rights and interests, and a 
reduction in corporate reserves. 
  The SDPJ's draft policy outline was drawn up by the party's 
Research Commission on the Tax System (chaired by Ichiro Hino). 
The party, which holds the key to successful tax system reform, 
plans to discuss this draft outline by assembling concerned 
officials from its local chapters and holding a national 
convention of policy board chairmen and policymaking officials 
on 8-9 April.

  [Text] On 5 April, the government decided to seek the 
international community's positive understanding once again of 
Japan's position that it will maintain its "three nonnuclear 
principles" [of not producing, possessing, and introducing 
nuclear arms] in the future, and that Japan will never be armed 
with nuclear weapons in any form. On the same day, the Monju 
fast- breeder reactor, which produces plutonium, reached 
"criticality." Under this situation, the government made the 
aforementioned decision while taking into consideration the 
possibility that the "concern over Japan becoming a nuclear 
power," which lingers in connection with the suspicions over the 
DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear weapons development program, may 
crop up again. In concrete terms, the government intends to 
make its appeals concerning Japan's position as the "only nation 
in the world that has suffered atomic bombings" through various 
opportunities such as summit meetings and the public relations 
activities of embassies and legations abroad. 
  Last year, Japan's delayed decision to support the 
indefinite 
extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) created 
speculation among European nations and the United States that 
Japan "might intend to possess nuclear arms." This was the 
origin of the prevailing view that Japan "will be armed with 
nuclear weapons." 
  Moreover, in connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear 
weapons development, Britain's SUNDAY TIMES newspaper reported 
in January, "The British Ministry of Defense has completed a 
secret report that says there is a possibility that Japan will 
abandon its nonnuclear principles." In the United States, 
Defense Secretary (then Deputy Secretary) William Perry 
testified at a public hearing of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee in February, "If North Korea succeeds in producing 
nuclear weapons, the possibility that Japan, Taiwan, and South 
Korea will seek to possess nuclear arms will increase greatly." 
In this way, there have been statements pointing out the fear 
that Japan will arm itself with nuclear weapons.

  [Text] At a regular news conference on 7 April, Tetsuya 
Nishimoto, Joint Staff Council Chairman of the Self-Defense 
Forces [SDF], touched on the issue of North Korea's suspected 
development of nuclear weapons. Asked about rescuing Japanese 
staying in South Korea if the situation on the Korean peninsula 
should become tense, he said: "Our operation should not deviate 
from the law. Japanese staying there will feel relieved when a 
bill on revising the SDF Law submitted to the Diet passes 
through the Diet. I hope the bill will be adopted as early as 
possible." In this way, he expressed hopes that the bill on 
revising the SDF Law which allows the SDF to use 
government-owned planes for rescue operations will be enacted at 
an early date.

  [Text] The Patent Office is scheduled to amend the Patent 
Act in order to strengthen the system for protecting inventors' 
rights. The pillars of the amendment are: 1) the term of 
validity of the patent right should be extended by five years to 
20 years; 2) stricter conditions should be applied for invoking 
the "compulsory implementation right"--which allows the 
government to order a patent holder to allow a third person to 
use his patent for welfare purposes; and 3) the application 
limits of the patent should be extended. The Patent Office 
plans to enact the amended act by January 1995, when an 
agreement reached on trade-related aspects of intellectual 
property rights negotiations (TRIP) under the Uruguay Round of 
(GATT's) multilateral trade talks late last year will come into 
effect. The Patent Office plans to submit a bill for amending 
the act to an extraordinary Diet session in autumn. 
  In the current act, it is specified that the term of patent 
"shall be 15 years from the date of the public announcement, but 
shall not be over 20 years from the date of application for 
patent." In the amended act, it will be specified that the term 
of patent "shall expire after 20 years from the date of 
application." 
  Therefore, the maximum limits of a patent will be virtually 
changed from 15 years to 20 years, and with this change, an 
inventor's--companies or individuals--income from patent 
royalties will increase. The amended act will be applied to a 
patent request which is under examination now. 
  Under the current act, as far as patent-related medical 
supplies are concerned, it takes about 10 years for a 
pharmaceutical company to merchandise patented products, and in 
many cases the patent term expires soon after patented products 
are put on sale. It is expected that pharmaceutical companies 
will benefit from the amended act because it costs approximately 
10-15 billion yen for them to develop a new medicine. 
  In addition, in order to further protect a patent holder, 
more strict conditions for invoking the "compulsory 
implementation right"--which allows the government to order a 
patent holder to allow third persons to use the patent only for 
the public interest--will be introduced. 
  Specifically, 1) adoption of the first invention--to which 
the patent right has already been granted--should be limited to 
the purpose for "developing economically more important and more 
advanced technology," and 2) with regard to 
semiconductor-related technology, "the compulsory implementation 
right" should be invoked only for welfare and noncommercial 
purposes. 
  So far, the Japanese Government has not invoked the 
"compulsory implementation right." But among foreign companies 
which have basic patents in Japan, a critical view have been 
expressed that "Japanese companies, by waving the government's 
'compulsory implementation right' before foreign firms, tend to 
try to use it to their advantage in conducting negotiations on 
royalties of foreign companies' basic patents." The Patent 
Office believes the amended act will help to overcome this view.

  [Text] On 6 April, the Industrial Science and Technology 
Agency [ISTA] in the Ministry of International Trade Industry 
disclosed its plan to drastically review Japan industrial 
standards (JIS), which are often criticized by other countries 
as being a trade barrier. The plan is aimed at actively 
supporting efforts to standardize industrial products in Asia, 
which has become the center of the world's growth; at launching 
measures for Asia to create international standard 
specifications, and at using revised JIS as a guide to maintain 
the transparency of trade. To clarify its policy to give 
importance to consumers, the ISTA will consider abolishing 
standards which attach too much importance to manufacturers. 
The agency is to formulate a draft plan for the review by the 
end of April. After being discussed by the Japanese Industrial 
Standards Committee (chaired by Isamu Yamashita), the plan will 
be included in the eighth five-year products standardization 
program, which is to come into effect in fiscal year 1996. 
  The main pillars of the revision will be: 1) 
internationalization; 2) a shift of importance to consumers; and 
3) the flexible adjustment of JIS to new processes such as 
multimedia technology. 
  Japan has tried to internationalize its industrial standards 
primarily through adjusting them to those of the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO). However, because ISO is 
composed mainly of European countries, only 20 to 30 percent of 
JIS have so far been adjusted to ISO standards. Meanwhile, it 
is considered certain that many new products will be developed 
in Asia, a region with a strong momentum of growth, and various 
problems will crop up concerning new standards. The government 
plans to actively participate in the work to establish 
international standards by such means as promoting 
standardization mainly in Asia and strengthening efforts to have 
the ISO approve Asian standards as official ones. 
  This month, the government started discussions on the 
establishment of a system to promote standardization with the 
ASEAN Association for Standardizing Quality Control (ACCQ) 
[acronym as published], which is composed of six Southeast Asian 
nations. With reference to Japan's know-how, they will work out 
their own five-year programs for the promotion of 
standardization and will carry them out beginning April 1995. 
  Japan will also work to establish standards for such 
products 
as hearing aids and walking sticks, which are essential to 
living in an aging society and for a rich life. There are 
currently no standards for them. On the other hand, it will 
abolish standards established to promote exchanges of parts 
between manufacturers, and those for mature products such as 
sewing machine parts whose shapes are not expected to diversify 
any further.

  [Text] In a bid to further promote liberalization [in world 
trade], the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan 
[Keidanren] has compiled a report. The report stresses that in 
response to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT, both 
the Japanese Government and the private sector should make 
concerted efforts to cooperate financially and personally with 
the World Trade Organization (WTO). Commenting on the 
negotiations at the Uruguay Round, the report harshly attacks 
the Japanese Government, saying, "Japan focused its attention 
only on the rice issue and was utterly passive in the 
negotiations." The report also appeals to corporations in other 
nations "not to resort to trade methods such as managed trade." 
The report, which is entitled "The Assessment of the Conclusion 
of the Uruguay Round and Proposals for Future Tasks," has been 
compiled by both the Trade Measures Committee and the Services 
and Trade Committee of the Keidanren. It will be approved at a 
meeting of the Keidanren chairman and vice chairmen scheduled to 
be held on 11 April. 
  The report highly praises the reaffirmation of the 
multilateral free trade principle achieved with the Uruguay 
Round and the creation of the WTO as an international 
organization to promote free trade. The report, however, points 
out that the elimination of a clause on preventing roundabout 
exports left room for the dumping of exports. 
  The report proposes that the Japanese Government provide 
financial assistance to the WTO and make aggressive personnel 
contributions to that organization. The report also emphasizes 
the need for Japan to revamp its domestic laws to prepare for 
the inauguration of the WTO in January 1995. In referring to 
the United States' revival of the Super 301 provision, the 
report urges the United States "not to take one-sided trade 
measures, including the invocation of the provision," and it 
says that the revival of the Super 301 provision runs counter to 
the goal of concluding the Uruguay Round.

  [Text] Automakers including Nissan Motor Company and Toyota 
Motor Corporation have agreed with major steelmakers including 
Nippon Steel Corporation to cut the prices of steel plates, 
including surfaced-processed steel plates, by about 5,000 yen 
(about 4-6 percent) per ton beginning in April. This is the 
first time that the prices of steel plates supplied to 
automakers have been cut since 1989. Automakers, eager to 
quickly reduce their production costs, have strongly urged major 
steelmakers to lower their prices on steel plates. Major 
steelmakers have gone along with the request because of the wide 
price differentials existing between Japanese-produced plates 
and those of other nations. With the prices of steel plates set 
to be lowered, the manufacturers of rubber, nonferrous metals, 
and plastic products will certainly be pressed to lower their 
prices. Negotiations are now under way between major 
steelmakers and commercial electric appliance makers on price 
cuts, and the prices of steel plates supplied to electric 
appliance makers are expected to be lowered by about 4 percent. 
  The prices of surface-processed steel plates, cold-rolled 
steel plates, and hot-rolled steel plates will be reduced. In 
the case of cold-rolled steel plates that are used to 
manufacture car bodies, both major steelmakers and automakers 
appear to have agreed to lower their prices from 90,000 yen to 
85,000 yen per ton. 
  Automakers have adopted a concentrated purchase system under 
which they make a large purchase of steel plates which they then 
sell to their subsidiaries which manufacture auto parts. 
Automakers have pressed them to sharply cut their production 
costs in order to bolster their international competitiveness. 
Auto parts makers are increasingly voicing complaints about the 
prices of steel plates supplied by automakers that are higher 
than those on the open Japanese and foreign markets. 
  Major steelmakers which registered large deficits in their 
1993 settlement of accounts have gone along with the request.

  [Text] Electric power companies will increase their 
procurement of foreign-made products in fiscal year 1994 in 
consideration of criticism from the U.S. Trade Representative 
(USTR). Because most companies are cutting their investment in 
equipment, the ratio of foreign-made products will drastically 
increase this fiscal year. 
  The Tokyo Electric Power Company is planning to spend 59 
billion yen to purchase foreign-made goods, and this amount is 
almost 200 percent higher than that spent on this sector in 
1993. Also, the Chubu Electric Power Company, which spent 20.9 
billion yen in purchasing foreign-made equipment in 1993, 
intends to spend an additional 5-10 billion yen on equipment in 
1994. These decisions are partly because of the companies' 
intention to cooperate in easing trade frictions, but their 
primary objective is to lower investment costs through 
purchasing cost-effective foreign products. 
  Last February, the Tokyo Electric Power Company invited 
foreign companies to place bids to supply a generating turbine 
for the Yukawa hydraulic power plant (in Nagano Prefecture). 
The company intends to increase its purchases of larger 
general-purpose equipment from foreign companies. Moreover, the 
core parts of nuclear reactors and gas turbine generators -- for 
constructing the No. 6 and 7 reactors of the Kashiwazaki-Kariba 
nuclear power plant (in Niigata Prefecture) and the No. 7 and 8 
generators of the Yokohama thermal power plant--will be 
imported. The parts will be purchased from the United States 
because General Electric (GE) possesses advanced technology in 
these fields. 
  The Chubu Electric Power Company will also purchase GE-made 
gas turbine generators for the No. 3 generator of the Kawagoe 
thermal power plant. Other electric power companies intend to 
increase their imports of general-purpose goods such as optical 
fiber cables, transformers, and power-transmission wires because 
these products are expensive in Japan.

  [Text] At a news conference held after the "Monju" 
plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactor reached criticality, 
Ishiwata Takao, president of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel 
Development Corporation [Donen], disclosed that Donen is 
studying the possibility of building a "recycle experiment 
reactor" as an experiment and research reactor to replace the 
"Monju." This will allow Japan to technically handle issues of 
nuclear nonproliferation as well as environmental problems. The 
idea under consideration by Donen is that a fast breeder reactor 
and a spent-fuel reprocessing plant are constructed to 
simultaneously burn ultra-uranium elements mixed in with spent 
fuel and plutonium. This idea would remove concerns about the 
extraction of pure plutonium and its conversion into nuclear 
weapons.

"NTT Begins Preparing for Multimedia in Earnest"] 
  [Text] 123 Trillion Yen Economic Impact 
  Multimedia is no longer just a concept but is getting closer 
to becoming a reality in Japan, too. At a time when the pace of 
social innovation is said to have slowed to a sluggish crawl, 
expectations are high that the multimedia field will spawn a 
new, next-generation industry. 
  According to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' 
January report, Toward the Creation of a New Information 
Industry, by the year 2010, the market that will be created 
(in video programming, new television services, and terminal 
units) as a result of optical fiber networks will generate no 
less than an estimated 56 trillion yen. Related markets 
(including existing markets for terminal equipment and software) 
will grow to 67 trillion yen, bringing the total by the year 
2010 to 123 trillion yen. Optical fiber networks will also 
create new jobs for an estimated 2.4 million workers, to account 
for about 3.6 percent of Japan's workforce, which is expected to 
reach 27 million by 2010. 
  But will multimedia really take root in Japan? 
  On 12 January [1994], Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation president, Masashi Kojima, announced "NTT's Basic 
Ideas for the Multimedia Age." 
  The report touched on the following four points, among 
others: 1) in February 1994, NTT is expected to set up a 
multimedia promotion desk; 2) in September 1994, it will 
inaugurate a high-speed, wideband pilot backbone network (for 
intracompany office automation [OA] transmissions); 3) from 
1995, it will begin pilot multimedia services for general 
residential use, and 4) it will attempt to lower the cost for 
customers wanting to access optical fiber networks. 
  The advent of a multimedia society, though often discussed, 
is an idea that belonged to the world of fantasy in the past. 
But with the recent announcement of the basic idea by NTT, 
Japan's core information communications enterprise, that fantasy 
world seems capable of becoming reality. Related industries--in 
communications, broadcasting, cable television, computer games, 
home electronics, printed news, and publishing--are all keeping 
their eyes on NTT's movements. Last October, when one of the 
regional Bell telephone companies, Bell Atlantic, announced 
plans to purchase the foremost cable television company, 
Tele-Communications, Inc. [TCI], there was suddenly a multimedia 
boom in the United States. NTT's announcement is comparable to 
that of Bell Atlantic. 
  A closer look at NTT's multimedia plans would show that: 
  1. The role of its multimedia promotion desk is to a) 
collect 
data from all parts of the world about trends in information 
communications, b) formulate NTT's basic strategies, c) set up a 
pilot office to handle business matters, and d) establish an 
intracompany multimedia organizational structure. Rather than 
engage directly in business activities, the promotion desk will 
be responsible for preparing the way for NTT to go into the 
multimedia business. 
  2. The pilot high-speed, wideband backbone network will put 
NTT's existing nationwide, intracompany OA net into routine, 
practical use. NTT will set up new super-high-speed ATM 
(Asynchronous Transfer Mode) switch nodes for existing optical 
fiber networks at each of its bases (10 main cities, including 
Tokyo and Osaka) and test high-volume, ultra-high-speed 
transmissions of 2.4 gigabits (1 Gb = 1 billion bits) per second 
and 10 gigabits per second, as well as develop network 
applications and operational technology. 
  The backbone network will be linked to university research 
institutes and hospitals, etc., and be used for LAN [local area 
network] communications and trial transmissions of high-volume 
data files. Also to be tested are multimedia communications with 
user participation. 
  3. In pilot multimedia projects aimed at the average 
household, a model residential area will be designated and 
projects carried out in cooperation with cable television 
companies (with NTT leasing lines to them) and information 
providers [IP] (companies providing information services). 
Optical fiber cables will be laid in the designated areas to 
bring interactive television into households -- videos-on-demand 
(where users can see programs or films of their choice anytime 
they want), home-study courses, communication games 
(electronically distributed computer games) -- through a merger 
of cable television and the telephone. 
  4. NTT is aiming to lower the cost of optical access 
circuits 
into homes by the year 2000 or 2005 to levels comparable to 
current copper wiring. 
<H5>  Important Not To Lose Out to the United States </H5>
  Behind NTT's decision to announce its multimedia plans at 
this time, we see several factors: tie-ups have been occurring 
between U.S. regional Bell companies and cable television 
companies, the United States has been witnessing a multimedia 
boom, and U.S. and British information communications companies 
are expanding into a global operation. Moreover, the Ministry of 
Posts and Telecommunications, the agency overseeing activities 
in this area, has been favorable to the aggressive stance NTT is 
taking in its field. By way of background, U.S. cable television 
and telephone companies began investing in cable companies in 
Japan in 1993. That was the year TCI tied up with Sumitomo 
Corporation and invested in Suginami Cable Television. The 
second-ranking cable company in the United States, Time Warner, 
tied up with Itochu and invested in Cable Vision 21, a Fukuoka 
city cable company. And Nynex Corporation, another regional Bell 
company, tied up with Tomen Corporation and invested in a 
Yokohama television station. 
  Even before these tie-ups, regional Bell companies -- US 
West, Nynex, Southwestern Bell, and Pacific Telesis -- were 
making their way into the British cable television field. 
  If NTT were to sit quietly by watching these developments, 
there was a chance it would be left behind by multimedia trends 
in other advanced countries. No doubt it was also moved to hurry 
its multimedia strategy along from a sense that the multimedia 
industry in the United States would overpower Japan's own 
multimedia and cable industries. 
  NTT's plans with regard to multimedia as a business, 
however, 
end with its building fiber optic networks and providing circuit 
services to users, those in the cable television field and IP's. 
It is not, apparently, to enter into program production or the 
field of terminal equipment. Although NTT announced in January 
[1994] that it had invested in General Magic, a company that 
boasts the best technology in communications software 
development anywhere, the aim behind this tie-up is to build a 
communications network that can easily be linked up to the next 
generation of information terminals. 
  As multimedia gains in popularity, what form can we expect 
to 
see it take in Japan? First of all, we can probably expect to 
see it catching on with businesses and in the office rather than 
the average household. In the United States, cable television is 
already widely subscribed to and the expectation is that it be 
equally popular among businesses as in the home. This is not so 
in Japan's case. 
  For business use, we can imagine, for example, several 
enterprises, though located apart from each other, all watching 
the same screen to come up with joint designs for machinery and 
parts. The same with posters. Revisions and changes can be 
worked out on the spot, even though the client and advertising 
firm are in different locations. We can also expect video 
conferencing to take place, bringing a greater sense of 
proximity and immediacy to users than is now possible. Among its 
many other possibilities, multimedia might also be used in 
employee education and the introduction of new products within 
companies. 
<H5>  Japan's Technology Is Best in World </H5>
  NTT's optical communications technology is the best in the 
world. Though still in the experimental stage, during the autumn 
of 1993, NTT succeeded in 100 gigabit per second optical 
transmissions, thus setting a world record for speed. Neither 
AT&amp;T nor BT (British Telecom) has as yet rivaled NTT in 
carrying 
out such ultra-high-speed transmissions. 
  When it tests its backbone network this September [1994] 
with 
optical transmissions of 2.4 gigabits per second and 10 gigabits 
per second, NTT will again be setting a world speed record. Even 
AT&amp;T is only now at the stage where it will start testing 
transmissions this year of 2.4 gigabits per second. 
  In size, Japan has the second-largest communications and 
terminal equipment markets in the world, and those in the 
communications industry in other major countries, including the 
world's leading manufacturers, are eager to enter these markets. 
As indicated earlier, the process has already begun, with U.S. 
cable companies entering Japan's cable business. Also occurring 
more frequently are tie-ups between Japanese and U.S. 
manufacturers for the development of next-generation information 
terminals (to handle a mix of voice, data, and images at high 
speeds). Cases in point include tie-ups between Apple Computer 
and Sharp, Microsoft and Toshiba, and AT&amp;T and NEC. In the 
area 
of multimedia games, tie-ups have also occurred between 
Microsoft and Sega Enterprises, Silicon Graphics and Nintendo, 
and AT&amp;T and Matsushita. 
  NTT, however, seems to be working as a kind of deterrent for 
foreign communications, cable companies, and manufacturers, 
somewhat tempering the ambitions of foreign companies toward 
Japan's markets. In addition to its strength in terms of 
technical development and ability to create a national network, 
it is a business enterprise backed by some 58 million telephone 
subscribers. Parenthetically, U.S. and British communications 
companies are said to have made a clean sweep on the European 
continent, capturing its markets in data and mobile 
communications. 
  Leading U.S. cable companies are very powerful. TCI and Time 
Warner link their respective operating regions together by 
satellite to broadcast programs throughout the United States. 
TCI has 13 million subscribers nationwide. Moreover, wideband 
cable networks are continuing to grow. One reason is that cable 
companies, while having monopolistic management rights in their 
regions, are not under fee restrictions. Satellite communication 
is also growing. The national character, which seems to indicate 
a liking for direct visual media, as testified by the world 
preeminence of U.S. television and film industries, can be 
considered a factor as well. Thus, as of the present, U.S. 
software and know-how to create programs are far more advanced 
than Japan's. 
  On the other hand, the United States is behind in 
modernizing 
(digitalizing, opticalizing) its regional telephone networks -- 
one of the aftereffects of AT&amp;T's breakup. Although the 
Clinton 
administration is pushing the idea of building an information 
highway and regional Bell companies are putting their efforts 
into modernizing their present communications networks, there 
will not be enough wideband networks to be sufficient for 
multimedia. Regional Bell companies do, however, have more funds 
at their disposal than cable companies and are moving to buy up 
the latter and acquire their wideband networks and through these 
networks to go into multimedia services. 
  In Japan, the work of modernizing networks is progressing 
not 
only in the long-distance communications field, but in regional 
communications as well. The conversion of subscriber circuits to 
optical fiber in central Tokyo is slated for completion by 1995 
and in the business districts of large cities like Tokyo, Osaka, 
and Nagoya by 1997. Also slated for completion are optical fiber 
networks for suburban residential areas by the year 2010 or 2015. 
  In contrast to the progress that is being made in 
modernizing 
its telephone networks, Japan is behind when it comes to 
developing wideband cable television networks. The reason is 
that cable companies until now have operated within local, 
administrative units such as municipal districts. At the end of 
fiscal 1992, of the 123 municipal cable companies (accounting 
for 1.075 million subscriber households), only 24 (roughly 20 
percent) were operating in the black (if we include 
hard-to-reach reception areas, we are talking about some 56,437 
cable television facilities and 8.34 million subscriber 
households). 
  In December 1993, the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications released a report, Measures for 
Developing CATV, with the aim of strengthening the 
management base of cable television companies, stimulating 
businesses to accommodate multimedia, and expanding wideband 
networks. Such aims depend mainly on plans to 1) expand the 
geographic scope of cable television enterprises; 2) move cable 
television companies toward the communications business; 3) put 
"model" pilot undertakings, like videos-on-demand, which 
accommodate the merger of communications and broadcasting, into 
operation; and 4) bring in the capital, technology and software 
know-how of foreign enterprises to foster the spread of cable 
television. 
  In addition to the cost of investing in circuits, the cable 
television business has been troubled by the slow growth in 
subscriber numbers due to a lack of interesting programs. Though 
it has been possible for cable companies to gain approval to 
enter the telecommunications business, there have been very few 
examples of this happening because of the heavy burden of 
investing in new equipment and facilities. Taking such 
circumstances into account, the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications seems to have set out on a course of 
nurturing the cable television industry, the goal being to 
improve management by effecting economies of scale in 
advertising, cable installation, the procurement of video 
programs, etc. 
  In response to these new measures, two Nagoya cable 
television companies, Cable Network and Central Cable 
Television, announced their joint merger at the start of 1994. 
With roughly 300,000 subscribers, the newly formed company will 
have the largest customer base in Japan. In the future, there is 
a strong possibility that cable television business interests 
will move in the direction of operating multiple CATV stations, 
which require large amounts of capital, in order to develop MSO 
(multiple system operator) companies. In the long term, we can 
expect to see more and more entries into the communications 
field through MSO's and greater regional communications 
competition. For cable television companies to begin offering 
multimedia services, however, it seems that for awhile they will 
have to rely on NTT circuits. It seems highly likely that it 
will be in this form -- using NTT's circuits -- that cable 
television companies will provide programs to their subscribers. 
The conversion of NTT's trunk line to an optical fiber network 
is already nearing completion. 
<H5>  Putting Energy Into Developing Software </H5>
  With Japan being so much behind the United States in the 
software field, will there really be a multimedia boom in this 
country? Considering the high educational level of the 
Japanese, the emergence of all sorts of creative and original 
programs and commercial messages (CM) on broadcast television, 
and the extraordinary energy that has been thrown into applied 
technology and the creation of commercial products in the past, 
the development of programs and software to meet demands seems 
quite possible. Again, with Japan's preeminence in optical 
technology both as it relates to hardware and transmissions, the 
construction of the next generation of optical fiber 
communication networks is steadily moving ahead. Timely 
investments and detailed studies of demand are important in 
building optical fiber networks; however, when the important 
factors are considered, it seems very likely that the future, as 
seen in mid-range terms, will hold for Japan the flowering of 
multimedia.

<F P=106> [Article by Jiro Kokuryo, assistant professor, Keio </F>
University Business School: "Pressing Need To Reconsider Rate 
Structure"] 
  [Text] We are entering a period when we can expect to see 
users throughout the world turn to multimedia communication 
systems and distributed processing computer networks. Technical 
discussion on this subject is often tinted in rosy colors. But a 
business economics analysis shows that without fundamental 
changes in Japanese telecommunications structure, it will be 
useless to wait for the coming of the multimedia age in Japan. 
  In a NEW YORK TIMES special report, which appeared last 
November, Japan was said to have already fallen considerably 
behind the United States in networking. In a country without a 
long acquaintance with keyboard culture, Japan's information 
system is not only being held back by attempts to maintain the 
status quo for telephone services but also by Japan's outdated 
telecommunications system. Without reforming its current system, 
attempts to lay optical fiber lines will be a waste of the 
investors' money, and the dream of having high-speed information 
networks will probably go unrealized. This writer would urge the 
following reforms. 
<H5>  Hampered by Old Ways </H5>
  First, current telephone charges are based on a meter-rate 
system, which adds sharply to the cost of longer calls. This 
system is the first thing that has to be revised. Otherwise the 
system, as it exists, is hardly suitable for the transmission of 
large amounts of data. The ISDN [integrated services digital 
network] charge, for example, for sending 90 seconds of 
high-resolution images (at an estimated 10 megabits per second), 
using the conversion rate for 64 kilobits per second per 
telephone line, would run up a bill of 47,000 yen. Even if the 
amount of information were cut down to one-tenth of this by 
reducing the quality of the resolution, it would still cost 
4,700 yen and cannot compete with videos. We can hardly expect 
the multimedia age to come to us with this sort of fee structure. 
  Second, it is necessary to do away with fencing policies 
that 
divide the field along regional, city, service, and 
international lines to prohibit territorial crossovers. In the 
United States, the ability of businesses to cross over regional 
lines has encouraged the diversification of services and the 
lowering of fees. Regional fencing in Japan has the opposite 
effect, protecting NTT's monopoly and obstructing the entry of 
competition into high-level services where communication has to 
be controlled from start to finish. 
  Third, abolishing restrictions on the resale or leasing of 
lines (connections between private and public lines) should also 
be considered. Use restrictions, besides reducing the incentive 
to develop ways to apply new technology, serve as deterrents to 
developing a rich array of telecommunication services through 
competition. 
  Linked to the fact that the Japanese have fallen behind in 
the use of communication networks is the failure of domestic 
equipment manufacturers to develop suitable products for the 
market. It is symbolic of this failure that all of the network 
equipment for communication services known as "frame relays" 
that have been introduced in the last year or two are 
foreign-made. The problem isn't that Japan is technically weak. 
Rather, unlike the United States, where products are actively 
developed to meet actual demand, in Japan, the development of 
new products has to meet "projected" demand. But that sort of 
demand may not materialize under the type of restrictions and 
fees that currently exist. The problem is not limited to the 
telecommunications industry or to telecommunications equipment. 
The lack of progress in developing distributed processing 
information networks will probably hamper the efforts of 
Japanese enterprises trying to recover their competitiveness 
through downsizing and reengineering. For the telecommunications 
industry, too, this failure has become an important factor in 
its falling behind in the competition among carriers that are in 
the process of globalizing their operations. 
  Under the protection of the postwar years, the 
telecommunications industry has led a life far removed from 
international competition. But, as will be shown, in the age of 
multimedia and distributed processing, global competition will 
be a necessary fact of life. The day is nearing when dramas 
played overseas -- the struggle between British 
Telecommunications (BT) and American Telephone and Telegraph 
Company (AT&amp;T) over entering each other's domestic market or 
the 
tie-up between BT and MCI of the United States -- will be 
replayed on Japan's shores. No longer about international 
territory, global competition has already moved into an age when 
the struggle will be over entering another country's domestic 
communications market. One can safely say that neither Japan's 
administrative agencies nor those in the telecommunications 
business are prepared to respond to this trend. 
  The activities of global telecommunications companies in 
Japan have not gathered a great deal of general interest because 
regulations limit their services to data communications, and at 
the present time, they cannot handle voice communications (i.e., 
telephone services). But their packet communications technology 
is considered the forerunner of technology known as Asynchronous 
Transfer Mode [ATM], used for switching equipment. This 
technology is said to be central to communications in the 21st 
century. Functionally, these companies already have the 
technology to make voice services possible and will be able to 
realize multimedia networks that combine voice, image, and text 
data. They are working out a system, including a system of fixed 
charges, that users will find easy to use. Regulations that 
would restrict these companies, especially in the United States 
and England, were done away with long ago. 
  This writer would basically welcome the changes that foreign 
carriers would bring to Japan. Their entry would probably lower 
communication charges while providing users with a greater 
diversity of services and serve as an impetus to the high-level 
use of networks. Rather, the problem is with the administration 
and an industry that tries to maintain the status quo. If things 
are left as they are, Japanese industries as a whole will be 
left behind other advanced nations in the information 
revolution, losing their global competitiveness, and in the 
short run, bear the seeds of new trade friction. 
<H5>  The Age of Distributed Processing </H5>
  Here, a short description of leading trends in the 
multimedia 
field may be helpful. 
  News reports about major trends in the telecommunications 
industry focus on the growing use of distributed processing 
computer networks and, along with this, the growing use of 
computer networks as communication tools. Because the price of 
smaller computers has gone down dramatically just as there have 
been marked improvements in their capabilities, there has been a 
move away from the kind of centralized processing of information 
that was done primarily by large computers and mainframes toward 
its distribution to personal computer workstations and smaller 
computers. There has been a rapid conversion toward distributed 
processing, where only necessary information is passed on and 
exchanged through workstations. The distributed processing 
system has broken through the limitations of centralized 
processing, making it possible to expand greatly one's data 
processing capabilities with only a small investment of money. 
Able to be used for "on-the-spot" system development and for a 
system that matches one's particular needs, it has also become a 
powerful reengineering tool for corporations. 
  In distributed processing, since the system is being 
designed 
so that computers set up in various locations can communicate 
with other computers, information can be processed as it is 
being exchanged; therefore, it is an excellent communications 
(media) tool. In U.S. workplaces, local area networks (LAN) 
linking workers, each with a personal computer on his or her 
desk, are used in communicating through such means as electronic 
mail, facsimile, and voice mail (multifunction answering 
machine) and are starting to get popular in Japan, too. As far 
as distributed processing networks are concerned, multimedia has 
become a real possibility. 
  A characteristic of communications based on this kind of 
computer network is that nearly every network function will be 
carried out by equipment in the office rather than by the 
telephone company's switchboard. We are in the process of moving 
from a centralized network system to a distributed processing 
network system. The telephone company's role will merely be that 
of maintaining and servicing its cable lines. All other advanced 
functions will be carried out at [computer] terminals. An 
important point for such telephone companies is that these 
terminals in most cases will be provided, not by themselves, but 
by equipment manufacturers. Telephone companies, their services 
reduced to "wiring," a term which is used by the telephone 
companies, are afraid that their value-added services will flee 
into other hands. Carriers in every country, fearful of losing 
revenue, have come out of their offices to adopt a strategy 
which transcends existing jurisdictions and national boundaries 
to cover advanced communication needs from start to finish. 
Cases in point are the purchases by American regional telephone 
companies of cable television companies in other regions and 
BT's global enterprise communications service. The pressure is 
building to break down regional fences. 
<H5>  Rate Structure To Encourage Use </H5>
  Another characteristic of distributed processing networks 
has 
to do with their fee structures. Generally, almost all 
communication networks have fixed costs that are passed on to 
users according to some kind of formula or method of allocating 
these costs. In Japan, during the age of centralized processing, 
the basis for allocating costs was time and distance -- the time 
on a "switch" [device used to transmit and route data] and the 
distance between them. Today, with distributed processing, 
however, this switching ability exists in the user's office, 
making it meaningless to base charges on time and distance. With 
the technology employed for distributed processing -- the use of 
fiber optics and packet switching -- distance is not such an 
important factor in determining transmission costs, and it has 
become meaningless to impose charges on the basis of distance. 
  Thus, what is becoming more and more popular is a system of 
fixed charges or some variation of that. Fixed-charge systems 
are set up to allow unlimited use of a network for a fixed 
charge, thus encouraging a high-level of use of information 
systems. This idea of fixed charges is not new. Until 1971, 
Japan had a system of fixed charges for calls made within city 
limits. In the United States, a system ofintra-city fixed 
charges is employed in many areas. To think that the meter-rate 
system is the one and only arrangement possible would be hasty. 
  In Arlington, a suburb of Boston where this writer lived for 
two years, residents had the option of fixed rates, enabling 
them to call anywhere within the city or neighboring areas 
(including Boston) as much as they wanted for the set charge of 
$29.29. For this writer, this meant being able to call up the 
computer at Harvard University, from home and to send 
electronic mail anywhere in the world. It also meant being able 
to make connections to computers at Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology and other universities without any additional charge. 
This writer's monthly phone bill, on average, came to about 
3,100 yen for the equivalent of about 2,400 minutes on the 
phone. In Japan, on the other hand, for a connection between 
Tokyo and the neighboring city of Kawasaki, callers would have 
to pay a basic charge of 1,550 yen along with an additional 
16,000 yen for the call, for a total of 17,550 yen. 
  This doesn't mean, however, that calls within city limits 
are 
necessarily cheaper in the United States and higher in Japan. 
Japan's rate structure is clearly more favorable for shorter 
calls. The problem is that, for users who want to transmit a 
large volume of data, a necessity in multimedia, the fee 
structure in Japan is very onerous. If this fee structure 
reflected true costs, there might not be anything that could be 
done about it. In today's age of distributed processing, 
however, the existing fee structure has lost its meaning, and 
maintaining it will only stand in the way of users. 
  Relaxing restriction on the resale or leasing of circuits is 
an important basis for a system that hopes to correct its fee 
structure and encourage providers to cross over into new 
territories, disregarding existing fences which mark off city, 
regional, and national boundaries. Specifically, it is necessary 
to deregulate the connections, or hook ups, between private and 
public services. In the telecommunications industry, there are 
public services that are comparable to buses, an example of 
publicly owned, public (mass) transportation, and there are 
private services that are comparable to chartered buses. The 
business of leasing out private lines is like the business of 
setting up scheduled tours, using buses chartered from the bus 
company. 
  Connecting public and private services, then, is like 
setting 
up a tour that uses both chartered buses and regular (publicly 
accessible), scheduled airline flights. That such tours (at 
least, in regard to voice services) are not recognized is a fact 
of life in Japan and a major deterrent to the development of 
diverse services. To continue with our analogy, the tour 
business would fold if one of the conditions for a tour was that 
everything up to [but not including] the planes that were used 
had to be chartered. 
  Doing away with regulations regarding the leasing of private 
lines would be a valuable step for those in the 
telecommunications industry who hope to regionally expand their 
services and, without the confusion over ownership rights to 
telephone lines and facilities within city limits, will make it 
possible for them to quickly develop advanced services covering 
large areas. In fact, in the data communications field, where 
deregulation has been occurring, powerful carriers like BT and 
AT&amp;T have sent in their globalizing forces and are leasing 
services here, in Japan, too. Not only are fees below those 
charged for public services offered by the telephone companies 
in the past, a savings due to the development of technology 
which makes use of circuits with greater efficiency; with a 
fixed-rate system, an alternative is being offered that better 
matches the needs of high-volume system users. Symbolic of what 
is happening is the fact that AT&amp;T-JENS is leasing services 
connecting users to local area networks at a cost four times 
lower than the fees charged domestically by NTT. Internet and 
other U.S. "information highway" networks as well as other 
foreign carriers are in the process of expanding their presence 
in Japan as fixed-rate, leased services. 
  In Japan, the resale or leasing of private lines--something 
which introduces competition into the telecommunications service 
area and brings about diversity as well as lower costs--is 
strictly regulated. In the United States and England, this type 
of restriction was quickly done away with; in Japan, where such 
restrictions still exist, they have become barriers to the 
development of advanced services by foreign carriers and to new 
businesses entering Japan's domestic market. What would be 
desirable is for restrictions on the leasing of private lines to 
be relaxed as soon as possible and for the situation to exist 
where foreign and domestic companies compete regardless of 
existing fences. In this article, major problems standing in the 
way of these things happening have been discussed in terms of 
the telecommunications administration's fencing policy, which 
divides the industry by regional, city, and national boundaries 
and prohibits businesses from crossing over into each other's 
territory. This policy may have been appropriate for Japan's 
old, centralized telephone network. But it is clear, from the 
above discussion, that it hampers competition and technological 
progress in an age of global, distributed networks. 
<H5>  Reform Is Essential </H5>
  Unlike other major countries that are revamping rate 
structures and outdated telecommunications systems built on a 
telephone-based concept of communications, Japan has stuck to 
its old ways, unable to discard either its existing rate 
structure or its outdated telecommunications system. If Japan 
retains these old ways, the multimedia age will be a long time 
in coming. Adjusting the ISDN rate structure to the existing 
telephone rate structure may be a good way to preserve the old 
order, but like a wall, it blocks the way to a new era. And it 
will have serious repercussions for the competitiveness of every 
Japanese company. 
  The kind of system reform that has been discussed here will 
inevitably profit some businesses and hurt others, and it calls 
for some tough decisions for government administrators. It may 
even call for a political solution. But the type of reform that 
has been advocated here is, for Japan's future, necessary and 
essential.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 8 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
representatives of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) 
have demanded a resignation of the government at the meeting 
organized by the MDA at one of the central squares of the 
capital. 
  Those speaking at the meeting including the leaders of the 
MDA and people delegating the Social Democratic Party, the 
Students Union as well as the unemployed and pensioners have 
reminded the government all its promises concerning the 
stabilization of the national economy within a two-year period 
and criticized the policies being pursued by the government in 
the spheres of foreign trade, social welfare of the population, 
production and finance. 
  It was said that the abuses of official position are 
acquiring a boundless character at any level of management. In 
this connection some speakers stressed the significance of the 
hearing of the issue on possible involvement of some leaders of 
the parliament and government in corruption and abuses of 
official position to be carried out as sooner as possible. 
  The chairman of the parliament and the prime minister 
refused 
to take part in the meeting though they had been invited to it 
by the organizers of the meeting. The leaders of the MDA 
explained their suggestion as striving to provide the leaders of 
the country with possibilities to express their opinions and to 
be associated with the common people. 
  When the meeting was over, its participants passed to the 
main square of the capital named after D. Suhbaatar where those 
who wanted could express their views from the "free rostrum" 
arranged by the MDA. 
  The meeting was attended by not less than five-six [as 
received] thousand people.

reference to the character and property ownership there should 
be functioning state, public and private radio and television 
stations, the association notes.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 7 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The proper 
functioning of power supply enterprises of the Mongolian capital 
is not to be improved greatly shortly as soon as Russia started 
two days ago supplying electricity which was ceased by the 
beginning of the current year due to the delay in payments on 
the part of Mongolia. But as is cleared up now, the failures in 
power supply were and are stipulated by more serious reasons 
connected with a poor organization of labour, irresponsibility 
and loosening discipline of those dealing with as well as other 
shortcomings in the work of the coal mining enterprises. 
According to the Mongolian television, at the major heat and 
power stations of the city there is the coal stock left only for 
a few days so they are trying to make use of them as much longer 
as possible which means that the current practice of cutting of 
the power supply for several times a day would be continued for 
a uncertain period up to a normalizing of the coal mining.

the DPRK is building large missile launching sites in areas near 
the Chinese border. This was disclosed to an ASAHI SHIMBUN 
reporter by former North Korean Lieutenant Yim Yong-son who has 
taken refuge in the ROK. Reportedly, the DPRK chose the areas 
thinking that other countries would not dare to attack the sites 
for fear of bombing China by mistake. 
  Former Lieutenant Yim worked at the military construction 
bureau in Pyongyang till he defected to the ROK last September. 
According to his fellow soldier who was engaged in the 
construction of missile bases, the launch sites are located 
mainly in the eastern coastal areas, including North Hamgyong 
and Kangwon Provinces and Wonsan City. Recently, however, the 
DPRK started to construct missile sites along the Chinese 
border. It is said that about 5,000 people are working at the 
sites at Chunggangjin in Changang Province and that the job will 
be completed next year. Former Lieutenant Yim said: "I heard 
that the DPRK selected the areas presuming that it would be 
difficult for the United States and the ROK to launch an attack 
in time of emergency for fear of hitting China by accident."

  [Text] A delegation of the Japan-Vietnam Economic Committee 
(chairman: Akira Nishio, president of the Nissho Iwai 
Corporation) of the Federation of Economic Organizations of 
Japan [Keidanren] is now on a visit to Vietnam. The delegation 
paid a call on Do Muoi, Communist Party of Vietnam general 
secretary, in Hanoi on 5 April. During the meeting with members 
of the delegation, the Vietnamese leader stated: "Japan is 
Vietnam's biggest trading partner and a top aid donor of 
Vietnam. I am grateful to Japan. The amount of investment in 
Vietnam from the Japanese private sector remains small, 
however." In this way, he asked for Japan's increased 
investment in Vietnam. Specifically, he asked Japan to invest 
in Vietnam's machinery industry, which can generate employment, 
transfer high technology to Vietnam, and provide Vietnam with 
business management know-how. 
  In response, Chairman Nishio said, "Japan's investment in 
Vietnam lags behind that of other nations, but Japan will be a 
top investor in Vietnam sometime in the future." Thus, the 
Japanese business leader indicated that in taking advantage of 
the lifting of the U.S. embargo against Vietnam, Japan would 
make aggressive investments in Vietnam in the future.

  [Text] THE Karen National Union (KNU) will appoint a 
five-man team to meet representatives of Burma's ruling State 
Law and Order Restoration Council to discuss the possibility of 
peace talks, a Karen guerrilla said yesterday. 
  "We are awaiting the Burmese junta's decision on whether to 
meet with us, and on the place and the time of the meeting," 
said the guerrilla, who is a colonel. 
  However, the meeting should be held openly, he said. "The 
meeting must be held outside the territory controlled by the 
junta. If possible, it should be a neighboring country where the 
mass media will be allowed to observe." 
  The Karen team will first sound out the Burmese junta on the 
subjects to discuss at the peace talks. Initially, low-level 
representatives from both sides could meet to prepare an agenda 
for a meeting of higher-level officials, he said. 
  Gen. Bo Mya, the KNU's president will not take part in the 
first talks. 
  Two months ago, the KNU appointed a team, headed by Brig. 
Gen. Maung Maung, its joint secretary, to meet with Burmese 
junta representatives. But a new team will be appointed when 
the Burmese junta is ready for talks, he said. 
  The Karen colonel, who is a close aide of Gen. Bo Mya, said 
the KNU regards the peace negotiations as very important to 
settling its prolonged conflict with Rangoon.

    [Editorial Report] Rangoon Burma Television Network in 
Burmese at 1300 GMT on 8 April carries a 39-minute report on the 
8 April National Convention plenary session on the presentation 
by the Panel of Chairmen on the review and analysis of 
suggestions submitted by the delegate groups to prescribe the 
fundamental principles related to the "State," "State 
Structure," and "Head of State" chapters that will be included 
in drawing up the constitution. 
  Alternate Chairman U Saw Philip, alias U Philip San, and 
Panel of Chairmen members U San Tha Aung, U Sai Aung Htun, U Kan 
Nyunt, U Mahn Ohn Maung, U Soe Maung, U Tin Maung, U Khin Maung 
Htoo, and Dr. Than Nyunt present analysis on the "Head of State" 
chapter. 
  The Panel of Chairmen's report clarifies and appraises the 
reports presented by the various delegate groups concerning the 
head of state and suggests the following as basic principles 
concerning the appropriate terms of office for the president and 
vice presidents for the "Head of State" chapter. "The term of 
office of the president and the vice presidents shall be five 
years; the president and vice presidents shall carry on in 
office until the new president and vice presidents are duly 
elected after the expiration of incumbent terms; incumbents 
shall serve in the office of the president and vice presidents 
for not more than two terms; and the term as acting president or 
acting vice president shall not be considered as a term in 
office." Moreover, the analysis report proposes that "if for 
some reason the post of president or vice president becomes 
vacant and someone is elected to fill the vacancy, the term of 
office of that person shall be only until the end of the 
original term of office." 
  Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report clarifies the 
political position of the president and proposes the basic 
principles. "The president and vice presidents shall not be 
representatives of parliament; if a parliament representative is 
elected president or vice president, this person shall be deemed 
to have resigned his seat in parliament, and if a public service 
person is elected president or vice president, that person shall 
be deemed to have retired from the date of such election; if a 
person elected president or vice president happens to be a 
member of a political party, that person shall not participate 
in party activities of that party organization from the date of 
such election during the term of office." 
  Continuing, the analysis report defines the oaths of office 
for the president and vice presidents before they assume their 
official responsibilities and cites suggestions by various 
delegates, including: "A. To observe and safeguard the state 
constitution; B. To protect the laws of the nation; C. To 
strive for the nondisintegration of the union, the 
nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of 
national sovereignty; D. To execute the constitutional duties 
and responsibilities with righteousness and without depravity; 
E. To strive for the promotion of Lawkapala [universal] 
principle of justice, liberty, and equality." The analysis 
report proposes that the basic principle on the oath of office 
include the following points: "To be loyal to the Union of 
Myanmar [Burma] and its citizens; to perpetually bear in mind 
and strive for the nondisintegration of the union, the 
nondisintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of 
national sovereignty; to observe and safeguard the state 
constitution and to protect and abide by the laws of the nation; 
to execute duties and responsibilities with utmost integrity and 
righteousness; to strive for the promotion of Lawkapala 
principle of justice, liberty, and equality in the Republic of 
the Union of Myanmar; and solemnly swear to offer one's body and 
life to the nation for the benefit of the Republic of the Union 
of Myanmar." Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report 
suggests another basic principle, stating that "the president 
and vice presidents should not accept any other office or 
position of emolument." 
  Further, the analysis report evaluates the assets of the 
president and vice presidents and proposes that "the president 
and vice presidents should furnish lists of assets -- such as 
family-owned land, houses, buildings, businesses, savings, and 
other valuables, stating their values, and belonging to the 
respective families headed by them -- and send them to the 
leader of the union parliament." The report then describes 
remuneration, benefits, and lodging suggestions and proposes 
that "the president and vice presidents should each be entitled 
to enjoy legally appropriate remuneration, privileges, and 
benefits; each should be provided with a suitable residence; and 
when a president or vice presidents, apart from those being 
impeached, retire after completing a term in office, they should 
be granted pension and suitable benefits." 
  The Panel of Chairmen's analysis report determines the 
duties 
and responsibilities and proposes the basic principle that "the 
president and vice presidents shall exercise responsibilities 
and rights assigned and vested by the constitution and other 
laws." The report next assesses the points for impeachment, the 
procedures to be followed, and prescribes the basic principles 
"1. The president or a vice president can be impeached for the 
following reasons: A. treason; B. violation of the state 
constitution; C. misconduct; D. deterioration in the specific 
qualifications prescribed in the constitution for the president 
and vice president; 2. If a president or a vice president faces 
impeachment, a written proposal signed by not less than one 
quarter of the total members of any of the two parliaments 
included in the union parliament will be submitted to the leader 
of that parliament; 3. The impeachment procedure can continue 
only if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total 
members of the parliament concerned; 4. When an impeachment 
motion has been referred by one parliament, the other parliament 
shall investigate the motion or cause the motion to be 
investigated by a body; 5. The president, vice presidents, or 
their representatives shall have the right to refute the motion; 
6. If, as a result of the investigation, a resolution is passed 
and is supported by not less than two-thirds of the members of 
the parliament by which the charge was investigated or caused to 
be investigated, declaring that the charge has been sustained 
and that the offense -- the subject of the charge -- was such as 
to render the president or vice president unfit to continue in 
office, that parliament should submit it to the leader of the 
union parliament to remove the president or vice president from 
office; 7. Immediately upon receipt of the submission, the 
leader of the union parliament shall proclaim the removal of the 
president or vice president from office." 
  Next, the Panel of Chairmen's analysis report analyzes the 
election of a president or a vice president if the positions 
become vacant due to resignation, death, or inability, and 
proposes the basic principles that "1. The president or vice 
president should have the right to resign from office of their 
own volition before the expiry of the term of office; 2. If the 
post of president becomes vacant due to resignation, death, 
inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office, or 
any other cause, the vice president who has won the second 
highest number of votes in the presidential election shall serve 
as acting president; 3. If the vacancy in the presidency arises 
while the union parliament is in session, the acting president 
should promptly inform the leader of the union parliament to 
fill the vacancy within seven days; 4. Upon receipt of the 
announcement from the acting president, the leader of the union 
parliament should take the necessary steps to elect a new vice 
president by the electoral college; 5. After electing a new 
vice president, union parliament members shall elect a president 
of their choice from among the vice presidents; 6. If a vacancy 
arises when the union parliament is not in session, the leader 
of the union parliament shall summon a special parliamentary 
session within 21 days of receiving the announcement from the 
acting president and carry out the above-mentioned process for 
choosing a new president; 7. If a vice presidential post 
becomes vacant due to resignation, death, removal from office, 
permanent disability, or any other cause while the union 
parliament is in session, the electoral college which has 
elected that vice president should promptly inform the leader of 
the union parliament to fill the vacancy within seven days; 8. 
If a vacancy arises when the union parliament is not in 
session, the leader of the union parliament shall summon a 
special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the 
announcement from the president and carry out the required 
process for choosing a new vice president."

election of a president or a vice president if the positions 
become vacant due to resignation, death, or inability, and 
proposes the basic principles that "1. The president or vice 
president should have the right to resign from office of their 
own volition before the expiry of the term of office; 2. If the 
post of president becomes vacant due to resignation, death, 
inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office, or 
any other cause, the vice president who has won the second 
highest number of votes in the presidential election shall serve 
as acting president; 3. If the vacancy in the presidency arises 
while the union parliament is in session, the acting president 
should promptly inform the leader of the union parliament to 
fill the vacancy within seven days; 4. Upon receipt of the 
announcement from the acting president, the leader of the union 
parliament should take the necessary steps to elect a new vice 
president by the electoral college; 5. After electing a new 
vice president, union parliament members shall elect a president 
of their choice from among the vice presidents; 6. If a vacancy 
arises when the union parliament is not in session, the leader 
of the union parliament shall summon a special parliamentary 
session within 21 days of receiving the announcement from the 
acting president and carry out the above-mentioned process for 
choosing a new president; 7. If a vice presidential post 
becomes vacant due to resignation, death, removal from office, 
permanent disability, or any other cause while the union 
parliament is in session, the electoral college which has 
elected that vice president should promptly inform the leader of 
the union parliament to fill the vacancy within seven days; 8. 
If a vacancy arises when the union parliament is not in 
session, the leader of the union parliament shall summon a 
special parliamentary session within 21 days of receiving the 
announcement from the president and carry out the required 
process for choosing a new vice president."

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] The four-day visit of Cambodian Deputy Prime 
Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut to Malaysia this week marked 
another step in building stronger relations between the two 
countries. A Malaysia- Cambodia Joint Commission is to be set 
up soon to promote bilateral activities. The idea was suggested 
by Sirivut himself at his one-hour meeting with Malaysian 
Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. The commission will, 
among others, coordinate training and cooperation in 
agriculture, tourism, and forestry apart from the exploitation 
of oil and minerals. Cambodia has also requested Malaysia's 
assistance in the formulation of trade and investment policies 
for the country. 
  Ever since the two-decade-old civil war was brought to an 
end, Malaysia has been in the forefront in that country's 
reconstruction and development. Prince Sirivut expressed his 
country's gratitude to the Government and people of Malaysia who 
had greatly contributed toward the peace process in his country. 
  Cambodia plans to set up an embassy in Kuala Lumpur before 
proceeding to do so in other countries of ASEAN. The embassies 
are necessary to enable Cambodia keep abreast with developments 
in the region as they have been isolated during the last 20 
years. 
  Right now, Cambodia's priority is to revive its economy. The 
new Cambodian Government, which was formed after last May's 
general elections, is keen on attracting Malaysia's private 
sector to invest in the country. It is also seeking Malaysia's 
expertise in various fields, especially in agriculture. It is 
relevant to find out that 85 percent of the Cambodian people 
live in the rural areas. Thus, Cambodia naturally wants to 
learn from Malaysia how the latter has achieved immense 
development and improved the quality of life in the rural areas. 
  The visit of Prince Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign 
affairs and international cooperation, was also to finalize 
details of the Malaysian premier Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's 
three-day visit to Cambodia next week. Dr. Mahathir is 
scheduled to hold discussions on bilateral, regional, and 
international issues with the co-prime ministers of Cambodia, 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Mr. Hun Sen. According to Sirivut, 
the official visit of the Malaysian premier is interpreted and 
considered by the Government of Cambodia as a very important 
political event. The people of Cambodia are reported to be 
looking forward to the visit, especially because of Malaysia's 
role in the country's peace process. 
  Malaysia, just like its other ASEAN partners, considers 
Cambodia as an important and integral part of Southeast Asia. 
Malaysia may be remembered as among the first countries to send 
troops to serve in the United Nations Transitional Authority in 
Cambodia, UNTAC. And now that peace has come about as a result 
of the UN-brokered 1991 Paris peace accord, Malaysia would like 
to see that country grow and prosper in all fields, and come on 
par with other countries in the region.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Tues. -- The round-up of 1,500 
Filipino maids at Saint John's Cathedral here on March 27 was 
not a deliberate attempt to target foreign Christian workers. 
  Deputy Home Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub said today 
that the Government considered such an exercise as routine and 
part of the on-going operation to detain foreign workers without 
valid travel and employment papers. 
  He criticised certain foreign newspapers for their reports 
which had implied the exercise was targeted at Christian foreign 
workers. 
  "Just because the operation took place in a church area, it 
has been misconstrued as targeting Christian foreign workers," 
he said. 
  "Such reports were not only mischievious but also untrue," 
he 
added. 
  Megat Junid was speaking to newsmen at his office at the 
Prime Minister's Department here. 
  He said that in the past the police and immigration 
authorities had rounded up illegal foreign workers at other 
places of worship without protest from their governments. 
  "There have been operations where foreign Muslim workers who 
did not have the proper papers were detained at mosques where 
they slept" he said. 
  Yesterday, the Philippines Foreign Office in Manila summoned 
a senior Malaysian diplomat to express deep concern over the 
round-up of the Filipino maids. 
  Charge d'affaires Mohamed Noh told Foreign Secretary Roberto 
Romula the action was part of periodic checks by Malaysian 
authorities against illegal immigrants. 
  Megat Junid said the operation was carried out at Saint 
John's Cathedral following media reports that some Filipino 
maids were involved in vice activities. 
  Of the 1,500 who were taken to the Immigration Department 
headquarters here, 711 were found without valid travel documents.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 8 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
expects to spend [Malaysian ringgit] RM16.2 billion (about US$6 
billion) on development of the telecommunications industry for 
the next five years from 1993, Deputy Energy, Telecommunications 
and Posts Minister Tajol Rosli Ghazali said Friday. 
  Only through sustained investment in domestic research and 
development could the country ensure a steady, if not 
spectacular, growth in the industry and contribute towards 
Vision 2020, he said at the opening of the 
Telemex/Elec-Com/Electrical '94 Exhibition, here. 
  Tajol Rosli said that given the rising demand for 
telecommunications services, joint-venture projects with 
multi-national manufacturers to produce or assemble 
telecommunications equipment locally were encouraged if Malaysia 
were to be a strong contender in the telecommunications 
equipment export area. 
  In this respect, he noted that Telekom Malaysia was leading 
the way by investing RM670 million (about US$248 million) in its 
local network, RM160 million (about US$59.25 million) in its 
international network and RM1.7 billion (US$629 million) in the 
development of rural telecommunications. 
  It is hoped that other telecommunications corporations would 
follow suit and work towards making Malaysia the regional centre 
for telecommunications activities, he added. 
  The six-day exhibition on telecommunications system, office 
automation, electronics and electrical equipment, is staged by 
54 exhibitors including those from China, Germany, Japan and 
Singapore.

  Encik Ahmad, 47, has been appointed for a three-year period.

  [Text] Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans has 
called on the rebel Cambodian guerrilla faction, the Khmer 
Rouge, to end its war and talk peace with the government in 
Phnom Penh. Senator Evans told journalists in the Cambodian 
capital that the Khmer Rouge was a diminishing force with no 
credibility. He said the guerrillas continue to loose their 
power and influence and predicted that Cambodian Government 
troops would remain in control of the faction's former 
stronghold of Pailin, which they captured last month. Senator 
Evans said for the Khmer Rouge to engage in a proper 
reconciliation process, it would have to give up areas it still 
controlled, end its military campaign, and recognize the 
legitimacy of the Cambodian Government.

  [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Senator Gareth Evans said in 
a news conference at the Information Ministry yesterday that 
Australia will provide aid worth 92 million Australian dollars 
to the Kingdom of Cambodia for a period of four years, from 
1994-95 to 1997-98. According to this pledge, Australian aid 
will nearly double the amount of aid pledged by Australia for 
Cambodia at the international conference on Cambodia's 
rehabilitation held in March 1992 [as heard] in Tokyo, Japan. 
  H.E. Gareth Evans affirmed that this program enables 
Australia and Cambodia to solve urgent needs to develop 
important sectors in Cambodia, including infrastructure in which 
Australia will help build bridges to improve roads. As for mine 
clearing, Australia will continue to assist the Cambodian Mine 
Action Center in removing the estimated more than 10 million 
remaining mines in Cambodia. In the human rights sector, 
Australia will continue to assist the UN Human Rights Center in 
the Kingdom of Cambodia. In the field of education, Australia 
has paid attention to teaching the English language, including 
modern English teaching programs which will be broadcast over 
Australian international television and through the use of 
videotapes, tape recorders, and printing. In the public health 
sector Australia will make great efforts to completely eradicate 
polio and to control malaria.

  [Text] PHNOM PENH, April 9 (AFP) -- King Norodom Sihanouk 
has expressed support for the government's recent offensive to 
capture the Khmer Rouge's rear headquarters in the northwestern 
town of Pailin, a report said Saturday. 
  "The offensive ... is legitimate, unavoidable and most 
laudable," the king said in an interview in the bi-weekly PHNOM 
PENH POST. 
  The government's recent seizure of Pailin was justified as a 
blow against the "de facto partitioning of the country and to 
prevent further destruction of the country's natural resources 
by the Khmer Rouge for their own profit and the gain of foriegn 
interests," said the ailing King Sihanouk, who returned here 
Friday after an absence of more than six months. 
  The Khmer Rouge occupied the gem-and timber-rich area of 
Pailin in 1989. It has since served as their "capital" while it 
financed its guerrilla operations by selling mining and logging 
concessions to primarily Thai business consortiums. 
  King Sihanouk said that if the government could hold Pailin, 
"with its wealth of minerals and timber, it would be a benefit 
of historic proportions for Cambodia." 
  But he warned of a "double-edged sword" and pointed to the 
recent debacle at Anlong Veng, where government forces seized 
the strategic Khmer Rouge base only to be routed several weeks 
later when the guerrillas launched a surpise counter-attack. 
  The consequences of a similar setback in Pailin would be 
"extremely grave and hypothetically could threaten the very 
future of our new regime," the king said. 
  The 71-year-old monarch, who returned totally bald after 
months of cancer treatment in China, allayed widespread fears 
about the state of his health when he nimbly stepped down onto 
the tarmac of the capital's airport looking spruce and smiling. 
  But later a scheduled meeting with Khmer Rouge nominal 
leader 
Khieu Samphan to discuss peace negotiations was cancelled. 
  The Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio reported that the king 
told Khieu Samphan "it would be best" to postpone the meeting 
until June. 
  The king said in the interview that it was difficult for him 
to arrange or broker peace negotiations as the government was 
continuing to gain ground and co-premiers Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh or Hun Sen were not willing to talk with the Khmer 
Rouge.

  [Text] Phnom Penh AKP April 9 -- Samdech Krompreah Norodom 
Ranariddh, first prime minister of Cambodia, paid a brief visit 
to Pailin on April 7. 
  Generals Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat, co-ministers of national 
defence, accompanied aboard an helicopter, the co-premier. 
  Prince Ranariddh was welcomed on his arrival in Pailin by 
General Ke Kimyan, chief of general staff; Pol Saroeun, deputy 
general staff; Sak Sutsakhan, adviser to the co-prime ministers 
in charge of military affairs, and other high-ranking officers 
and combatants stationed in Pailin. 
  It was the first visit by a government leader since the 
seizure of Pailin by the Royal Khmer Army on March 19. 
  The same day a group of representatives of diplomatic corps 
of 19 countries and of four international organizations led by 
Mr. Khieu Kanharit, secretary of state of information, also 
visited the area. 
  "If Thailand does not support Khmer Rouge, Pailin will 
mainly 
be a zone of security and the local authorities will be put in 
place," General Ke Kimyan told the visitors.

reported that you will greet the king on his return after a long 
period of medical treatment. However, it has been reported that 
you cannot make this trip. Is this true? And what are your 
reasons for it? 
  [Khieu Samphan] Thank you comrade representative of the 
Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia radio. I, 
like all cadres and members of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea 
[PDK], am very happy at the news that the king has been 
successfully treated, that he has recovered, and that he will 
return to Phnom Penh on 8 April. 
  I sent his majesty a message saying that I and a PDK 
delegation will join our nation and people in greeting him and 
the queen at Pochentong airport on his return. His majesty the 
king replied to me and allowed me and the PDK delegation to see 
him and the queen on 13 April 1994. However, on 5 April 1994, 
there was a message from the king to the head of his secretariat 
in Phnom Penh informing me that the two-headed government has 
refused to provide security and an escort to protect me. The 
king is clearly aware that in such a situation it will not be 
safe for me to see him in Phnom Penh on 13 April 1994. 
Therefore, he is pleased to let me see him and the queen in 
Beijing in June instead. 
  This royal message clearly shows the heart of the king 
concerning my safety. In his role as the father of the nation 
and of national reconciliation, he has always considered the PDK 
as a nationalist force which has joined our nation and people to 
struggle to defend and safeguard the nation and the Cambodian 
race under the king's national reconciliation banner so that 
Cambodia is independent, peaceful, and neutral with its 
territorial integrity. 
  I would like to take this opportunity to express once again 
my deepest gratitude to his majesty the king for his lofty 
initiative above. In sum, the king is pleased to let me see him 
on 13 April 1994. However, there has been opposition to the 
king's reception of me and on my call on him. This is the story 
and the reason for my failure to call on the king and the queen 
in Phnom Penh. 
  This is trampling on the constitution and preventing the 
king 
from having any right or role. Any word or the slightest 
activity by the king along the line of national reconciliation 
has been opposed. By who? 
  In form, it seems as though the two-headed government is 
opposed to my meeting with the king. However, the truth is that 
the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their allies, namely the 
United States, France, and Australia, are against this. They 
are opposing the efforts of the king and of all nationalist 
forces on national reconciliation. They are only thinking about 
fueling the war of the communist Vietnamese. 
  [Correspondent] So, it is no longer possible for you to go 
to Phnom Penh. This will be an obstacle to national 
reconciliation and to a solution for peace. What do you think 
should be done? 
  [Khieu Samphan] To answer this question we should examine 
the reasons why the communist Vietnamese, their allies, the 
communist Vietnamese puppets, and the two-headed government are 
against my meeting the king on 13 April. 
  This is because they are afraid of the national force and 
our 
people, in particular they are afraid of the force of the masses 
in Phnom Penh which has been growing in strength. Our nation 
and people oppose them and demand national reconciliation and an 
end to the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war. Our nation and 
people clearly see that the communist Vietnamese, their allies, 
and their lackeys are the ones fueling the war. Our nation and 
people clearly realize that their tragedy and suffering are due 
to the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their allies, the 
communist Vietnamese puppets, and the two-headed government who 
think only of the war, of continuing the fighting, and of 
levying taxes from the people and using this money to serve the 
war. What little money that has been begged from foreigners has 
also been thrown into the war. 
  The communist Vietnamese have annexed Cambodian territory in 
the east at will and have brought nearly four million Vietnamese 
nationals into Cambodia at will. The two-headed government is 
indifferent to this. The economy has hit the bottom. Social 
problems are getting serious and are deteriorating and these 
people remain completely indifferent. They are implementing the 
strategy of the communist Vietnamese and their allies in using a 
military war to kill the people and the Democratic Kampuchean 
force. They think that if they can destroy Democratic 
Kampuchea, they will kill the king politically and other 
nationalist forces and that they will run Cambodia through their 
fascist and barbarous policy. As for the communist Vietnamese, 
they will annex Cambodia at will. They are thinking along this 
line and are implementing this policy. 
  (Khieu Samphan continues] However, our entire nation and 
people, in the rural areas, in Phnom Penh, and abroad, are well 
aware of all this. They have cooperated and carried out 
activities everywhere through various forms to oppose all these 
warmongers. 
  Look at how these people are being entangled with their 
policy to fuel the war! What have they solved through the 
military war so far? What is the situation on the Anlung Veng 
battlefield? The Pailin battlefield situation will be moving 
toward that of Anlung Veng; it is just a question of time. It 
is the same situation on other battlefields. 
  Therefore, using a military war to destroy the national 
force 
and that of Democratic Kampuchea will not work. Thousands of 
social problems will get more serious. All this is a large 
chunk of rock hanging down from the two-headed government's 
neck. This rock is getting heavier and heavier. The government 
cannot get out of this. If it continues to fuel the war, it 
will certainly die. Why? 
  This is because of the strength of the great national union 
force. Our entire nation and people are uniting around the 
king's national reconciliation policy. This is a mighty force. 
The communist Vietnamese, their Western allies, their puppets 
and lackeys, and the two-headed government certainly cannot win 
against this mighty force. This has been successively borne by 
history. This is the current situation. 
  In sum, although they -- the communist Vietnamese, the 
Western allies, their puppets and lackeys, and the two-headed 
government -- strive to oppose the king, national 
reconciliation, peace, and to continue to fuel the war, they 
certainly cannot win against the force of the nation and the 
people who, in cooperation with the king, need to end the war 
and need peace and national reconciliation. The national 
reconciliation trend is very powerful; nothing can stop this.

  [Text] Pean So, Cambodia, April 11 (AFP) -- Ethnic 
Vietnamese in this small village near Phnom Penh said Monday 
they could not identity the gunmen who massacred 14 of their 
number, contradicting reports which blamed Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas. 
  The gun and grenade attack also left more than 20 wounded in 
the village in Tro Sla district about 30 kilometers (20 miles) 
southeast of Phnom Penh, villagers said. 
  The Vietnamese Embassy in Phnom Penh said earlier Monday 
that 
local people blamed the Khmer Rouge for the attack late Saturday 
on the village along the banks of the Bassac River. 
  But one woman whose grandson was killed when the group of 
about 10 gunmen attacked said: "We do not know who they were 
because it was dark." 
  The assailants, who were dressed in shorts and T-shirts 
attacked at around 8.30 P.M. killing 14 people, mainly women and 
children, the Pean So villagers said. 
  "They started running from the far end of the village and 
when they heard the sound of children playing they threw 
grenades. They did not care about young or old," said Pham 
Kory, whose sister was killed and whose son and daughter were 
injured in a grenade blast. 
  Many of the ethnic Vietnamese villagers told AFP that they 
had never seen or heard of Khmer Rouge in the area and there was 
no evidence of guerrilla involvement in the attack. 
  Lam Van Chiep, a 42-year-old fisherman, also said he did not 
think the gunmen were bandits. 
  "It's very difficult to say who they were. Most of them wore 
shorts and T-shirts and they did not steal any belongings except 
for a little money," he said. 
  The Vietnamese Embassy statement, which originally 
identified 
the village as Tro Sla, called the attack the bloodiest in a 
year against ethnic Vietnamese living in Cambodia. The Khmer 
Rouge have been blamed for several massacres during the 
UN-supervised elections in 1993. 
  Among victims was [word indistinct]-day-old infant whose arm 
was torn off, said the embassy statement. Nguyen Van Ty, an 
official with the local Vietnamese residents' association, was 
among the victims, it added. 
  The embassy said the "barbarous massacre" was an attempt to 
harm friendly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia. 
  It called on the Cambodian Government for an immediate and 
effective inquiry, to bring the guilty to justice and prevent 
such killings occurring again. 
  Thousands of people have fled Cambodia over the past two 
years after the Khmer Rouge attacked ethnic Vietnamese, many of 
whom have lived in Cambodia for generations. 
  About 30,000 refugees are stranded in border provinces of 
Vietnam, unable to return to Cambodia, while another 5,000 to 
6,000 are on the Cambodian side.

  [Text] The government hopes that Japanese Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation today will not affect Indonesia- 
Japan bilateral relations, especially in trade and economic 
fields. Speaking in Jakarta today, Irawan Abidin, director of 
foreign information service of the Foreign Affairs Department, 
said the Indonesian Government is closely monitoring political 
developments in Japan and hopes that the Japanese prime 
minister's resignation will not affect existing cordial 
relations between the two countries. 
  Speaking on a separate occasion, Sabam Sirait, a member of 
parliament, said Hosokawa's resignation will provide an 
opportunity for Japan's Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to stage 
a comeback and assume the country's premiership which the party 
lost in the last general elections. Sabam Sirait noted that 
factional power struggle within the LDP may still continue if 
the party regains the premiership. However, he believes 
Indonesia is not expected to suffer the consequences of such a 
scenario.

  [Excerpts] Jakarta (JP) -- For the first time in 10 years 
Indonesia's non-oil exports have declined, rising concerns in a 
cabinet meeting on economy at the Bina Graha Presidential Office 
here yesterday. 
  "President Suharto ordered related ministers to study the 
causes of the decline in non-oil exports in January and learn 
why the changes in demand were taking place." Minister of 
Information Harmoko made this announcement after a limited 
cabinet meeting on economy. 
  Harmoko said that Indonesia's export of non-oil products 
fell 
by 11.7 percent to US$1.89 billion in January from $2.14 billion 
in the same month of 1993, while export of oil and gas declined 
by 10.9 percent to $763 million from $856.31 million. 
  Indonesia, however, enjoyed a trade surplus of $597.2 
million 
in January despite of the export decline, he said. 
  The January imports fell by 3.9 percent to $2.05 billion 
from 
$2.14 billion in the same month last year. 
  The country's exports have already fallen by 4.9 percent to 
$3.19 billion last December from a year before due to a sharp 
decline in oil prices on the world market. 
  "The government will soon take concrete measures to boost 
the 
country's non-oil exports," Harmoko said. [passage omitted] 
  Harmoko said that the cabinet meeting also dealt with 
inflation which fell to 0.7 percent last month from 1.76 percent 
in February and 1.25 percent in January. 
  "The inflation of 3.71 percent in the first three months of 
this year is far lower than 6.44 percent in the same period of 
last year," he said. 
  According to the government, the high inflation rate in the 
first quarter of last year was caused by increases in fuel 
prices, electricity billing rates and transportation fares, 
while the high rate in the January-March period was caused 
mainly by floods and increasing demand for goods prior to last 
month's 'id al-fitr holiday. 
  The government, under its State Policy Guidelines, is 
committed to keeping the rate of inflation to a maximum of five 
percent per annum. 
  The information minister said that last month's inflation 
was 
caused by increases of food prices in the capitals of the 
country's 27 provinces by an average of 1.6 percent. The prices 
of housing increased by only 0.07 percent and other goods and 
services by 0.04 percent. 
  Even though the food prices rose by an average of 1.6 
percent, The prices of rice fell by an average of 2.44 percent 
to Rp [rupiah] 609.29 (28.4 U.S. cents) per kilo last month from 
Rp 624.58 in February due to the start of the harvest season in 
the country, he said. 
  He said the money supply increased by 8.9 percent to Rp 
40.35 
trillion as of January from Rp 37.03 trillion as of last 
December. 
  Harmoko said the meeting also discussed the damages of rice 
and secondary crops caused by floods in Java, Sumatera, Sulawesi 
and West Nusa Tenggara. 
  "The president wants a delay for the repayment of credits by 
farmers whose crops have been damaged by floods," he said.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- International 
organisations and public organisations of different countries 
denounced the United States for leading the situation of the 
Korean peninsula to the brink of war. 
  The Islamic world and Arab regional leadership of the 
International Front Against Zionism in a statement warned that 
if the United States resorted to war moves against independent 
and peace-loving Korea, it would get only defeat and shame. 
  The Luxemburg-Korea Friendship Association in a statement 
demanded that the United States abandon the policy of strength 
and sincerely approach dialogue with the DPRK for a peaceful and 
fair solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. 
  The Tanzanian Youth League in a statement said that DPRK-USA 
talks are the only solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean 
peninsula. 
  The Mali Committee for Supporting the Independent and 
Peaceful Reunification of Korea in a statement said that if the 
United States really had an intention to resolve the nuclear 
issue, it must be faithful to its responsibility and obligation, 
though belatedly, and the Secretariat of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency must renounce the "double standard" policy 
at once. 
  The Britain-Korea Friendship Committee in an appeal called 
upon the British political parties and organisations which 
treasure peace and justice to lift up voices denouncing the 
unjust stand of the government to join the U.S. in the moves to 
isolate and stifle the DPRK and demanding the normalisation of 
relations with the DPRK.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA)--Delegates of 
international organizations and political parties and 
organizations of different countries criticised the United 
States and its followers for aggravating the situation in the 
Korean peninsula. 
  Sam Marcy, chairman of the Workers World Party of the United 
States, in an article contributed to the newspaper workers world 
on March 31 said the United States now is in a desperate bid to 
make it appear that the DPRK "is promoting a criminal program 
overtly and covertly to become a nuclear power." 
  He said it is entirely a matter of sovereignty for the 
Korean 
Government to decide on who should come and what he should 
inspect, whether it be nuclear facilities or any other things. 
The progressive people and working class in the United States 
should support the DPRK's cause of justice, he added. 
  The Jordanian Islamic and Christian United Action Front in a 
statement dated March 30 denounced what the United States has 
been doing on the Korean peninsula as a total challenge to 
international law, international usage, human rights and to the 
interests of the people in the DPRK and the rest of Asia and to 
world peace. 
  A Cuban delegate and 18 resident representatives of 
Dominican, Palestinian, Salvadoran and other national political 
parties and organizations and international organizations 
including the Tri-Continental People's Solidarity organization 
in Cuba held a joint conference in Havana on March 30 and 
published a joint statement, in which they called attention to 
the fact that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
authorities are now driving the situation of the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war on the pretext of the fictitious 
"nuclear issue of the North". The actual nuclear threat on the 
Korean peninsula comes from South Korea where U.S. forces are 
stationed, said the statement. 
  It strongly urged the United States and the South Korean 
authorities to unconditionally and immediately give up the 
deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and the resumption 
of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. 
  The Peruvian group for the study of works of Comrade Kim 
Il-song and the Portuguese Committee for Supporting the 
Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, too, published 
statements urging the United States to renounce its position of 
"strength" and solve the issue through dialogue and negotiation.

<F P=106> ["No Evidence of DPRK's Nuclear Arms Development" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The Malaysian Action 
Front said the suspicion and allegation that North Korea was 
"developing nuclear weapons" were nothing but a speculation and 
propaganda of the West and there was no convincing evidence. 
  In a letter to the U.S. President on the situation of the 
Korean peninsula, representatives of the front said the U.S. 
concern over the possibility of "nuclear arms development" by 
North Korea was a flamboyant hypocrisy. 
  The letter said: 
  "The `nuclear issue' of Korea must be resolved peacefully 
only through a fair dialogue, not by pressure, military threat 
or economic `sanctions.' 
  "The U.S. Government and Congress must abandon such 
dangerous 
games as the provocation of a new war."

<F P=106> ["`The U.S. Must Immediately Stop Nuclear Threat to Korea'" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Public figures of 
different countries have criticised the U.S. pressure upon the 
DPRK. 
  Tanzanian Vice-Minister of Home Affairs Edward Mwesaumo said 
in a statement March 26: 
  "The United States is making haste with the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea and threatening `sanctions' 
against the DPRK. This cannot be construed otherwise than a 
premeditated act intended to delay a solution to the nuclear 
issue of the Korean peninsula and stifle the DPRK." 
  Mozambican Minister of Interior Manuel Jose Antonio said in 
a 
statement April 1 that nothing could be solved by war or 
pressure and all the issues should be settled only through 
peaceful negotiation. 
  "The United States must renounce its policy of strength," he 
added. 
  Chairman of the Zaire-Korea Friendship Association Pierre 
Welo Ahondju Ewale said in a statement April 1 that the United 
States, if it is truly willing to solve the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula, must stop at once, though belatedly, 
introducing Patriot missiles into South Korea and posing a 
nuclear threat to the DPRK and approach the DPRK-U.S. talks with 
sincerity. 
  "If the United States venture invasion of Korea, we will 
join 
the heroic Korean people in the fight of justice against U.S. 
imperialism," he declared.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The Asian Regional 
Committee to Support Korea's Reunification condemned the perfidy 
of the United States in totally reversing the agreed conclusions 
reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York. 
  In its statement March 28, the committee said the U.S. act 
at 
a decisive moment with the solution of the nuclear issue at hand 
clearly proved that it was still pursuing a double-dealing 
policy of resorting to a war scheme and threat to socialist 
Korea while having talks with the latter. 
  Pointing out that the United States is manoeuvring to 
isolate 
and stifle Korea, cashing in on talks, negotiation and "nuclear 
inspection", the statement demanded that it immediately withdraw 
from South Korea with all its nuclear weapons and allow an 
overall inspection of its nuclear weapons in South Korea. 
  Secretary General of the Committee, Om Prakash Mantri, sent 
protest letters to the U.S. President and the South Korean chief 
executive. 
  The letters demanded that the United States take an 
effective 
measure for the implementation of the agreed conclusions, 
squarely looking at the realities, and the South Korean 
authorities stop obeying to its orders. 
  The committee published on March 29 an appeal to political 
parties and public organizations and peaceloving people in Asia, 
calling upon the peaceloving people of Asia and the rest of the 
world to wage a vigorous struggle against the perfidy of the 
United States.

    [Editorial Report] Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting 
Network in Korean at 1200 GMT on 9 April carries a brief report 
on a letter of appeal to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali issued on 30 March by the Standing Committee of the 
Committee of Peace and Today of Russia in connection with the 
present situation of the Korean peninsula. 
  The report says: "The letter of appeal indicates that it 
calls the UN secretary general's attention to the tense 
situation of the Korean peninsula. The letter of appeal revealed 
that the overall campaign the United States and its follower 
forces are waging is aimed at creating another tension on the 
Korean peninsula. The letter of appeal appealed to the United 
Nations to exert due efforts to resolve the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula by means of peace, not by means of unwarranted 
pressure, a policy of force, and sanctions against Korea. The 
letter of appeal stressed that today when the 21st century is 
nearing, all problems should be resolved by way of talks."

<F P=106> ["MINJU CHOSON Slams Kim Yong-sam Group's Dependence on </F>
Outside Forces" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Our fellow countrymen 
cannot live in peace nor can they avoid a nuclear disaster with 
such traitors as the Kim Yong-sam group utterly devoid of 
independence left in the nation, and must remove them in time, 
stresses MINJU CHOSON today. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam during his trip to Japan asked 
Japan 
to "take responsible measures" over the "nuclear issue" of the 
DPRK. He also called the U.S. President on the phone and begged 
for "close cooperation" of the United States in South Korea's 
campaign over the issue. 
  The South Korean "foreign minister" advertised the "need of 
international sanctions" against the DPRK during his trip to the 
United States and Japan. 
  This shows the South Korean puppet clique's dependence on 
outside forces and flunkeyist treacheries against the nation 
have been carried into the extremes. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group regards it as the only way of 
prolonging its days to harm and stifle fellow countrymen as a 
shock brigade in the anti-DPRK hostile policy of outside forces. 
That is why the puppet clique is persisting in confrontation 
and war moves against the North. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group must ponder over the grave 
consequences that might come from its reckless act of driving 
the situation to the brink of war in collusion with outside 
forces.

<F P=106> ["Where Do They Drive the Situation?" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
rulers are driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to a 
grave phase, making much ado as if a war were imminent due to 
the North. Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN today states that 
it is not the North but the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique of South 
Korea who are scheming a war on the Korean peninsula. 
  The news analyst says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group adopted a "policy of tough response" 
to the North at a "high-level strategic meeting." It worked out 
long ago a war scenario against the North codenamed New 
Operation Plan 5027, and promoted a plan for introducing Patriot 
missiles, crying for "a prompt entry into action" and "surprise 
operation." 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is driving the situation to the brink 
of war against fellow countrymen in collusion with outside 
forces. In this it seeks to stifle the DPRK with "strength," 
realise its ambition for unification by invading the North and 
prolong its power with the military support of its master. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is a gang of treacherous political 
charlatans most dependent on outside forces among the successive 
rulers of South Korea. 
  In order to ease the tensions in Korea, save the nation from 
disaster and promote peace and peaceful reunification of the 
country, the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK must be changed 
and such traitors as Kim Yong-sam be removed from power in South 
Korea.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Upwards of 30,000 
students of far more than a hundred universities across South 
Korea under the South Korean Federation of General Student 
councils Friday held rallies and protests and boycotted school 
to check the "parliamentary ratification" of farm market opening 
by the Kim Yong-sam group, a radio report from Seoul said. 
  Some 20,000 students of 20 odd universities in Seoul 
including Korea and Hanyang Universities at their rallies 
branded the enforcement schedule submitted by the Kim Yong-sam 
regime to the GATT as humilitating one which complied with the 
brigandish demand of the United States. They strongly urged its 
revocation and "renegotiation of the Uruguay Round talks." 
  They held protests shouting "check the `parliamentary 
ratification' of farm market opening" in the teeth of repression 
by combat police of some 170 companies 20,000 strong. 
  Student protests also took place in Pusan, Kwangju, Taegu 
and 
other local cities.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The opposition 
Democratic Party of South Korea Friday entered into a 
full-dressed out-of-the-assembly struggle against farm market 
opening with the inaugural ceremony of the committee for 
checking the ratification of the Uruguay Round [UR] accord. 
  Chairman of the Democratic Party Yi Ki-taek, who was elected 
chairman of the committee, in his speech at the inaugural 
ceremony said that the present regime which had revealed its 
diplomatic incompetency and deceived the people was entirely 
responsible for the out-of-the-assembly struggle which the 
opposition party had to wage to check the "National Assembly 
ratification" of farm market opening. 
  He warned that his party would intensify the all-people 
struggle if the authorities refused to shelve the signing of the 
"enforcement schedule of the Uruguay Round accord" and to 
proceed with the renegotiation of the Uruguay Round results".

`Parliamentary Approval'" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- People's rallies were 
held in Seoul, Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju, Taejon and six other 
cities of South Korea from two Saturday afternoon to denounce 
the farm market opening and check its "parliamentary approval," 
a radio report from Seoul said. 
  The rally in Seoul was attended by 15,000 farmers, 
dissidents, citizens and students under the South Korean 
Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon). 
  The ralliers said the South Korean countryside would be 
ruined by the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in which the 
authorities fully accepted the brigandish demands of the United 
States. 
  They urged the "National Assembly" to refuse to "approve" 
farm market opening. 
  In his address at the rally, Yi Ki-taek, president of the 
Democratic Party, urged the authorities not to attend the 
signing ceremony of the Uruguay Round accord scheduled in 
Morocco on April 15, saying that South Korea's agriculture and 
countryside were standing on the edge of a cliff due to the 
humiliating diplomacy. 
  After the rally, the participants continued their protests 
for a long time in front of the "National Assembly building," 
shouting "check with death the parliamentary endorsement of the 
Uruguay Round accord." 
  Prior to the rally in Seoul, 3,000 students of Seoul 
National, Korea and Hanyang Universities under Hanchongnyon held 
meetings to check the Uruguay Round at their universities and 
dispatched a group of 200 hunger strikers to Myongdong Cathedral 
in Seoul. 
  Hanchongnyon announced that a hunger strike against farm 
market opening will be organised from April 9 to 15. 
  Rallies and demonstrations also took place in ten other 
cities including Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju and Taejon, attended by 
10,000 people of different strata. 
  On Friday, 3,000 students held a rally and protests in 
Seoul, 
shouting "Down with Kim Yong-sam" and "Oppose foreign rice."

Students and People"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- It is only too natural 
that the South Korean students and people rose in struggle under 
anti-U.S. slogans, says a NODONG SINMUN analyst today, 
commenting on various meetings, rallies and demonstrations which 
have taken place almost every day these days in nearly all 
places of South Korea against the U.S. imperialists' new war 
provocation moves. 
  The news analyst goes on: 
  After unilaterally aborting the third round of talks with 
the 
DPRK on unreasonable pretexts, the U.S. imperialists openly 
talked about stepping up military threat and pressure on the 
DPRK and have massed their aggression forces in and around South 
Korea. The racket of confrontation and war against the DPRK 
kicked up by the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors by taking 
advantage of it has now reached an extremely reckless phase. It 
goes without saying that should their such reckless military 
moves be overlooked, peace and security on the Korean peninsula 
would be disturbed and our nation would suffer a holocaust of 
nuclear war. 
  South Korean students and people could not tolerate it, so 
they rose in vigorous anti-U.S. protests to remove the source of 
their misfortunes. 
  Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique are ruthlessly 
cracking down on the people's righteous patriotic struggle at 
the point of the bayonet. This is an anti-national criminal act 
that could be done only by such sycophant traitors as the Kim 
Yong-sam group which is seeking to prolong its stay in power 
under the patronage of outside forces, bartering away the 
dignity and interest of the nation lock, stock and barrel. 
  Nothing can break the unshakable will of the South Korean 
people to live in a peaceful and reunified country free from 
foreign domination and interference.

<F P=106> ["CPRF Secretariat Denounces South Korean Authorities' </F>
Development of Nuclear Weapons"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group 
must not resort to the reckless confrontation row against the 
North by taking issue with it in a far-fetched manner, while 
developing nuclear weapons for their part, but eliminate the 
pressurized heavy water reactor (PHWR) and the multi-purpose 
research reactor which have been fully revealed as ones for 
developing nuclear weapons, and stop at once their development 
of nuclear weapons, said the secretariat of the Committee for 
the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] in its 
Information No. 648 released Sunday. 
  Recalling that the Central Committee of the South Korean 
National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) in its white paper March 
30 disclosed that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the 
multi-purpose research reactor at the Taedok complex in South 
Korea are used to develop nuclear weapons and that South Korean 
publications and foreign media continued to report materials of 
scientific analysis and evidences of those concerned proving it, 
the information denounces the South Korean puppets' development 
of nuclear weapons as an undisguised act of perfidy on the joint 
declaration on denuclearization already agreed upon between the 
North and the South. 
  The information says: 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is groundlessly taking issue with the 
North over its "nuclear issue," pressing home the urgency of a 
solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. This is 
intended to draw public attention at home and abroad to the 
North and speed up its own development of nuclear weapons behind 
the facade and provide justification for it. 
  The DPRK's "nuclear issue" is a product of the 
anti-socialist, anti-DPRK plot of the United States and its 
followers. 
  The United States must give up the unjustifiable pressure 
upon the DPRK, stop the deployment of nuclear war materiel 
including Patriot missiles in South Korea and not resume the 
provocative "Team Spirit" nuclear war exercise. 
  The secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA) must apologize for widening the scope of partiality by 
following the United States in its anti-DPRK moves and strictly 
keep to the principle of impartiality in nuclear inspection. 
  We take this opportunity to express our belief that justice- 
and peace-loving governments, political parties, public 
organizations, individual personages and progressive people all 
over the world will further lift up voices of solidarity for the 
Korean people's just struggle to check and frustrate the Kim 
Yong-sam group's development of nuclear weapons and denuclearize 
the Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Information No. 648 issued by the Secretariat of the </F>
Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland on 11 
April in Pyongyang] 
  [Text] The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the 
Fatherland [CPRF] Secretariat issued the following information 
exposing and denouncing the South Korean puppet authorities' 
maneuvers for nuclear weapons development. 
<H5>  CPRF Secretariat Information No. 648 </H5>
  Data concerning the South Korean puppets' maneuvers for 
nuclear weapons development are exposed one after another these 
days, arousing deep concern and indignation at home and abroad. 
  The South Korean National Democratic Front Central Committee 
in a white paper dated 30 March disclosed that the South Korean 
heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and its multipurpose research 
reactor in the Taedok complex were intended to develop nuclear 
weapons. South Korean publications and foreign media also 
continue to report scientific analytical data and testimony from 
relevant people that confirm this. 
  The South Korean puppets' maneuvers for nuclear weapons 
development are an outright betrayal to the joint declaration on 
denuclearization on which the North and the South have agreed, 
and a vicious challenge to the aspiration of all the fellow 
countrymen who yearn for peace and peaceful reunification of the 
country. 
  The South Korean puppets had already established a policy of 
developing nuclear weapons by the early 1970's, and brought a 
Candu-type [Canadian Deuterium-Uranium] heavy-water reactor from 
Canada and installed it in Wolsong in order to secure 
fissionable material. The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong is a 
nuclear reactor for the development of nuclear weapons disguised 
for commercial use. The South Korean magazine WOLGAN CHOSON 
exposed, through the testimony of the specialists who were 
directly involved in the nuclear weapons development, that the 
heavy-water reactor in Wolsong brought from Canada was aimed at 
producing nuclear weapons. 
  The heavy-water reactor--the main purpose of which is to 
produce plutonium, different from the light-water reactor for 
commercial use which is supposed to replace fuel all at the same 
time, suspending operations after filling it with nuclear fuel 
every year or year and a half--is designed so that part of the 
fuel is replaced every day. Therefore, it is easy to secretly 
hoard the plutonium. The South Korean magazine WOLGAN CHOSON 
No. 4, 1992 issue referred to the remark of a researcher from 
the South Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute who said that 
hoarding can be done by making a double ledger and recording in 
it that 10 kg of nuclear fuel is processed even if 1,000 kg of 
nuclear fuel is actually processed. This means that the puppets 
are hoarding plutonium even under surveillance by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. 
  The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong is extracting an enormous 
quantity of used nuclear fuel containing highly pure plutonium 
from natural uranium. The heavy-water reactor in Wolsong, which 
began operation in April 1983, has produced an enormous quantity 
of plutonium, from which some 370 nuclear bombs can be made. 
  Newspapers of many countries, including the United States 
and 
Britain, have reported data exposing the status of nuclear 
weapons development in South Korea and that South Korea has 
already stockpiled 10 tons of plutonium, which will increase to 
24 tons by the year 2000. 
  The multipurpose research reactor in the Taedok complex is 
also intended solely for the development of nuclear weapons. 
The South Korean puppets, carrying on a joint design project 
with Canada for the multipurpose research reactor beginning in 
1985, obtained not only the technology necessary for designing 
and manufacturing a nuclear bomb but the computer software 
[chonsan koud], the key element thereof, as well. 
  The Japanese magazine SEKAI No. 12, 1992 issue reported that 
the multipurpose research reactor can produce a nuclear bomb if 
South Korea purchases enriched uranium from another country 
quite legally and highly enrich it by using the 20 percent 
enriched uranium, which is the highest limit of the lowly 
enriched [chonongchuk] uranium and the lowest limit of the 
highly enriched uranium. The SEKAI magazine also noted that the 
reactor can be remade quickly into a reactor to produce 
plutonium and that it is a reactor for military use, which can 
produce highly pure plutonium as well. 
  The South Korean puppets have accelerated the development 
of nuclear weapons in an integrated plutonium generating and 
extracting system by adding a research retest facility--a 
semi-reprocessing facility--when they built the multipurpose 
research reactor so that the used nuclear fuel from the 
multipurpose reactor can be directly reprocessed in the research 
retest facility. 
  On 29 March, Japanese NHK exposed that the South Korean 
puppets have activated its own nuclear weapons development by a 
group of specialists in the nuclear research facility in Taedok 
since 1991, a year before the multipurpose research reactor was 
completed. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is today further accelerating its 
nuclear weapons development on a full scale by openly denying 
the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula and going in the direction of invalidating it. 
  On 1 April 1993, the former South Korean minister of the 
National Unification Board said that the joint declaration on 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula was originally 
invalidated, that it was time for them to possess nuclear 
capacity, and that the National Assembly should raise its voice 
for possessing nuclear weapons. 
  On 9 October, Kim Yong-sam the traitor presided over a 
so-called security-related ministers' meeting with the presence 
of the minister of Science and Technology to conspire on the 
issues of securing a nuclear fuel reprocessing reactor and 
reviewing the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the 
Korean peninsula. Regarding these South Korean puppet's 
suspicious moves, NEW KOREA TIMES, an overseas Koreans' 
newspaper, exposed in its 23 October 1993 issue that the 
independent right for nuclear development had become a frequent 
subject at the National Assembly. 
  Facts clearly prove that the Wolsong heavy-water reactor and 
multipurpose research reactor in Taedok complex were built for 
nuclear weapons development and that the puppets have been 
secretly prompting the development of nuclear weapons. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group is groundlessly taking issue over our 
nuclear issue talking about the urgency of the resolution of the 
nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is intended to draw 
domestic and international attention to the North, while 
accelerating its own nuclear weapons development behind the 
scenes and justifying it. 
  Our so-called nuclear issue is a product of the 
antisocialist 
and anti-Republic plot of the United States and its followers. 
Under the special circumstances of unilaterally withholding the 
effect of the announcement of withdrawal from the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty temporarily in concurrence with the 
announcement of the DPRK- U.S. joint statement, we suspended all 
transportation of nuclear materials within the Republic to prove 
the transparency of nuclear activities, and allowed inspections 
to assure the continuity of safeguards. 
  In particular, to root out the so-called suspicion, we even 
made a bold decision to transform the existing graphite 
moderated reactor system to a light-water reactor system knowing 
that this would sacrifice the independence of the nuclear energy 
industry, thus displaying the innocence of our nuclear policy at 
home and abroad. The South Korean top leader also confessed in a 
recent news conference that we do not have nuclear weapons and 
admitted that the nuclear development commotion was to frame 
fellow countrymen and was a deliberate scheme to conceal the 
truth of their nuclear weapons development. 
  Even while developing nuclear weapons, the Kim Yong-sam 
ring is irrationally kicking up reckless confrontational 
commotions against the North. Instead, it must eliminate 
[pyegi] its heavy-water reactor and multipurpose research 
reactor, which is clearly for developing nuclear weapons and 
immediately stop maneuvering to develop nuclear weapons. 
  It is the United States that blocks resolution of the 
nuclear 
issue on the Korean peninsula. Instead of fulfilling its 
obligation under the DPRK-U.S. agreement, the United States 
deliberately avoids fulfilling it and uses the so-called nuclear 
issue of the North as a means to fulfill its insidious 
[pulsunhan] purpose of crushing [apsal] our republic. 
  The United States must stop kicking up unjust commotions to 
pressure us and deploying Patriot missiles and other equipment 
for a nuclear war and must not resume the provocative Team 
Spirit nuclear war exercise. 
  The IAEA Secretariat is also responsible for the fact that 
the issue of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula has not been 
resolved. The IAEA Secretariat pointlessly [kongyonhui] found 
fault with our experimental reactor for generating electricity, 
whose irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] has already been proven 
and which has no problem at all, and takes issue with the 
reactor under unjustifiable pretexts. Rather, it turns a blind 
eye to [mugin] the military-purpose heavy-water reactor and 
multipurpose research reactor in South Korea, which have grave 
problems [omjunghan munje] and turned a blind eye to 
[kkaraborida] even those reactors which came into question 
[munjesidoeotton] during inspections. 
  The IAEA Secretariat must apologize for widening the scope 
of 
its partiality [pulgongjongsongui pomwi hwaktae] by following 
the United States in its antirepublic maneuvers and must 
strictly keep to the principle of impartiality in nuclear 
inspections. 
  We take this opportunity to express our belief that 
governments, political parties, public organizations, individual 
personages, and progressive people of various countries of the 
world that love justice and peace will further raise their 
voices of solidarity with the Korean people's just struggle to 
check and frustrate [choji patan] the Kim Yong-sam ring's 
nuclear weapons development maneuvers and denuclearize the 
Korean peninsula.

<F P=106> [Report by Finance Minister Yun Ki-chong to the second day </F>
morning session of the Seventh Session of the Ninth Supreme 
People's Assembly on 7 April: "Review of the Performance of the 
DPRK State Budget for 1993 and the State Budget for 
1994"--recorded] 
  [Text] Comrade deputies: Under today's grand circumstances 
in which all the people are responding to the party's appeal and 
displaying their infinite devotion by vigorously accelerating 
the general march of socialism, we will discuss the result of 
the execution of the state budget of last year and this year. 
  Today, our people are accelerating the struggle to implement 
the revolutionary economic strategy set forth by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song at the 21st plenary session of the 
sixth Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and 
the letter he sent to the historic national agricultural 
meeting. They are also effecting a new great upsurge in the 
major fronts of economic construction, including agriculture and 
light industry. 
  Enhancing the genuine appearance of our society's 
single-hearted unity firmly rallied around the party and the 
leader [suryong] and their beautiful communist virtues which 
show our people's noble ideological and mental features, all of 
our working people are vigorously advancing, while breaking 
through all sorts of difficulties and the challenge of enemies, 
and the whole country is filled an unprecedented upsurge in the 
popular masses' revolutionary zeal. 
  We should strengthen the country's might and further exalt 
the superiority of the popular masses-centered socialism of our 
own style by successfully executing the immense tasks of 
economic construction that we are facing and this year's state 
budget on the strength of our masses' surging revolutionary 
zeal. By the authority of the Government of the Republic I will 
now present a report on the settlement of the execution of the 
state budget for 1993 and the state budget for 1994. 
  Comrade deputies: Last year our people won a great victory 
in 
socialist construction by surmounting the grim trials laid 
before the fatherland and the revolution and by fighting 
heroically under the party's leadership. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Winning 
successive victories in political and military confrontation 
with enemies under the party's leadership, our people vigorously 
accelerated socialist economic construction with surging 
revolutionary zeal last year and, as a result, adorned the last 
year of the Third Seven-Year Plan as a brilliant year. 
  Last year, the imperialists and reactionaries perpetrated 
offensives and aggression manuevers designed to oppose our 
republic, a fortress of socialism, and to crush our socialist 
cause more adventurously and viciously. However, they could not 
frighten our people, nor could they block our people's advance. 
  Our party took a stern self-defensive measure of placing the 
whole country, all the people, and all the Army in a semi-war 
state to cope with the extremely acute situation which was 
created due to the Team Spirit joint military exercise staged by 
the U.S. imperialists and, thus, vigorously inspired all the 
people throughout the country into a struggle to defend the 
sovereignty aof the country and the gains of the revolution. 
  Brave officers and men of our People's Army and all of the 
working people who are infinitely loyal to the party and the 
leader [suryong] bravely rose up with a do-or-die determination 
in response to the party's call and heroically braved the 
enemies' offensives, holding aloft the banner of socialism to 
thus honorably defended the fatherland's dignity and security. 
[applause] 
  Upholding our party's call, our people waged a vigorous 
and continuous battle of loyalty, maintaining the spirit of 
general mobilization heightened during the period of a semi-war 
state, registered great labor exploits, and grandly celebrated 
the 40th anniversary of the victory in the Great Fatherland 
Liberation War. Through this, they strongly demonstrated the 
heroic spirit of our people vigorously advancing firmly rallied 
around the party and the leader and the might of chuche Korea. 
[applause] 
  In the forceful blaze of the external struggle and of the 
socialist general onward march which was vigorously waged 
greeting the 40th anniversary of the war victory, the 
revolutionary ranks of our wholehearted unity were solidified 
more firmly into an invincible force, and a great upsurge was 
brought forth in socialist economic construction. By so doing, 
a great victory was won in the battle for the final year of the 
Third Seven-Year Plan. 
  In connection with the conclusion of the Third Seven-Year 
Plan, the 21st plenary meeting of the Sixth WPK Central 
Committee held last year proudly summed up the great advance our 
people had achieved in all sectors of socialist construction 
under our party's great leadership despite grave trials and 
difficulties during this period when the situation at home and 
abroad was most complex and acute. By so doing, the plenary 
meeting highly demonstrated again the heroic spirit of the 
chuche Korea and the might of our-style socialism which is 
firmly maintained in a corner of the Orient and is victoriously 
advancing. 
  All the victories our people achieved in acute confrontation 
with enemies last year were a great victory of the 
ever-victorious strength of our party's iron will and tested 
leadership and independent, self-reliant, and self-defending 
revolutionary line. They were the victory of the wholehearted 
unity of the leader, the party, and the masses. They were the 
powerful demonstration of the superiority and invincibility of 
our-style socialism centered on the popular masses. [applause] 
  In the all-people general onward march last year, our people 
brought forth great upsurges in socialist economic construction, 
thus successfully executing the state budget as well. The total 
state budget revenue last year was 40.5712 billion won. This 
represents our overfulfilling the plan by 0.3 percent. Because 
our people vigorously waged a mass campaign to increase the 
financial revenue by effecting production upsurge in all sectors 
of the people's economy and effectively utilizing the existing 
economic base, the budget revenue scored an increase of 2.6 
percent over the previous year. 
  The total state budget expenditure last year was 40.24297 
billion won. This represents an execution of 99.5 percent of 
the planned amount and an increase of 2.4 percent over the 
previous year. 
  The state budget last year satisfactorily ensured the 
increasing financial demands in various domains of socialist 
construction based on the increased budged revenue, and was 
successfully summed up with financial reserves of 328.23 million 
won. 
  During the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan which was 
embroidered with great creation and construction, state budget 
income in our country increased with a rapid average speed of 
5.2 percent per year and the total scale of budget income 
increased 1.4 times. 
  As a result, the state budget in our country excellently 
contributed to strengthening the might of the self-reliant 
socialist economy, to promoting and developing a socialist 
national culture, to promoting the people's material and 
cultural welfare, and to highly displaying the superiority of 
our own-style socialism. 
  This clearly demonstrates incomparable superiority and 
firmness of the state budget of our country, which is developing 
in a planned manner based on independent financial foundations, 
as well as the justness of our party's financial policy. 
[applause] 
  Last year, the government of the republic increased 
disbursement of funds to the national economy 2.5 percent over 
the previous year with a view to accelerating socialist economic 
construction and to further promoting the people's living 
standard. Of the funds, the investment in precedent sectors of 
national economy, in light industry, and in rural economy was 
drastically increased. 
  Last year the state budget increased the investment in coal 
industry, mining industry, electric power industry, and metal 
industry, by 3.5 percent over the previous year, and ensured 
production conditions with priority. Thus, it directed great 
efforts to effecting a production upsurge in these domains. 
  By cherishing ardent loyalty to the party and the leader, 
the 
working class of the coal industry domain effected collective 
innovations last year, and completed construction of Hwapung 
mine in Anju district mine complex; the project of in-pit 
belt-conveyer transport line in Namyang mine, Pukchang district 
mine complex, and first and second-phase construction project of 
long-range conveyor-belt transport line in Yongdae mine. The 
working class in this domain vigorously pushed ahead with 
construction of new mines and new pits, and expansion project of 
existing pits, and accelerated modernization of in-pit transport 
means and coal mining facilities, thus drastically increasing 
coal production capacity. 
  Last year, the mining industry sector completed construction 
of No. 12 pit and No.24 vertical pit in Komdok mine complex; ore 
dressing site in (Taeduri) mine; ore dressing site in Changsang 
mine, and [word indistinct] in Munmuri mine. The mining industry 
sector further expanded mines with bright prospects and 
drastically increased production of various types of ore 
including lead, zinc, and copper. 
  Construction of large-scale hydroelectric power stations and 
thermoelectric power stations, Kumgangsan power station, and 
Yongwon power station was vigorously pushed ahead last year, 
thanks to the devoted labor struggle of the working class of the 
electric power industry sector which is endlessly loyal to the 
party and the leader, and of the builders of the power stations. 
In addition, the No. 1 generator in Namgang power station and 
No. 2 generator in Tongpyongyang thermoelectric power station 
began operation, and a large number of small and medium-size 
hydroelectric power stations were built in many places. 
  Last year in the metal industry sector, the construction 
project of the steel plate [words indistinct] in the Hwanghae 
Iron and Steel Complex, the construction project of the [word 
indistinct] in the Chollima Steel Complex, and the expansion 
work of the ferroalloy workshop in the Puryong Ferroalloy 
Complex were completed because of the strength of the state's 
vast investments and steel workers' creative efforts and 
struggle. The processes of steel and rolling steel manufacturing 
were readjusted and strengthened, and, as a result, metal plants 
were more firmly built into a chuche-oriented and modern 
metallurgical base. 
  Last year, our party and the government of the republic 
concentrated great efforts on developing the light industry. The 
state budget allocated a large amount of funds--which increased 
4 percent over the previous year--to the light industry sector 
in accordance with our party's revolutionary policy of 
increasing investments in the light industry and of thoroughly 
carrying out the revolution in the light industry sector. 
  Thanks to our party's active measures and the devoted labor 
struggle by the working class in the light industry sector, a 
great innovation was effected in the production of various kinds 
of daily necessities urgently required in improving the people's 
living. Along with this, the expansion work of the Kusong 
textile plant, the construction of the 4 March plant, the 
construction of the Nanam clothing plant, and the construction 
projects of various other modern textile and clothing plants, 
shoes plants, and food processing plants were completed and put 
into operation. Thus, the modernization of light industry plant 
facilities were vigorously carried out. 
  Last year, the government of the republic also allocated a 
large amount of funds--which increased 4 percent over the 
previous year--to the railway transport sector. The working 
class and builders in the railway transport sector readjusted 
and strengthened major trunk lines into heavy-duty rails by 
accelerating the modernization of railway transport and the 
introduction of heavy-duty railways, upholding the party's 
policy of carrying out the revolution in the transport sector. 
They also actively carried out the work for technological 
innovation and completed the electrification of the 
Yongkwang-Saju line, the construction of the turning line 
[tollimson] railway construction between Kowon and Kurae, and 
other railway electrification projects and new railway 
construction in many areas. Thus, they further increased the 
railway transport capabilities. 
  Last year, the rural economy sector vigorously waged the 
struggle to implement the demands of the socialist rural theses 
and the chuche farm methods and, as a result, achieved a great 
progress in agricultural production. 
  Last year, the state sharply increased its investment in 
agriculture--2.8 percent over the previous year--in an effort to 
strengthen the material and technological foundation of the 
rural economy by carrying out the rural technological 
revolution. Last year, on the strength of the vigorous support 
from the people throughout the country, our agricultural working 
people completed the construction of the Sohae lockgate 
(Haesan)-Ongjin waterway and, thus, more smoothly resolved the 
water supply problem in our country's plain areas. They also 
built 1,000 water pumping stations and drainage facilities and 
more of water reservoirs and underground water supply facilities 
in various areas. Thus, they more properly perfected the 
irrigation system in our rural areas. 
  Thanks to our party's active measures to achieve the use of 
chemicals in the rural economy, last year more of various kinds 
of chemical fertilizer were produced and supplied in the rural 
areas, and, as a result, the amount of chemical fertilizers 
applied on fields across the country increased by far. 
  Last year, a large number of tractors, trucks, and various 
types of modern farm machines were produced and supplied to 
cooperative farms. 
  By vigorously carrying out the huge nature remaking 
project to build a tideland towards the West Sea, our brave 
tideland builders have registered a brilliant feat of reclaiming 
vast areas of tidal land by completing construction on Kumsong 
and Chongsudo tidelands. 
  Under the banner of the socialist rural theses, irrigation 
and electrification have already been completed at a high level 
in our country's rural areas, and new progress has also been 
made in mechanizing and scientizing rural areas. Thus, a 
significant [kyolchongjogin] victory has been achieved in 
implementing a technological revolution in rural areas. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song sent a historic letter 
to the national agricultural meeting held on the 30th 
anniversary of the publication of the theses on our country's 
socialist rural problems. In the letter, summing up the great 
victory achieved by our party and people in the struggle to 
implement the rural theses, he announced proudly that the 
historic task of implementing the technological revolution in 
rural areas, which is presented in the socialist rural theses, 
has basically been completed [kibonjogurowansong toeodda] with 
the realization of irrigation, electrification, mechanization, 
and scientization in our country's rural areas. [applause] 
  This is the change of the century made in our country's 
rural 
areas and the most brilliant victory achieved in the course of 
the struggle to realize the rural theses. [applause] 
  Because of the technological revolution realized in rural 
areas under the brilliant rays of the socialist rural theses, 
the material and technological basis of agriculture has been 
strengthened further than ever, and we could achieve a bumper 
crop last year despite unfavorable weather by completely 
observing the chuche farming method. 
  The brilliant result achieved in the rural economic 
development under our party's leadership clearly demonstrates 
the great vitality of the socialist rural theses, which has 
opened the broad way to solve rural problems, and the 
superiority of our country's socialist rural economic system, 
which has been consolidated and developed under the banner of 
the rural theses. [applause] 
  The republic's government appropriated an enormous fund, 1.5 
percent up from last year, to build more houses and to further 
develop cities and other territories of the country. 
  Upholding our party's intent to build a grand capital, 
builders and supporters in Pyongyang built the Kwangbok and 
Tong-il streets and 50,000 modern houses and completed the huge 
and difficult construction in the short space of one and half 
years by continuously effecting mass innovations. Last year, 
they registered another brilliant feat of completing the 
construction of an additional 30,000 modern houses. 
  The newly built magnificent, luxurious modern houses in the 
capital are proud creations whose construction was due to the 
great benevolence of our party, which has led builders to create 
an unprecedented speed of construction with a high goal to 
arrange better living conditions for our people. 
  Last year, in Pyongyang city, greeting the 40th 
anniversary of the war victory, the commemorative tower of the 
victory of the Fatherland Liberation War was built reflecting 
our party's lofty will and farsighted plan to hand down the 
heroic exploits of our People's Army and our people who 
honorably defended the freedom and sovereignty of the fatherland 
to the next generations forever. Along with this, the three 
revolutions exhibition newly opened; a hotel for (?scientists), 
Pyongyang cold noodle restaurant equipped with 5,000 seats in 
modern facilities, the road between Pyongyang and Kangdong, the 
(Munsong) (?playground), and Pyongyang bowling hall--which 
reflects the patriotic spirit of the industrialists of the 
General Association of Koreans residing in Japan and their 
families--were outstandingly built. As a result of this, 
Pyongyang has been turned into a more splendid, modern city. 
  Numerous monumental edifices which have been built in 
Pyongyang in succession very year and the grand appearance of 
Pyongyang which is being changed clearly shows the dignified 
appearance of chuche Korea which is enjoying infinite grandeur 
and prosperity and the wisdom and heroic mettle of our people 
who are glorifying the era of the Workers Party. 
  Last year, the state built many modern houses not only in 
local cities such as Sinuiju, Haesan, Haeju, and Kaesong, but 
also in rural areas and, thus, provided more cultural living 
conditions to the people. 
  Last year, the government of the republic further increased 
social, cultural, and housing expenses to further develop all 
fields of socialist cultural construction. Last year, the state 
further increased scientific and technological development work 
expenses 7 percent over the previous year. Our scientists and 
technicians fully demonstrated their creative ability and wisdom 
with infinite loyalty to the party and the leader [suryong] and 
outstandingly solved various valuable scientific and 
technological problems arising in making the national economy 
chuche-oriented, modernized, and scientific. Thus, they actively 
contributed to the country's scientific and technological 
development. 
  Last year, the government of the republic raised 
expenditures 
for educational work 3.5 percent over the previous year and 
built anew some additional 20 colleges, including engineering 
colleges, agricultural colleges, and physical culture colleges, 
in provinces. It also built some 1,000 classrooms in various 
schools and provided schools with modern educational equipment 
and facilities. Thus, it has provided a firmer foundation for 
education for the next generations and for the training of 
national cadres. 
  Last year, the government of the republic also raised 
expenditures for cultural work, public health work, and sports 
work in an effort to smoothly guarantee the development of 
literary and arts, public health, and sports. 
  Last year, not only the (Namdaebong) secret camp and the 
(Pukdaebong) secret camp--which were founded by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song during his anti-Japanese armed struggle in 
the area of central Korea as strong points for his local 
leadership--were rebuilt as they were, but also various 
historical battlefields of the revolution and historical sites 
of the revolution which will glorify the immortal revolutionary 
achievements of the party and the leader forever were more 
outstandingly rebuilt as strongpoints for the indoctrination in 
the revolutionary traditions. 
  At the same time, last year, thanks to the policy of 
correctly inheriting and developing national cultural relics 
elucidated by the great leader and thanks to the wise leadership 
of our party, the royal tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder king 
of Koguryo, which was a powerful big country in the Orient, and 
the royal tomb of King Wanggon, the founder king of Koryo, were 
outstandingly rebuilt. With the unearthing of Tangun's tomb we 
could discover again the founder king of our nation and the 
5,000 year history of our nation, and the work of rebuilding the 
tomb was vigorously carried out, thus, making the hearts of all 
fellow countrymen filled with national dignity and honor. 
  Thanks to the measures taken by our party--which 
ceaselessly gives unsparing love and concern to bring our 
children up well culturally and emotionally, and promote their 
health--the Songdokwon International Children's Union Members 
Camp has sprang up magnificently. The first stage of 
construction for the Hamhung Municipal Children's Union Members 
Camp has been finished, enabling it to open to the republic. In 
addition, thanks to young compatriots' patriot devotion, the 
splendid Aeguk Preventives Manufacturing Plant has been newly 
built, greatly contributing to implementing the party's lines of 
preventive medicine. 
  Last year, the state offered additional benefits to our 
people by increasing various popular [word indistinct] to 
promote the people's welfare. 
  Not long ago, our people observed the 20th anniversary of 
the 
proclamation of the historic law on totally abolishing the tax 
system. Without collecting a penny for taxes, our country last 
year supplied food to workers and office employees almost free 
of charge at state expense, and implemented the systems of 
overall free education and free comprehensive medical care. In 
addition, our country provided well-furnished houses to workers, 
office employees, and peasants, and electricity, service water, 
and even fuel were supplied free of charge. In this way, the 
state last year envisaged a great amount of funds worth billions 
of won to implement these policies alone. 
  Amid the rapidly changing situation and difficulties during 
the period of the Third Seven-Year Plan, Our party and the 
government of the republic invariably carried out all sorts of 
popular communist policies for the people without trimming a 
penny from the state's huge financial expenditure even under a 
difficult condition in which many things had to diverted 
economically to the defense due to stern situation prevailing on 
the Korean peninsula. 
  During the same period, our party and the government of the 
republic drastically raised the wages [saenghwalbi] of all 
workers, technicians, and office employees to 43.4 percent on 
the average, and sharply increased social security funds for 
welfare recipients [sahoebojangja] and scholarships to students 
in each school. Our party and the government of the republic 
implemented the epoch-making policy to increase the income of 
peasants of cooperative farms by increasing the purchase price 
of paddy rice, maize, and other agricultural products. 
  Our country, in which the most powerful socialist 
self-reliant economy has been established as a result of the 
brilliant embodiment of the great chuche idea, grants the most 
advanced social, cultural policies and popular policies. Thus, 
all of our people are firmly guaranteed with a stable life and 
fully enjoy a self-reliant political life and a happy material 
and cultural life. 
  These clearly show the superiority of popular-mass centered 
socialism of our own style, which cannot be compared with 
others, in which the party and the state not only practically 
ensure the people's political rights and freedom, but also do 
everything for the people's welfare and assume total 
responsibility for their life. 
  Last year, the government of the republic earmarked 12.5 
percent of the total state budgetary expenditures for defense 
spending to thoroughly implement our party's military line of 
self-defense and to firmly defend the socialist fatherland's 
security and the gains of the revolution. 
  Today, our military might has been further solidified 
enough for us to be able to beat the enemy's any provocation and 
surprise invasion. Our one-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary 
forces are dependably defending the country's defense line with 
high vigilance. 
  The state budget last year smoothly met with the financial 
needs for the enormous tasks to accelerate socialist economic 
construction and cultural construction, to enhance the people's 
living standard, and to firmly solidify the country's defense 
capability, thus actively contributing to strengthening the 
country's might and defending, adhering to, and further adding 
luster to our style socialism. 
  The proud summation of the execution of the state budget 
last 
year clearly demonstrates the justness of our party's financial 
policy, our state budget's people-oriented nature which embodies 
the popular masses' independent demands and aspirations and 
serves the people's welfare thoroughly, and the solidity and 
superiority of the socialist finance of our country. 
  All the successes we attained last year in socialist 
construction and in the execution of state budget is a noble 
fruition of the revolutionary guideline for socialist economic 
construction and the direction of the socialist finance 
elucidated by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and of the 
struggle of all the people exerting boundless devotion and 
spirit of sacrifice under the leadership of our party with 
wholehearted unity around the party. [applause] 
  Comrade deputies: Today we have a rewarding task to attain 
new greater success in socialist construction by thoroughly 
implementing the strategic guideline of economic construction 
which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forth in the 21st 
plenary meeting of the Sixth WPK Central Committee. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: In 
socialist economic construction, we will set aside a period of 
adjustment for three years from now as decided by the 21st 
plenary meeting of the sixth party Central Committee. During 
this period, we must thoroughly implement the agriculture-first, 
light industry-first, and trade-first policies. At the same 
time, we should give definite priority to coal mining industry, 
power industry, and railway transport--the leading sectors of 
the people's economy--and continuously develop the metal 
industry. 
  The revolutionary economic strategy put forth by our party 
is 
to thoroughly implement, during the period of adjustment, the 
agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first 
policies and to give priority to the coal mining industry, power 
industry, and railway transport--the leading sectors of the 
people's economy--and continuously develop metal the industry. 
  The party's revolutionary economic strategy is a 
revolutionary guideline for economic construction to solidify 
the country's self-reliant economic base as firm as a rock in 
conformity with the demand of the new stage of development of 
our country's socialist construction, to drastically improve the 
people's living standard, and to firmly solidify the springboard 
to bring forth a new leap forward in all fronts of socialist 
construction. 
  The 1994 state budget has been compiled in order to 
implement 
the agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first 
policies according to the revolutionary economic strategy put 
forth by our party, to concentrate the country's financial 
resources on giving priority to the leading sectors of the 
people's economy, and to further strengthen the might of our 
country's socialist self-reliant economy. 
  The total revenue and expenditure of the state budget for 
1994 amount to 41.52519 billio won each, up 2.4 percent in 
revenue and 3.2 percent in expenditure from last year. 
  The state budget for this year will firmly achieve an 
increase of the budgetary revenue based on the creative zeal of 
our people, who are accelerating the general onward march of 
socialism, and the great potential of our country's socialist, 
self-reliant national economy. 
  It is an invariable policy of our party and the Republic 
government to make the state budget put great emphasis on 
expenditure for the national economy in order to enhance the 
national economic strength and to improve the people's living 
standard. 
  The government of the republic will increase expenditure for 
the national economy by 3.2 percent from last year, and a huge 
state fund will be appropriated for developing agriculture, 
light industry, and trade with foreign countries. 
  In order to consolidate and develop the achieved result in 
the course of the struggle to implement the socialist rural 
theses, upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
historic letter to the national agricultural meeting, the state 
will drastically [hoekkijoguro] increase investment in the 
agricultural sector by 6 percent from last year and will 
continue to accelerate the socialist rural construction. 
  The government of the republic will consolidate the result 
that has been achieved basically in the technological revolution 
in our country's rural areas and let it demonstrate its might. 
In particular, the government will concentrate its effort to 
expand and develop the result of mechanization and scientization 
under the condition that irrigation and electrification has been 
completed at a high level. 
  Our party has recently sent 500 tractors 250 automobiles, 
all 
at the same time, to rural areas in Chongdan, Yanan, and Taechon 
counties to elevate the level of general mechanization of rural 
economy and to accelerate the industrialization and 
modernization of agriculture. 
  According to the party policy, the state will send more 
tractors, automobiles, and various modern farming machines to 
rural areas by normalizing the production by farming machinery 
plants at a high level. The state will also concentrate efforts 
to increase the fertilizer production by chemical fertilizer 
plants and will supply well-assorted chemical fertilizer to 
rural areas more than before. 
  All agricultural working people and supporters will make all 
valuable results achieved in the course of implementing the 
technological revolution in rural areas take effect, upholding 
the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's historic letter to the 
national agricultural meeting and upholding the banner of the 
socialist rural theses. They will also carry out all farming 
work tenaciously and methodically in a scientific and 
technological way while thoroughly implementing the chuche 
farming method. By doing so, they will make another great 
upsurge in grain production and all other areas of agricultural 
production. 
  This year, the government of the republic will increase 
investment in light industry by 5.4 percent from last year and 
will vigorously accelerate the light industrial revolution. 
  The state will also concentrate its efforts to actively 
modernize facilities and processing lines of existing central 
light industrial plants and local industrial plants, to expand 
and develop branch plants, workshops, and work teams that 
produce 3 August people's consumer goods, to increase the 
production by synthetic fiber and synthetic resin chemical 
plants, and to supply various light industrial materials. 
  With a high sense of loyalty toward the party and the 
leader [suryong], all workers in light industry this year will 
highly display their positive creativity to operate the light 
industrial plants at full capability, normalize production on a 
high level, and greatly increase the production of textile goods 
of various sorts, daily necessities, and processed foodstuffs 
and decisively improve their qualities. In this way, we will 
make decisive turns in the production of people's consumer goods. 
  The state budget for this year foresees massive expenditures 
for increasing exports to thoroughly implement the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song's instruction on developing foreign trade to 
comply with the changed environment and our party's policy 
toward that end. 
  The government of the republic will increase the state 
investments for expanding and strengthening the existing 
production bases 4.2 percent this year compared to last year, 
establish more plants, shops, and work teams for producing 
export goods and further strengthen their technological basis in 
production, and build more bases for processing trade [kagong 
muyok kiji]. 
  All sectors of the people's economy and all regions will 
thoroughly implement our party's trade policy, find more sources 
for exports, positively advance into foreign markets, thoroughly 
maintain their credit [sinyongul cholchohui chikigo], and 
vigorously carry out trade-related activities. In this way, 
they will make new progress in foreign trade. 
  Giving top priority to the coal industry, the power 
industry, 
and railway transportation, and developing the metallurgical 
industry is an important task to implement the plan on the 
agriculture-, light industry-, and foreign trade-first principle 
and vigorously accelerate the country's overall economic 
construction. 
  The state budget for this year foresees an increase of 3 
percent in investments in the coal industry, the power industry, 
and railway transportation compared to last year. The 
government of the republic will accelerate drilling and the 
construction of pits in all coal mines and exert efforts to 
build more [word indistinct] and coal pits and modernize coal 
mining equipment. In the power industry, it will accelerate the 
construction of large-scale hydraulic power stations and thermal 
power stations and build many small and medium-size power 
stations everywhere, thus strongly consolidating the country's 
resource and power bases. 
  Also, in the railway transportation sector, the government 
of 
the republic will improve railway systems strong enough for 
heavy-duty trains [choldo chungnyanghwa] in the 
Pyongyang-Chongjin railway line and other major railway lines, 
electrify more and more railway lines, and accelerate the 
modernization of means of transportation, thus further 
increasing the railway system's transportation capability. 
  This year, the state will increase its investment in the 
metallurgical industry 2.6 percent compared to last year, better 
repair and maintain facilities in metallurgical plants, 
positively realize the chuche-orientation of the metallurgical 
industry, and, thus, further strengthen the production basis of 
steel products. 
  According to our party's [word indistinct] economic 
strategy, 
we will score new gains in important fronts of economic 
construction; have all people in a few years [kakkaun yongange] 
fulfill our people's earnest desire to eat rice and meat soup, 
wear silk clothes, and live in a tile-roofed house in a few 
years; and further consolidate the self-reliant basis for the 
economy of popular masses-centered socialism of our own style 
like a rock. 
  Accelerating the cultural revolution and making socialist 
culture bloom and develop is an important task to highly display 
the superiority of socialism of our own style and complete the 
socialist cause. 
  This year the government of the republic will increase 
expenditure for practicing its socialist cultural policy by 2.8 
percent compared to last year to further develop all areas of 
our socialist cultural construction. 
  The state will increase expenditure for (?science 
activities) 
by 4 percent and education by 2 percent compared to last year so 
as to arrange better conditions for educational organizations 
intensifying scientific research and improving the quality of 
education in conformity with the demand of developing realities. 
  At the same time, the state will also increase expenditure 
for culture, public health, and sports to advance the socialist 
national culture and art, to strengthen medical service for the 
people, and to implement the policy of popularizing sports so 
that working people's health can improve. 
  The government of the republic will increase expenditure for 
its people-oriented policy this year so that various state 
benefits, such as free education, free medical care, the 
nurturing and indoctrination of children at state expense, 
socialist insurance, and socialist security, can be well granted 
to the people. 
  The government of the republic has provided a huge amount of 
educational aid and stipends every year for the development of 
democratic, national education for Korean children in Japan. 
  This year, too, the government of the republic will send a 
huge amount of educational aid and stipends to Korean children 
in Japan. This great, repeated benevolent care granted by our 
party and state under the respected and beloved leader's 
consideration will vigorously encourage the democratic national 
education of the General Association of Koreans Residents in 
Japan and will greatly encourage patriotic activities of Korean 
compatriots in Japan who are devoting their all to achieving the 
fatherland's independent and peaceful reunification. 
  The government of the republic envisages 11.6 percent of the 
total state budgetary expenditure as defense appropriations this 
year to firmly deepen the country's defense capabilities in 
coping with the enemies' provocation maneuvers. 
  By thoroughly implementing the party's self-defensive 
military line, we will iron-tightly harden the military strength 
of the People's Army and the all-state- and all-people-oriented 
party system. Also, by advancing the beautiful virtue of unity 
between the Army and the people, we will firmly make every 
preparation to cope with any unexpected situation on our own 
initiative [chudongjoguro]. 
  This year's state budget submitted to the Supreme People's 
Assembly for deliberation is a chuche-based solid budget that 
guarantees financial support for the huge tasks of economic 
construction presented by the party, with our own financial 
resources on the firm foundation of the self-reliant socialist 
economy. It also a people-oriented, revolutionary budget that 
will improve the people's material and cultural living 
conditions, strengthen the country's might, and enhance the 
superiority of socialism of our own style. [applause] 
  Comrade deputies: 
  Successfully executing this year's state budget is an 
honorable task to add luster to the popular masses-oriented 
socialism of our country by making a new change and a greater 
victory in socialist construction. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: Upholding the 
party's militant slogans, all functionaries, party members, and 
working people should continue to innovate and advance in the 
spirit of Chollima plus the nineties' speed, so that they can 
make the new year 1994 a historic changeover in the revolution 
and construction in our country. 
  In order to successfully execute this year's state budget 
while implementing the party's revolutionary economic 
strategies, all domains and units of the national economy should 
vigorously carry out the struggle for increased production and 
economization as a mass movement. 
  To vigorously carry out the struggle for the maximum 
increased production and economy is an important principle to be 
firmly adhered to in the whole course of socialist economic 
construction. To do so is also an important task to demonstrate 
the substantial superiority of our country's socialism and is a 
sublime duty of all the working people who are masters of the 
country and the society. 
  Intensifying the produce-more and save-more campaign is a 
basic way to vigorously push ahead with economic construction 
under the present situation. It is a decisive guarantee for 
increasing the revenue sources in conformity with the socialist 
state budget's people-oriented nature and for successfully 
executing this year's budget. The functionaries and working 
people of all the sectors and units of the people's economy 
should place themselves into general mobilization, according to 
our party's call, with high revolutionary self-awareness and 
with an attitude befitting masters, and wage an all-people 
struggle to produce and save to the maximum degree. 
  The functionaries and all the working people at plants and 
enterprises of all sectors of the people's economy should exert 
high creative wisdom and positive attitude, find all sorts of 
production reserve and potential, operate all the facilities at 
full capacity, and wage a vigorous struggle to increase 
production to the maximum degree. 
  All sectors and units should wage an active struggle to save 
as much as possible fuel, energy, and various kinds of raw 
materials and facilities and to mobilize all sorts of reserves. 
At the same time, they should highly exert such an attitude 
befitting masters as producing more with available materials and 
facilities and managing the state's economic life assiduously 
and methodically. 
  The best wisdom in producing more and saving more at the 
present time lies in vigorously conducting the technological 
innovation campaign. All sectors of the people's economy should 
have the scientists, technicians, and producing masses give full 
play to their talents and creativity and wage a vigorous 
campaign of mass technological innovation, thus developing new 
technology and apply advanced technology actively to the 
production. 
  To successfully execute this year's state budget, we should 
properly implement the independent economic accounting system 
[tongnip chaesanje] in conformity with the demand of the great 
Taean work system, intensify the local budgetary system [chibang 
yesanje], and further improve and intensify the financial 
management work. To properly implement the independent economic 
accounting system in conformity with the Taean work system is 
our party's consistent policy. It is also an important 
requisite to improving and intensifying managerial activities 
and financial management. 
  The independent economic accounting system is a planned and 
rational managerial and operational method of the socialist 
state-run enterprises in which the plants and enterprises make 
both ends meet and give benefit to the state while engaging in 
managerial activities with relative managerial independence 
under the state's central guidance. All the plants and 
enterprises should work more scrupulously to properly implement 
the independent economic accounting system in conformity with 
the demand of the Taean work system in order to have the working 
people give full play to their political self-awareness, 
revolutionary enthusiasm, and collectivism. In so doing, they 
should rationalize their production and managerial activities, 
making both ends meet and increasing profit, so that they can 
give greater profit to the state. 
  The local budgetary system which the great leader founded is 
a new-type budgetary system of our-style socialism which makes 
it possible to manage the overall economic life of both local 
area and the state well by enhancing the local area's 
responsibility and creativity while firmly ensuring the state's 
central guidance. The local budgetary system has displayed 
great vitality in the management of the state's economic life 
over the last 20 years. Giving full play to the superiority of 
the local budgetary system, all the local areas today are 
increasing the local budget revenue every year and turning over 
much funds to the state after smoothly appropriating the funds 
necessary for the development of the local area's economy and 
culture and for the local area's economic life. 
  The basic unit of the local budgetary system is county. In 
order to develop the local budgetary system, we should 
thoroughly implement our party's consistent policy to enhance 
the function and role of the county--the base of the local 
area's economic and cultural development. All counties should 
make exceptional efforts to develop agriculture and local 
industry in conformity with the party's policy and the county's 
own special characteristic. At the same time, they should carry 
out good work of earning foreign currency and actively conduct 
service activities in order to earn more money, so that they can 
keep their local area in better shape and further enhance the 
people's standard of living. 
  Intensifying the system of daily summing up production and 
finance put forth by our party is an urgent demand to improve 
and reinforce financial management, as well as production 
management, by having the producing masses give full play to 
their revolutionary enthusiasm and creative activity. 
  Plants and enterprises of all sectors of the people's 
economy should more properly organize production and finance 
management by further strengthening the summing system of 
production and finance and by organizing and proceeding the 
system in a normal and orderly manner. 
  In order to improve finance management and correctly execute 
the national budget, the role of finance management 
organizations should be enhanced. The finance management 
organizations should thoroughly establish the principle of the 
unitary management of the nation's finance and the principle of 
planned agreement, utilize funds in a well-planned manner in 
accordance with the national financial plan, strictly follow the 
financial regulation, and strengthen financial control to make 
sure no national funds are wasted. 
  Organizing economic organizational work and production 
command and making a new turn in the business ethos of 
functionaries are fundamental methods for thoroughly 
implementing our party's economic strategy and executing our 
national budget in a phased manner. 
  Functionaries should conduct economic operations for 
implementing the economic strategies and policy presented by the 
party and properly carry out planning work and material supply 
work in conformity with the demands of new economic strategies, 
and establish strongly disciplined regulations of economic works. 
  With a high spirit of revolution, all economic guidance 
functionaries should work in a militant and revolutionary manner 
filled with confidence and optimism, and volunteer to open a 
breakthrough in difficult and tough works. 
  All functionaries should ceaselessly make themselves 
revolutionary upholding the great leader's philosophy of taking 
the people as heaven and our party's slogan of serving the 
people, and should become true people's servants who always 
involve themselves with the masses, share joy and sorrow with 
them, and dedicate their all for the people. 
  To achieve brilliant victory in the combat of this year's 
economic construction, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance 
and fortitude should be highly displayed. Self-reliance is the 
traditional revolutionary spirit of our party which has always 
won in the long and arduous revolutionary struggles, the party's 
revolutionary slogan which should be upheld more than ever in 
today's situation, and a victorious banner which firmly 
guarantees the result of this year's combat. 
  All functionaries and working people should vigorously 
advance with the same struggle spirit, which effected the 
Chollima upsurge amid postwar dust and dirts with the strong 
spirit of self-reliance that filled the Paektu secret camp, so 
that another revolutionary great upsurge may be effected in all 
fores of this year's socialist construction. 
  Strengthening our revolutionary rank's single-minded unity 
upholding our party's leadership is a decisive guarantee for the 
victory of this year's advancement. 
  Our party is the heart of our single-heartedly united 
society, the party's leadership is the lifeline of the socialist 
cause. It is our people's unequaled desire and honor to carry 
out the sacred revolutionary cause while following the great 
leadership of the party. 
  All functionaries and working people should uphold our 
party's leadership, be endlessly faithful to the party's cause, 
and thoroughly implement our party's line and policy in all 
domains and sectors. 
  We should defend the single-hearted unity of the party and 
our revolutionary ranks as if we were the rulers, safeguard our 
party with our lives, and achieve a new brilliant victory in 
this year combat with the might of single-hearted unity. 
  Our people, who are following the leadership of the great 
leader and the great party and vigorously fighting on with 
revolutionary optimism and confidence, are ever-victorious and 
indomitable. [applause] 
  Let us all firmly unite around the party central committee 
headed by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song and 
vigorously fight on for the victory of chuche revolutionary 
cause and socialist cause. [applause]

<F P=106> ["Closing Address" by Yang Hyong-sop, chairman of the </F>
Supreme People's Assembly, SPA, at the conclusion of the seventh 
session of the Ninth SPA at Mansudae Assembly Hall in Pyongyang 
on 8 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Comrade deputies: 
  The seventh session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly 
[SPA] held amid the great interest of all people across the 
country concludes its work after successfully discussing the 
items on the agenda with the active participation of comrade 
deputies. 
  The current SPA session discussed the issue on successfully 
fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic construction in the 
period of adjustment set forth by the Workers Party of Korea 
[WPK] and adopted appropriate decisions. It also summed up the 
execution of last year's state budget and deliberated and 
decided on this year's state budget. 
  The current SPA session also deliberated and approved the 
Law 
on Protecting Cultural Relics, the Law on Lawyers, and the 
revised and replenished Joint-Venture Law adopted by the SPA 
Standing Committee during the recess of the SPA. 
  The discussions on the issue on successfully fulfilling the 
tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of 
adjustment set forth by the WPK as the SPA primary agenda item 
and the adoption of appropriate decisions will further encourage 
the revolutionary zeal of our people who are accelerating the 
general onward march to create a new upsurge in the revolution 
and construction, upholding the wise leadership of the party and 
the leader, and will serve as an important momentum in 
vigorously organizing and mobilizing them to implement the 
imminent economic tasks in the period of adjustment. [applause] 
  In the current SPA session, the State Administration Council 
[SAC] gave the great leader its pledge of loyalty to implement 
the party's revolutionary economic strategies. Also, 
responsible functionaries in charge of major fronts in the 
period of adjustment and deputies of sectors concerned made a 
firm resolution to fulfill their heavy and honorable tasks 
without fail. This will further enhance the responsibility and 
role of administrative and economic organizations, including the 
SAC, and of functionaries in national economic activities and 
will effect a great change in our people's worthwhile struggle 
to fulfill the imminent economic tasks in the period of 
adjustment. [applause] 
  The 1994 state budget adopted at the current SPA session is 
a 
concrete budget based on the solid socialist independent 
economic foundation that ensures finance required for fulfilling 
the tasks of socialist economic construction in the first year 
of the adjustment period set forth by the WPK with our own 
financial resources. It is also a dynamic and people-oriented 
budget that is correctly formulated so as to elevate the 
people's material and cultural living standard, to strengthen 
the country's might, and to further advance the superiority of 
the popular masses-oriented socialism of our own style. 
[applause] 
  By deliberating and approving the Law on Protecting Cultural 
Relics, the Law on Lawyers, and the Joint Venture Law adopted by 
the SPA Standing Committee during the recess of the SPA, the 
current SPA session has provided a firm legal guarantee for well 
protecting, properly managing, and correctly inheriting and 
developing our nation's excellent cultural legacy through the 
embodiment of our party's chuche-based policy on the nation's 
cultural legacy, for displaying the superiority of the legal 
system in socialism of our own style, and for defending and 
ensuring the country's economic and technological development 
and its economic interests. [applause] 
  The whole course of the current SPA session's successful 
discussions on the agenda items clearly demonstrated the 
superiority and vitality of our country's socialist system, 
which has been further consolidated and developed as days go by, 
and under which the imperialists' and reactionaries' 
antirepublic maneuvers becoming more vicious have been smashed 
sternly under the wise leadership of the WPK headed by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song. It also vigorously demonstrated our 
people's firm faith and invincible will to resolutely protect, 
defend, and brilliantly consummate the chuche socialist cause to 
the end with the might of single-hearted unity around the party 
and the leader. [applause] 
  I now declare the closing of the seventh session of the 
Ninth 
SPA, expressing my firm belief that all comrade deputies will 
excellently repay the party's great confidence and expectations 
with their successful fulfillment of economic tasks assigned to 
each sector and unit for the adjustment period, at the front of 
the masses by greatly displaying the revolutionary spirit of 
self- reliance and fortitude, upholding the leadership of the 
party and the leader.

  [Text] Comrades: 
  Today, we are observing the first anniversary of the 
election 
of the respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il as the chairman of the National Defense Committee under 
a militant atmosphere in which all the people across the country 
and People's Army officers and men are resolutely smashing 
[chitpusida] the vicious challenge by the imperialists and 
reactionaries and vigorously accelerating the general onward 
movement of the socialism of our own style, being 
single-heartedly united around the party and the leader 
[suryong]. 
  Observing the meaningful day, our people and People's Army 
officers and men are filled with great pride and dignity of 
having the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is an 
iron-willed military leader, at the head of the country's 
defense forces and the revolutionary Armed Forces. They are 
replete with the impregnable resolve to achieve the 
reunification of the fatherland and complete the chuche 
revolutionary cause to the end under the leadership of the 
comrade supreme commander. 
  The election of KPA [Korean People's Army] supreme commander 
Comrade Kim Chong-il as chairman of the DPRK National Defense 
Committee at the fifth session of the Ninth Supreme People's 
Assembly held in April last year was the realization of the 
unanimous aspiration and burning desire of our people and 
People's Army officers and men to have their leader at the head 
of the defense forces and follow him. [applause] 
  As everyone knows, whether or not the long-cherished desire 
of a sovereign state which builds socialism while repelling 
anti- revolutionary offensives by the imperialist aggressive 
forces and reactionaries is accomplished depends on the 
greatness of a leader [yongdoja]. History tells us that a 
country and nation with a great leader always prevail over both 
politics and defense, however those without a great leader 
[yongdoja] cannot defend independence and sovereignty, and, 
moreover, cannot complete its just revolutionary cause. 
  In light of this, the people link the name of a leader with 
the fate of a nation and that of revolution, and convinced in 
tomorrow's victory, considering it as their greatest fortune to 
have a great leader. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--who has led the party, 
the state, and the revolutionary Armed Forces at the head from 
his early years -- wisely led the historic cause of modelling 
the whole party and the entire Army of the whole society after 
the chuche idea. He thus accumulated immortal accomplishments 
which will shine forever in the history of the fatherland. 
[applause] 
  In particular, the achievements accumulated by the dear 
comrade leader on the road to strengthening and developing our 
revolutionary Armed Forces into a revolutionary Armed Forces of 
one-a-match-for-100 by firmly consolidating the country's 
defense power, are innumerably enormous. 
  Highly upholding the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
who accumulated great achievements in fulfilling the chuche 
socialist cause and (?overall) construction cause at the head of 
the self- reliant defense power, is another historical milestone 
in the people's security, firmly defending the revolutionary 
cause, and in victoriously advancing our revolution. [applause] 
  By upholding the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
who is a great military commander, at the supreme head of the 
defense power, our people and the People's Army were able to 
firmly guarantee the work to further defend the chuche socialist 
system ever so strong and accelerate the completion of the 
chuche revolutionary cause at a new high stage. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Comrade Kim 
Chong-il has an indomitable will and courage, and outstanding 
intelligence and commanding art as befits the supreme commander 
of the revolutionary Armed Forces. This guarantees the constant 
strengthening and development of our revolutionary Armed Forces 
and their ever-victorious advance. 
  The dear comrade leader is embodying at a lofty level the 
trait of an extraordinary military strategy and outstanding 
military commander who can lead our people and the People's Army 
to be ever victorious. The first mission of a military 
commander leading the military and people is to present a 
correct military ideology and theory to correctly elucidate the 
road in the construction of the main force of the revolution and 
in the victory in the revolutionary war. Here, the greatness of 
the military commander is concentratedly manifested. 
  Through his extraordinary wisdom and activities that were 
carried out without sleep and rest, which no one can follow, the 
dear comrade leader developed and enriched the chuche-oriented 
military ideology and theory that the great leader presented. 
Thus, he provided the most correct guiding principle in solving 
the military problems of our times. 
  The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il formulated the military doctrine of the great leader as 
an integral one with chuche military idea, military theory, and 
military tactics as its keynote and has comprehensively 
developed it in depth, thus, brilliantly solving the urgent 
questions raised by military practice in the present times. 
[applause] 
  Because of this immortal achievement by the dear comrade 
leader, the chuche-oriented military ideology and theory were 
both in name and reality clearly proven as a new and unique 
military doctrine that is the most scientific and revolutionary 
military doctrine based on the man-centered philosophical theory. 
  The respected and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim 
Chong-il developed and enriched the chuche-oriented military 
ideology into a new doctrine and propositions. In particular, 
based on the theory of the revolutionary outlook on the leader, 
he presented a unique military construction ideology that the 
working-class revolutionary Army is in essence an army of the 
leader and army of the party. This truly has important 
significance in building, strengthening, and developing the 
working-class revolutionary Armed Forces into a revolutionary 
Armed Forces that truly serves the party, the leader, and cause 
of socialism. 
  The profound and multifaceted military ideologies and 
theories elucidated by the dear comrade leader are the most 
scientific and revolutionary military ideology and theory, all 
based on the chuche revolutionary theory. Therefore, it is 
being elucidated as an ever-victorious military (?valuable 
sword). 
  Saying that the new era has ushered in with the end of the 
Cold War era, the imperialists and the renegades of the 
revolution are babbling about the so-called new military 
doctrine. 
  In view of today's complicated situation, our people and 
People's Army are truly fortunate to possess the ever-victorious 
precious military sword which is running thoroughly with 
revolutionary spirit and scientific accuracy. [applause] 
  Amid all sorts of rampant wave of antirevolutionary 
opportunism, our revolutionary Armed Forces are firmly adhering 
to their revolutionary character of being chuche-type 
revolutionary Armed Forces, and staunchly defending the 
socialist cause under the banner of chuche military idea, 
without knowing about trivial deviation of difficulties. 
  With an outstanding and tested commanding art, the respected 
and beloved supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il has wisely 
led the whole party, all the people, and the entire Army to 
implement our party's line of self-reliant defense. In doing so, 
the defense capabilities of the nation have been consolidated 
rock firm in all aspects. 
  Powerful self-reliant national defense power is a military 
guarantee that defends the national sovereignty from the 
imperialists' aggression, and that enables us to build the 
socialism and communism triumphantly. 
  All-people defense system and powerful self-reliant national 
defense power--which firmly defends the sovereignty of the 
country and the nation by smashing any formidable imperialist 
enemy with our own power--are unthinkable without the excelled 
and tested leadership of the respected and beloved supreme 
commander Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause] 
  The People's Army is the core of the self-reliant national 
defense power. The major work our party has always given top 
priority to is bringing up the People's Army as the ranks of 
loyalty who sacrifice their life for the party and the leader 
[suryong] and as an indomitable army which can smash any enemy. 
  The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has set 
forth the program of army construction on modelling the entire 
Army after the chuche idea. By so doing, he has provided a firm 
guarantee whereby our revolutionary Armed Forces can be brought 
up as an indomitable army defeating any formidable imperialist 
enemy as the party's true army, a revolutionary army, endlessly 
loyal to the party and the leader [suryong]. 
  Likewise, in conformity with the requirements of modelling 
the entire Army after the chuche idea, he has given definite 
precedence to the party's monolithic ideological system and the 
monolithic system of guidance in the military construction and 
every domain of military activities. He has put big emphasis on 
strengthening the work of educating the spirit of loyalty to the 
party and the leader [suryong] among the officers. In this way, 
he has firmly ensured the unitary of the leader's ideology and 
leadership in every work of the People's Army, and achieved the 
entire Army's single-hearted unity, and made the entire Army 
have the faith of loyalty to the extent they would sacrifice 
their life for the party and the leader. 
  The might of the revolutionary Army is a political, 
ideological might and this can only be highly demonstrated when 
it is connected with modern military techniques. 
  The respected and beloved comrade supreme commander has 
given 
decisive precedence to the work to firmly prepare the People's 
Army politically, ideologically while energetically organizing 
and leading the work to strengthen the People's Army militarily 
and technically. 
  Thanks to our party's energetic leadership, today our 
People's Army has grown in strength and developed into 
invincible revolutionary Armed Forces with all services and 
arms, powerful means of strike and defense and unique tactics of 
chuche, which are sufficient for any modern warfare. 
  The ever-victorious might of the People's Army lies in that 
the whole Army has one loyal heart to defend the party and the 
leader with death, closely united with one idea and one purpose, 
and are firmly prepared militarily and technically to defeat any 
formidable enemy. [applause] 
  One of the great military achievements of dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, who has further wisely led the chuche-based cause of 
the founding of the Army, is having so firmly consolidated our 
People's Army in political, ideological, military, and 
technological aspects. [applause] 
  In addition to strengthening the People's Army in all 
aspects, comrade dear leader brilliantly armed all the people 
and turned the entire country into a fortress, firmly set up an 
all-people and all-nation defense system in the entire country, 
built up a powerful self-reliant defense industry, and wisely 
led the huge work of resolutely coping with the enemies' new war 
provocative moves. 
  Today, the civilian Armed Forces, including the Red 
Worker-Peasant Militia and Red Youth Guards, are generally 
firmly consolidated, and the entire nation literally turned into 
an impregnable fortress. 
  And, because our own strong self-defensive national defense 
industry has been built, we have today come to have the 
capability of further improving the country's defense forces 
with our own strength if we made up our mind to do so. 
  Along with this, the tradition of the people-army unity is 
fully blooming on a new, higher level and the ideological and 
willful cohesion between the army and the people is further 
firmly consolidated. 
  The two troop reviews commemorating the 40th anniversary of 
the victory in fatherland liberation war and the 60th 
anniversary of the founding of the KPA, which left a record of a 
brilliant chapter of our revolution's chronicle, were active 
displays of the indomitable might of our self-reliant defense 
power with the People's Army as the core. This gave trust of 
victory to our people and the world's revolutionary people, and 
anxiety and fear to the enemies. 
  The proud reality, in which none of the opponents dare to 
intrude the self-reliant national defense power that has been 
built under the extraordinarily difficult condition of building 
socialism amid constant risk of the U.S. imperialists' 
aggression and war, is a brilliant fruition of the outstanding 
and tested leadership of the respected and beloved comrade 
supreme commander. [applause] 
  The greatness of a sagacious general is highlighted by the 
practice of leading the army and the people with peerless 
courage and outstanding wisdom to gain supremacy over the 
enemies' offensives, and of reliably defending the country's 
independence and the nation's dignity. 
  Our country is an arena of the most acute confrontation on 
earth between revolution and antirevolution, and socialism and 
capitalism, and dark and heavy clouds of war constantly float 
around the Korean peninsula. However, our people and the 
People's Army have smashed [chitpusida] every step of the 
enemies' antirevolutionary offensive and reliably defended the 
independence right of the country and the gains of revolution 
under the wise leadership of the party and the leader. 
  In confrontation with the enemies, dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, 
who wholly embodied the wisdom of a great sagacious general, has 
always gained supremacy over the enemies with wonderful and 
brilliant strategies and tactics and put the exhausted enemies 
on the defensive. 
  In recent years, whenever the enemies conducted the Team 
Spirit war exercise, our country was laid in a situation of 
ultra-tension [choginjang] in a brink of war. Without the 
slightest hesitation and vacillation, our people and the 
People's Army fought to repulse them every time and made every 
step of the rascals' war exercises commotion stumble because 
they were led by the comrade supreme commander who has iron-clad 
will and peerless courage. 
  The truth is that when the leader of revolution is great and 
the military sagacious leader is extraordinary, the people and 
the army can display independent spirit hundreds and thousands 
times more and become mighty people and indomitably strong army, 
is proven by our people's eloquent revolutionary practices today. 
  The spirit of national independence, and revolution and 
militant trait of our people and the People's Army under the 
leadership of the supreme commander Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is 
an extraordinary sagacious general, are displayed today on an 
unprecedentedly lofty level. 
  Today, our people and the officers and men of the People's 
Army are fully blossoming the revolutionary army trait of 
fulfilling to the end the invincibility of jumping into water 
and fire if it is an order of the comrade supreme commander, and 
the virtue of army-people unity in which the army and the people 
are upholding the party through complete unity. 
  Only the great chuche idea--our party's revolutionary 
ideology--dominates in our revolutionary ranks, and in every 
hearts of our people and the officers and men of the People's 
Army, they are overflowing with the firm faith of sharing their 
fate with the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander. 
The trait of attaching great importance to the military in the 
whole society and the trait of faithfully learning the military 
affairs is overflowing, and the country has truly changed into 
an impregnable fortress. [applause] 
  Even under the condition in which the imperialists tried to 
commit aggressive maneuvers at any time at all to crush [apsal] 
the small countries through forcible measures and threat, our 
party and people were vigorously advancing the socialist cause, 
with the faith of victory, because we were provided with a truly 
strong defense capacity and an invincibly strong army. 
  Our country, which has a small territory and a small 
population, smashed [chitbusigo] all kinds of challenges of the 
imperialists and reactionaries and defended the nation's 
dignity. Therefore, all the victories achieved to advance the 
socialist cause are a great victory of the dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il's, the great leader [yongdoja] of our party and people, 
iron-like faith and will, extraordinary strategy and tactic, and 
outstanding military strategy. [applause] 
  Through this significant meeting, filled with the utmost 
admiration and blazing loyalty, on behalf of all the people and 
the officers and men of the People's Army, I would like to give 
the greatest honor and warmest thanks to the dear Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the chairman of the DPRK National Defense Commission 
and supreme commander of the KPA, who elucidated the dignity of 
the fatherland and nation through his extraordinary military 
ideology and refined leadership and always led our people and 
the People's Army toward the one road of victory and glory. 
[applause] 
  Comrades: Today, our people and all the officers and men of 
the People's Army are faced with the heavy and honorary task of 
further consolidating the country's defense capacity like an 
impregnable fortress and to achieve ahead of schedule the 
fatherland's independent reunification and the ultimate victory 
of the chuche revolutionary cause in accordance with the demand 
of the prevailing situation. 
  A tense situation in which a war may break out anytime 
prevails in our country at present because of the vicious 
antisocialist, antirepublic maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists 
and other international reactionary forces. 
  The U.S. imperialists, who had broken up [patan] the third 
round of DPRK-U.S. talks, had the UN Security Council release 
the president's statement, which makes unjustifiable 
[tangchiannun] demands on us, and are more openly maneuvering to 
crush [apsal] us. 
  Moreover, the U.S. imperialists are more frantically kicking 
up commotions for military pressure, while saying that they 
would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that 
they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war. 
  In step with them, the puppet South Korean clique intends to 
stage the nuclear war exercise against us at all cost and 
babbles that it would offer punitive retaliation [ungjing pobok] 
against us and use this as an opportunity to achieve 
reunification if it is necessary. 
  The South Korean puppets put all the puppet armed forces on 
special alert and even made public a dangerous new plan to 
invade the North. 
  Teaming up with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean 
puppets, the Japanese reactionaries, as well, got more deeply 
involved in the maneuvers to ignite a fuse to a new war on the 
southern Korean peninsula. 
  All facts show that the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists 
and other reactionaries to isolate and crush [apsal] our 
Republic have reached their extreme and that, as a result, a war 
may break out on the Korean peninsula anytime. 
  However, any maneuver by the enemy cannot frighten our 
people and the People's Army, under the outstanding leadership 
of the great commander [yongjan]. 
  If the bastards ignite a fuse to a war after all, our people 
and the People's Army, filled with a firm resolve to share the 
same destiny with the party, will resolutely tackle them head on 
and mercilessly sweep out [mujabihage ssuroborilgut] the enemy. 
[applause] 
  Responding to the use of force with force and dialogue with 
dialogue is our firm will and policy [himenun himuro taehwaenun 
taehwaro tappyonhanun kossi uriui hwakko pudonghan uijiimyo 
chongchaegimnida]. 
  The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys must not 
miscalculate 
[osan] our firm will and policy and act with discretion after 
clearly seeing the trend of the times. 
  All the people and People's Army officers and men must 
vigorously wage the struggle to reliably defend the socialist 
fatherland and the revolutionary gains from the enemy's 
infringement [chimhae], build the country's defensive forces 
impregnable, and strengthen the People's Army into an invincible 
revolutionary army. 
  The most important problem in effecting a bigger upsurge in 
the socialist construction while securing the chuche 
revolutionary cause by force of arms is brilliantly inheriting 
and developing our revolution's tradition of single-hearted 
unity. [applause] 
  Single-hearted unity is the banner of victory and the primal 
basis of our revolution. Our single-hearted unity is the 
single-hearted unity which upholds the supreme commander Comrade 
Kim Chong-il at the center of its unity with faith and filial 
duty, and is the everlasting single-hearted unity which does not 
move an inch even under any raging storm in the world. 
[applause] 
  With strong faith that they will always win if there is the 
dear leader, all the people and People's Army officers and men 
must resolutely defend the party and the leader [suryong] by 
becoming a shield of single-hearted unity and faithfully 
upholding the party's monolithic leadership. 
  Firmly securing the chuche revolutionary cause by force of 
arms is the basic mission of the People's Army. The entire 
officers and men of the People's Army must make loyalty to the 
respected and beloved comrade supreme commander their faith, 
conscience, morality, and life by thoroughly arming themselves 
with the chuche idea. They must persistently hold fast to the 
party's line on modelling the entire Army after the chuche idea. 
Thus, they should strengthen the political, ideological might 
of the People's Army in every way. 
  The officers of the People's Army must make the entire ranks 
overflowing with the revolutionary ethos of going through fire 
and water to carry through the comrade supreme commander's order 
and direction to the end and carrying out discipline, life, and 
learning the way the anti-Japanese guerrilla army did. They 
should also make the entire ranks overflowing with the 
traditional virtue of the unity between the officers and men, 
and the unity between the party and society. 
  Furthermore, the officers of the People's Army must set up 
steel-like regulations inside the entire Army and prepare 
soldiers as one-a-match-for-100 fighters who are possessed of 
invulnerable power, military techniques, markermanship worthy of 
a crack shot, and adroit military strategy. They must 
ceaselessly modernize the armed equipments of the People's Army 
and further consolidate the military posts as an impregnable 
fortresses. 
  Defending the socialist fatherland is an all-popular work. 
It is firm will of our people to vigorously push ahead with the 
socialist construction and the defense of the nation, holding a 
gun on one hand and a sickle and a hammer on another. [applause] 
  Today's acute situation, in which provocative moves for a 
new 
war are endlessly perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists and the 
puppet clique, calls on us to all the more firmly consolidate 
all-people, all-state defense system by thoroughly implementing 
our party's line on arming all the people and turning the entire 
country into a fortress. 
  Our party members and workers must strongly arm themselves 
with our party's chuche-oriented view on war [chonjaenggwanjom] 
and firmly establish in the entire society a trait of attaching 
importance to military affairs and sincerely learning military 
affairs. By so doing, they must make thorough political and 
ideological, military, and material preparations against any 
unanticipated event on our own initiative [buruiui satae edo 
chudongjoguro taechohalssu innun chongchisasangjok chunbi 
kunsajok chunbi mulchilchok chunbirul pintumopsi kachuoya 
hagessumnida]. 
  In particular, all the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the 
Young Red Guards must cherish deep in their hearts great pride 
in being revolutionary warriors of the great general, strengthen 
combat and political training and, thus, defend their work 
places, villages, and schools with vigilance. 
  The traditional beautiful trait of Army-people unity which 
is 
highly maintained today in our society is an expression of the 
noble idea and spirit that all people and the entire Army share 
the life and death and destiny with the comrade supreme 
commander under any stern trial. 
  All people and officers and men of the People's Army must 
vigorously carry out the our guardpost is our village, our 
village is our guardpost movement and, thus, ensure that a 
beautiful trait be further fostered throughout the country in 
which the Army positively helps the people and in which the 
people sincerely assist the Army. By so doing, the Army and 
people must become one in flesh and spirit in the same trenches, 
resolutely punish the aggressors and, thus, again demonstrate 
the dignity and honor of the heroic Korea if the enemy dares to 
provoke a new war. [applause] 
  The revolutionary economic strategy presented by our party 
is 
a banner of struggle to strengthen the overall national power 
and more highly display the superiority of popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own style. [applause] 
  To thoroughly implement the party's revolutionary economic 
strategy, we must highly demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of 
self-reliance and arduous struggle. All party members and 
workers must score great upsurges in production and construction 
in hearty response to the party's militant slogan on vigorously 
accelerating the general onward socialist march with the 
revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous struggle. 
  The fatherland's reunification is the unanimous earnest 
desire of all Korean people and achieving the fatherland's 
reunification in the nineties without fail is our party's firm 
will. [applause] 
  All people and officers and men of the People's Army must 
possess the belief that achieving the fatherland's reunification 
in the nineties is a certainty [hwakchongjok] because there is 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, resolutely crush 
[chippussida] the maneuvers by the antireunification forces, and 
more staunchly fight to hasten the fatherland's reunification. 
[applause] 
  All Korean compatriots in the North and South and overseas 
must achieve strong unity under the banner of the 10-point 
program of great unity of the entire nation presented by the 
great leader and more boldly wage the struggle to prevent the 
danger of a new war and carry out the historic cause of the 
fatherland's reunification. 
  A revolutionary road is far and turbulent, and our future 
road may be fraught with trials and adversities. However, we 
are not afraid of any trial. Our people and People's Army are 
filled with the firm belief that they, just like they did in the 
past, will be ever-victorious in the future, as well, because 
they uphold respected and beloved Comrade Kim Chong-il at the 
head of the party and revolutionary armed forces [[kyongaehanun 
kim chong-il tongjirul tanggwa hyongmyongmuryogui suwie 
mosigoitkie]. 
  No matter how frantically the imperialists and reactionaries 
try to isolate and crush [korip apsal] our Republic, all 
progressive people of the world who love justice and peace will 
be on our side, and our socialism, the chuche-oriented 
socialism, which defeated all trials in history, will win 
victory after victory. [applause] 
  For socialism to win victory and for imperialism to be 
ruined 
is the law of the development of history. Let us all be 
single-heartedly united around respected and beloved Supreme 
Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il and more vigorously fight for a 
victory in the socialist cause, the fatherland's independent 
reunification, and the ultimate completion of the chuche 
revolutionary cause. [applause] 
  Long live the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, chairman of 
the DPRK National Defense Committee and supreme commander of the 
KPA! [applause]

to the strengthening and development of the ties of friendship 
between the two neighbouring countries.

  [Text] Vientiane, April 9 (KPL) -- Their Majesties King 
Phumiphon Adunyadet and Queen Sirikit with Her Royal Highness 
Princess Maha Chakkri Sirinthon yesterday afternoon visited the 
km 22 Agricultural Development and Service Center, the project 
established under the patronage of the King of Thailand, where 
the king and President Nouhak Phoumsavanh jointly performed the 
opening of the center. 
  Also present at the ceremony were Thai Prime Minister Chuan 
Likphai and Thai ministers who joined the king in his visit to 
Laos, and several Lao ministers and senior officials. 
  Located at km 22 on Luang Prabang Road, Vientiane 
Prefecture, 
the agricultural development center was established under the 
financial support of the king of Thailand. 
  On arrival at the center, Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai 
in his capacity as president of the project coordination 
committee made a report to the king on the background of this 
project. 
  Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat, responsible for the 
implementation of the project on the Lao side, then presented a 
report on the implementation of this project. He said that the 
king of Thailand had agreed with the Lao PDR [People's 
Democratic Republic] to jointly build this center as a 
commemorative establishment for the late President Kaysone 
Phomvihan and as a symbol of the neighbourly friendship between 
the people of Laos and Thailand. 
  He said, in this project the Lao Government had allocated a 
274 million kip input, and the work started with survey and 
economic feasibility study on an area of 52 hectares to be 
covered by the project, which was followed by the installation 
of a power supply system to serve the center and people of 
Na-gnang. 
  A four-kilometer road from road 13 north to the center was 
repaired and asphalted, a club house was built and equipped with 
water supply system, and an irrigation weir was built on Houai 
Son Tai, able to irrigate about 200 hectares during the rainy 
season and six hectares in the dry season. In addition, a 
survey of forest areas on the nearby Phou Phanang mountain was 
made. The government has already made it a forest reserve. 
  He said along with the infrastructure construction, the 
project had promoted the production among the local people 
living in the vicinity of the center. A new rice variety and 
the rice growing technique were introduced in 1993 at the 
irrigation area. Experiment was made on creating model families 
of farmers in cultivation and livestock at Ban Na-gnang, Ban 
Nason, and Ban Nam Kiang. Cattle vaccination was carried out 
and cattle epidemic preventive methods were introduced to the 
people at five villages nearby the center. He said that less 
than one year later, the area around the center had a new 
improved image. 
  Speaking on the occasion King Phumiphon Adunyadet of 
Thailand 
said: The queen and I feel very pleased and greatly honoured to 
have been invited to pay an official visit to the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic on this occasion when we have participated 
at the opening ceremony of the Friendship Bridge. 
  The king said that the welcome his party received made him 
feel that he was among good friends who were most familiar with 
each other as well as understand one another very well dating 
back into the distant past. 
  The king said to this effect: In reality the Lao and Thai 
peoples have long enjoyed friendly ties going into the 
centuries. The relationship between our two peoples and states 
are so closely intertwined that they cannot be separated. This 
is because we are neighbouring countries with both our peoples 
being Buddhists and having similar kinds of customs, traditions 
and cultures, to such a point that our two nations have a 
well-known reputation of being close relatives. Such intimate 
and long-establishment and promotion of diplomatic relations as 
well as for the carrying out of joint projects between the 
Kingdom of Thailand and the Lao People's Democratic Republic, 
which today have met with satisfactory results. [sentence as 
received] 
  "The Thai people have watched and followed with great 
interest the development in various fields of endeavours in the 
Lao People's Democratic Republic. Thus, we are highly pleased 
and gratified to have witnessed that in the last decade the 
country has been able to preserve in good order her national 
integrity and characteristics as well as maintain every feature 
of her national livelihood. Furthermore, she has been able to 
further develop and improve herself for greater prosperity and 
advancement. Such prosperity and security will not only result 
in the benefits and happiness for the people of your country, 
but will also play an important role in the establishment of 
peace and security for all nations in this region of the world. 
I am, therefore, pleased to be able to state most clearly that 
under the wise and circumspect guidance (of the Lao leaders) as 
well as the able administration of the Lao Government, the Lao 
People's Democratic Republic will continue to make progress 
towards the achievement of full prosperity and happiness". 
  After planting a commemorative tree at the center, the king 
and the queen with President Nouhak Phoumsavan visited the area 
around the Houai Son irrigation. After that, the king and the 
queen together with the princess returned to Vientiane.

<F P=106> ["Hawks in U.S. Take Upperhand Touting Military Option in </F>
Korea" -- YONHAP headline] 
  [Text] Washington, April 10 (YONHAP) -- As U.S. Secretary 
of Defense William Perry prepares to visit South Korea, 
attention is being focused on stepped-up efforts by "the hawks" 
to picture the North Korean nuclear issue as a military crisis 
on the peninsula. 
  One sign underscoring the move is a special report to be 
submitted Monday to Congress by its research arm, the General 
Accounting Office [GAO], on military options available to 
Washington and Seoul in the nuclear dispute with Pyongyang. 
  Another indication is an unconfirmed report that the 
Pentagon 
was trying to secure military manpower that could be deployed to 
the Korean peninsula in case of another war. 
  In addition, rumor had it that a U.S. intelligence support 
team might be formed in South Korea, as hinted earlier by 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director James Woolsey, and 
that a state-of-the-art ground facility capable of analyzing 
intelligence collected by satellite could be set up here soon. 
  Against this backdrop, American analysts specializing in 
Korean affairs say there are two main aspects to the situation. 
  The hard-liners (the hawks) in Washington want to prepare 
for 
a military solution to the Korean nuclear row if the UN Security 
Council fails to break the impasse. 
  At the same time, they wish to sway American public opinion 
in favor of the military option, according to the analysts. 
  The GAO report carries the caveat that it was only 
spotlighting possible solution of the nuclear issue through 
options that could be exercised by Washington and Seoul -- and 
by Pyongyang. 
  The report offers options that include the use of nuclear 
weapons. 
  There is the shocking possibility, it says, that North Korea 
could explode one or two nuclear bombs hidden in tunnels near 
the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and allow radioactive particles to 
drift Southward. 
  This horrifying possibility does not end there. 
  As a result of the nuclear explosions in the DMZ, South 
Korean and U.S. troops would be dealt a crippling blow as the 
blasts knocked out ultra-modern military equipment. Taking 
advantage of this initial blow, North Korea would send its 
powerful conventional forces sweeping down into the South. 
  The accuracy of the GAO report's military logistics remains 
unclear, but it has nevertheless drawn keen interest because the 
GAO is recognized throughout the country as authoritative, 
independent and trustworthy. 
  Informed sources also note that the GAO report was issued as 
Perry, who is regarded as one of the hawks, was preparing to 
visit Seoul. 
  The report may have been meant not only for domestic 
consumption but also for leaders in South Korea and Japan, they 
say. 
  Further raising eyebrows in Washington was a proposal on the 
possible withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea. 
  Quoting the Center for Defense Intelligence (CDI), a private 
analysis organization, the GAO report pointed to a plan that 
calls for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from South 
Korea if the North abandons its nuclear program. 
  The possibility of a U.S. troop withdrawal is obviously 
being 
raised in light of concern for the safety of American soldiers 
in Korea. It also indicates that if war breaks out on the 
Korean peninsula, the U.S. military could concentrate on air and 
naval support. 
  In other words, America is considering changing the role of 
its troops in South Korea in a new security arrangement between 
Washington and Seoul, analysts say. 
  In any event, a recent series of moves by American 
hard-liners is aimed at strenthening and sharpening U.S. public 
opinion on the North Korean nuclear issue. 
  Various opinion polls indicate that a majority of Americans 
oppose U.S. intervention in Korea if another war breaks out on 
the peninsula. 
  The hawks obviously feel they must change this attitude -- 
and soon -- because North Korea is not listening to the White 
House, they said.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "And Now Even the Withdrawal of U.S. Forces From </F>
the ROK Is Raised"] 
  [Text] The U.S. Congress released a report stating that 
the United States may consider withdrawing U.S. Forces stationed 
in the ROK under the condition that North Korea completely give 
up nuclear development. The report is based on an analysis of 
choices of military measures in case North Korea does not give 
up nuclear development to the last. 
  U.S. Congressional reports do not necessarily reflect a U.S. 
Administration's policies. And there has been no sign that the 
U.S. Administration is considering such a scenario. However, 
the United States is a country moved by public opinion. U.S. 
Congressional reports are reference materials for U.S. 
lawmakers' parliamentary activities. In this regard, the report 
is noteworthy. It comes as a shock that this U.S. Congressional 
report has turned to the negotiation strategy of trading the 
withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK for North Korea's nuclear 
development. 
  The withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK is the last 
choice 
of negotiation strategies. It is natural to doubt if it would 
be actually realized. It is notable that the withdrawal of U.S. 
Forces from the ROK was raised after the snag of the U.S. plan 
to deploy Patriot missiles on its own expenses with an aim to 
reinforce the U.S. Forces in the ROK in preparation for a 
possible contingency. It has been learned that our government's 
odd action of making a military defensive weapon as a diplomatic 
weapon put the U.S. Forces in the ROK in an awkward situation. 
  Another noteworthy fact is the U.S. military authorities' 
information analysis that North Korea already has one or two 
nuclear bombs. Quoting the analysis, the U.S. Congressional 
report believes that North Korea possesses one or two primitive 
nuclear bombs and is able to transport them by truck. This is 
different from our government's opinion which denies the 
possibility on every occasion. It is puzzling on what basis the 
government has come to this assertion and to what extent should 
we believe it. 
  Let us calmly reanalyze North Korea's intention to develop 
nuclear weapons. There could be many different opinions but it 
is safe to take the worst possible situation. That is North 
Korea's long-desired political goal of the withdrawal of U.S. 
Forces from the ROK is achieved. As long as North Korea 
believes the nuclear threat could effectively block the 
involvement of the U.S. Forces in the ROK in the contingency, it 
will never be satisfied with any carrot other than a condition 
that could achieve the goal. In this regard, the U.S. 
Congressional report makes us uncomfortable. 
  Shall we refute that this creates a crisis on the Korean 
peninsula? Shall we repeat the optimistic observation that 
North Korea does not possess nuclear weapons? The government 
should first of all do its best in clearing up distrust and 
suspicion that the government is doing nothing.

nuclear situation, a Ministry official said Friday. 
  Han pushed up his departure to Europe to meet IAEA 
Director-General Hans Blix on April 12 in Tokyo, where he plans 
to attend a seminar on the nuclear industry. 
  In accordance with the U.N. Security Council's presidential 
statement last week calling for additional inspections in North 
Korea, the IAEA is expected to send a message to Pyongyang soon 
proposing talks on arranging the checks. 
  Han and Blix will discuss the practical "deadline" for 
conducting the additional inspections and providing the right 
conditions so that North Korea accepts full nuclear checks, the 
official said.

He plans to meet his British counterpart Douglas Hurd and 
attend the South Korea-Britain Forum, delivering a speech on 
bilateral relations. 
  He will stop off in Brussels April 16-17 for a conference of 
South Korean mission chiefs stationed in Europe before returning 
April 18. 
  The trip will obviously highlight coordination on the 
nuclear 
problem that entered a new phase last month with the UN Security 
Council's presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow 
additional outside inspections. 
  Moscow has recently tried to play a more visible role in the 
matter, proposing an eight-party conference to solve the problem 
among regional powers, the United Nations and the IAEA.

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) repeatedly urged the government Monday to 
re-examine its policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute, 
criticized recently for inconsistency. 
  In a general policy-makers' meeting, the DLP's current 
affairs analysis committee pointed out that the party and 
government should heed recent U.S. press reports and study 
measures to cope with developments in the nuclear matter. 
  The party and government should note a report by the 
newsweekly TIME, which said North Korea already possesses one or 
two nuclear weapons, and a U.S. congressional report predicting 
a possible withdrawal of American forces from South Korea in 
return for North Korea abandoning its nuclear ambitions, the 
committee said.

  [Text] The North Korean Embassy in Beijing claimed on 11 
April that the North Korean authorities firmly believe that the 
Chinese Government will unchangeably support North Korea at the 
United Nations. 
  Councillor (Choe Han-chan) of the North Korean Embassy in 
Beijing said on 11 April that there is no tense situation or 
uncomfortable relations at all between North Korea and China and 
that China is North Korea's neighbor as usual. He made efforts 
to show that friendly relations between North Korea and China

  [Text] It was learned that North Korea has greatly 
strengthened security at the North Korean-China border. It was 
learned that North Korea took this action because the number of 
North Korean residents fleeing the hardships of life is 
increasing and because influence from the capitalist ideology is 
penetrating through the border. 
  It was learned that the order to strengthen security in this 
region was made by Kim Chong-il. Kim Chong-il has ordered 
strengthening of security on the border over four times since 
1989, when the East European communist bloc countries collapsed, 
to 1993.

chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, flew into Seoul Sunday afternoon for an official 
visit at the invitation of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu. 
  On arrival at Kimpo Airport, Wu said he was visiting South 
Korea to promote friendship and expand exchanges and cooperation 
between the two countries. "I am confident that South 
Korea-China friendly cooperative relations based on a five-point 
principle for peaceful co-existence is a common wish of the two 
countries and will also be conducive to both countries' economic 
prosperity," Wu said.

pay a courtesy call on President Kim Yong-sam and meet with 
government leaders to exchange opinions on matters of common 
interest. He will also confer with National Assembly Speaker Yi

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu asked China Monday to persuade North Korea 
that the nuclear card will not work to its benefit. Talking 
with Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, Han praised Beijing's role in trying to 
defuse the North Korean nuclear crisis. He asked Beijing to 
persuade Pyongyang that nuclear development will not succeed and 
to bring its ally into the international fold, ministry 
spokesman Chang Ki-ho said after the 40-minute meeting. 
  Former Foreign Minister and Deputy Premier Wu, saying his 
country had tried to help before and would continue its efforts, 
nevertheless explained that Beijing's scope of influence was 
limited. But he promised to urge North Korea to work for peace 
and stability on the Korean peninsula, the spokesman said. 
  Wu came to Seoul Sunday on an eight-day visit at Han's 
invitation. 
  He predicted improvement in inter-Korean relations and urged 
persuasion through patient dialogue, Chang said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- A visiting senior 
Chinese official said on Monday that China does not know the 
correct extent of North Korea's nuclear development. 
  Wu Xueqian, vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political 
Consultative Conference, said China had talked with North Korea 
over the nuclear question. 
  "But, North Korea listened to us some times, and at some 
other times they did not," Wu said. 
  During his call on President Kim Yong-sam, the Chinese 
official said that denuclearization ought to be realized on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  He was quick to add, however, that if pressures were applied 
to North Korea to this end, it is prone to aggravate the 
situation. 
  "I am sure that if South Korea promotes its policies toward 
North Korea with patience, denuclearization would be realized 
some time," he said. 
  During the meeting, President Kim said that if North Korea 
develops nuclear arms, it would be a misfortune not only for 
peace in Northeast Asia and the world but also for North Korea 
itself. 
  If North Korea returns to dialogue with the South in a 
sincere manner, South Korea would furnish economic support to 
North Korea and help them improve relations with the United 
States and Japan, President Kim said. 
  Wu flew into Seoul Sunday for an eight-day official visit at 
the invitation of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu.

  [Text] Japan's Fuji Television Broadcast reported on 11 
April that North Korea and Iran agreed to establish a plant to 
produce NODONG No. 1 missiles in Iran. Such a fact was revealed 
in an interview with (Paul Beaver), a military commentator for 
JANE'S, while appearing in a feature program entitled "Areas of 
Dispute in the World." He said that this project is being 
promoted secretly under the password (Ronda-68). 
  When considering the level of the North Korean military 
force, Paul Beaver analyzed that North Korea has the ability to 
attack Seoul within 24 hours. He claimed that a response to the 
enemy by the United States through an immediate military 
intervention is inevitable for security on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has given 
troop transport vehicles and ammunition to the Cambodian Army, a 
Japanese newspaper reported from Phnom Penh on Sunday. 
  With North Korea's support, last month the Cambodian Army 
was 
able to capture Pailin, the "capital" of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas, the SANKEI SHIMBUN said. 
  Pyongyang supplied the materiel free of charge to maintain 
friendly relations with Southeast Asian nations in a bid to 
avoid international isolation resulting from suspicions over its 
nuclear program, the newspaper quoted a Cambodian Army official 
as saying. 
  The North Koreans sent six troop transport vehicles and 
scores of tons of field guns, mortars, rifles and ammunition by 
air to Cambodia and plan to supply additional ammunition in 
April, according to the official. 
  Making use of the North Korean weapons, the Cambodian Army 
staged a fierce attack on the rebels and succeeded in driving 
them out of Pailin on March 21, the official said. 
  Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk and North Korean President 
Kim Il-song have maintained a close relationship and Sihanouk 
visits Pyongyang every year, according to the official.

  [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- Despite Moscow's 
willingness to allow the resettlement in South Korea of North 
Koreans who escaped from logging yards in Siberia, the chances 
of their coming to Seoul soon remain slim. 
  "If we allow them in, it would certainly offend North Korea 
and have an adverse impact on overall inter-Korean relations," a 
Foreign Ministry official said Saturday. 
  Russian Vice Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov said in New 
Delhi Friday that if Seoul agreed, Russia would send all escaped 
North Korean loggers to South Korea. 
  The ministry official said that if South Korea allowed the 
escaped loggers to come, it would set off an avalanche of 
would-be asylum seekers, a development certain to alarm the 
Pyongyang regime. 
  President Kim Yong-sam said Thursday that about 90 North 
Korean loggers had applied at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow 
for asylum in South Korea. 
  "But we are not accepting them under a policy not to offend 
North Korea, and there will be no change in this policy for a 
considerable period of time," Kim said. 
  The ministry official said that accepting North Korean 
loggers at this stage would involve a set of complicated 
problems. 
  In addition to offending Pyongyang, he said, there would be 
the problem of raising funds for their resettlement, of handling 
outlaws among the escaped loggers, and of similarly accepting 
loggers who manage to enter China. 
  "We must cope with the question prudently and flexibly from 
a 
far-reaching viewpoint in consideration of future developments 
in inter-Korean relations," an official at the National 
Unification Board said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- North Korea proposed on 
Monday to have a South-North liaison officials contact at 
Panmunjom on Wednesday morning, saying they have messages to 
deliver to the South. 
  In a telephone message to the South, North Korea said that 
at 
the contact they would deliver messages recently adopted by a 
joint session of the North Korean Government, political parties 
and social organizations. 
  The messages are addressed to the South Korean Government, 
political parties, social organizations and some individuals, it 
said. 
  A Unification Board official hinted that the South would not 
send a liaison official to Panmunjom as suggested by the North. 
  "The message is apparently part of their united front 
strategy. A dialogue for political propaganda's sake is 
something not desirable," the official said.

  [Text] A photograph of Kim Pyong-il, Kim Il-song's second 
son (41), who assumed office as North Korean ambassador to 
Finland on 18 March, was disclosed by a recent issue of the 
Japanese weekly news magazine SHUKAN BUNSHUN (photograph). 
  The disclosure of the photograph of Kim Pyong-il, who has 
been shielded from the Western press, is very unusual. The 
photograph was taken as he was entering the Finnish president's 
official residence to present him with his credentials. 
  Kim's tall 180 centimeter height, 80 kg weight, and not 
excessively fat face remind one of his father, Kim Il-song, when 
he was young. 
  In an article entitled "Kim Pyong-il, a Younger Sibling of 
Successor Secretary Kim Chong-il Whom the Latter Fears Most," 
the SHUKAN BUNSHUN said: "Kim Pyong-il served as North Korean 
Ambassador to Hungary in 1988, then as ambassador to Bulgaria 
before being appointed as ambassador to Finland." The weekly 
added: "Kim Pyong-il is treated by his brother like a person 
living in exile. 
  The weekly noted: "He excels in his foreign language 
ability, likes sports, and has an aspect of sincerity in his 
characteristics. Handsome Kim Pyong-il is reported to be 
enjoying far greater popularity than Kim Chong-il among the 
North Korean people." 
  SHUKAN BUNSHUN also noted: "Kim Pyong-il graduated from Kim 
Il-song University, served in the Army for ten plus several 
years, and enjoys an extensively good reputation in the Army as 
well." The weekly then observed: "If Kim Il-song dies, it is 
quite possible that the anti-Kim Chong-il force will try to 
replace Kim Chong-il with Kim Pyong-il."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The United States had by 
last Sunday deployed in South Korea part of the up-to-date 
Apache attack helicopters it plans to bring into Korea to build 
up the battle ability of the U.S. Forces in Korea, a Japanese 
daily reported Monday. 
  In a dispatch from Seoul, the ASAHI SHIMBUN quoting a South 
Korean military source said the first batch of ground-to-air 
Patriot missiles, too, is expected to arrive in South Korea 
toward this weekend and early next week timed with U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry's visit to Korea. 
  Both Apache helicopters and Patriots are designed to help 
prepare against contingency on the Korean peninsula, the paper 
said. 
  ASAHI said they were initially set to be deployed in Korea 
by 
mid-March but their deployment has been delayed in consideration 
of the inter-Korean contacts that had been going on at that time 
on the issue of exchanging special envoys. 
  About 30 Apache helicopters are set to be taken into Korea, 
including those already deployed at U.S. military installations 
north of Seoul, it said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- South Korean delegation 
leaves for Marrakech, Morocco, Sunday to sign the Uruguay Round 
agreement in the midst of fierce opposition at the home front. 
  Trade, Industry and Resources Minister Kim Chol-su leads the 
16-member delegation to be joined by nine others at Marrakech. 
He will be one of the representatives from 123 nations there 
marking the conclusion of the global trade pact that comes after 
seven years of gruelling negotiations since the first meeting in 
Punta del Este, Uruguay, back in 1986. 
  While protesters rocked the entire nation Saturday to oppose 
South Korea's signing of the agreement, Seoul officials declared 
they will go ahead to commit to the pact. But Seoul will delay 
signing the mandate for the World Trade Organization (WTO) and 
its annex protocol until after the parliamentary ratification, 
officials said. The mandate for the WTO includes country 
schedules in agriculture, industry and services. 
  Kim will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
while in the Moroccan city where the two officials are expected 
to formally discuss wider opening of South Korean market to 
American automobiles. He also meets other trade ministers from 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members for an informal 
conference to decide on the time, site and agendas to the APEC 
trade ministers' talks scheduled or sometime in September or 
October.

on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and its annexed protocol, the 
Government Procurement Agreement, until after parliament 
approves, a government official said Saturday. 
  The official denied reports that Seoul might hold back on 
signing the final agreement, which would be construed as a 
rejection of the total UR pact as the signing is a formal and 
declarative promise of commitment to the world's largest trade 
agreement and its future direction by participating nations. 
  But Korea is seriously thinking about waiting on the mandate 
for the WTO, comprised of bilateral and multilateral 
negotiations in 17 fields including country schedules in 
agriculture, industry and services, and its annexed protocol 
until formal approval by the National Assembly. 
  Signing the two other agreements is not mandatory at the 
Marrakech conference and countries can choose to do so after 
parliamentary ratification. 
  The United States and Japan have already decided not to sign 
the two pacts at next week's conference due to domestic legal 
procedures. 
  Three agreements will be signed at the Marrakech meeting on 
April 15. Some nations will sign then while others will wait 
until after legislative passage, ruling Democratic Liberal Party 
Spokesman Ha Sun-pong said after party-government discussions.

  [Text] Seoul, April 9 (YONHAP) -- Over 30,000 defiant 
protesters united nationwide Saturday to oppose South Korea's 
signing of the Uruguay Round [UR] agreement on the eve of 
delegation's departure to commit to the pact. 
  Collegians at Seoul universities had joined some 13,000 
farmers' representatives, opposition lawmakers, activist 
teachers and dissidents at Poramae Park in southern part of the 
capital by 2:30 P.M. to launch the rally opened simultaneously 
in 11 other cities. 
  Hundreds of ralliers in the southern city of Ulsan occupied 
downtown streets chanting "renegotiate, renegotiate." Some 2,000 
protesters in Chonju threatened to fight to bring down the 
government if the agreement is not rebargained. 
  "No to UR," "Fight UR till death," shouted protesters in 
Seoul as they tried to cut the police blockade to march to the 
National Assembly hall. Fierce clashes are likely late into the 
evening with hundreds of students vowing to reunite at Myongdong 
Cathedral to go on a hunger strike until the trade agreement is 
vetoed at the National Assembly. 
  Organizers said 197 groups participated in the rally that 
turned out to be the largest this year to fight Seoul's 
commitment to the global trade pact at the signing ceremony 
starting next Tuesday. Controversy over South Korea's country 
schedule never waned after the government retracted a 
presidential promise and opened its rice market. 
  Government officials said they are going ahead to ink the 
Uruguay Round final agreement despite the protest at home. 
Trade, industry and resources minister leaves for the ceremony 
in Morocco Sunday. 
  "The government could not possibly sign the agreement in 
Morocco on April 12 if it sincerely cared for the people and the 
country's future," opposition leader Yi Ki-taek said through a 
blaring microphone. "We will never sit idly by if the government 
tries to put its stamp on the agreement as is," he said. 
  Organizers read a statement demanding an immediate hearing 
on 
allegations of secret agreement with the United States on rice 
market opening. The headquarters of the pan-national movement 
for protection of farmers pleaded with the citizens to 
participate in the fight against ratification and to keep 
foreign products off the market shelves.

  [Text] It was learned on 11 April that under the basic 
policy of annually collecting reunification funds -- which may 
reach hundreds of million and billion of won -- in preparation 
for the approach of the immediate reunification of the Korean 
peninsula, the government has begun to study concrete measures 
on the form of fund collection, the principle for using funds, 
and subjects of fund collection. 
  The government has decided to formulate a policy to prepare 
for the period after reunification as they do not rule out the 
possibility that the North Korean system may suddenly collapse 
due to the recently increasing number of North Korean escapees. 
  A relevant government official in charge of security-related 
affairs said that "the present confirmed position of the 
government is to collect annually reunification funds in 
preparation for the approach of the immediate reunification," 
and that "the government will decide on the total amount of 
reunification funds only after studying concrete measures, such 
as the method of collecting funds, principle for using funds, 
and subjects of fund collection." 
  Another relevant government official in charge of 
security-related affairs said: "The government has just 
established a Unification and Security Policy Coordination 
Council, which Chongwadae [presidential office] will directly 
operate. We can say that this is related to the serious move 
recently shown inside North Korea. The reunification funds can 
be spent, in the form of emergency funds, on the fulfillment of 
major projects that will be carried out during the period after 
national reunification." 
  Although the government has studied plans to collect funds 
-- 
which, so far, have been dependent upon people's donations -- it 
has had difficulties making decisions due to President Kim 
Yong-sam's proposed principle of prohibiting people from 
donating funds in a quasi-tax form. 
  The official said: "It is difficult to estimate the funds 
necessary for reunification, it is even more difficult to 
appropriate funds -- which would total hundred millions and 
billions of won -- from the government's budget or its reserve 
funds. Therefore, the government will collect funds from people 
in the form of donations or from bonds for national 
reunification. It will carry out the plans as soon as possible 
when there is consensus among people." 
  The government also believes North-South cooperation funds 
would be needed more in case the North Korean nuclear issue is 
resolved and progress is made in North-South relations. 
Accordingly, it has studied plans to increase North-South 
cooperation funds, which presently totals approximately 100 
billion won. 
  Reunification funds are different from North-South 
cooperation funds in that the former are funds to prepare for 
the period after national reunification.

  [Text] Dear friends: Australian Prime Minister Paul 
Keating will pay his first official friendship to our country at 
the invitation of Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. In today's issue, 
NHAN DAN carries an editorial pegged to this event entitled: In 
the Interests of the Vietnamese and Australian Peoples and for 
the Sake of Peace, Cooperation, and Development. The editorial 
reads in part as follows: 
  Following the first official visit to Australia by our prime 
minister in May 1993, the Vietnam visit by Australian Prime 
Minister Paul Keating has drawn the attention of broad sections 
of public opinion in the region and other parts of the world. 
This important event marks a new developmental step in the 
friendly and cooperative ties between Vietnam and Australia. 
  Vietnam and Australia established diplomatic relations in 
1973. The friendly and cooperative ties between the two 
countries have continued to develop with each passing day since 
then based on the principles of mutual respect, mutual 
understanding, equality, and mutual benefit. Australia highly 
valued Vietnam's renovation achievements in all fields as well 
as Vietnam's foreign policy of diversification and 
multilateralization and its efforts to improve relations with 
many countries in the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
  Australia lifted its trade embargo at an early date and 
resumed its development aid for Vietnam. It has also shared its 
experiences and stepped up cooperation with Vietnam. The 
cooperative ties between the two countries have been improved 
step by step. Both sides have worked together toward the goals 
of implementing agreements on economic and trade cooperation, 
thereby creating favorable conditions for increasing the value 
of bilateral trade activities to $70 million in 1991 from $2 
million in 1982 and to $252 million in 1992 and then to $366 
million in 1993. Australia has become Vietnam's seventh trade 
partner and ranks fifth on the list of foreign investors in 
Vietnam with 26 projects valued at $776 million. 
  Australia has also helped our country with the training of 
hundreds of specialists; the formulation of laws on mining, 
telecommunications, and state management over 
telecommunications; and the enhancement of farmland irrigation, 
hydrometeorological, public health, and tourist sectors in which 
Vietnam has a need and Australia has great potential and high 
technologies. 
  Regarding many regional and international issues, Vietnam 
and 
Australia have reached more and more consensus on the need for 
peace, stability, and development in the Asia-Pacific region 
that the two countries have regarded as the top priority 
objectives of their foreign policies. 
  We hope that Prime Minister Paul Keating's official 
friendship visit to Vietnam will end in success, help strengthen 
mutual understanding, and lead the multifaceted cooperation 
between Vietnam and Australia to a higher level, a larger scale, 
and a broader scope for the sake of each country's prosperity 
and in conformity with the common trends of peace, cooperation, 
and development in the Asia-Pacific region.

  [Summary] In his article entitled: Vietnam's Economy and 
Its Investment Prospects, Mr. Graham Alliband, an Australian 
adviser and director general of Asia-Indochina Limited, analyzes 
Australia's opportunities for trade cooperation with and 
investment in Vietnam. 
  According to Mr. Alliband, Australia made its first inroads 
into the Vietnam market through the OTCI telecommunications 
investment program in 1987. Under this program, Australia 
pledged investment capital of 80 million U.S. dollars. By the 
end of 1992, Australia became the sixth biggest investor in 
Vietnam with 22 projects involving a total investment capital of 
280 million U.S. dollars. 
  Recently, BHP Oil Company won a product-sharing contract to 
exploit oil at the Dai Hung oil field Vietnam's continental 
shelf. This development may make Australia top the list of 
foreign investors in Vietnam. BHP's achievement has testified 
to Australia's high position in Vietnam and also to the 
attractiveness of BHP bidding procedures. 
  Australian companies have also taken the lead in helping 
their Vietnamese counterparts with the exploration of coal, 
gold, silicate sand, lead, tin, copper, manganese, and precious 
stones. Australia has also collaborated with the UNDP in helping 
Vietnam draft a new law on mining exploration. 
  Thanks to its rich agricultural and marine resources, 
Vietnam 
has created conditions for Australian investors to sell their 
agricultural and food processing technologies. Australia has 
also expressed its interest in relocating some of its textile, 
garment, and footwear manufacturing companies to Vietnam. 
Furthermore, Australia's service industries have made their 
presence felt in Vietnam. Australia's ANZ Bank was among the 
first foreign banks to open branches in Vietnam. Some 
Australian law firms have also provided legal advice to foreign 
investors in Vietnam. A number of Australian financial 
companies have also helped Vietnam with access to international 
financial standards. Recently, some of those companies allowed 
their branches based in the neighboring countries to operate 
directly in Vietnam. 
  Most of Australia's construction companies expressed their 
interest in Vietnam through the formation of joint ventures, 
setting up of representative offices, or signing of cooperation 
agreements. They also applied for the participation in major 
infrastructure building projects.

  [Text] The SRV Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokesman on 11 
April issued a statement as follows: 
  1. According to the latest news, a massacre of Vietnamese 
residents was carried out at 1815 on 9 April at Hamlet No. 8, 
Troeuy Sla commune, S'ang district, Kandal Province in Cambodia. 
A total of 13 Vietnamese were killed and 27 others were 
injured. Among those killed were nine children and a women who 
had recently given birth. The mother was killed, while her 
baby's arm was amputated. Public opinion in the locality held 
that the massacre was conducted by the Khmer Rouge in the area. 
  2. After a series of brutal massacres of Vietnamese 
residents 
in Cambodia in the past, this act once again seriously threatens 
mankind's conscience and boldly tramples on human rights 
recognized by international conventions. This serious brutal 
act is obviously aimed at inciting national hatred and damaging 
the fine tradition of friendship and good-neighborly relations 
between the Vietnamese and Cambodian peoples. 
  3. The SRV Government resolutely condemns this new hostile 
act. It urgently asks King Sihanouk and the Royal Government of 
the Kingdom of Cambodia to take prompt and effective measures to 
ensure the safety of the Vietnamese residents in Cambodia so 
that they may live a peaceful life as citizens of other nations 
in Cambodia, thereby meeting the spirit and letter of the 3 
April 1994 [year as heard] joint communique. 
  The SRV Government urgently asks the United Nations and 
signatory countries to the Paris Accord on Cambodia, and 
justice-loving people in the region and the world to seriously 
denounce and take resolute actions to stop this brutal act 
against Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, thereby helping to 
ensure a peaceful life for them in accordance with the spirit of 
the Paris Accord and other international documents on human 
rights. 
  The SRV Government expresses its profound concern that if 
the 
Royal Government of the Kingdom of Cambodia does not take 
resolute actions against this brutal and barbarous act of the 
Khmer Rouge, a series of massacres may recur in Cambodia, 
thereby bringing about unpredicted consequences. 
  Dated 11 April 1994

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 9 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and 
Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt in their speeches at the 
banquet in Hanoi on Thursday in honour of the latters first 
official visit to Vietnam since the establishment of the two 
countries diplomatic relations 25 years ago. 
  The Vietnamese Government leader highlighted Vietnam's 
success in its socio-economic development in recent years. 
  He noted 'with its open foreign policy, Vietnam's relations 
with other countries and international organizations are 
developing positively. Vietnam's market is attracting more and 
more foreign investors'. `While strengthening and expanding its 
cooperative relations with other countries in the region, 
Vietnam also attaches importance to its cooperation with 
northwest European countries and those that have traditional 
relations with Vietnam', Prime Minister Kiet stressed. 
  Regarding the Vietnam-Sweden relations, Mr Kiet said: `For 
many years now, the government and people of Sweden have 
extended precious support and assistance to Vietnam. We 
specially appreciated Sweden's active assistance to Vietnam 
during its war for national liberation'. 
  In reply Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said: 
  `It is an important milestone in our relationship that today 
for the first time ever a prime minister from Sweden is visiting 
your country and is received here in Hanoi as your guest. 
  `In a number of important areas contacts between our two 
countries have been close strong during a long period of time in 
which there has important political changes both in Vietnam and 
Sweden'. [sentence as received] 
  Prime Minister Carl Bildt continued: 
  `Although the issue of Vietnam at that time was 
controversial 
also in Sweden, we all agreed that Vietnam was to be one 
country, and that the people of Vietnam should be free to 
determine and decide their own affairs without outside 
interference from whatever side that came'. 
  Referring to the two countries' relations, the Swedish 
leader 
stressed: 
  `Almost totally dominated by aid in the past, I hope it now 
will be ever more based on trade, thus facilitating the 
essential transfer of know-how, skills and technologies'. 
  `Contacts between Sweden and Vietnam have been strong and 
firm during the turbulent times of the past. Your country is 
now entering a truly new era and our joint task is to give our 
bilateral relationship a new and firm base adjusted to the 
demands of this new era', Prime Minister Carl Bildt affirmed.

  [Text] Dear friends, tonight at the government guest house 
in Hanoi, Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, who is on an 
official visit to our country, held a news conference. A large 
number of journalists from various domestic and international 
news agencies, newspapers, and radio and television stations 
attended the conference. In opening the news conference, the 
Swedish Prime minister said: 
  [Begin Bildt recording in English fading into Vietnamese 
translation] I came here -- this is the first time a prime 
minister of Sweden has come to Vietnam -- in order to primarily 
broaden the relationship between the two countries. We have 
seen important political and economic changes in Vietnam, 
Sweden, and all of Southeast Asia. Therefore, we want to 
develop our relations so they can reflect these important 
changes. In the past, our relations consisted mainly of aid. 
Now they have developed to other areas such as technology 
transfer and economic cooperation. The development will be 
based on experiences obtained through the years of our 
relationship. 
  Experience shows that some countries receive significant 
amounts of aid from the world community but still have not 
developed much. And at the same time we have also seen other 
countries who scarcely receive any international aid, yet have 
progressed and obtained encouraging results. In the development 
of relations, economic renovation should be taken into account, 
and it will be reflected in the relations between Sweden and 
Vietnam in the future. 
  Today I had a discussion with His Excellency [H.E.] the 
prime 
minister, H.E. the president, H.E. the foreign minister, and 
H.E. the chairman of the National Assembly. Yesterday I visited 
Ho Chi Minh City, and today I visited various places in Hanoi 
where I witnessed the dynamic motivation of our Vietnamese 
friends, and the existence of this dynamic motivation proves 
that Vietnam is moving in the right direction. [end recording] 
  Prime Minister Carl Bildt then answered many questions 
raised 
by Vietnamese and international journalists. On a question 
about future relations between Vietnam and Sweden, the prime 
minister said: 
  [Begin Bildt recording in English fading into Vietnamese 
translation] We will have a detailed discussion concerning 
long-term strategy for development assistance here in Hanoi 
between Swedish and Vietnamese representatives at the end of 
April. In the past we decided on a total amount of aid and left 
it to the Vietnamese side to decide how to use it. This method 
has proven to be erratic at times and we have been looking for 
ways to change the situation. Now we will consider each 
strategic concrete need. We will continue to assist programs 
that have been initiated in the past, such as health programs. 
The assistance will be focused on areas that carry important 
significance for the economic renovation of Vietnam. We will 
assist the legal system to help Vietnam build a law-governed 
society. There should also be a banking and finance system that 
suits a market-driven economy. [end recording] 
  Also in the news conference, Prime Minister Carl Bildt 
answered many questions about his official visit to Vietnam. 
  Tonight at the Presidential Palace, Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet feted the Swedish prime minister and other guests in the 
delegation.

  [Text] In Hanoi on 9 April, the Ministry of Finance held a 
news conference on Vietnam's financial situation in the first 
quarter of 1994, with Minister Ho Te chairing. 
  In the first quarter of this year, gross collection of state 
revenues was 17.3 percent of the year's plan or a 34 percent 
increase when compared with the corresponding period last year; 
while expenditure was 17 percent of the set target, or an 
increase of 33 percent when compared to the same period last 
year. It is expected that 23.6 percent of this year's revenues 
will be collected in the second quarter. 
  To fulfill the set targets in the second quarter and the 
first half of this year, the Ministry of Finance is supervising 
various units to help issue guiding documents for localities to 
improve their collection of state revenues, management of local 
budgets, and settlement of capital depreciation. The ministry 
called for efforts to quickly perfect the law on transfer of 
rights to land use, the law on state budget, regulations on land 
and house taxes, and regulations on income taxes. It also urged 
agencies concerned to formulate plans to mobilize capital at 
home and abroad to offset the budget deficit, improve and 
perfect the tax collection system, and design measures to oppose 
waste and prevent losses of state capital.

  [Text] According to a Central Vietnam-based Voice of 
Vietnam Radio correspondent, from 7-8 April, the Khanh Hoa 
Province party organization convened a two-day conference of 
cadres. Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi attended and 
addressed the conference. 
  The conference thoroughly studied the Mid-Term National 
Party 
Conference Resolution and discussed the report on the local 
socioeconomic development over the past three years and on the 
orientations and tasks for the 1994-95 two-year period. 
  According to the report, the value of agricultural products 
has increased by three percent per year and that of marine 
products by 20-25 percent compared with 1990. The annual growth 
rate of agricultural production has increased by more than seven 
percent. The total value of budget revenues has increased by 
nearly five times compared with 1990. Most of the economic 
targets set by the province have been fulfilled or 
overfulfilled. Cultural, scientific, educational, and public 
health services have also made improvements. The people's right 
of mastership has been developed step by step. Positive results 
have also been recorded on the national security and national 
defense front. 
  The conference also analyzed shortcomings and weaknesses and 
discussed measures to overcome disunity that has dragged on and 
on and seriously affected local socioeconomic development. The 
conference focused on major objectives that must be fulfilled 
during the 1994-95 two-year period. It is necessary to continue 
to effect changes in the economic structure in the direction of 
industrialization, agriculture, service industry, and tourism. 
Efforts must be made to effect an average annual increase of 
eight-nine percent in gross domestic product. Measures must be 
taken to improve the people's material and cultural life a step 
further. It is necessary to attract and make good use of the 
contingent of scientific-technological and management cadres. 
Plans must be worked out to promote educational and vocational 
training activities. Steps must be taken to renovate the 
operating procedures of state agencies, fight the evils of 
corruption and red tape, consolidate political stability, firmly 
maintain national security and national defense, and renovate 
and strengthen party leadership over grassroots establishments 
and the masses. 
  Speaking on this occasion, Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi 
commended the Khanh Hoa Province party organization and people 
for their achievements over the past three years. He stressed 
the need for Khanh Hoa to step up industrialization, deep-sea 
fishing, and aquaculture as well as link efforts to protect 
marine resources with endeavors to defend the Fatherland. 
  The comrade general secretary pointed out Khanh Hoa's 
geographical role and responsibility toward the task of 
developing public healthcare and national security and defense 
systems in the island district of Truong Sa and at Cam Ranh Bay. 
He also reminded the Khanh Hoa Province party organization of 
the need to satisfactorily carry out party-building work, 
promote internal unity, and devote efforts to directing the 
local army and people in building Khanh Hoa into a prosperous, 
powerful, and civilized province. 
  The conference also informed the participants of the 
Secretariat's decision to remove 11 comrades from the Khanh Hoa

  [Text] Washington, April 7 KYODO -- A senior Japanese 
economic official met with U.S. Trade Representative [TR] Mickey 
Kantor in Washington on Thursday [7 April] but said he is not on 
a trouble-shooting mission to mend Japan's rocky trade ties with 
the United States. "I have no request on the part of my 
government," Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's government representative 
for external economic affairs, told reporters after a private 
session with Kantor. 
  Matsunaga, who heads a think tank on international 
relations, 
said he called on Kantor for advice on setting up a private 
forum to promote economic cooperation between Japan and North 
America. "Most of our conversations were about the forum I am 
thinking to establish," Matsunaga said. 
  Matsunaga, a close confidant of Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, insisted he and Kantor did not discuss any specific 
issues on how to resume stalled bilateral framework trade talks. 
  But Matsunaga said he stressed to Kantor the importance to 
maintaining healthy bilateral ties between Japan and the United 
States, a conviction he said Kantor shared. "I am convinced 
that we can ultimately sort out our differences," Matsunaga 
later told reporters. 
  Matsunaga said he met with both Hosokawa and Foreign 
Minister 
Tsutomu Hata before coming to Washington and will report back to 
Hosokawa after returning home this weekend. Apart from Kantor, 
he met with the top state department official in charge of 
economic relations, Undersecretary of State Joan Spero, on 
Wednesday. 
  On Friday, Matsunaga is scheduled to meet separately with 
Robert Rubin, head of the White House National Economic Council, 
and Presidential National Security Adviser Tony Lake. 
  Matsunaga's trip to Washington came as the Clinton 
administration was shifting to a less confrontational approach 
in resolving trade disputes with Tokyo. 
  "We are moving in a measured and responsible and careful 
manner in order to work with Japan," Kantor told reporters 
Thursday. 
  Kantor said he expects to review all outstanding trade 
issues 
between Japan and the U.S. when he sees Hata next week in 
Morocco. "I expect we will have a good meeting," Kantor said. 
  Kantor and Hata are going to Morocco to join trade and 
foreign ministers from around the world in signing a new global 
trade pact.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata said Saturday he does not think a general election will be 
held in the next six months in spite of the political disruption 
stemming from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's abrupt 
announcement on Friday that he would resign. 
  Hata, also deputy prime minister who is thought to be one of 
the most likely candidates to succeed Hosokawa, was speaking at 
the 25th trilateral commission plenary meeting held in Tokyo. 
  "There is no need for Japan to hold an election now," he 
told 
the audience, saying that even Diet deliberations have not begun 
on the 1994 budget. 
  Hata, who leads Shinseito, warned the new electoral system 
for the House of Representatives enacted in January may be 
scrapped if the next general election is held under the current 
multiseat electoral system. 
  The new electoral system combines single-seat districts and 
proportional representation seats. But a new electoral map has 
not been drafted yet. 
  "There are some Diet members who say an election under the 
current electoral system would be more advantageous for them," 
he said, adding that such assertion may gain power in the 
political unrest. 
  Hata also said whatever kind of a new administration comes 
about, there will be no policy changes that conflict with 
Hosokawa's reform drive. 
  The foreign minister said it will not be clear until next 
Monday whether he can go to Morocco to attend a ministerial 
meeting from April 12 to 15 to sign the final agreement on the 
General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade. 
  During the gathering, Hata is expected to discuss with U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on resumption of bilateral 
framework trade talks.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- The leaders of the 
seven-party governing coalition agreed on Saturday to pick a 
successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and form a new 
cabinet next week, coalition officials said. 
  The leaders also decided to make efforts to initiate 
deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget in the week that 
will start on April 17, the officials said. 
  The accords were struck at a meeting of the leaders of 
coalition partners who banded together to decide on the course 
of the government following Hosokawa's bombshell announcement 
Friday that he would step down as premier. 
  Budget debate has been paralyzed due to a four-week 
opposition boycott over the premier's refusal to summon his aide 
over Hosokawa's financial deals.

  [Text] Sendai, April 9 KYODO -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party] executive Kozo Watanabe said Saturday [9 April] the 
ruling coalition would welcome legislators from the largest 
opposition force, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who want 
to join the coalition. 
  "If there are some LDP members who have the courage to join 
an upcoming cabinet, we welcome them," said Watanabe, a 
right-hand man of the coalition's behind-the-scene strategist 
Ichiro Ozawa. 
  "We will pick the next prime minister from such a 
broad-minded standpoint," Watanabe said in an apparent reference 
to former Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe of the LDP. 
  The LDP's Watanabe himself dropped hints on Saturday -- for 
the second day in a row -- regarding his readiness to form an 
alliance with Shinseito.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Executives of the ruling 
coalition parties on Saturday agreed on the need to select a 
candidate to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and inaugurate a fresh cabinet by the end of next week. 
  "We all agree that we have to form a new cabinet within next 
week," Social Democratic Party (SDP) secretary general Wataru 
Kubo told a news conference. 
  The No. 2 man in the largest contingent in the coalition 
voiced hope that the ruling seven-party union can inaugurate a 
new cabinet and finish the next premier's major policy speech 
and a questioning session by representatives from all parties 
before parliament next week. 
  Kubo also spoke of the need for the new government to open 
deliberations on the state budget for fiscal 1994, which started 
April 1, in the week beginning April 17. 
  The ruling parties' officials will resume talks on Sunday 
morning over the selection of a candidate to succeed Hosokawa, 
who on Friday offered to resign after eight months in office 
because of controversy over his personal financial deals and 
stalled Diet budget debate. 
  At Saturday's meeting, the coalition executives continued 
discussing a proposal for further coordinating basic policies 
among the partners of the current coalition before setting up a 
fresh administration, Kubo said. 
  The present coalition, an alliance of seven parties spanning 
a wide political spectrum, set sail last August after the 
parties in July hammered out an accord on basic policies to 
establish a government. 
  The SDP believes the intercoalition agreement should be 
honored even if the ruling forces move to narrow down their 
differences on other policy matters, Kubo said. 
  Some coalition parties contend that now that the Hosokawa 
government's intention to implement anticorruption political 
reform has been achieved, the next government should be created 
on the basis of a new policy accord to institute new reforms. 
  This concept could result in forcing the SDP out of the 
coalition due to its lingering policy differences with other 
coalition partners. 
  The SDP secretary general, however, said coalition 
executives 
are working to pick a possible successor to Hosokawa while 
maintaining the current framework of the union. 
  Also at Saturday's meeting, the officials of the ruling 
parties listened to a call from an official of a newly created 
parliamentary group in the House of Representatives on other 
ruling forces to join the group. 
  The new group "Reform," consisting of members of Hosokawa's 
Japan New Party (JNP) and the United Social Democratic Party, 
was established Friday after the JNP dissolved its parliamentary 
affiliation with new party Sakigake (Harbinger). 
  Behind the establishment of the group is Hosokawa's 
intention 
to create a new large parliamentary group of current coalition 
forces as a step toward launching a new party to keep the 
once-dominant Liberal Democratic Party at bay, political sources 
said. 
  Each party of the coalition will consider the call from the 
new parliamentary group on their own, Kubo said. 
  Shinseito and Komeito are expected to join "Reform" next 
week, while the SDP, Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party 
will not take part in the parliamentary group, coalition sources 
said. 
  Shinseito and Komeito are envisioning a new government to be 
made up of parties with full accords on key policies, such as 
tax reform and policy toward North Korea, party officials said. 
  The SDP disagrees with their stand, saying the top priority 
should be how to maintain the seven-party coalition and keep it 
in power, SDP lawmakers said. 
  Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, also vice premier, is 
emerging 
as the front-runner for the premiership, coalition sources said. 
  In interviews with news organizations, former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP hinted at allying with 
Shinseito and other parties with which he shares views on 
Japan-U.S. relations, tax reform and North Korea's suspected 
nuclear weapons program. 
  He said the Japanese people want to see an alliance of 
parties that can execute policy objectives. 
  Asked about the possibility that some senior Shinseito 
members may ask Watanabe to run for the premiership if he quits 
the LDP, Watanabe replied, "Ask the Shinseito members."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Some 150 House of 
Representatives members will before long rally behind a new 
parliamentary group set up by the Japan New Party (JNP) led by 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, eyeing a political realignment 
in the wake of the premier's announcement Friday that he would 
resign, group sources said Saturday. 
  The new grouping will be the second largest in the lower 
house after the 219 seats held by the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), the main opposition party. 
  Lower house members of the ruling coalition's two core 
parties Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, and some 
independents will join the new group, called "Reform," the 
sources said. 
  Three of the seven coalition parties -- the Social 
Democratic 
Party (SDP), the largest force in the coalition, the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] -- 
have, however, criticized the movement. 
  The three parties, which favor a multiparty system, said 
they 
will not participate in the new group as it could ultimately 
lead to a new single party dominated by Shinseito and Komeito. 
  On Friday, Hosokawa established the new group comprising 38 
JNP members and two legislators of the United Social Democratic 
Party, a minor partner in the seven-party coalition. 
  Before establishing Reform, the JNP dissolved an 
eight-month-long alliance with Sakigake, headed by Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  In its prospectus, the new group defined itself as a new 
base 
for establishing a group of politicians who aim to promote 
administrative reform, tax reform and Japan's international 
contribution following political reforms, the sources said. 
  The new group also aims to block a return to power by the 
LDP, which dominated the political scene for 38 years until it 
was ousted by the coalition last August. 
  The LDP still holds the largest portion of seats in the 
powerful lower house as a single party. 
  Shinseito secretary general Ichiro Ozawa, also known as the 
coalition's chief strategist, and Komeito secretary general 
Yuichi Ichikawa envision a new government comprised of parties 
with full accords on key policies such as tax reform and foreign 
policy affairs, the sources said. 
  They are calling on reform-minded LDP legislators to join 
their group. 
  Hosokawa, who was once an advocate of a multiparty system, 
is 
tilting heavily in favor of the Ozawa-Ichikawa line. The three 
key figures are trying to rally over 200 lawmakers of the 
511-member lower house to join the parliamentary group, 
including defectors of the LDP and the SDP, the sources said. 
  Some 10 JNP members, however, have refused to sign the 
prospectus and are expected to leave the party, possibly 
prompting a move to divide the coalition parties into two blocs, 
the sources said. 
  Some members of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 
another 
coalition party, said Saturday they will also join the new 
parliamentary group, DSP sources said. 
  Their decision contradicts DSP Chairman Keido Ouchi's stand 
that the party will not join the group.

    [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at 2329 
GMT on 9 April, in its "News 2001" program, carries a live 
20-minute interview with former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe 
by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Seiko Tomomi, political 
commentator Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University professor 
Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo. 
  Asked what he thinks of the opportunity for him to realize 
the things written in his newly published book "New Conservative 
Revolution," Watanabe says: "Of course, I do not think that 
what I wrote in the book will be realized 100 percent." In 
response to a question on whether he will run for prime minister 
if asked by the ruling coalition, Watanabe says: "They have not 
approached me as yet. The LDP has to do its best to regain 
power. However, the best way for me is to have a comfortable 
number of members of the Liberal Democratic Party support me." 
He then explains the need and importance of finding coalition 
members who share the same beliefs, rather than trying to find 
as many partners as possible for the sake of getting sufficient 
numbers. 
  On allying with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], 
Watanabe points out several policy differences between the LDP 
and the SDPJ and says: "There are fundamental differences 
between the LDP and the SDPJ. Although the SDPJ has been 
changing recently, it is still unable to change completely. The 
SDPJ is unable to respond to the changing times. Therefore, it 
will be difficult for us to form a partnership with the SDPJ 
unless it does something like changing the party and starting 
anew." However, he says he can form a coalition with some of 
the SDPJ members who are called Democrats. 
  On the political style of Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito, Watanabe says although he does not like it, he agrees 
with Ozawa's fundamental political ideas. 
  Watanabe rules out the possibility of forming a coalition 
with Komeito under the current situation. He points out that 
Komeito's fundamental policies are quite different from those of 
the LDP. He said: "They said, when they formed the coalition 
government, that the LDP government's fundamental policies would 
be maintained but the situation was different when it came to 
talking about concrete measures." 
  Asked what he thinks of Foreign Minister Hata becoming the 
next prime minister, Watanabe explains the importance of 
policies, saying: "The problem is what kind of policies he will 
have, or whether or not his policies will be similar to ours." 
  Kobayashi goes back to the question of whether or not 
Watanabe wants to become the next prime minister, urging 
Watanabe to tell the people that he wants serve as prime 
minister. In response, Watanabe says: "I do want to become a 
prime minister, by all means, if I am allowed to do even 70 or 
65 percent of what I wrote in my book."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party [LDP] will defer a decision for some time on 
whether to field its own candidate for prime minister in a 
parliamentary election, LDP officials said Saturday [9 April]. 
  The LDP, which ruled for an uninterrupted 38 years until 
last 
August, reached the accord at a meeting of top party officials. 
Yohei Kono, president, and Yoshiro Mori, secretary general, 
attended the session. 
  Instead of naming its candidate immediately, however, the 
LDP 
will continue to monitor moves by the ruling coalition, the 
officials said. 
  The seven parties in the ruling coalition are now scrambling 
to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who, 
dogged by persistent allegations over his personal finances, 
abruptly announced his resignation Friday. 
  The senior LDP executives also decided to respond to a 
coalition proposal to open debate on the fiscal 1994 state 
budget at the House of Representatives at an early date, the 
officials said. 
  Meanwhile, the LDP's Diet Affairs Committee chairman said 
the 
party will continue efforts to shed light on suspicions over 
Hosokawa's finances. 
  The inquiry resolves around allegations that Hosokawa failed 
to repay a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a 
scandal-tainted trucking business group, as well as a new 
suspicion that Hosokawa unwittingly entrusted an old friend with 
managing his money in a way that might have involved some 
illegalities. 
  During the Friday news conference at which he announced his 
resignation, Hosokawa described the Sagawa money as a loan he 
had repaid and also raised the topic of the "new suspicions" 
without disclosing any additional details. 
  Sadatoshi Ozato, LDP Diet Affairs Committee chairman, told 
reporters, "We need to clarify and explain (Hosokawa's) 
scandals, including the new problem which Hosokawa himself 
raised." 
  "However, the investigations into these scandals must take a 
rational form that would not obstruct Diet deliberations on the 
budget," he said. 
  In a related development, LDP legislator Koichi Kato, who 
served as chief cabinet secretary in the cabinet of Prime 
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of the LDP, proposed throwing the LDP's 
weight behind a candidate to be recommended from among the ranks 
of other parties. 
  "The Liberal Democratic Party should first decide not to 
field its candidate for premiership and then consider what moves 
it could take," Kato said during a nationally-televised news 
program on the Tokyo Broadcasting System.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 10 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe expressed reluctance Sunday [10 April] to leave 
the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) without 
"comfortable" support from LDP members to run for prime minister 
as a candidate of the ruling coalition. 
  Appearing on a TV Asahi program with Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal 
Party] leader Tsutomu Hata, the leading contender to succeed 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, and two other coalition 
leaders, Watanabe said the ruling coalition has not sounded him 
out about running for premier. 
  But during the program, Watanabe signaled his willingness to 
run for prime minister if there is a "comfortable" number of LDP 
members to leave the party to rally with all or portions of the 
ruling coalition. 
  He made the remarks just before representatives of coalition 
partners resumed talks Sunday morning to see if they can settle 
on a candidate for Hosokawa's successor. 
  The ruling coalition has agreed to help inaugurate a new 
cabinet by the end of this week. 
  Watanabe said he has spelled out his policy objectives in 
his 
newly published book "New Conservative Revolution," adding that 
Japan-U.S. trade disputes are "an urgent problem" along with 
Japan's crisis management. 
  Keigo Ouchi, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), 
revealed during the same TV Asahi program that he recently had a 
one-on-one session with Watanabe. 
  Ouchi said his party would back Watanabe's candidacy for 
premier if Watanabe promises not to be too close to Shinseito 
and Komeito [Clean Government Party] at the expense of other 
coalition partners, including Ouchi's DSP. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDP), voiced skepticism about forming a coalition government 
with the conservative LDP. 
  "There is no such possibility," he told the TV Asahi 
program. 
  Hosokawa announced Friday he is resigning to take 
responsibility for questionable financial deals and for the 
impasse over Diet debate on the budget for fiscal 1994 that 
began April 1. 
  Komeito is in favor of Hata as a candidate to replace 
Hosokawa but the SDP is against his candidacy fearing that a new 
cabinet will be dominated by Shinseito and Soka Gakkai-backed 
Komeito. 
  Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, appearing on an 
NHK program, criticized Watanabe for "talking too much (about 
Komeito) based on misunderstanding." 
  Watanabe has been critical of the longstanding relationship 
between Komeito and Soka Gakkai, a lay organization of the 
Nichiren Shoshu sect of Buddhism. 
  The Japanese constitution bans religious groups from 
exercising "any political authority." 
  LDP president Yohei Kono called for the establishment of a 
new coalition government by gathering conservatives and liberals 
together with the LDP as the axis. 
  Kono told the NHK program that "it is natural to discuss 
rearranging (members of) the coalition government." 
  "The LDP should talk with other parties about policies one 
by 
one and stabilize politics," Kono said. 
  As fundamental policies to which a new coalition government 
should agree, Kono raised such issues as the Japan-U.S. 
relationship, tax reform and welfare policy. 
  Kono did not deny a possibility of tying up with the SDP but 
spurned a speculation that Watanabe quit the LDP to join other 
forces, saying, "I don't think it at all." 
  New party Sakigage leader Takemura Masayoshi, also the chief 
cabinet secretary, showed reluctance to maintain the framework 
of the present coalition government unless a situation will 
change where Shinseito founder Ichiro Ozawa is said to have been 
actually controlled. 
  "We must graduate earlier from a situation where a man, not 
a 
prime minister, leads Japan," Takemura told the NHK program, 
alluding to Ozawa's behind-the-scenes clout. 
  Takemura also hinted that Sakigage may tie up with 
reformists 
within the LDP. 
  Murayama also told a Fuji TV program that he can support 
Hata 
but only on condition that the Shinseito amend its "high-handed" 
political techniques. 
  But Murayama denied a possibility that the SDP will remain 
in 
a coalition government if Watanabe joins after quitting the LDP 
with a certain number of members. 
  "It is meaningless for the SDP to stay in a cabinet to be 
mainly formed by Shinseito and the Watanabe faction which will 
possess the same nature as the LDP," Murayama said. 
  Shinseito was set up by a group of Diet men who bolted from 
the LDP just before the July 1993 general elections. 
  Hosokawa's Japan new party formed the coalition government 
last August with Shinseito, the SDP, Komeito, the DSP, Sakigage 
and the United Social Democratic Party. 
  The LDP lost its 38-year-rule on power but has maintained 
the 
largest force in the Diet with Kono as its president.

<F P=106> [Announcer-read report by Sadaya Yokota from the Diet </F>
building; from the "NHK News" program] 
  [Text] At 1100 on 10 April, representatives from the 
ruling coalition parties held a meeting to discuss the choosing 
of a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in an effort 
to form a new cabinet this week. 
  At the meeting, they argued over remarks made on 9 April by 
Masayoshi Takemura, Sakigake [Harbinger Party] representative 
and chief cabinet secretary, and by Democratic Socialist Party 
[DSP] Chairman Keigo Ouchi that the debate on selecting a 
successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa should be shifted from the 
current representative meeting to summit meetings of the 
coalition parties. Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and chairman of the 
representative meeting, stated: Now that a few coalition leaders 
have stated so, there is no point in continuing discussions at 
the representative meeting. Leaders of the coalition parties 
need to put their views in order regarding what has to be done 
at the representative meeting of the ruling coalition. 
  In this way, it has been decided that the leaders of the 
coalition parties will coordinate their views on an appropriate 
venue for discussing a possible successor to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa. Following their coordination, the meeting of 
coalition party representatives will be held again at 1500 [0600 
GMT]. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura's proposal for holding a 
ruling party summit meeting is believed to be based on concern 
that if the issue of choosing a successor to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa is discussed at the coalition representative meeting, 
at which Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito 
Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa attend, both Shinseito and 
Komeito may take the initiative in choosing the successor. 
Because discussion over a possible successor to Prime Minister 
Hosokawa is entangled with a struggle for leadership among the 
coalition parties, it will still take time to coordinate views 
on the issue.

  [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese on 10 April broadcasts at 0000 GMT the "Sunday 
Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) political talk show. This episode 
is 130 minutes long, is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi 
Yamamoro, and carries separate live interviews with Tomiichi 
Murayama, Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) chairman; 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) President Yohei Kono; Komeito 
(Clean Government Party) Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa, and 
Sakigake (Harbinger) representative Masayoshi Takemura, who is 
also chief cabinet secretary. Commentator Naoki Tanaka joins the 
program as an interviewer. 
  At 0004 GMT, after introducing the program, Yamamoto starts 
interviewing SDPJ Chairman Murayama. When asked if the 
successor of outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be 
chosen from the SDPJ, the largest party in the coalition, 
Murayama says, "Before choosing a new prime minister, it is 
important to seek an agreement within the coalition through 
discussions on the framework or character or policies of the new 
cabinet." He adds that it is premature to discuss the 
possibility of his being chosen as the new prime minister. When 
asked what the SDPJ thinks of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) 
head Tsutomu Hata, who is foreign minister and is said to be a 
hopeful candidate, Murayama states, "Rather than saying that the 
SDPJ feels antipathy against Mr. Hata himself, our party, 
frankly speaking, feels antipathy against Shinseito's political 
methods." 
  Murayama stresses that the current framework of the 
coalition 
parties should remain unchanged and thus hold in check the 
Shinseito-Komeito move toward creating a new framework, wherein 
the two parties said that the ruling parties should share common 
policies. He says his party will not join the Japan New Party 
(JNP)-proposed parliamentary group called Reform (Kaikaku) which 
Shinseito and Komeito are likely to join. Murayama then 
reiterates that it is necessary to effect policy coordination 
within the ruling parties. 
  Asked by Tanaka how the SDPJ is dealing with North Korea's 
suspected development of nuclear weapons, Murayama replies: 
"Because the United Nations has not yet come to a final 
conclusion, it is necessary to carry out thorough discussions 
before making any decision. Meanwhile, the DPRK should accept 
nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
I think it is matter of course that we should not drive North 
Korea into a corner by threatening to impose sanctions, and 
therefore we should avoid making North Korea become isolated. 
However, if it should become unavoidable for the United Nations 
to adopt resolutions on taking sanctions, we will have to take 
actions in concert with the United Nations. But Japan has its 
own limitations, and it is possible for Japan to take action in 
accordance with UN resolutions but within its own limitations." 
Returning to the issue of the new cabinet, he rules out joining 
the new government that will be created mainly by LDP Vice 
President Watanabe, Shinseito, and Komeito. The interview ends 
at 0020 GMT. 
  LDP President Kono then takes a seat. Asked how the LDP will 
act to deal with the current political turmoil, Kono says: "What 
our party has to consider first is how to deal with domestic 
economic affairs and the relations between Japan and the United 
States. The current Japanese-U.S. relations are at a very 
critical stage. The LDP will continue to do its utmost to 
correct such a situation." On the domestic front, Kono 
criticizes Hosokawa for failing to take initiatives in dealing 
with economic issues. 
  When asked to comment on LDP Vice President Watanabe's 
possibly leaving the LDP, Kono rules out such a possibility. 
Kono then discusses the LDP's views on a move toward a 
political realignment and on the achievements of the Hosokawa 
government. He terms Hosokawa's having enacted political 
reform-related bills as deserving praise. Asked if the LDP 
hopes to return to power by allying with other parties, Kono 
notes "under the current situation, in which the new cabinet may 
be formed without elections, it is possible to ally with other 
parties which share common policies, and we have to seek such a 
possibility." 
  At 0042 GMT, an interview with Komeito Secretary General 
Ichikawa starts. When Yamamoto asks how he views the criticism 
that the Hosokawa government has been led by Ichikawa and 
Shinseito Secretary General Ozawa, Ichikawa answers that the 
cabinet is run based on an agreement between the ruling parties. 
He says the ties that have bound the coalition partners 
together were broken after the political reform bill was 
enacted, and he notes there is serious gap in policies between 
the ruling parties. On the question of the possible framework 
of a new cabinet, he states: "We are very eager to hold frank 
discussions with the SDPJ. Although it is important to discuss 
who will be the next prime minister, we have a duty to the 
people to create a cabinet that can cope with issues which Japan 
will face soon or later." He adds, "In fact, our party is tired 
of coordinating policies with the SDPJ." 
  Asked when the ruling parties will decide on a new 
cabinet, Ichikawa answers, "Yesterday we agreed to decide on the 
new prime minister at a plenary session of the Diet on Thursday 
[14 April] or Friday at the latest." In this connection, 
Yamamoto asks if there is a possibility of parties allying with 
LDP Vice President Watanabe. Ichikawa answers, "I am of the 
opinion that Mr. Hata is the most qualified person in view of 
maintaining the current framework of the coalition government. 
But the SDPJ and Sakigake say they oppose this opinion on the 
grounds that the government will be led by Shinseito and Komeito 
if Hata is chosen. However, when I ask them to further discuss 
the details of the ruling parties' basic agreements to deal with 
such upcoming issues as the DPRK and tax reform issues, they say 
that this is not necessary and that Komeito is trying to expel 
them from the coalition government. I think that if they 
continue to reject these proposals, we will then have to choose 
another alternative." The interview concludes at 0100 GMT. 
  Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary and head of 
Sakigake, is then interviewed on issues such as the future 
political realignment. Asked about the reason for the 
deterioration of relations between his party and the JNP, 
Takemura says that Hosokawa's favoritism toward Shinseito and 
Komeito is the major cause. Asked if Sakigake will join the 
JNP-proposed Reform parliamentary group, Takemura answers, "No." 
On the issue of a political realignment, Takemura says that it 
is now an outdated concept to divide political parties into LDP 
and non-LDP parties. 
  Yamamoto then asks how the framework of the new government 
should be constructed and asks whether it is impossible for 
Sakigake to get along with political parties or groups led by 
Shinseito's Ozawa. Takemura replies: "I do not know. In 
addition to our party, within the coalition government there are 
parties which are increasingly opposed to Shinseito's manner." 
  Asked whether his party will support Hata as prime minister, 
Takemura says it depends on whether or not the current coalition 
partners can make a fresh start. He stresses that now is the 
time to break the "dual-power" structure. Asked about his 
party's role in forming a new government and the framework of 
it, Takemura says, "We will present our proposal at an early 
date." The interview ends at 0118 GMT.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 10 KYODO -- A growing rift among the 
governing coalition parties on Sunday left in the dark efforts 
to find a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
and the future shape of the coalition. 
  After the 56-year-old Hosokawa abruptly offered to leave the 
helm of government on Friday, top executives of the seven-party 
coalition began moving to choose a candidate for the next 
premier at their caucus. 
  However, two ruling party heads raised doubts about the 
procedure of picking a successor to Hosokawa and demanded that 
top leaders of the coalition parties decide on a new premier. 
  Because of the demand, the coalition representatives' forum 
before noon Sunday suspended efforts to find a suitable figure 
to replace Hosokawa and left the rest up to their party bosses. 
  Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama 
subsequently proposed holding a meeting of the heads of the 
coalition forces at noon Monday to break the selection stalemate. 
  But the offer met with a flat refusal from two major forces 
within the coalition, accentuating deep division among coalition 
partners. 
  "There is a consensus that the caucus of the ruling parties 
is to discuss issues of mutual concern," Shinseito (Japan 
Renewal Party) secretary general Ichiro Ozawa told reporters, 
explaining his party's rejection of SDP chief's offer. 
  "If this is disregarded, it will be perceived as 
dictatorial," the main strategist of the coalition added. 
  Ozawa also asserted that should heads of the SDP, the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and new party Sakigake 
(Harbinger) hold talks themselves on the choice of a candidate 
to succeed Hosokawa, it would constitute a private talk. 
  Koji Morimoto, chairman of Komeito's Diet Affairs Committee, 
also told a news conference Sunday night that his party will not 
accept Murayama's proposal to hold a meeting of the coalition 
party heads on Monday at noon. 
  Although the chairman of the SDP, the largest coalition 
contingent, had asked Hosokawa by telephone to call such a 
meeting under his authority, the departing head of government 
replied he is not in a position to do so because he has already 
offered to resign, Murayama said. 
  Behind the growing division within the coalition, an 
alliance 
of parties spanning a wide political spectrum, is the question 
of which party or parties will take control of the next 
government, political analysts said. 
  While Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is widely considered the 
most likely candidate for the next premier, the SDP and Sakigake 
have been especially cautious about the choice, fearing it would 
allow Hata's Shinseito and its closest partner Komeito to take 
initiative within the coalition. 
  The SDP, for its part, has said that its chairman, Murayama, 
is also qualified for the premiership, though not clearly 
stating the party will field him as a candidate to succeed 
Hosokawa. 
  Meanwhile, a move to reorganize the current framework of the 
coalition has been growing. 
  Although the Shinseito-Komeito bloc wants to see Hata, who 
doubles as deputy prime minister, to be picked as Hosokawa's 
successor, it is also considering fielding former Foreign 
Minister Michio Watanabe of the primary opposition Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) as a candidate for the premiership. 
  If Watanabe defects from the now-deposed party and agrees to 
run for the highest government office with the backing of 
Shinseito, Komeito and other coalition forces, the SDP, whose 
basic policies are still way apart from those of its coalition 
partners, is expected to get the boot. 
  On Sunday, Watanabe signaled his readiness to bolt from the 
LDP and join hands with all or portions of the coalition if 
there is a comfortable number of LDP members to leave the party 
with him. 
  During Hosokawa's eight months in office, the SDP has often 
put the coalition on the spot due to its policy differences with 
other coalition members over such issues as political reform, 
the partial opening of Japan's rice market and tax system reform. 
  The party, along with Sakigake, also hampered Hosokawa's bid 
to revamp his cabinet in protest against his apparent intention 
to sack Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. 
  Sakigake is scheduled to hammer out an outline to form a new 
government on Monday and likely to begin seeking a tie-up with 
pro- reformers within the LDP. Sakigake is a splinter party of 
the LDP, which was toppled from power last August after 38 years 
of uninterrupted rule. 
  LDP president Yohei Kono also called on Sunday for the 
establishment of a new coalition government by uniting 
conservatives and liberals with his party as the core. 
  Kono did not deny the possibility of the LDP tying up with 
the SDP but brushed aside speculation that Watanabe will quit 
his party to join other forces.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Leaders of four parties in 
the ruling coalition agreed Monday [11 April] to urge other 
partners in the administration to meet in an effort to break the 
stalemate over selection of a successor to departing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  "We reaffirmed that we shouldn't prolong this period of 
political vacuum," Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) 
[SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news conference. 
  "We thus agreed to strive to hold a meeting of parties' 
leaders at 10 A.M. tomorrow," said the chief of the largest 
coalition contingent. 
  Other leaders who joined Monday's session include Chief 
Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads new party 
Sakigake (Harbinger) and Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi 
of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). 
  Eiichi Nakamura of the Democratic Reform Party, a small 
parliamentary group in the House of Councillors, also attended. 
  The gathering of the four coalition figures came shortly 
after top officials of the ruling parties agreed to continue 
mulling the choice of a replacement for Hosokawa at their caucus 
for the time being, not at a meeting of ruling parties' heads. 
  Murayama said he will call on Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), Management and Coordination 
Agency Chief Koshiro Ishida of Komeito and Hosokawa of the Japan 
New Party (JNP), to attend the planned session on Tuesday. 
  "I will tell them to compare notes at a meeting of parties' 
heads to minimize the political vacuum and work together to 
fulfill our duties to the public," he added. 
  Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP had flatly refused to hold a 
summit of coalition parties' leaders on Monday. 
  The SDPJ chief denied the four leaders discussed during 
Monday's meeting a possible change in the current framework of 
the coalition government, which was formed last August. 
  There is a growing rift among the ruling parties on the 
selection of a candidate for premier and the shape of the new 
government. 
  Hosokawa, 56, announced his resignation Friday to take 
responsibility for a gridlock in the Diet budget debate spawned 
by allegations of financial impropriety. 
  Hosokawa will remain in office as caretaker until his 
replacement is chosen. 
  Hata is tipped as the most likely candidate for the 
premiership. But some coalition members say Murayama and 
Takemura are also on a list of candidates. 
  Also, the Shinseito-Komeito bloc is considering fielding 
former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the primary 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party as a candidate to succeed 
Hosokawa in a move to split the once-dominant party.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The seven-party ruling 
coalition is splitting into two groups as differences have grown 
over how to pick a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
who announced his resignation Friday, political sources said 
Monday. 
  The Social Democratic Party (SDP) the Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP) and the new party Sakigake [Harbinger] are 
strengthening unity against the coalition's majority group 
comprising Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and the 
Japan New Party (JNP). 
  Meanwhile, the main opposition group, the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP), continues to watch and wait, putting priority on 
keeping its own unity and preventing defections as the two 
coalition groups woo its members, they said. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama, the head of the coalition's 
largest party, Sunday proposed holding a meeting of the heads of 
all the coalition parties at noon Monday to discuss who should 
succeed Hosokawa as prime minister. 
  Murayama's proposal aims at leveling up to the top leaders 
of 
coalition parties from the present level of secretaries general 
to discuss the choice of a successor to Hosokawa. 
  DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake leader Masayoshi 
Takemura supported the idea but Shinseito and Komeito rejected 
the proposal. 
  Hosokawa, the JNP head, also responded coolly to Murayama's 
proposal. 
  On Sunday, the secretaries general of the coalition parties 
began discussions on how to choose the next premier but the 
meeting broke up after only 20 minutes because of differences 
between the two groups. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, regarded as the 
coalition's chief strategist during the eight months of 
Hosokawa's government, said, "there was a consensus that the 
caucus of the ruling parties (at the level of secretaries 
general) is to discuss" the choice of a successor. 
  Ozawa told reporters that if the heads of the SDPJ, the DSP 
and Sakigake attend the proposed leaders' meeting it would 
constitute "a private talk." 
  Koji Morimoto, chairman of Komeito's Diet Affairs Committee, 
also told a news conference Sunday that his party will not 
accept Murayama's proposal for a meeting of the coalition party 
heads. 
  Shinseito and Komeito are considering throwing their support 
behind the LDP's Michio Watanabe, a former foreign minister, as 
a candidate for the premiership if he defects from the LDP, the 
sources said. On Sunday, Watanabe signaled his readiness to bolt 
from the LDP and join hands with all or portions of the 
coalition if a comfortable number of LDP members to leave the 
party with him. 
  Sakigake is scheduled to announce an outline on forming the 
next government Monday and is likely to begin seeking a tie-up 
with reformers within the LDP, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- The ruling coalition put 
off Monday's [11 April] proposed meeting of its party heads to 
discuss the choice of a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who announced his resignation Friday, coalition 
officials said. 
  The coalition will continue talks on the matter at the level 
of secretaries general, they said. 
  Representatives of the coalition partners, who met for 40 
minutes Monday morning, also agreed to convene a meeting of 
party leaders "as the need arises," the officials said. 
  The accord represented a last-minute compromise to avert a 
decisive split of the eight-month-old, seven-party alliance. 
  SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of Japan] Chairman Tomiichi 
Murayama, the head of the coalition's largest party, Sunday 
proposed holding a meeting of the heads of all the coalition 
parties at noon Monday to discuss who should succeed Hosokawa as 
prime minister. 
  Murayama's proposal aims at raising the level for discussing 
the succession to the premiership to that of the top leaders of 
the coalition parties from the present level of secretaries 
general. 
  DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi and Sakigake [Harbinger] leader 
Masayoshi Takemura supported the idea but Shinseito [Japan 
Renewal Party] and Komeito rejected the proposal. 
  Hosokawa, the JNP head, also responded coolly to Murayama's 
proposal. He told reporters that he will not attend the 
leaders' meeting. 
  Komeito Chairman Koshiro Ishida told reporters Monday that a 
meeting of party heads should be convened at the final stage. 
  Meantime, the heads of the SDPJ, DSP, Sakigake and the 
Democratic Reform Party had talks at noon Monday and agreed to 
propose a meeting of leaders of all the coalition parties at 10 
A.M. Tuesday, well-placed sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- A policy study group of 
the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged its 
leadership on Monday [11 April] to initiate a bid to sweep 
former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe to power to succeed 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  The suprafaction group, "Liberals," chaired by former 
parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, issued the 
appeal after adopting it at a meeting of 20 of the group's 36 
legislators at LDP headquarters. 
  Kakizawa was vice foreign minister when Watanabe held the 
portfolio of the foreign minister under the administration of 
former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Watanabe was not present 
at the meeting. 
  The group's appeal urged the LDP leadership to put an end to 
the current "futile" political structure, where LDP forces and 
anti-LDP forces clash with each other in a bid for power, 
members said. 
  The LDP lost its 38-year grip on power last August after a 
series of defections led to the establishment of a seven-party 
coalition government. 
  The group called on the leadership to strive to create a new 
coalition government that would not be paralyzed by 
intracoalition conflicts over crucial policy issues such as 
diplomacy or defense. 
  The group urged the formation of a new administration led by 
Watanabe that would keep the "same distance from all political 
forces" that now comprise the governing coalition. 
  Shokei Arai, a member of the group, told a news conference 
that followed the meeting, "Our vision is not to have Mr. 
Watanabe take advantage of Shinseito and Komeito." 
  The two parties -- key forces within the ruling coalition -- 
are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe as the next leader 
of a new coalition government due to his political influence and 
his parliamentary strength as head the LDP's third-largest 
faction, which has 46 members. 
  Seiichi Ota, another member, did not rule out the 
possibility 
that the group's appeal for support for Watanabe might lead to 
the establishment of a new political party led by Watanabe. 
  "There could be a range of variations" on possible political 
forces, he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe plans to form a new parliamentary group in the 
House of Representatives in a bid to form a coalition government 
with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito [Clean Government 
Party] and the Japan New Party [JNP], a senior official of the 
Watanabe faction said Monday [11 April]. 
  However, Watanabe and his faction's members will not 
renounce 
their membership of the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], the No. 
1 opposition party, even after the lower chamber secretariat 
approves the new group, they said. 
  In parallel with this move, executives kicked off a campaign 
to solicit the signatures of LDP legislators ready to support 
Watanabe's bid for the premiership following the imminent 
official resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  As the combined parliamentary strength of his 46-member 
faction, Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP stands at 161, Watanabe 
will need to win support from more than 95 LDP legislators who 
belong to other LDP factions. 
  The LDP was stripped of its 38-year lock on power after 
dozens of Shinseito and Sakigake [Harbinger] legislators bolted 
the party last June. 
  Watanabe's bid for premiership is also contingent on whether 
Shinseito will agree to link up with him in view of its earlier 
demand that the Watanabe faction leave the LDP to form a new 
party with it, political analysts said. 
  Watanabe hinted at his readiness to leave at a meeting of 
his 
faction earlier in the day, saying, "I want to take fresh action 
together with people who have the same (political) opinions and 
share my ideals." 
  However, he decided to form a new group without renouncing 
his LDP membership, as it would alienate potential supporters 
within the LDP if he demanded they quit the party, the faction 
executives said. 
  Since last February, Watanabe has repeatedly held 
clandestine 
meetings with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is 
the chief coalition strategist. 
  Shinseito and Komeito -- key forces within the ruling 
coalition -- are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe the 
next leader of a new coalition government due to his political 
influence and his position as head of the LDP's third-largest 
faction.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- New party Sakigake, one of 
the seven coalition parties, unveiled a policy platform Monday 
with a proposal to reorganize the political landscape from 
scratch with political, administrative and economic reforms as 
top priorities. 
  The policy platform said a new government to succeed that of 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should be drawn up "on 
a blank sheet of paper." 
  The new government should be free from the framework of the 
current coalition that excludes the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), currently the primary opposition party. 
  Party leader and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, 
however, told a news conference that Sakigake, which has 15 
members in the House of Representatives, will not join a 
government "under the leadership of the present LDP." 
  Sakigake's deputy chief, Shusei Tanaka, said, "This is not 
an 
appeal to the LDP for participation in a government." 
  Sakigake (Harbinger) outlined its goals for the next 
government as coalition members struggled to come up with a new 
premier following Hosokawa's abrupt resignation announcement 
Friday. 
  It also stipulated that the new government should observe 
the 
war-renouncing constitution and firmly resolve not to turn Japan 
into a major political or military power. 
  Sakigake's basic stance is in stark contrast to the vision 
of 
Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's chief strategist and cofounder of 
the alliance's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party). 
  Ozawa wants Japan's Self-Defense Forces to play a more 
active 
role in UN peacekeeping activities. 
  Given that the Hosokawa administration faltered over a 
financial scandal, Sakigake's platform said the next government 
has a special obligation to live up to reform pledges. 
  It also urged a more democratic and more transparent policy- 
making process. 
  Last August the LDP was ousted after 38 years in power when 
Sakigake and Shinseito, whose members are former LDP 
parliamentarians, joined five other parties to form the 
coalition. The LDP failed to win a majority in July's general 
election. 
  The seven ruling coalition parties remain divided over how 
to 
pick a successor to Hosokawa. 
  Hosokawa declared his intention to resign last Friday to 
assume responsibility for involvement in scandals pertaining to 
his finances, and to break a deadlock in the Diet that had 
brought debate over the fiscal 1994 budget to a standstill. 
  A rift is growing among the fractious coalition components, 
splitting the parties into two blocs. One comprises Shinseito, 
Komeito and Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP). The other 
consists of the largest component of the coalition, the Social 
Democratic Party (SDP), along with the Democratic Socialist 
Party (DSP) and Sakigake. 
  Shinseito and Komeito will soon join a new parliamentary 
group in the lower house established last Friday by the JNP. 
The SDP, the DSP and Sakigake have said they will not 
participate in the group because they fear it will be dominated 
by Shinseito and Komeito, official sources said. 
  Shinseito and Komeito envisage forming a new party, while 
the 
SDP, the DSP and Sakigake favor a multiparty system, but with 
fewer parties than at present, they said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- A private secretary of the 
late former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and a former publisher 
of an economic information magazine mishandled investment of a 
60 million yen fund of Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa, sources 
close to Hosokawa said Saturday [9 April]. 
  Hosokawa on Friday abruptly announced he would step down, 
saying "new suspicions" that investment of some of his personal 
funds may have been unlawful. 
  The sources said Masatoshi Miyama, Hosokawa's former 
financial secretary, entrusted the publisher with the investment 
of 60 million yen with intermediation of Tanaka's former 
secretary. 
  The secretary denied his involvement in the financial 
transactions in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The 
publisher could not be reached for comment. 
  According to the sources, around 1981 Miyama asked Tanaka's 
former secretary, an acquaintance of Miyama, for advice on 
investing funds and Tanaka's secretary introduced the publisher 
to Miyama. 
  At that time, Hosokawa was a House of Councillors member in 
Tanaka's faction in the Liberal Democratic Party. The next 
year, with Tanaka's backing, Hosokawa successfully ran in the 
Kumamoto gubernatorial race. 
  The publisher was an investment consultant and was engaged 
in 
an illegal money-lending business, the sources said. 
  At first, the publisher was entrusted with more than 1 
million yen and was later entrusted with the 60 million yen, 
part of the money Hosokawa raised through sale of land inherited 
in 1982, they said. 
  In 1991, when Miyama quit Hosokawa's office, he reportedly 
told the office that the investment of the 60 million yen was 
not a success and that only 10 million yen worth of shares were 
left. 
  Hosokawa received some 202 million yen in 1982 as his 
portion 
of the sale of an estate in Suginami ward in Tokyo after he and 
two of his relatives inherited the estate following the death of 
their grandmother Chiyoko Konoe in September 1980. 
  After paying inheritance taxes and lending 64 million yen of 
the money to one of his political fund-raising organizations, 
Hosokawa entrusted the remaining 60 million yen to Miyama, the 
sources said. 
  The opposition camp has demanded Miyama be summoned before 
the Diet to testify on Hosokawa's finances. The premier has 
repeatedly rejected the call. 
  Hosokawa told a news conference Friday that "from 1981 and 
for several years, my office let a certain person use the fund, 
and he gained personal profit from it. That person is an old 
personal friend of mine." 
  "He specifically requested that money be entrusted to him, 
because he would manage it for profit. But there were some 
problems in the process of the management of that particular 
fund." 
  He declined, however, to elaborate further on the specifics 
of the new suspicions, saying an investigation by his political 
office was still underway.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- A former publisher of an 
economic magazine admitted Monday [11 April] he had been 
involved in investing funds belonging to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa but denied he had used them on the financial black 
market. 
  Yusei Kuwata, 60, said in an interview with Kyodo News 
Service, "as I heard (Hosokawa) needed 500 million yen to form a 
faction in the future, I cooperated in investment of his funds." 
  He denied any illegality in his use of the funds. 
  Hosokawa on Friday abruptly announced he would step down, 
citing a fresh questionable financial deal as one of the reasons 
for his decision to resign. 
  Kuwata said Hosokawa and he played golf together in Shiga 
Prefecture on a day in 1981 when the premier was a Liberal 
Democratic Party member of the House of Councillors. Kuwata was 
introduced to Kiyoshi Sagawa, founder of the Sagawa Kyubin 
trucking group, at the center of a money-and-mob scandal, in 
Hosokawa's residence in Kyoto that night. 
  On a train returning to Tokyo, Kuwata proposed to Hosokawa 
cooperating in raising funds and Hosokawa said 500 million yen 
was necessary to form a faction. 
  Kuwata received funds through Masatoshi Miyama, Hosokawa's 
secretary, one month later and promised payment of interest of 
at least 12 percent a year. He invested the funds in stocks and 
convertible bonds and made a profit of 20 million yen until 
1985, Kuwata said. 
  In 1991, Kuwata received 30 million yen from Hosokawa and 
invested the money in stocks but the money became unrecoverable, 
he said. 
  Hosokawa told a news conference Friday, "From 1981 and for 
several years, my office let a certain person use the funds, and 
he gained personal profit from it. That person is an old 
personal friend of mine." 
  "He specifically requested that money be entrusted to him, 
because he would manage it for profit. But there were some 
problems in the process of the management of that particular 
fund," Hosokawa continued. 
  He declined, however, to elaborate on the specifics of the 
new suspicions, saying an investigation by his political office 
was still under way. 
  Kuwata said he did not invest the funds on the black market. 
  Kuwata advised Hosokawa to buy shares in Nippon Telegraph 
and 
Telephone Corp. (NTT) in August 1987 when Hosokawa was Kumamoto 
governor. NTT was then planning to go private by selling its 
shares. 
  Kuwata introduced Shuzo Fujiki, an investment consultant and 
president of a Tokyo-based consulting firm, to Miyama. 
  Three hundred NTT shares were brought in the name of 
Hosokawa's father-in-law, Shohei Ueda. 
  Hosokawa said at the news conference, "Concerning NTT 
shares, 
I have repeatedly mentioned that my father-in-law personally 
purchased them, that my former secretary was involved in that, 
and that the returns for that service, at least part of it, were 
made to the personal accounts of my father-in-law." 
  Fujiki, however, has said the NTT share transaction was 
Hosokawa's.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Lending by Japan's 11 
major commercial banks in fiscal 1993 posted the first fall 
since the banks started taking statistics in 1954, a banking 
group said Monday [11 April]. 
  Both consumer and corporate loans remained sluggish 
throughout the year that ended March 31, said an official of the 
Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan. 
  The outstanding balance of lending by the 11 banks, known as 
city banks in Japan, came to 221.97 trillion yen at the end of 
the year, down 0.6 percent from a year earlier with a scant 0.1 
percent growth in the latest reporting month alone, the 
federation said. 
  The official brushed aside views that banks have been 
reluctant to expand lending after incurring huge bad loans from 
the collapse of the asset-inflated economy of the late 1980s. 
  "Banks took an active posture with various measures to 
increase lending, (but) corporate demand for funds stayed 
sluggish," he said. 
  Six city banks posted declines in fiscal 1993 lending, led 
by 
2.31 percent at the Bank of Tokyo, 2.30 percent at Fuji Bank and 
2.08 percent at Sanwa Bank. 
  Daiwa Bank marked the highest growth of 5.85 percent among 
the five banks that increased lending. Mitsubishi Bank followed 
with 1.00 percent, and the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank with 0.87 
percent. 
  The ranking of lending balance remained unchanged from the 
previous year, with 32.37 trillion yen at Sakura Bank, 28.18 
trillion yen at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, and 27.28 trillion yen at 
Sumitomo Bank. 
  The year-end balance of lending by Japan's three long-term 
credit banks also marked the first fall, falling 0.2 percent 
from the year- before level and dropping 0.1 percent for March 
alone to 47.45 trillion yen. 
  The lending balance at Japan's seven trust banks stood at 
25.43 trillion yen, up 4.1 percent from a year earlier and 1.7 
percent in March. 
  As for deposits released together, the federation said the 
outstanding balance of deposits at the city banks in fiscal 1993 
rose for the first time in three years, climbing 2.0 percent 
from the year before to 196.17 trillion yen. 
  The officials said deposits tended to be higher toward the 
end of the year, with a 4.0 percent growth seen in the second 
half after a 1.9 percent fall in the first half. 
  Corporate deposits increased for the first time in three 
years as deposits by government-affiliated companies and 
temporary deposits of investment funds by insurance firms 
increased to more than offset declines in other general 
corporate deposits, the official said. 
  Individual deposits remained buoyant led by demand deposits, 
he said. 
  Real deposits, excluding checks and bills, rose a strong 3.1 
percent in March alone. 
  The balance of debenture issuance -- equivalent to deposits 
at other banks -- at the long-term credit banks for fiscal 1993 
came to 51.33 trillion yen, down 0.9 percent to mark the second 
consecutive fall. The March issuance alone dropped 0.4 percent. 
  The balance of deposits at the trust banks gained 4.9 
percent 
in fiscal 1993 to 10.09 trillion yen, recording the first 
increase in three years.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- A government advisory tax 
panel will continue its discussions as Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa requested to compile detailed proposals on tax reform, 
a forum chief said Friday [8 April]. 
  Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, made the remarks 
at 
a news conference after a panel meeting held amid news that 
Hosokawa announced his intention to resign. 
  The news indeed came as a surprise for the advisory body to 
the prime minister that kicked off discussions with newly 
appointed panel members after Hosokawa himself requested at the 
onset to compile detailed proposals on a tax reform. 
  His request featured a net tax increase to cope with the 
coming aged society. 
  "There will be no effect on our discussions," Kato said, 
noting a tax reform as requested by Hosokawa is a promise both 
domestically and internationally to materialize by the end of 
the year. 
  He added any new cabinet will come up with the same 
direction 
as Hosokawa to deal with the coming aged society. 
  The greatest missions are to limit the net tax increase as 
much as possible and to promote publicity to win public support, 
Kato said. 
  The panel will compile a report in June with "various 
options" for politicians to decide, he said, suggesting the 
report will include specific figures on the scale of the tax cut 
and hikes. 
  The timing is in line with the ruling coalition parties' 
agreement to decide on the tax reform before the current Diet 
session ends June 29 and also with Japan's promises in the March 
market-opening package to offer details in June before the 
summit of the Group of Seven major nations in Italy in July. 
  Addressing the resumed meeting, Hosokawa asked the panel to 
discuss and present recommendations "in the early stage to 
detail a desirable tax system for creating a stable, balanced 
tax system on income, consumption and assets," as proposed by 
the panel in November in its medium-term report on tax reform. 
  The November report called for such a balanced tax system to 
cope with the coming aging of society in the 21th century. 
  But Hosokawa said an "increase in public tax burden is 
unavoidable" to attain an affluent society amid the aged 
population while creating a sound fiscal position without 
amassing national debt balance even if thorough administrative 
reform and expenditure streamlining are taken. 
  In specifying tax reform, Hosokawa reminded panel members 
that the government and the ruling coalition parties vowed to 
bring about full-scale tax reform by the end of the year, when 
they decided in February to conduct 6 trillion yen income tax 
cuts limited to fiscal 1994. 
  He also said legislators attached a provision to include a 
permanent income tax in the year-end reform when they passed the 
single-year bills in March.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Trade Minister Hiroshi 
Kumagai on Friday [8 April] cautioned against the recent moves 
by public entities to raise rates on utilities, transportation 
and other fees. 
  Recent plans to raise public fees should not be easily 
justified at a time when many countries are calling on Japan to 
rectify its heavy price gaps with other countries, International 
Trade and Industry Minister Kumagai told a regular press 
conference. 
  The warning came after the government earlier in the day 
unveiled basic guidelines for increasing public fees. 
  The guidelines, prepared in response to a barrage of public 
criticism of public rate hike plans, address the importance of 
local governments and concerned entities taking full 
consideration for the impact such hikes may have on overall 
prices and people's livelihood. 
  Kumagai said further deregulation and administrative reform 
intended to remove structural problems needs to be implemented 
to push down Japanese prices to international levels. 
  Rate increases now under consideration include medical 
expenses, highway tolls, tuition at national universities, taxi 
charges, gas and electricity rates, municipal buses and subways, 
rents for publicly owned houses and telephone rates. 
  In line with the latest guidelines, the government is 
expected to postpone or scrap part of these plans. 
  Kumagai indicated his support for the introduction of a 
product liability law when he referred to a court ruling on a 
defective TV. 
  The March 29 ruling by Osaka District Court said the maker, 
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., should be held responsible 
for a defect that caused a fire unless it could prove there were 
no mechanical problems with the TV. 
  The ruling was epoch-making because the court accepted that 
consumers seeking compensation simply need to prove that a 
product was defective, instead of having to prove negligence by 
the maker, as at present. 
  A government panel recently proposed excluding such a 
provision from any product liability law passed in Japan. 
  The ruling "showed that the current surrounding product 
liability is moving in a certain direction," Kumagai said. 
  Matsushita said Thursday it will not appeal the ruling.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- A government white paper 
called Friday [8 April] for enhanced "social support" for child 
care, saying it costs parents an estimated 20 million yen to 
raise a child from birth through university graduation. 
  The 1993 White Paper on Health and Welfare, approved at a 
cabinet meeting, particularly called on companies to improve 
conditions for child care for their employees. 
  Companies should view support for child care as necessary 
costs for securing a work force, introduce a child care leave 
system and create corporate nurseries, it said. 
  The white paper also urged corporations to promote 
reemployment of female workers who have left companies to take 
care of their infants. 
  The report also calculated the costs of rearing children. 
  For a couple whose first child is born when the husband is 
30 
years old and the second two years later, bringing up the two 
children and putting them through college costs 39.78 million 
yen if the wife works part time, and 45.05 million yen if she 
works full time. 
  The calculations also assume the couple buys a 40 million 
yen 
condominium when the husband is 35 years old. 
  The higher costs for a couple with the wife working full 
time 
are due to extra nursery expenses. 
  The financial burden of rearing children is especially heavy 
when they are attending college, accounting for 45 percent of 
the total disposable income of the family if the wife works full 
time, and 70 percent if she works part time. 
  The white paper also sounded the alarm about the declining 
birthrate, which dropped to a record 1.50 births per woman of 
childbearing age in 1992, when only 1.2 million babies were 
born, from 2.14 in 1973. 
  The dwindling number of children could put a squeeze on the 
nation's economic growth and increase the social security burden 
on workers, the report warned. 
  Wide-ranging measures are needed to halt the trend, 
encompassing nursery facilities, working conditions, housing, 
and education, it said. 
  Pointing to the importance of housing conditions, the paper 
noted a correlation between the number of children and the size 
of houses. 
  Toyama Prefecture, which boasts the largest proportion of 
housing floor space per person, was also the prefecture with the 
largest number of children per family, 2.3, it said. 
  Akita Prefecture, which ranked third in per-capita house 
area, came ninth in the number of children at 2.0 per family, 
the report said. 
  Families in Tokyo, which ranked second from the bottom in 
terms of house area, have only 1.0 child on average, the 
smallest rate in Japan. 
  In line with the white paper, the Health and Welfare 
Ministry 
plans to compile a package of measures for supporting 
childbearing and child care by the end of fiscal 1994, which 
ends next March 31.

  [Text] Sa Kaeo -- Six Thais who crossed into the Cambodian 
town of Poipet, apparently unaware that the border was 
temporarily closed, were arrested by Cambodian soldiers 
yesterday. One of the six, who is a soldier, Pvt Damnoen 
Kaeodoeng, was freed by his captors and told to fetch 10,000 
baht in exchange for the release of the other five. 
  The five were named as Phaibun Sawatdi, Sanit Hoibunloet, 
Sak 
Soemphun, Wanyen Phokhamon and Kiat (surname unknown). All work 
in Bangkok and had gone home to Sa Kaeo province for Songkran 
holidays. 
  Pvt Damnoen told police the group went to Poipet at 9 a.m. 
by 
walking across Mahod creek which had dried up. On their way 
back to Thailand, they were arrested by Cambodian forces. 
  Following the incident, Governor Kasem Chaisit ordered 
officials to warn Thais not to get close to or cross into 
Cambodia because of the safety problem in the wake of increased 
fighting inside Cambodia. 
  In another incident, one Thai villager was robbed by 
Cambodian bandits in Tambon Tha Kham of Aranyaprathet early 
yesterday. The police said at least three bandits pulled a rope 
across the Aranyaprathet-Khlong Namsai border road to trap 
passing motorcyclists. Sawant Boonto rode a motorbike past the 
site without seeing the rope and was flung off-balance. The 
bandits hit him on the head with a rifle butt and stole his bike 
and gold necklace.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Anuson Kritsanaserani, director 
of the Supreme Command Information Office, disclosed that 
Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari will visit 
Cambodia this month to discuss with Cambodian military leaders 
problems that exist between the two countries. He said efforts 
had been made to arrange for a visit which, he believed, would 
enable the two parties to thrash out misunderstandings. 
  Commenting on a report that the Cambodian Government was 
planning to lodge a protest with the UN Security Council about 
Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge, Lieutenant General 
Anuson said it is entitled to do so. The Thai military has no 
worries because it has facts to explain, but it prefers to leave 
the matter to the Foreign Ministry to handle.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has called 
for restraint and understanding in relations with Cambodia, 
saying Thailand cannot respond to the daily accusations by Phnom 
Penh of its support for the Khmer Rouge. 
  The government should be firm and act maturely as the 
Cambodian allegations could be made for domestic gain or to 
resolve internal problems. 
  Surin's comments came amidst strong criticism by Cambodian 
leaders, who have repeatedly charged that Thailand has assisted 
the Khmer Rouge to launch offensives and sheltered the Maoist 
faction's leaders. 
  Cambodian Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut has 
threatened to take the matter to the UN Security Council. He 
also warned that bilateral relations between the two governments 
could be jeopardized.

  [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that the Cambodian 
foreign minister's accusation that Thailand supports the Khmer 
Rouge affects Thailand's image. The prime minister made these 
remarks when talking to reporters in Nong Khai Province. He 
said that he had instructed the Thai ambassador to Phnom Penh to 
seek facts and evidence in this regard. 
  Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said he 
regretted that the Cambodian leader made such an accusation 
because the two sides had agreed not to publicly speak out 
against each other. The two sides agreed to solve problems 
through dialogue. He said that he would meet the Cambodian 
foreign minister soon to discuss this question. 
  Meanwhile, Defense Minister General Wichit Sukmak said 
Thailand has upheld humanitarian principles in assisting 
Cambodian displaced persons. He said that as the accusation has 
an impact on the country's reputation, Thailand will have to 
explain to the international community Thailand's policy of 
noninterference in Cambodia's internal affairs.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement clarifying 
an accusation about Thailand supporting the Khmer Rouge. The 
statement says that Thailand would like to reject the accusation 
because Thailand has a firm policy of recognizing the elected 
Cambodian Government and noninterference in Cambodia's internal 
affairs by not providing any assistance to the Khmer Rouge. The 
Cambodian side should send evidence to the Thai side if it has 
any evidence to support the accusation. The Thai side is ready 
to take appropriate action in this regard. If Cambodia cannot 
solve its internal problems and accuses another country of 
supporting any particular faction, it is incorrect and 
inappropriate.

<F P=106> [Article by Phaisan Sicharatchanya under the rubric of "From </F>
The Editor's Desk": "Outbursts by Khmer Leaders Do Not Solve 
Bilateral Sore Point"] 
  [Text] Judging from their relentless criticisms of alleged 
Thai military assistance for the Khmer Rouge [KR], Cambodian 
government leaders must have harbored some deep ill feelings 
against Thailand. But the successive salvos of stinging attacks 
by Cambodian co-Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh and 
Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut last week hardly 
served to address the crux of the problems. 
  By airing their grievances to the mass media, both Ranariddh 
and Sirivut must have hoped to drum up international pressures 
to force Thailand to terminate what they believe is continuous, 
clandestine Thai support for the outlawed guerrilla faction. 
But although they might have succeeded in re-focusing media 
attention on the subject, the crude tactics they adopted also 
achieved the counter-productive effect of souring the atmosphere 
of bilateral relations with Thailand. 
  Ranariddh kicked off the latest anti-Thailand barrage by 
claiming he possessed photographic evidence that showed Thai 
troops helped Pol Pot escape the recent Cambodian government 
attack on Pailin. But he clarified his accusation a day later by 
explaining that he actually meant the Pol Potists--a reference 
to the Khmer Rouge--but not the guerrilla leader himself. 
  Since the said evidence was not made public, it wasn't clear 
whether Ranariddh was just bluffing. Indeed Ranariddh could 
contribute to improving relations by producing the evidence if 
it was really in his possession, so that this bilateral 
sore-point could be seriously addressed. 
  There are enough Thais in this country who do not condone 
clandestine support for the Khmer Rouge and would certainly 
question any such shady military practice. Given the persistent 
denials by the Army leadership of any such assistance, it would 
be bound to weed out undesirable elements stationed in the 
border areas which violate the policy that is, on the face of 
concrete evidence. 
  But the breach of diplomatic protocol committed by Sirivut 
was more disturbing. What on earth was he trying to achieve by 
publicizing this contentious issue in Kuala Lumpur aside from 
further aggravating an already strained atmosphere of bilateral 
ties with Thailand? Surely he could have been more discreet, 
especially since this is very much a Thai-Cambodian problem 
which can be resolved only by the two countries. 
  As a result of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's recent visit 
to 
Cambodia, Bangkok and Phnom Penh were supposed to put into place 
a hotline to coordinate various bilateral problems of a serious 
and urgent nature. But judging from the surprised reactions by 
senior Thai officials, who claimed they have to verify 
wire-service reports to ascertain that both Ranariddh and 
Sirivut were not misquoted, it was apparent there was a 
breakdown of communications both through the normal diplomatic 
channels as well as the special hotline contact. 
  Notwithstanding the Cambodian leaders' undiplomatic 
outbursts, the deep-seeded resentment inherent in their latest 
accusations nonetheless call for serious attention and 
investigation by the Thai side. In essence, it would require a 
combination of policy adjustments and changes in attitude by 
both sides for relations to improve. Thailand and Cambodia are 
neighboring countries that have no other choice but forging at 
least a proper relationship of peaceful coexistence if not 
substantive political and economic ties. 
  With the embarrassing police discovery of a huge secret 
arsenal near the Thai-Cambodian border last December still fresh 
in our memory, the Thai Army cannot simply dismiss the latest 
Cambodian accusations outright. Army Commander Gen. Wimon 
Wongwanit should be believed and trusted when he says the Thai 
military does not support the Khmer Rouge. Indeed there is 
probably no such policy. But the conduct of certain military 
officers stationed at the border who enjoy longstanding 
connections and share certain vested interests with the Khmer 
Rouge is a different matter. 
  One alleged piece of `evidence' warranting investigation is 
an undated photograph found in Pailin and released by AFP which 
purportedly shows senior Khmer Rouge commanders and Pailin chief 
Kim Chean toasting out-of-uniform Thai soldiers at an 
undisclosed Khmer Rouge headquarters in western Cambodia. Are 
those identified as Thai soldiers really Thai soldiers? That 
should be easy enough for the army to find out. 
  The Thai civilian and military leaderships have the 
collective task to weed out whatever wayward elements stationed 
on the border areas which collude with the Khmer Rouge. It is 
the conduct of these elements that presents the bone of 
contention with Cambodia and casts Thailand in a poor light 
internationally. Persistent accusations of complicity by some 
officers in the gems and timber trade with the Khmer Rouge must 
be investigated and those found to do so eliminated. Otherwise, 
the mistrust of the Thai military will not be mollified.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- Khmer Rouge guerrillas have seized 
several outposts of Cambodian government forces in Thmar Puok 
district of Banteay Meanchey Province since they launched 
attacks on Thursday. 
  Thai military sources claimed the guerrillas had driven 
Phnom 
Penh forces out of their outposts in Banteay Chhma, Kok Khieu, 
Kauk Mon, Toek Lesor, Phum Totoek and Phum Soeng. The 
guerrillas were poised to attack Thmar Puok township, the 
sources said. 
  Retreating elements of the Phnom Penh's 3rd and 7th 
divisions 
are regrouping and are waiting for reinforcements from Banteay 
Meanchey. 
  The outbreak of fighting had caused 5,000 Cambodian 
civilians 
to pack up in preparation to flee across the border to 
Thailand's Ta Phraya district if the fighting intensified, the 
sources said.

  [Text] China does not want the disputes over the 
sovereignty of the Spratly islands, a "hot issue" for this 
region, to be included in the agenda of the upcoming ASEAN 
Regional Forum [ARF] to be held in Bangkok on 25 July. Instead, 
it hopes participants will discuss how to establish mutual trust 
at the meeting. 
  Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the above 
remarks during his meeting with Thai senior foreign ministry 
officials in Bangkok yesterday. 
  Foreign Ministers of the six ASEAN countries, their seven 
dialogue partners, and observer nations -- Vietnam, Laos, and 
Papua New Guinea -- as well as China and Russia will attend the 
ARF meeting to discuss regional political and security 
cooperation issues. 
  Six countries including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the 
Philippines, Brunei, and Malaysia claim sovereignty over the 
Spratly islands. 
  Tang Jianxuan and his delegation arrived in Bangkok late 
Monday night for a week-long visit to three ASEAN countries -- 
Thailand, Malaysia, and Brunei -- to discuss bilateral relations 
and issues of common concern. 
  An informed diplomatic source said during Tang Jiaxuan's 
visit to Malaysia from 5 to 7 April and to Brunei from 7 to 9 
April, that he will exchange views on the Spratly issue with 
Malaysian and Bruneian officials. 
  During his meeting with Tang Jiaxuan yesterday, Foreign 
Minister Prasong Sunsinri assured the Chinese side that Thailand 
will uphold the "one-China" policy. He said Thailand will not 
invite Taiwan to attend the upcoming ARF meeting in Bangkok. 
So, China should not worry about a report that Taiwan would 
join the ARF meeting. China had protested when Taiwan President 
Li Teng-hui made a "holiday diplomacy" visit to Thailand during 
the Chinese New Year. 
  The informed source also told our correspondent that a 
delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress Foreign 
Affairs Committee led by its chairman, Zhu Liang, will visit 
Thailand from 15 to 21 April as guests of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee. The delegation postponed its visit to 
Thailand as a result of Li Teng-hui's visit. 
  Zhu Liang, age 70, is a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong 
Province. He led a delegation to visit Thailand in March 1989 
when he was director of the International Liaison Department of 
the CPC Central Committee. His former name was Zhou Zhiyi. He 
has relatives in Thailand. 
  Prasong told Tang Jiaxuan that China is an important 
consultative partner of ASEAN. ASEAN and China will discuss 
ways to strengthen bilateral trade and scientific cooperation 
during the 27th Annual ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting in 
Bangkok in July. 
  During the meeting, Tang Jiaxuan welcomed Thailand's 
decision 
to invite Burma to attend the upcoming annual ASEAN ministerial 
meeting as a guest of the host country. Prasong will lead a 
delegation to visit Burma in mid-April. 
  Tang Jiaxuan told Thai officials that Cambodian King Prince 
Norodom Sihanouk has recovered and was full of vigor after a 
period of recuperation in Beijing. Regarding problems in 
Cambodia, China hopes that all Cambodian factions will follow 
Prince Norodom Sihanouk's instruction and achieve national 
reconciliation. 
  Regarding the Korean peninsula situation, Tang Jiaxuan said 
China wanted to see a nuclear free zone in the Korean peninsula. 
He also said that China did not want to see any economic 
sanctions against North Korea. China hopes that all parties 
concerned will settle the Korean issue through dialogue. 
  Tang Jiaxuan said that he knew nothing about a report from 
Seoul that China will send a delegation to Pyongyang to discuss 
the Korean nuclear issue. 
  Discussing bilateral issues, the Thai and Chinese officials 
expressed their satisfaction over their cooperation in all 
fields and the exchanges of visits in the past 19 years after 
the establishment of diplomatic relations. The two sides agreed 
to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in trade, tourism, 
and science and technology. The Thai side hoped that Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin will pay an official visit to Thailand 
this year. 
  The Buddhist relics preserved in Chinese ancient capital 
Xian, will be shipped to Bangkok to be exhibited on the occasion 
of the birthday of His Majesty King Phumiphon on 5 December this 
year. The Thai side hoped that this exhibition can be extended 
till the auspicious 50th anniversary of the present reign of His 
Majesty the King.

  [Text] Australia's prime minister Paul Keating has 
rejected a call to highlight the role of Australian war veterans 
during his visit to Vietnam. In Thailand yesterday, Mr. Keating 
visited the graves of Australians who died working on the 
Thai-Burma railway during the second world war. National Party 
leader Tim Fisher has now urged Mr. Keating to make a similar 
gesture in Vietnam. However, as political correspondent Graeme 
Well reports, Mr. Keating said he'll be keeping the focus of his 
visit to economic development. 
  [Begin recording] [Well] Human rights is a sensitive issue 
for Vietnam and Mr. Keating is expected to raise it. He said an 
Australian delegation will be visiting Vietnam to assess human 
rights. But before leaving Bangkok for Hanoi, Mr. Keating 
played the issue down. 
  [Keating] There is no one particular matter that comes to my 
mind at the moment. So are we engaging the... [pause] I mean... 
I think the important thing about the visit to Vietnam is that 
I'll be the first Australian prime minister to have gone 
there.... 
  [Well] Mr. Keating says he wants to make certain Australia 
is involved in Vietnam's development. [end recording]

  [Text] The missing third secretary of the Russian Embassy, 
Igor Makeyev, is reportedly no longer in Thailand but police do 
not know where he is taking refuge, Deputy Police Director 
General Pol. Gen. [Police General] Phong-ammat Amattayakun said 
yesterday. 
  He said that police had unearthed no trace of Mr Makeyev's 
whereabouts. 
  He also insisted that Immigration Department officials could 
not find any record of the Russian diplomat having left the 
country. 
  Pol. Gen. Phong-ammat said Mr Makeyev's name did not appear 
on the list of foreigners who had passed though Thailand's 
Immigration checkpoints. 
  A report from Russia's Tass news agency said Mr Makeyev had 
emerged in the United States but other details were not 
available. 
  Meanwhile immigration officials at Don Muang airport said 
they would stop issuing visas to the citizens of certain nations 
who apply for entry visas at Don Muang, but refused to name the 
countries. 
  A high-ranking official said the measures were designed to 
prevent some ill-intentioned foreigners from carrying out acts 
of sabotage in Thailand. 
  Pol. Gen. Phong-ammat said Thailand last year had relaxed 
the 
process of issuing visas at Don Muang airport to promote tourism 
but this would have to change in line with the world situation.

  [Text] Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon received Feng 
Zhicheng, managing director of the China International Trade 
Center; Li Hetian; and Zhang Liexiong at the Landmark Hotel on 
Sukhumwit Road yesterday morning. The three Chinese officials 
are in Bangkok to attend an Asia-Pacific meeting. During the 
talks, the two sides exchanged views on efforts to strengthen 
friendly cooperation between Thailand and China and to expand 
bilateral trade relations. 
  Commerce Minister Uthai said that during his recent visit to 
China, he was very happy to see the great progress made during 
the past 10 years. This was his third visit to China since he 
paid his first visit 10 year ago. He said that China has made 
rapid progress and achieved fast economic development and that 
Thailand and China should expand direct economic and trade 
cooperation. 
  Uthai said that China is a big market. Currently, China 
imports Thai fruits through Hong Kong. But communications are 
easier now and there are direct flights between the two 
countries. Thai mangos, durians, papayas, and pomelos can be 
exported to China through direct air links. 
  Uthai said that he will attend an international trade 
meeting 
in Mexico in a few days and will meet Wu Yi, Chinese minister of 
foreign trade and economic cooperation, to discuss ways to 
strengthen bilateral trade. 
  Feng Zhicheng said that he would convey Uthai's message to 
the Chinese minister when he returns home.

  [Text] Bangkok -- Thailand has affirmed the liberalization 
of the kingdom's money market, but there will be some limitation 
on foreign banks operating as Bangkok International Banking 
Facilities [BIBF], said Tharin Nimmanhemin, Finance Minister. 
  Tharin said he will affirm the proposals at the coming GATT 
meeting to be held in Morocco on April 12-15. Foreign banks 
will be allowed to open only 5 branches in 1997 as BIBFs in 
Thailand, Tharin said. Tharin said the GATT talk will seek 
agreement on trade issues which could not be resolved in the 
last meeting. He said as a representative of Thailand he will 
confirm the same proposals which were raised in the last GATT 
meeting. The minister disclosed Thailand will allow some part 
of the monetary market to be open to foreign banks. 
  Tharin said Thailand will allow foreign banks to open only 
five branches to conduct BIBF business in the country within 
1997 and will specify the commercial banks which will benefit 
Thailand most. 
  Apart from that, the Finance Ministry will consider the 
relaxation of some regulations used for foreign commercial 
banks, such as the regulations for services. 
  For instance, foreign commercial banks will be allowed to 
install ATMs, and given the right to form joint-ventures with 
Thai companies in the businesses of financial and securities 
companies. 
  "I believe that we will be the one country to propose the 
free monetary market most at the GATT meeting in Morocco and the 
proposals are larger than the limitation of GATT on the issue," 
Tharin said.

  [Text] Chief Justice Yong Pung How has released his written 
judgment for dismissing the appeal by American student Michael 
Fay. The chief justice noted the appeal had rested on two 
grounds. The first ground of appeal is that the district judge 
erred in deciding that paint was regarded as an indelible 
substance under the Vandalism Act. Chief Justice Yong said the 
act indicates plainly the parliament's intention that all acts 
of vandalism committed with paint be punished with caning. 
There is no evidence anywhere to subject all such acts of 
vandalism to this sort of test of indelibility, which Fay's 
counsel had suggested. 
  The chief justice said the law clearly states an act of 
vandalism committed with paint, whether with one type or 
another, attracts a mandatory minimum of three strokes of the 
cane. 
  On the second ground of appeal, Fay's counsel had said the 
district judge should have called for pre-sentence probation 
report. Chief Justice Yong said the court had been given the 
discretion to decide rehabilitation for young offenders when 
balancing the concerns of society. He is satisfied the district 
judge had fully considered all mitigating factors listed by 
Fay's counsel, including his youth and plea of guilt.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "APEC and Indonesia's Bargaining Power"] </F>
  [Text] It looks like the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) will be just a forum for consultations and exchanges of 
information, experience, and ideas on economic activities in the 
region. This was reflected in the ASEAN countries' economic 
vision at the end of the APEC finance ministers meeting at 
Kahala Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii 16 to 18 March. The APEC forum 
was also attended by ASEAN finance ministers. Indonesian 
Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammad told newsmen that ASEAN member 
countries remain committed to strengthening their own formal 
regional cooperation. He said that the ASEAN finance ministers 
discussed not only issues concerning APEC, but also ASEAN's 
financial needs. 
  However, developing countries like Indonesia had a stronger 
bargaining power at the limited APEC forum. According to Dr. 
Budiono, a member of the Indonesian delegation, Indonesia's and 
Malaysia's views had a strong bearing at the APEC forum, but 
their views are not likely to have any influence in 
international forums such as GATT meetings. 
  The APEC finance ministers meeting in Honolulu, which was a 
follow up to the summit held in Seattle in November 1993, was 
actually an informal meeting for participants to exchange ideas 
and information. A similar ministerial-level meeting will be 
held in Indonesia this year. 
  One of the causes that led to the formation of APEC several 
years ago was the doubt that the impasse in the Uruguay Round of 
multilateral trade negotiations could be broken. Now that the 
Uruguay Round has reached a successful conclusion, APEC hopes 
that the agreements reached at the Uruguay Round of GATT trade 
talks will be observed and implemented. 
  The APEC forum hopes that various kinds of protectionism 
imposed on goods will be lessened, considering that the 
international market is now moving towards trade liberalization 
in line with the agreements concluded at the GATT talks. Any 
form of protectionism imposed on Indonesian goods will increase 
their production costs and this will in turn weaken their 
competitiveness in the international market. Currently, almost 
all countries are racing to step up the competitiveness of their 
goods as a means of wooing foreign investment. For this, they 
prefer to reduce complicated bureaucratic procedures because 
they will turn away investors as well. 
  Indonesia could take advantage of the APEC finance ministers 
forum so that the rules governing foreign investment in the 
country will be observed by member countries. Even though it is 
difficult to impose sanctions against the countries that violate 
the rules, those belonging to APEC are still bound to respect 
them. 
  The trade dispute between the United State and Japan and 
their different economic interests also highlighted the APEC 
forum in Hawaii. It is common knowledge that the two countries 
contribute 80 percent of the total industrial waste found in 
this region, while their export products dominate more than half 
of the world trade. 
  In this regard, will the continued economic dispute between 
the United States and Japan make APEC less significant? 
Indonesia could have played a mediator's role at the recent 
APEC forum. However, it appears that this is not going to be an 
easy task because the two conflicting parties are still sticking 
strongly to their stance on world trade and it is difficult to 
help them reach a consensus. 
  It seems that we still need time before reaching regional 
cooperation on the basis of a need for a coalition to renew the 
trading system and promote multilateral economic cooperation in 
the Asia-Pacific region. The term "Pacific Age" has long been 
mentioned in articles and reports written by academics as an 
attempt to show that the world center is shifting from the 
Atlantic to the Asia- Pacific region. 
  However, in reality, attention to the implications of the 
global economy, which is marked by increasingly stiff 
competition and protectionism, has lessened the need to 
institutionalize the APEC forum. Therefore, it is better to 
take a more realistic approach to respecting the diversity of 
the region.

<F P=106> ["Dirty Conspiracy of Master and Stooge"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The abortion of the 
third round of the DPRK-USA talks and the creation of a grave 
situation on the Korean peninsula are a result of the filthy 
conspiracy between the U.S. master trying to stifle the 
socialism of Korea and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique who are 
courting the favor of the master and attempting to slay fellow 
countrymen with his help, says NODONG SINMUN in a commentary 
today. 
  The news analyst notes: 
  In return for its "commitment" to the "security" of South 
Korea from "nuclear threat of the North," the United States 
forced the puppets to open the South Korean rice market, bear 
heavier burden for the maintenance of the U.S. troops in South 
Korea and introduce Patriot missiles and other weapons in larger 
quantities. 
  Accepting all the demands of the United States, the South 
Korean puppets sold off the dignity and interests of the nation 
to the master. They made no bones about committing such 
flunkeyist treacheries as entreating the master to set the 
exchange of special envoys between the two halves of Korea as a 
precondition for the third-round of DPRK-USA talks in an attempt 
to meddle in the "nuclear problem" without any power and 
capacity. 
  The abortion of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks and 
the 
creation of a grave situation on the Korean peninsula are 
entirely attributable to such disgusting conspiracy between the 
United States and the South Korean puppet clique. 
  If the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula is to be 
solved and the strained situation is to be eased today, an end 
must be put to the U.S. hostile policy to stifle Korea, and such 
a flunkeyist traitor as Kim Yong-sam must be removed from the 
power and their criminal tieup be smashed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Kim Ho-sam: "The U.S. Scheme for Provoking a </F>
Korean War Is More Conspicuous Than Ever"] 
  [Text] According to a foreign press report, U.S. Defense 
Secretary Perry said in an NBC television interview on 3 April 
that if the situation in the Korean peninsula does not change in 
six more months, the United States would consider its so-called 
diplomatic approach has failed and hinted that they would move 
in the direction of imposing heavy pressure, including economic 
sanctions. Then he added that he would not preclude the 
possibility of a preemptive military attack if their diplomatic 
and nonmilitary pressure proves unsuccessful. 
  This bellicose outburst by the incumbent U.S. defense 
secretary is very out of the ordinary, and we must regard it as 
grave. Perry's provocative outburst coupled with his recent 
remark that they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war, 
shows that the U.S. imperialists are attempting to provoke a new 
war in Korea any time they choose. 
  This bellicose violent remark was not made accidentally. 
Although the United States has raved that it is interested in 
the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, this is false, judging by 
the violent war remarks made recently by the U.S. military 
leader. Perry's remarks also show that the United States has 
only been scheming for a policy of crushing [apsal] the DPRK by 
force. 
  Let me take a few instances. According to a recent 
WASHINGTON POST issue, war fanatic Perry, babbling about our 
so-called nuclear development, said that the United States would 
stop our so-called nuclear weapons development even if it had to 
pay the price of starting a war on the Korean peninsula again. 
Saying that the U.S. strategy is taking step-by-step measures 
while isolating North Korea, he stated that the United States 
would take more serious measures. 
  Perry also disclosed that the parts and maintenance 
personnel 
of the U.S. forces' fighter planes are being dispatched to the 
military bases in South Korea and Japan, that the South Korean 
puppets are being prepared with some kind of weapon, and that 
preparations are underway to deploy to South Korea the second 
lot of launching pads for Patriot missiles. Moreover, he 
unhesitatingly and undisguisedly made violent remarks of war 
that the United States will deal an overwhelming air strike 
against someone else's provocation within 24 hours. 
  What should be noted seriously is that he openly disclosed 
that he will have in-depth talks with the South Korean puppets 
during his forthcoming junket to South Korea on not only simple 
military countermeasures but also on when, how, and why the 
military measures should be taken. Perry's remark shows that he 
himself undisguisedly disclosed that the purpose of his visit is 
examining the preparations for the Korean war on the spot and 
giving a new war order. Worse still, this time he once again 
raved that he would not preclude the possibility of a preemptive 
military attack. This vividly shows that they attempt to crush 
our republic through a surprise armed attack. The military moves 
perpetrated around the Korean peninsula clearly prove this. 
  After a spokesman of our country's Foreign Ministry on 4 
April issued a statement rebuffing the so-called 31 March UN 
Security Council president's statement urging us to accept an 
additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, 
the imperialists' attempts to crush us militarily are all the 
more stepped up. 
  First of all, extremely bustling moves are being perpetrated 
in Japan. In a U.S. Air Force base in Yokota, the U.S. 
imperialists' countless warplanes are preparing to make a sally 
while assuming a posture for offense and defense, simulating 
attacks on our Republic. Furthermore, the United States and the 
South Korean puppets are staging joint aerial war exercises 
against us in South Korea almost every day. The number of 
planes that have taken part in the daily exercise have totalled 
700 on the average. Warplanes of various types brought in from 
overseas to South Korea are aimed at increasing their 
capabilities of making a surprise attack on the North and at 
enhancing cooperation between various flying corps. 
  The extremely hazardous situation, which resembles that of 
the eve of 25 June 1950, is prevailing on the Korean peninsula 
these days. The then U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had 
inspected the 38th parallel before the outbreak of war. 
Likewise, today, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry tries to crawl 
into [kiodulda] South Korea with the same intent. 
  All these facts show that the United States is driving the 
situation on the Korean peninsula into the brink of war while 
expanding its policies aimed at crushing us in a step-by-step 
manner. However, the United States should know very well that 
this kind of policy of power would never get by to us. 
  For us, we have strong defense capabilities that could stamp 
out any aggressor in a stroke and the might of single-hearted 
unity among the party, the leader [suryong], and the people. 
  The U.S. imperialists should squarely see the power of our 
single-hearted unity, the invincible faith, and the steel-like 
will, and not run amok recklessly. Only death will be given to 
those who play with fire.

  [Text] This is just-in news. According to Seoul radio 
reports, today, approximately 30,000 members of the National 
Federation of General Student Councils, who are students of 
approximately 130 South Korean universities, held meetings to 
express their resolve to stop the National Assembly from 
ratifying the treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique's opening of the 
agricultural market and waged demonstration struggles. They 
also jointly boycotted class [tongmaeng hyuhak]. 
  In Seoul, students of approximately 20 universities, 
including Korea and Hanyang Universities, held meetings to 
express their resolve and sternly denounced the puppet Kim 
Yong-sam clique for a nation-selling treacherous act. 
  The students denounced that the final implementation plan to 
open the agricultural market, which the Kim Yong-sam ring had 
presented to the GATT, resulted from its full acceptance of the 
U.S. brigandish demand [kangdojok yogu] and strongly demanded 
the withdrawal of the plan and the renegotiation of the Uruguay 
Round [UR]. 
  After the meetings, the students took to the streets and 
waged demonstration struggles. The demonstrators repeatedly 
chanted slogans such as "Let us stop the National Assembly from 
ratifying the opening of the agricultural market!" 
  The nation-selling treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique sent 
approximately 20,000 combat policemen of approximately 170 
companies to Seoul streets to suppress the students. However, 
the students defiantly continued their struggles. 
  Radio reports also say that university students, who are 
members of the National Federation of General Student Councils, 
joined in struggles in Pusan and various other regional cities.

Joint Technical Team] 
  [Text] Implementing the humanitarian policy of Lao 
People's Democratic Republic [LPDR] Government, between 9 March 
and 3 April 1993, the Lao-American Joint Technical Team jointly 
carried out an operation in Houa Phan and Xieng Khouang 
provinces. During the joint operation, technicians from both 
sides conducted excavations at four points: points 0079 and 0690 
in Viangsai District, Houa Phan Province, and point 1452 in Kham 
District and point 1482 in Pek District, Xieng Khouang Province. 
In addition to the excavations, the technical team investigated 
23 plane crash cases in various districts in these two provinces. 
  Along with the site surveys and excavations, Lao technicians 
led their U.S. counterparts to find out about American nationals 
whom the U.S. side believes to be still alive in Viangsai 
District and Phoupha area, Houa Phan Province, and at Ban 
village and Het District, Xieng Khouang Province. The 
investigation was made at the request of the U.S. side, and is 
aimed at helping the families of American MIA's and the U.S. 
Government answer questions about whether there are still 
Americans alive in the LPDR. 
  NBC and ABC television reporters accompanied the technical 
team during these joint operations to collect news and observe 
the cooperation between the two sides. 
  This is the fourth joint Lao-U.S. operation carried out in 
the 1994 fiscal year. The results of this operation has been 
considerably good. The U.S. has highly appraised the 
achievements of the operation. It has also expressed its 
appreciation to the Lao Government and people for their good 
cooperation and flexibility, despite the fact that up to this 
fiscal year the U.S. has not given any humanitarian aid to 
Laos, which has all along fulfilled its obligations effectively.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What On Earth Does the Remark on `North </F>
Korea's Possession of One or Two Nuclear Weapons' Mean?"] 
  [Text] We have been concerned about the government's 
inconsistent countermeasures in coping with the North Korean 
nuclear issue, and now we have come to harbor the suspicion that 
the United States has made some changes in its policy on the 
nuclear issue. We have repeatedly heard through authoritative 
media the report that, as the means to guarantee the nuclear 
transparency of North Korea faced the uppermost practical limit, 
the United States has decided to seek a countermeasure, with 
which it may ignore the possibility that North Korea currently 
possesses nuclear weapons. Some of the U.S. conservatives even 
suggested that the ROK and other countries be allowed 
small-scale nuclear armaments as a countermove against the 
possible possession of nuclear weapons by North Korea. 
  Last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that "I will 
not allow North Korea to develop nuclear weapons." U.S. Defense 
Secretary Perry, however, lately said that "What we can do now 
is to deter North Korea from producing any more nuclear 
weapons." The phrase "any more" in Secretary Perry's remark is 
noteworthy. It is natural for us to be concerned about the 
possibility of very serious changes in the situation since our 
aim is the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. If the 
situation is actually changing seriously, we must not be puzzled 
now with the phrase that "there is no clear evidence to prove 
that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons." 
  A more difficult task has been added to our policy which is 
solely based on the assumption of North Korea's nuclear 
transparency. Even if North Korea had one or two nuclear 
weapons, this could not be a threat to the United States. The 
United States would only have an additional burden in the 
international nuclear management. However, we are in a 
different situation. We are the direct object of North Korea's 
nuclear threat. It is clear that our military position would be 
weakened. In addition, if North Korea uses nuclear weapons as a 
means of force, not as a trump card, we would unavoidably be 
driven into a defensive position in South-North relations and in 
other international arenas. 
  It would be too late if we tried to seek a countermeasure 
when the United States comes to have interest only in "any more" 
production of nuclear weapons by North Korea after admitting it 
possesses nuclear weapons. We still hope for the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, but we cannot adhere 
to it even in case the hope is stifled by North Korea. We 
should return to the "no confirm, no deny" policy toward the 
nuclear problem or further strengthen the international 
cooperation system. In any case, we should assume a 
peace-guaranteeing policy. 
  With regard to the North Korean nuclear issue, the 
government 
seems to make considerable efforts only to relieve the people's 
anxiety. The government makes a wrong assumption, however, if 
it believes that the people are reassured by the government 
authorities' remarks that "there is no clear evidence that 
proves the North's nuclear weapons development" and that "there 
has been no sign of the North's military provocation." The 
level of the people's security consciousness is far beyond the 
government's expectation. When the government takes a security 
policy that the people think is reliable, it will overcome 
trials caused by the North Korean nuclear issue, encouraged by 
the people's confidence, without making public relations efforts.

  [Text] Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, has 
arrived in Vietnam for last stop on an Asian tour which has also 
included Laos and Thailand. Mr. Keating is the first Australian 
leader to visit Hanoi. Tomorrow, he will hold talks with top 
Vietnamese leaders including President Le Duc Anh, the Communist 
Party General Secretary Doi Muoi, and the Prime Minister Vo Van 
Kiet. 
  Australian officials say Mr. Keating will take a low-key 
approach to human rights issues despite calls for a strong 
statement from Vietnamese Buddhist group and some Australian 
parliamentarians. The officials say they hope Vietnamese 
officials will finalize arrangement for an Australian 
parliamentary human rights delegation to visit Vietnam later 
this year, but diplomats say the visit will concentrate on 
expanding economic links with Vietnam. Australia is currently 
the third largest investor in Vietnam taking $620 million 
[currency not further specified], mostly for oil and 
telecommunications projects. Two-way trade last year was worth 
$366 million with Vietnam running up a $136 million surplus 
through crude oil sales to Australia. 
  Australia's Prime Minister Paul Keating has spent his first 
afternoon in Vietnam sightseeing in Hanoi. The formal part of 
the visit will begin in the morning with an official welcome 
before beginning talks with Vietnamese leaders. Graeme Well 
reports Mr. Keating's main purpose in going to Vietnam is to 
assess the potential for economic development and what further 
role Australia can play. 
  [Begin recording] [Well] Mr. Keating says Vietnam has a 
great opportunity to develop and he believes Australia can help 
make a difference in areas like aid programs, education, social 
policies, and commerce. Responding to a call for him to change 
his itinerary to acknowledge Australians who died in the Vietnam 
War, Mr. Keating said he does not discriminate in commemorating 
Australia's war dead. He repeated comments he made last year at 
the opening of the Vietnam Memorial in Canberra. 
  [Keating in progress] ...[Words indistinct] same faith in 
Australia and the same belief in our values as every other 
service person did in other (?theaters) of the war. But 
again.... This in Hanoi and, really, in places I am visiting 
there is no natural opportunity as there was in Thailand. [end

  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news

  [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- Japanese Government envoy 
Nobuo Matsunaga left for Morocco on Monday night to attend a 
ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT), officials said. 
  The government decided earlier Monday to send Matsunaga, the 
trade representative for external affairs, to Marrakech for the 
signing of a new global trade pact concluded under GATT. 
  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said the 
government is still considering sending Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata to Morocco for talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor on the possible resumption of stalled bilateral trade 
negotiations. 
  Takemura said the government wants to reach a quick decision 
on whether Hata should be in Marrakech at least on Friday, the 
final day of the four-day GATT meeting. 
  Hata, however, may not be able to undertake the trip amid 
the 
domestic political turmoil triggered by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's decision to step down. 
  Matsunaga will also attend a quadilateral meeting of Japan, 
the United States, Canada and the European Union, expected on 
Wednesday, and will deliver a speech at the GATT meeting on 
Thursday if Hata is unable to go to Morocco, Vice Foreign 
Minister Kunihiko Saito said. 
  Saito also indicated that Matsunaga will meet Kantor in case 
Hata is unable to go to Morocco.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Asia should pressure US to impose gun control"] </F>
  [Text] As the Marrakech talks on the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) approach, developing countries are 
becoming increasingly anxious. Many of their governments, 
including Thailand's, fear the negotiations and the planned 
creation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) will be used to 
pressure them into adopting labour, human rights and 
environmental standards they consider inappropriate. 
  Their main fear is that any such move will damage their 
economic competitiveness. Businesses in developing countries 
often depend on cheap labour and lax environmental and labour 
standards to keep their costs down, and their products cheap. 
They see the move by the West to impose higher standards as a 
sneaky way to protect its own industries. 
  They have a point. Protectionism is on the rise in the 
developed world. But this is not the entire story. 
<H5>  National sovereignty </H5>
  Many consumers in the West are genuinely concerned that they 
are purchasing products made at the expense of the environment 
or the health of indigenous people (although they like cheap 
products, too). In their own countries, they may have some say 
over how such matters are protected, but the origin of imported 
goods is usually a mystery. Hence another reason to push for 
stricter enforcement of regulations abroad. 
  Governments in developing countries have responded by 
complaining that their national sovereignty is being impinged. 
But such talk will no longer do. "Free" trade is not really 
free, it comes with a price. 
  Businesses appear eager to have their cake and eat it, too. 
They want easy access to lucrative markets abroad but don't 
want to face up to the realities which closer trade links 
entail. Breaking down economic barriers inevitably means 
breaking down political and social ones, too. 
  The European Union has recognized this. Its leaders realize 
that economic union cannot be carried out without some kind of 
political union. Nor would the North American Free Trade 
Agreement have passed in the US without the side agreements on 
labour and the environment. 
  With this in mind, we must all pay very close attention to 
how the World Trade Organization develops. As Gatt expands and 
deepens, the WTO could well form the beginnings of a kind of 
world government, one which could conceivably gain greater 
powers than the United Nations. 
  As it stands, the WTO is not terribly accountable. Its 
representatives are appointed by governments and bureaucrats. 
It should be democratized, perhaps by creating a sister 
organization whose members are elected directly by the people, 
as with the European Parliament. 
  Our government should certainly continue defending our right 
to make our own decisions. But sooner or later, all the 
countries which sign the Gatt -- or any free trade agreement, 
including Afta [ASEAN Free Trade Area] -- will have to realize 
that acceding to the treaty will mean sacrificing national 
sovereignty on some issues. If we don't like it, then we 
shouldn't sign. 
  Of course, compromise must cut both ways. The US may well be 
justified in demanding, say, that Japan and Norway halt their 
whaling activities or that China stop using prison labour. But 
we in Asia also have a right to examine America's internal 
affairs. 
  One point which stands out is the widespread availability of 
guns in the US. Many Americans seem to believe they have a 
God-given, or at least a constitutionally ordained, right to own 
a deadly weapon. Some might say this is their own business. But 
it affects us in Asia, too. 
<H5>  Japanese students </H5>
  The latest instance was the case of two Japanese students 
gunned down in a Los Angeles [LA] parking lot. The incident 
created a public uproar in Japan, so much so the US ambassador 
felt the need to officially apologize on behalf of the United 
States government. The Japanese should consider themselves 
lucky; the US government rarely apologizes to governments of 
other foreigners gunned down in the States -- although it did 
express regret when Thai monks were murdered in Arizona several 
years ago -- much less to its own people for allowing weapons to 
be so easily available. 
  This is not the only way in which America's gun policy, or 
lack thereof, has affected foreigners. The gun used to 
assassinate Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio 
was traced back to LA. Who knows how many guns are bought in 
the States and then exported for murder abroad? Defenders of 
the United States' liberal gun laws say that gun control won't 
work, that it will only affect law-abiding citizens. But that's 
because it has barely been tried. The US government is too 
easily swayed by powerful anti-gun-control lobbies. Asian 
countries would be doing Americans and the world a favour by 
pushing for stronger weapons laws in the States. 
  This is just one example to show that many issues are no 
longer simply national in scope, but made international with the 
advent of ever freer trade. Rather than fighting the trend 
towards greater regulatory cooperation, we should try to work 
with it.

  [Excerpt] Phnom Penh, April 12 (AFP) -- Unidentified gunmen 
abducted two Britons and an Australian travelling in a taxi from 
Phnom Penh to the port town of Sihanoukville, British embassy 
officials said Tuesday. 
  "The car was stopped around 5.30 p.m. by armed gunmen, they 
were taken out of the car and ordered into the bush," an embassy 
official said. 
  The taxi driver was then ordered to drive on, he said. 
  The three, who were only identified as a male and female 
from 
Britain and a woman from Australia, were abducted near Sre Ambel 
about 130 kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital, the 
official said. 
  The embassy official refused to call the incident a 
kidnapping. 
  "No ransom has been demanded and there is no reason to 
believe one will be," he said. 
  A local police officer told AFP by telephone that he 
believed 
the Khmer Rouge were responsible. 
  "If it was government soldiers they would just ask for money 
or cigarettes," the officer said. 
  The embassy official said two of the three abducted were 
residents here and one was a tourist. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement by Hun Sen, second prime minister of Cambodia, in </F>
Pailin; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Summary from poor reception] Now, I wish to speak to the 
goal of attacking and controlling Pailin. The Royal Government 
of Cambodia [RGC] has no intention whatsoever of continuing the 
war. I will support Samdech Krompreah [Norodom Ranariddh] in his 
efforts to implement our king's initiative to woo the Khmer 
Rouge into settling the problem peacefully. Since all manner of 
attempts and all (?discussions) between Samdech Krompreah and 
H.E. Khieu Samphan have failed, however, and since the people 
and the KRAF [Khmer Royal Armed Forces] have continued to suffer 
from further attacks, Samdech Krompreah and I have decided to 
launch the attacks to take control of Anlung Veng, Pailin, An 
Seh, and other areas. If we do not destroy the bases in Pailin 
and Anlung Veng and other places, the Cambodian people can never 
live in peace. This is because the Khmer Rouge have used all 
those bases to attack them and the KRAF. 
  I would also like to say that the RGC is duty-bound to 
implement Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates 
clearly that the Kingdom of Cambodia is an indivisible state. 
We have the task of controlling Cambodia totally, according to 
the Constitution. We have resorted to offensives only after the 
talks between Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and the Khmer 
Rouge became unproductive. We can no longer let Cambodia remain 
divided. According to the Constitution, the royal government 
has to control the entire kingdom. Therefore, the attacks on 
Anlung Veng, Pailin, or other places do not constitute a 
violation of anybody's territory or border. They are the tasks 
carried out by the RGC in compliance with the Constitution. 
Moreover, our policy is to use military measures to enter into 
a political dialogue. 
  Samdech Krompreah and I are of the same opinion that if the 
Khmer Rouge continue to enjoy their military, economic, 
political, psychological, and diplomatic support, its leaders 
will not soften their political stances, no matter what. So the 
attack on Pailin is to isolate the Khmer Rouge and to soften its 
political stance while the government leaves the door open for 
political dialogue to achieve national reconciliation. 
  We continue to implement, not just accept, His Majesty's 
initiative. The Khmer Rouge has to fulfill the three necessary 
tasks while the royal government implements the two others. 
First, the Khmer Rouge has to stop firing on and destroying 
property; second, it has to surrender its troops to the royal 
government; and third, it has to hand over the regions under its 
control to the government. As for the government, it should 
fulfill two tasks: first, it should agree to include the Khmer 
Rouge troops in the KRAF; second, it should allow acceptable 
Khmer Rouge personages to hold some ministerial or advisory 
posts. 
  Samdech Krompreah and I are prepared to hold political 
discussion with H.E. [His Excellency] Khieu Samphan. The RGC 
wants to cease hostilities in compliance with His Majesty's 
initiative. Especially on this new year occasion, we want to 
have an unconditional and general cease-fire throughout the 
Kingdom of Cambodia so as to allow people to enjoy the new year 
celebration. The KRAF, police, and people, as well as the Khmer 
Rouge troops, all want to be happy on this occasion. If 
Democratic Kampuchea agrees to a general cease- fire, the KRAF 
have no reason whatsoever to launch attacks. Taking this 
opportunity, I would like to appeal, in case the Khmer Rouge 
leaders disagree, to the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
officers and soldiers to lay their arms aside and come in to 
enjoy popular games with the people and the KRAF. This is a 
very good opportunity for reconciliation. 
  Now, I want to talk a bit about the plan to develop Pailin. 
We have not only attacked and occupied Pailin militarily, but 
we should also develop it in line with other regions throughout 
the country. We need to transform Pailin into an administrative 
region. The RGC plans to request that the National Assembly 
authorize the designation of Pailin as a town with a structure 
equal to that of a province. The government has already set up 
a group of delegates with the duty of organizing this area as a 
development zone. 
  Taking this opportunity, I would like to appeal to the 
people 
who have been forced out of the Pailin region by the Khmer Rouge 
into Thailand or other areas to return. If they return, we will 
hand their homes or land back to them. We want to give priority 
to those forced by the Khmer Rouge to follow them. When they 
return, we will allow them to own homes legally as other people 
do. 
  [Summary from poor reception] I want to talk a bit about 
relations with Thailand. Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, 
deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, presented 
this issue to the Kingdom of Thailand on 8 April. As for 
myself, I will make an urgent visit to Bangkok on 16 April. 
That will be an urgent working visit to solve not only the 
Cambodian-Thai border problem at Pailin, but also the issue of 
security along the common border. I wish to emphasize that 
while I am there, I will not discuss the issue of establishing 
the boundary between the two countries because the 
Thai-Cambodian border, except for the maritime border, has been 
recognized since His Majesty's Sangkum Reas Niyum era. There 
have already been maps and proper arrangements. The purpose of 
my next trip is to settle the problems between Thailand and 
Cambodia concerning the control of the security situation and 
the relations of good neighborliness. This is to turn the 
common border into a border of peace, friendship, and 
cooperation. I will first make clear with the Kingdom of 
Thailand that the Khmer Rouge office near the Royal Palace in 
Phnom Penh does not mean that Cambodia is separated into two 
different countries. Some Thai leaders have said that the Khmer 
Rouge has not been outlawed yet because its representatives are 
still in Phnom Penh. I would like to underline that legally, 
there is only the royal government, which is the result of the 
UN-sponsored elections that the royal Thai government has 
already recognized. There is no other legitimate force on 
Cambodian soil other than the RGC. As for the Khmer Rouge 
office in Phnom Penh, it only represents a political liaison 
among Cambodians. This issue is purely an internal affair. The 
RGC also wants to keep dialogue through the Phnom Penh Khmer 
Rouge office with the aim of seeking a political solution. 
Nonetheless, we would like to specify to the entire world not 
to consider the Khmer Rouge office in Phnom Penh proof of 
Cambodia's division into two. This is the first point I want to 
clarify to my counterpart in Bangkok. 
  Second, we want to implement the Cambodian Government 
statement that all contracts previously concluded by Thai 
companies with the Khmer Rouge will be recognized. I will urge 
those companies to do business with the RGC, because the trade 
will have a bright future and be legal. The RGC will not 
tolerate any violation of Cambodian laws, policy, or economy. 
  I hope that my statement will not (?upset) the Thai side. 
This is done with the intention of settling problems and 
avoiding creation of new ones, and is also forewords to Bangkok. 
Anyway, we still have a lot of problems to discuss if the visit 
is to take place after this new year celebration.

<F P=106> [7 April PASASON editorial: "New Step for Lao-Australian </F>
Relations and Cooperation"] 
  [Text] By an invitation from His Excellency [H.E.] Khamtai 
Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's Democratic 
Republic [LPDR], H.E. Paul Keating, prime minister of the 
Commonwealth of Australia, led a government delegation to pay an 
official, friendly visit to the LPDR from 5 to 6 April. During 
the visit, H.E. Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating and his 
delegation were accorded a warm welcome by H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon and the multiethnic Lao people. H.E. Paul 
Keating and the delegation paid a courtesy call on H.E. Nouhak 
Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR, in an atmosphere of warm 
friendship. It was considered a very significant event in the 
history of good relations between Laos and Australia. 
  An official consultative meeting to exchange views between 
H.E. Khamtai Siphandon and H.E. Paul Keating was held at the 
Prime Minister's Office in Vientiane in an atmosphere of 
profound friendship and mutual understanding. During the 
meeting, the two prime ministers informed each other about the 
domestic situation as well as lines and policies in their 
respective countries, the lines and policies which serve as a 
firm basis for effectively strengthening cooperation for the 
benefit of the peoples of Laos and Australia, thus contributing 
to the common trend of establishing and promoting peace, 
stability, friendship, and cooperation among various countries 
in the region and the rest of the world. 
  Noteworthy is that following the consultative meeting, the 
two sides reached an agreement on investment promotion and 
protection between the two countries. This agreement is 
considered an important basis for improving cooperation between 
the Lao and Australian peoples to a new level -- a level which 
will bring about ever greater benefits for the two countries. 
Following the meeting, the Australian Government pledged to 
continue its support and assistance to Laos. Regarding this, 
beginning in 1994, the Australian Government will establish a 
47.5 million Australian dollar four-year aid project for Laos. 
In addition, the Australian Government has decided to give, 
through the WHO, gratis aid in the form of food worth one 
million Australian dollars to Laos. It will also continue to 
support and encourage more and more Australian businessmen to 
invest in the LPDR. 
  During the visit, H.E. Paul Keating also attended the hand 
over ceremony of the Border Control Station at the Lao-Thai 
Friendship Bridge, which was built with gratis financial aid 
from the Australian Government and people as a gift to the LPDR. 
The assistance given to the LPDR by the Australian Government 
and people in building the Border Control Station as well as the 
Friendship Bridge and other projects in the recent past has 
substantially reflected the long-standing relations of 
friendship between Laos and Australia, which have fruitfully 
developed with each passing day. 
  The multiethnic Lao people highly assess the effective 
assistance in various fields given by Australia, and consider it 
an important contribution to the development of economic 
infrastructure for the LPDR. The multiethnic Lao people also 
would like to wholeheartedly hail the glorious success of H.E. 
Paul Keating and delegation on their visit to the LPDR, a visit 
which will contribute to further strengthening the already 
effective friendly relations and cooperation between Laos and 
Australia for the benefit of the Lao and Australian people as 
well as in the interests of peace, stability, friendship, and 
cooperation for the development in Asia-Pacific and the rest of 
the world.

  [Text] His Majesty the King yesterday urged Thais living 
in Laos to view the Friendship Bridge as a symbol to mark the 
start of a new era of relations and friendship between Thailand 
and Laos and their people. He warned that relations between the 
two countries would deteriorate as in the past if his advice was 
not heeded. 
  "I visited Laos this time through the Friendship Bridge. I 
would like the bridge to be the start of a new era of your 
performance and the new era of relations between Thailand and 
Laos," His Majesty told 200 Thais who were granted an audience 
before he left for Bangkok at the end of his two-day visit to 
Laos, his first foreign visit in almost 30 years. 
  On their performance, His Majesty referred to the duty of 
all 
Thais to do their best to carry out their work as 
representatives of Thailand. This was his first remark on the 
bridge since he jointly presided over its formal opening with 
Laotian President Nouhak Phoumsavan on Friday. Most of the 200 
Thais granted an audience by His Majesty were businessmen and 
industrialists. 
  He told them their performance, which impresses Laotian 
officials and people, would enhance peace and security between 
the two countries. "If you do as suggested, you will be 
regarded as fulfilling your duty as a Thai," he said. 
  "A detrimental performance will jeopardise peace and 
friendship between the two countries and will finally lead to a 
situation that you are unable to stay in this country," the King 
stressed. 
  Good relations between the two peoples would pave the way 
for 
more Thais to visit Laos, he said. 
  "Everybody here, regardless of your differences in 
background 
and objectives, must bear in mind a duty to promote friendship, 
to perform to impress Laotian officials and people and help Laos 
wherever needed," he said and cited his royally-sponsored 
projects which aim to improve the livelihood of Laotian people. 
  "He called on Thai people in Laos to show to the world an 
example of living harmoniously and peacefully by the way they 
treat their Laotian counterparts. It will be an example to 
other regions which will be admired and which will bring about 
peace," he said. 
  His Majesty ended his visit to Laos yesterday with the 
traditional Baisi well-wishing ceremony at Hokham, the 
presidential palace. Her Majesty the Queen and Her Royal 
Highness Princess Maha Chakkri Sirinthon and the Laotian 
president as well as Mrs. Bounma also attended the ceremony. 
The royal family later proceeded to Wattai Airport for their 
journey back to Bangkok. 
  Earlier in the day, Their Majesties the King and Queen and 
the Princess visited Wat That Luang for a religious ceremony. 
They proceeded to a Royal orphanage sponsored by the Princess 
to donate sports equipment and educational materials. The 
royally sponsored orphanage is 67 kilometers north of Vientiane. 
It houses children orphaned by the war in Laos and also 
children from poor families. 
  Princess Sirinthon sponsored this project since she first 
visited Laos in March 1990. She built a new dormitory with 
donations and used her own personal funds, about 350,000 baht, 
to build another dormitory, named Sirinthon Building.

  [Text] The Bank of Thailand from yesterday suspended 
providing credits to textile and yarn products exported to the 
United States in order to boost Thailand's position in fighting 
an accusation that it dumps such goods. 
  Bank of Thailand spokesman Phisit Li-atham said yesterday 
that American industrialists claimed that Thai manufacturers of 
textile and yarn products obtained subsidies from the 
Government, enabling them to sell the goods in American markets 
at low prices. They asked the American authorities to impose 
anti-dumping duties on Thai products. 
  However, the Thais deny the claim. To improve Thai 
exporters' position in the battle, the Bank of Thailand will 
suspend providing credit for them in the form of promissory note 
discounts. 
  Dr Phisit said the suspension would not affect the exporters 
as no major companies needed such credits. Only small exporters 
that borrow from the central bank through commercial bank 
channels were affected.

  [Text] The Thai Government has promise to honour an 
agreement to buy Iranian crude oil, despite problems, and will 
bow to a demand for an increase in the supply volume. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak pledged this 
yesterday while insisting that attempts will be made to persuade 
Teheran to reduce the crude price said to be 50-60 US cents more 
than the world market price for the same crude. 
  His statement is aimed at quelling doubts that Thailand 
would 
breach terms of the Thai-Iran countertrade deal involving Thai 
rice and Iranian crude. 
  Dr Suphachai said it would be unfair for Thailand to 
dishonour the oil deal as Iran has already fulfilled its 
commitment by buying Thai rice. He stressed the importance of 
Iran as a major export market, especially at the time of market 
difficulties. 
  Teheran has already bought 412,343 tons of Thai rice as part 
of the agreement in return for the sale of Iranian crude to 
Thailand at the volume of 20,000 barrels a day (b/d). 
  Suggestions were made by some Cabinet members that Thailand 
should yield to Teheran's demand to increase the purchase volume 
of Iranian oil from the National Iranian Oil Corp (NIOC) to 
15,000 b/d against 5,000 b/d the Petroleum Authority of Thailand 
(PTT) was prepared to recelve. 
  Aside from high price, PTT, the national oil firm, has been 
reluctant to buy the Iranian crude which possesses undesirable 
high sulphur and metallic content as well as a low yield of oil 
products. 
  That results in higher refining costs and many refiners are 
not keen to accept the oil for refining. Oil refiners are also 
critical of Iran's ability to commit the delivery at an agreed 
tlme. 
  The PTT has said that two local oil refineries--operated by 
Thaioil and Bangchak Petroleum--have the capabilities to process 
the problematic crude with an extra cost of 78 million baht, 
based on the 15,000 b/d volume. 
  Commerce Minister Uthai Phimchaichon wi]l fly to Iran on 
April 18 to attempt to get a lower price for the Iranian crude 
at the level to at least cover the extra refining cost. 
  Mr Uthai has suggested that the sum be drawn from national 
coffers to compensate the PTT. 
  The minister supports his claims of the need to maintain 
Iran 
as a market for Thai rice. The volume of rice Teheran bought 
from Thailand represents 10-202000060100f total Thai rice exports.

  [Text] Thailand may elect to exclude some petrochemical 
products from AFTA [ASEAN Free Trade Area] liberalisation if 
Indonesia and Malaysia insist on doing the same said an informed 
Finance Ministry source. 
  Thailand keeps petrochemical industries under the ASEAN Free 
Trade Area normal track while Indonesia and Malaysia keep these 
industries on an exclusion list, added the source. However, 
Thailand will not include all petrochemical products in the 
exclusion list -- only locally-made products will be protected, 
he noted. 
  The source commented that Singapore stands to gain 
advantages 
over its neighbouring countries in these industries as it has 
more fully integrated its industries. The source noted that 
Singaporean products would flood the three countries if import 
taxes were diminished. 
  Malaysia has systematically developed its petrochemical 
industries while Indonesia has only six downstream petrochemical 
industries, explained the source. However, Brunei and the 
Philippines have not established petrochemical industries, noted 
the source. Thailand will keep petrochemical industries under 
an exclusion list but plans to reduce the protection period from 
eight to five years. 
  According to the source, the list of the protected items are 
ethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene, polystrylene, 
polypropylene, and propylene. The source confirmed that today's 
AFTA meeting, chaired by Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin, 
will consider this matter among other issues. 
  The studies conducted by the Ministry of Finance indicate 
that it is necessary to support the Thai petrochemical industry 
as it is a major basic industry and is only in its early 
development stages, noted the source. The source said if 
Malaysia and Indonesia accept a Ministry of Finance proposal to 
keep their petrochemical industries under the normal track, the 
Ministry would develop alternatives to help the emerging 
industries faced with a high interest rate burden. 
  The agenda for the AFTA meeting today will consider ways to 
expedite the realisation of the free trade area from 15 to 10-12 
years, to include consideration on non-processed agricultural 
products, said the source. The source conceded that 
disagreement among ASEAN members continues on the definition of 
the terms "processed" and "non-processed" goods. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak has proposed 
that Thailand withdraw some petrochemical products from the 
normal track to the exclusion list if other ASEAN countries 
decide to add their products to the exclusion list. 
  According to Dr Suphachai, if Thailand could successfully 
negotiate with the two countries to bring the petrochemical 
industries under the normal track, Thailand could accept the 
Malaysian request that it keep palm oil under the normal track. 
  Previously the Thai Government proposed to keep the 
petrochemical industry under the fast track, however, it has 
decided to keep the industry under the normal track. 
  The local production cost of the Thai industry is higher 
than 
imports regardless of upstream, intermediate or downstream 
industries. The reason cited is expensive local raw materials 
and the fact that production has not achieved economy of scale.

  [Text] A fifty-man police task force is being joined by 
Malaysian special branch police in the border hunt for six men 
believed responsible for two recent bomb attacks in Songkhla, 
the southern provincial police chief said yesterday. 
  Pol Maj Gen [Police Major General] Pricha Saengwan said the 
Malaysian police had pledged cooperation in the search for the 
suspects, who may have already sneaked into Kelantan state. 
  "We have deployed about 50 officers for the operation," said 
Pricha. "They will coordinate with our own special branch 
police and Malaysia's special branch, which operates in 
Kelantan." 
  The Songkhla governor had endorsed police warrants for the 
arrest of the six suspects, whom Pricha said have connections 
with southern Muslim separatist guerrillas. 
  "They have links with Pulo (the Pattani United Liberation 
Organization). That's all I can say, otherwise the information 
may affect the police hunt for suspects," Pricha said. 
  The suspects were believed to be responsible for a bomb 
explosion in Hat Yai's main shopping area early last month that 
injured three Thais and four foreign tourists, and a later blast 
that derailed a southern passenger train in Songkhla's Na Mom 
subdistrict. No serious injuries were reported in the 
derailment, but the sabotage triggered protests by railways 
workers and resulted in stepped-up security on the southern 
railroad. 
  Police will begin regular helicopter patrols of southern 
rail 
routes in a few days, Pricha said. 
  Pricha said it would take at least two more weeks before he 
will be able to report the progress of the joint Thai-Malaysian 
dragnet. 
  Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Michai Nukunkit, 
assistant police director general responsible for the South, 
confirmed that Malaysia's special branch chief had promised to 
help hunting down the six suspects.

  [Text] Thailand rejects a charge that it helped Khmer 
Rouge leaders to escape. 
  The Thai Government has issued an explanation denying a 
report that said Thailand helped the Khmer Rouge leaders to 
escape. The Thai Government, however, does not think the 
accusation was made by the Cambodian leaders, but rather views 
it as a misinterpretation by news agencies. 
  Relations between Thailand and Cambodia have been smooth and 
growing closer. Both countries understand and accept each 
other's stand concerning its foreign policy. Thailand, 
especially, has a clear-cut policy of recognition to the elected 
government of Cambodia, and noninterference in Cambodia's 
internal affairs. It has abstained from giving support to the 
Khmer Rouge. This policy has been emphasized by the Thai 
Government to the Cambodian Government on several occasions. 
The report accusing Thailand of helping the Khmer Rouge leaders 
to escape was utterly inaccurate. The distortion of facts might 
come from misunderstanding or misinterpretation by news 
agencies. It could also be possible that some news agencies 
wanted to destroy the good relations existing between Thailand 
and Cambodia. 
  Thailand does not want to see the close relations it has 
with 
Cambodia destroyed by just an error of news agencies that 
occurred regularly and, sometimes, inadvertently. For the sake 
of mutual understanding and to safeguard the good relations 
existing between the two countries, should there be any doubts 
about Thailand, the Cambodian Government is hereby requested to 
directly address Thailand through diplomatic channels. There is 
no need to go through a third country since Thailand and 
Cambodia have several proper channels for contact.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "It's Time-wasting Telling Burma What Press </F>
Freedom Is About"] 
  [Text] After the 1988 uprising in Burma, it was said that 
the Thai Ambassador to Rangoon was summoned to the Burmese 
Foreign Ministry and berated by a minister for something he had 
not done and had no control over -- Thai press reports of the 
Rangoon government's atrocities and persecution of its people in 
the aftermath of the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
[Slorc] takeover. 
  When the ambassador entered the office of the Burmese 
minister, the latter reportedly slammed a copy of one of 
Thailand's English-language dailies on the table before the Thai 
envoy could take a seat, and demanded: "What's the meaning of 
this? Why does your government allow the press in your country 
to publish lies about us?" 
  The Thai diplomat was stunned by such behaviour coming from 
a 
high-ranking official. He had not even had time to calmly reply 
that there is such a thing as freedom of the press in his 
country. It seems, however, the words of a Thai diplomat hold no 
water in a country where the word freedom is rivalled by its 
powerful nemesis -- imprisonment. 
  Now we hear that the Thai Foreign Ministry has invited 
Burmese Information Minister Myo Thant to Bangkok on Wednesday 
to explain the Government's policy on a free and liberal press. 
  The invitation is aimed at erasing Rangoon's doubts that the 
Government supports press criticism of the State Law and Order 
Restoration Council, according to sources in the Interior 
Ministry. The sources added that the visit will provide 
Brigadier General Myo Thant the opportunity to see that the Thai 
press has the freedom to express its opinion without Government 
control. 
  How the Government is going to do this, we do not know, but 
one thing we do know is that it will be a waste of the Thai 
Government's time, money, and energy to expect a non-believer in 
basic human rights to understand what freedom of speech means. 
  As members of the press, we strongly object to the 
Government's plans to display us like freaks in a sideshow to 
the Burmese military while at the same time pursuing a policy of 
"constructive engagement" with the so-called Burmese government, 
which has been shunned by most of the international community. 
We do not believe in the staging of a Richardson-Suu Kyi-like 
circus to try to fool the world into thinking that 
authoritarianism does not exist in Burma, when in fact it does. 
In short: Don't use the press like Khin Nyunt does, for his own 
selfish reasons. 
  If freedom of press does exist in this country, as the 
Government claims, then there is no reason to shout it for the 
rest of the world to hear, especially Burma, which is calling 
itself Myanmar and has changed its flag without the consent of 
its people. 
  The Thai press knows how much freedom it has and where to 
draw the line when reporting on events that affect national 
security or when criticising a high-ranking government or 
military official. This is called responsible journalism or 
self-censorship, depending on how one looks at it. It is said 
that the press in Thailand is the most free of all those in the 
ASEAN countries. We praise the Government for showing such a 
high degree of tolerance for the fourth estate. 
  The Rangoon government already knows the Thai press has the 
freedom to air its opinions, if and when it sees fit, without 
government control, even when criticising Burma or other 
countries. This paper has even assailed Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri's decision to invite Rangoon to attend the ASEAN 
conference in July as guest of the host country. 
  The generals in Burma also know that the press in Thailand 
has a voice of its own because it refuses to address that 
country as Myanmar and its capital as Yangon, despite the 
acquiescence of this Government and the United Nations. The 
BANGKOK POST and THE NATION have turned down repeated requests 
by the Burmese Embassy on Pan Road to stop calling its country 
Burma. We choose not to comply with their request because doing 
so would mean recognising an illegitimate government. As one 
prominent Thai editor put it: "Burma remains Burma until the 
Burmese people decide for themselves after elections whether the 
name of their country should be changed." 
  So if this Government is to invite the Burmese Information 
Minister here just to prove that there is a free press in this 
country, then it is wasting its time. It's plain stupidity to 
cast pearls before swine, or as the Burmese themselves say, to 
woo a buffalo with the melodious sounds of the harp. 
  Instead, we suggest that the invitation be extended to the 
silenced members of the Slorc-controlled media. They would 
appreciate the chance to see for themselves how their 
counterparts in Thailand practice journalism in a free society 
without interference or intimidation from the powers that be.

<F P=106> [Commentary by "Green November 32 (Burma)," a Chiang Mai </F>
University-based non-governmental organization: "In the name of 
'constructive engagement'?"] 
  [Text] A number of senior cabinet ministers including 
Foreign Minister Sqdn. Ldr. [Squadron Leader] Prasong Sunsiri, 
Democrat Party General Secretary Maj. Gen. Sanan Kachonprasat 
and PM's [Prime Minister's] Office Minister Sawit Phothiwihok 
will be going to Rangoon in the coming weeks to discuss joint 
energy development and water diversion plans with the ruling 
military junta, the State Law and Order Restoration Council 
(Slorc). 
  It is anticipated that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) 
will be signed on Thailand's buying natural gas from the Manaban 
Gasfield that is currently being developed by the multinational 
oil companies Total CFP (France) and Unocal Corp (USA). 
  These projects are evidently a major component of the Asean 
"constructive engagement" policy towards the Slorc. 
  A few points and some questions need to be pointed out and 
asked about the planned gas pipeline, the ceasefires that are 
currently being discussed between Slorc and the ethnic groups, 
security issues, the repatriation/relocation of refugees, and 
the living and labour conditions of villagers in the Ye-Tavoy 
area through which the gas pipeline will run. 
  These are issues that are very much interrelated, a fact 
that 
some parties may not like others to realize. 
  In the past two months most of the 8,000 semi-recognized Mon 
refugees who have been taking shelter in Thailand for the last 
3-4 years have been compelled by Thai authorities to move to a 
place called Halaukhani. This site is no more than 12 
kilometres from a major Slorc army base and is in even closer 
proximity to the military junta's frontline heavy weapons 
positions. 
  The Mon, Karen and many others insist that the area that the 
refugees have been sent to is clearly inside Burma, a claim 
validated by all but a few recent Thai maps. Some UNHCR 
officials have said that the site is in a "no-mans-land" on a 
"very fluid" border, while other officials accept the Thai claim 
that it is Thai territory. (Incidentally the UNHCR officials 
say that the ideal secure distance for a refugee settlement is 
around 50 kilometres from the borders.) 
  The Thai authorities have according to local sources been 
inconsistent in their claims that the site is in Thai territory 
although they are currently insistent that it is. Whatever it 
is, it is vulnerable to attack, and there are many reports in 
the papers expressing the reluctance of the Mon refugees and 
leaders about going there. The Mon have used virtually every 
form of media available to them other than coming out openly -- 
there have allegedly been personal death threats amongst other 
threats -- to make plain their concern about the lack of 
security in Halaukhani. 
  In the context of what they are convinced is a forced 
repatriation, the Mon have also made their belief very "clear 
that they are being pressured to agree to a ceasefire so that 
the (natural gas) pipeline can be built" through the Mon lands. 
  The coerced repatriation into an area where the refugees 
could be said to be as vulnerable as hostages is clearly one of 
the forms of pressure that are being brought to bear on the Mon 
leaders by Thai authorities as they begin the ceasefire 
negotiations with the notoriously treacherous Slorc regime. 
  The second round of talks between the New Mon State Party 
(NMSP) and the Slorc began in mid March, just after news reports 
stated that two Slorc battalions had been deployed in apparent 
preparation for an attack on the Mon Headquarters at Baho. 
  The talks have now been called off -- and the Mon leadership 
have more than a little justification for being concerned about 
the well- being of their kindred -- particularly the almost 
defenseless refugees at Halaukhani. 
  A source of further worry connected to the gas pipelines is 
its relationship to the Ye-Tavoy railway on which between 10,000 
and 30,000 villagers from the vicinity of the proposed pipeline 
are being forced to labour under appalling conditions. 
Testimonies given to journalists and aid workers by people who 
had escaped the work gangs are consistent with those given in 
literally hundreds of human rights interviews conducted along 
the border since the Slorc took power, attest to the pervasive 
reality of conditions tantamount to worse than slave labour. 
  The villagers who are forced to work from early morning to 
night are obliged even to provide for all of their own needs 
including food, medicine, and shelter, and they must also 
provide their own tools for doing the work of the Slorc. Slorc 
officials as a matter of course vehemently deny that any human 
rights violations take place under their governance, they also 
claim that all labourers are paid. However, the escapees from 
the railroad construction sites, including several Slorc army 
defectors, were unanimous that the labourers never got paid. 
This is also consistent with stories from numerous other sites. 
The stories of the escapees are of beatings, rapes, deaths from 
accidents and untreated diseases (such as a dysentry outbreak at 
the Natkyizin section of the track that different witnesses 
claim resulted in the deaths of more than 50 people in January) 
and long hours of gruelling work. 
  The Slorc has denied that the railway has a military 
purpose, 
claiming it is for national development and to help the local 
people. Despite the Rangoon military junta's claims, it's 
infrastructure development programmes in the area seem designed 
to increase the speed with which the unusually large numbers of 
troops who have been brought into the area in the past few years 
can be deployed. Even the logging concessions granted by the 
Slorc have served -- by design -- to open up access routes into 
the most remote parts of the border to the benefit of the Slorc 
troops. 
  The railway route, which crosses the planned pipeline route 
a 
near a place called Kanbaut and which runs parallel to the 
Ye-Tavoy highway some 7-10 km to the east would form a double 
barrier to Mon and Karen army units moving from the mountains to 
the sea. Units caught between the two routes by rapid 
deployment forces could be easily surrounded and annihilated. 
Furthermore, long range heavy weapons that could be brought 
down by rail or the currently-under- repair railway to the 
disputed territory through which the pipeline is to run would 
allow the Slorc to shell even the most remote strongholds of the 
Karen and Mon forces (in which areas it should be noted there 
are numerous internally displaced people who have not wanted to 
seek refuge in Thailand.) The development programmes of the 
military dictatorship in other areas of the country where there 
are ethnic minorities, have served to help the Slorc consolidate 
its occupation -- the multi-billion dollar gasfield and pipeline 
programme could be seen as a strong incentive to the Slorc to 
make very certain that it controls the area securely. 
  Neither Thailand nor the Western multinational corporations 
who are investing in the project have any guarantee that the 
Slorc will not use the extremely brutal methods it has become 
infamous for, to secure the ground for their profit-making 
development programme. 
  Part of the process of securing the pipeline route appears 
to 
be clearing all inhabitants from anywhere near the sections of 
the route that are most vulnerable to attack. The villagers who 
formerly lived in the hills to the east of the Ye-Tavoy road, 
particularly those in the Zinba stream watershed directly 
between Kaleinaung and Nat ei taung (Ban I Tong) have all been 
forcibly relocated into resettlement villages beside the highway 
where they can be more easily controlled by the Slorc troops. 
  From these places they can also be easily taken to do forced 
labour duty such as ammunition portering, serving the Burmese 
troops in their encampments and labouring on the railway or the 
road. The lands which they have been driven off have been 
declared "black areas" -- free fire zones for the Slorc troops. 
This is partially borne out by the Burmese official who said 
"there are no people left" from the Zinba River to Kaleinaung, 
leaving one to question what has happened to them. 
  One place other than the resettlement villages (called 
"strategic hamlets" or "cluster villages" in military parlance) 
where the villagers have gone to is Thailand. As refugees, they 
remain in camps such as Da Now See, Pa Yaw and Aung Tha Pyei. 
Many hundreds of people have fled to the relative safety of 
Thailand from the railway, and many more are expected to do so 
as people try to avoid doing murderous second or third work 
stints. 
  There are reported to be a great many more people who have 
left their homes to avoid the slave labour who have remained in 
the "liberated areas" controlled by the NMSP and the Karen 
National Union (KNU), and where they will probably stay until 
food shortages or a possible Slorc attack drives them over the 
border. 
  Reliable local sources say that an average of 20 new asylum 
seekers per day are coming through just two of the many possible 
routes into Thailand. It is hard to tell how many have already 
crossed the border as most of the people who do so will be 
trying to go deeper into Thailand to join the hundreds of 
thousands of illegal workers who appear to be better off than 
those on the border who fear being forcibly repatriated. 
Obviously there are no guarantees that the people in the camps 
will not be forced back over the border, especially after the 
examples of Halaukhani and the recent pushback of people at 
Pailin on the Cambodian border. 
  For those newly arriving at the border and seeking to stay 
in 
the camps there would be a great sense of insecurity as they 
cannot be sure of being allowed to register as refugees or stay 
in the refugee camps. Previously the number of refugees allowed 
to stay in the camps was fixed by the Thais. 
  Thailand's policy on refugees, if there is one, seems to be 
to keep them from ever feeling secure on Thai soil so that they 
would rather go back home at the first opportunity -- even if it 
is still not safe to do so. 
  Thai leaders owe it to their own people not to make deals 
that will have serious negative repercussions for their nation. 
In the past, personal interests of leaders have often been put 
before the national interest, and certainly before the interests 
of the indigenous peoples and the environment, with a result 
that lives, cultures, national economies and the environment 
could be severely destroyed.

  [Text] The situation at the Thai-Cambodian border is not a 
cause for concern now. Troubles are created by groups of 
bandits in uniforms who are stricken by poverty. The Thai Army 
has no intention of causing trouble in Cambodia. Cambodia's 
internal affairs should be solved among the Cambodian people. 
Army Commander General Wimon Wongwanit was interviewed by 
newsmen in Nakhon Ratchasima this morning: 
  [Begin Wimon recording] The situation now is not as serious 
as in the past. Otherwise, more people would have fled into our 
country again -- there have been no refugees these days. There 
is some trouble for our people being created by the bandits in 
uniform; we are trying to suppress them. We are coordinating 
work with unit commanders on the other side of the border to 
solve the problem. If they cannot get their bad elements under 
control, we will have to resort to tough measures to suppress 
them. I notice that those people are very poor. They have 
small salaries, and sometimes there was a delay in salary 
payment, and so on so forth. So those who lack discipline 
created trouble for our people. Sometimes, the problems stemmed 
from cheating among themselves since they are involved in arms 
and cattle smuggling. We are not responsible for all the 
troubles, but they are responsible. In this connection, the 
Army is ready to take the strongest measure to deal with those 
troubles and will not allow them to go on like this. 
  I would like to stress here that the Thai Army has never 
caused trouble in Cambodia. We want to see peace and 
prosperity, and to see our neighbors live happily. We do not 
want to see killing between Cambodian factions. But that's 
their duty to solve the problem. We have nothing to do with it.

  [Text]Sa Kaeo -- Governor Kasem Chaisit yesterday suspected 
arson as the cause of the inferno which devastated a border 
market in Aranyaprathet district Friday night. 
  About 330 stalls and some 60 million baht worth of 
merchandise were destroyed in the two-hour fire. Fire trucks 
were unable to get into the market because of the narrow access 
to the site and some of them had to draw water from toilets to 
extinguish the blaze. 
  The governor said the arsonists might be Thais or Cambodians 
who were enraged by the recent action taken by Thai authorities, 
upon the request of Cambodian officials in Banteay Meanchey 
Province, to repatriate all Cambodian traders who crossed the 
border to do business at Talat Rong Khrua. 
  He said he was awaiting the report of police investigation. 
  Emerging from an emergency meeting held yesterday with 
police 
and military officers, Governor Kasem said the border point at 
Khlong Luk-Poipet would be temporarily closed effective as of 
yesterday. Only authorized officials and aid workers of the 
United Nations agencies will be allowed to pass through the 
border. 
  The governor said the closure of the border was necessary 
for 
security reasons because of the escalation in fighting between 
Cambodian factions across the border. 
  He anticipated a rise in cross border smuggling by the 
so-called "ant army" as a result of the border closure which is 
expected to cost Thai traders 10 million baht a day in lost 
business. 
  Several angry Thai traders who lost their property in the 
fire complained that they did not understand why the military 
prevented them from going into the market to retrieve their 
goods as the fire had not yet reached their stalls. 
  Governor Kasem later asked for sympathy from the traders, 
saying that it was necessary for the troops to ban people from 
getting into the market in order to prevent "third hand" 
elements from causing trouble. He also said the scene of the 
fire was only 200 meters from the border line. 
  Shortly before the fire, three artillery shells, fired from 
inside Cambodia, exploded behind a Thai military outpost killing 
two Cambodians and injuring three -- two of them seriously. The 
injured were rushed to Aranyaprathet district hospital.

  [Text] Aranyaprathet -- The Thai military has threatened 
to close the border here with the Cambodian town of Poipet if 
Cambodian forces refuse to pay for damage caused by a recent 
rocket attack on a village. 
  Col. Wanchai Nuansukhum, chief of the Aranyaprathet Task 
Force, issued the ultimatum at a press conference in this border 
town yesterday. 
  He said a woman was injured and about 20,000 baht in damage 
was caused to houses last Monday when seven 107-mm rockets, 
believed to have been fired by Cambodian government forces, 
crashed into Tambon Khlong Namsai. 
  The colonel said that even though the closure would affect 
the local economy, it was necessary to protect the lives and 
property of Thai villagers near the border. 
  Since Tuesday, all trucks and cars have been banned from 
crossing the border via Khlong Luk bridge, but push carts have 
been allowed through the nearby border crossing at Talat Rong 
Khlua. More than 30 million baht worth of goods has been held 
up on the Thai side by the partial closure, and the number of 
visitors to Aranyaprathet and Poipet has dropped dramatically. 
  Col. Wanchai said he wants to find out from Cambodian forces 
whether the shelling was deliberate or accidental. He had asked 
Cambodian Gen. Lai Vira, commander of the 12th Division, for 
talks to discuss paying compensation and to ensure that fighting 
is contained within Cambodia. 
  Cambodia's warring factions had earlier been warned that 
Thai 
forces would fire smoke shells or flares if Cambodian shells 
landed in Thailand, and if the shelling continued, live fire 
would be returned. he said.

  [Text] Bangkok -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has 
announced it has stopped granting "soft loans" at a low interest 
rate to Thailand, saying the economic growth of the kingdom is 
now at a level where it no longer qualifies for these 
concessionary interest rate loans. 
  The bank said Thailand's annual economic growth rate had 
remained consistently high and the average yearly per capita 
income was now US$2,300 per annum which now disqualifies it from 
receiving the low interest rate soft loans. The maximum income 
per capita allowable is US$1,800. 
  ADB had previously sent a report to the Finance Ministry, 
saying that in the next decade Thailand looked set to become a 
new major industrial force in the region, bringing it up to the 
status of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. 
  The bank said it was obligated to distribute concessionary 
loans of this kind to more deserving cases, countries which have 
less developed economies and lower income rates than Thailand. 
  According to the report, the bank plans to grant soft loans 
to east European and Latin American countries. Initially, it 
will allocate around US$500,000 million for the granting of such 
loans. The bank will, however grant soft loans totaling US$500 
million to Thailand's state enterprises, although it did not go 
into detail about this. 
  Somchai Ruchupan, director-general of the Fiscal Policy 
Office, said the withdrawal of this loan privilege will not 
seriously affect Thailand's development as Thailand can seek 
loans from alternative sources. 
  A source at the Finance Ministry said ADB ceased granting 
loans of this type as of February this year.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Global demand for primary 
energy will grow at an average annual pace of 2.1 percent 
through 2010, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in an 
outlook report Tuesday [12 April]. 
  By 2010, the world will be consuming 48 percent more energy 
than it did in 1991, said the 1994 edition of the IEA's world 
energy outlook. "The inexorable increase" in energy demand is 
ascribed to an expected rise of over 70 percent in global gross 
domestic product (GDP) during the period, IEA Executive Director 
Helga Steeg said in a news conference in Tokyo. 
  The annual report said energy consumption among the 
countries 
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD) will increase by 28 percent between now and 2010. 
  Oil demand in the OECD will rise to 45 million barrels per 
day, up 18 percent over 1991 consumption. The rise in oil 
demand, an average pace of 0.8 percent a year, occurs entirely 
in the transport sector, the report said. 
  With a gradual decline in OECD oil production expected to 
continue, the OECD's dependency on imported oil will increase to 
nearly 70 percent by 2010 from 58 percent in 1991, the report 
said. 
  In order for the OECD to secure the demand, production in 
the 
Middle East and Venezuela needs to double over the next 16 to 17 
years, the report said. 
  World coal consumption will grow at 2.1 percent per annum. 
Such demand from countries other than the OECD will rise at 3.8 
percent a year with China accounting for over half of the 
expected increase. 
  The forecasts are based on the assumption that oil import 
prices will average 17 dollars per barrel in 1994 and 1995 in 
the IEA countries and rise to 28 barrels by 2005, after which it 
remains flat. 
  The outlook is also conditional on a modest macroeconomic 
growth in the OECD in the early years of the forecast amid the 
continuing recession in Japan and Europe. 
  The outlook for the world energy demand indicates global 
carbon dioxide emissions will grow 50 percent by 2010, Steeg 
said. 
  Emissions in the OECD will continue on an upward pace while 
those in the rest of the world will more than double, she said. 
"This picture will be slowed but not fundamentally changed 
under low economic growth assumptions," Steeg said. 
  Forecasting region-by-region energy demand, the report said 
consumption in Japan and other OECD Pacific areas is expected to 
grow at 1.8 percent per annum over the forecast period, a slower 
growth than that over the last decade. "Energy-intensive 
industries will continue to relocate from Japan to the rapidly 
growing Asian countries," Steeg explained. 
  Japanese nuclear output capacity is expected to almost 
double 
over the forecast period, the report said.

  [Text] Kyoto, April 12 KYODO -- France and Chile have 
jointly proposed tough regulations on tourists to Antarctica 
after reports of environmental damage caused by visitors to the 
frigid continent, sources at the Antarctica conference here said 
Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Signatories of an international treaty on the Antarctic are 
meeting here at the Kyoto International Conference Hall until 
April 22 to discuss policies to protect the environment at the 
South Pole. The proposed regulations would hold the tourists, 
their travel agents, and their countries responsible for 
protecting the environment, the sources said. 
  Tourists, who have been growing in number in recent years, 
and their travel agents would be required to submit a detailed 
plan of their visit 15 months before departure and strictly 
observe the environmental protection agreement during their 
trip, the sources said. 
  Home countries of the tourists and agents would be asked to 
approve the visits to Antarctica and in the event of violations 
of the protection agreement would be denied approval for visits 
up to five years, the sources said. 
  The United States and Britain, on the other hand, plan to 
propose guidelines for the tourists and adventurers, and are 
opposed to the strictness of the joint proposal of France and 
Chile. 
  Between 2,000 and 3,000 tourists visit Antarctica each year, 
but there have been reports of the tourists trampling penguin 
nesting grounds, damaging local plant life and disrupting 
scientific experiments being conducted in the area.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 11 -- Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet 
gave a banquet here this evening in honour of his Australian 
distinguished guests. At this event, he delivered a speech 
which read in part : 
  `It has been only a year since our first meeting in 
Canberra, 
but we have every reason to be satisfied with the rapid 
development of the multi-sided Vietnam-Australia cooperation, 
especially in the economic, trading, educational and training 
fields. We greatly appreciate Australia's active help to us in 
building a North-South 500 KV grid, a nearly-completed important 
project in our national construction. We also highly value the 
effective implementation of the Australian aid to train 
Vietnamese officials, as well as Australia's active contribution 
to a break-through in the relations between Vietnam and the 
international financial institutions. 
  `I am optimistic about the prospect for the development of 
friendly and cooperative relationship between our two countries. 
Despite thousands of miles separating us and the difference in 
historical circumstances and cultural traditions between Vietnam 
and Australia, both of us have been looking towards the Pacific 
and identifying ourselves with the common desire for an expanded 
regional cooperation. 
  `We are satisfied with the results of the open and frank 
exchanges of talks between us today. We are convinced that the 
agreement between us in many fields will contribute to further 
consolidation and development of the on-going fine cooperation 
between Vietnam and Australia'. 
  Prime Minister Paul Keating, for his part, said: 
  `The effect of the changes you have introduced, combined 
with 
the skill and enterprise of the Vietnamese people, have brought 
this country high levels of economic growth and have opened up 
new opportunities for our bilateral relationship. Australia, 
too, has been through a process of 'economic renovation'. We 
have opened our industry to competition and our economy to the 
world. 
  `I know, Mr Prime Minister, how difficult the task can be. 
But, like you, I also know how large are the rewards for our 
countries at the end of the process. 
  `And, like Vietnam Australia is also seeking closer links 
with our region not only economically but culturally, 
politically and strategically as well. 
  These parallel interests are creating unprecedented new 
opportunities for us. 
  Trade between Australia and Vietnam in 1982 was 2 million 
dollars. In 1993 it was 366 million dollars. 
  Australia is now Vietnam's third largest foreign investor, 
with nearly 800 million dollars invested here. 
  We are also developing new avenues for cooperation on 
regional issues. 
  And Vietnam can count on warm support from Australia as you 
move towards greater involvement in regional organisations. 
  Bilaterally, we are finding new opportunities to work 
together. 
  `I was also pleased to be able to tell you today, Mr Prime 
Minister, that Australia has committed more than 200 million 
dollars in a new four-year aid program, which we hope will cover 
areas such as education, health, infrastructure and legal 
training.

measures to further strengthen the cooperative relations between 
the two countries.

of attaching importance to the development of cooperation with 
Vietnam in trade, investment and other fields and its aid 
programme to Vietnam, especially Australia's experience sharing, 
technical assistance and personnel training to Vietnam as well

Vietnam, and said that Australia was ready to broaden its

<F P=106> [Interview with Truong Tan Sang, chairman of the Ho Chi Minh </F>
City people's committee, by an unidentified NHAN DAN 
correspondent on "the city's foreign economic activities" -- 
place and date not given] 
  [Summary] [Correspondent] "Could you, Comrade Chairman, 
give your observations on the results of the city's foreign 
economic activities over the years and on their course of 
development in the period ahead?" 
  [Truong Tan Sang] "As far as Ho Chi Minh City is concerned, 
foreign economic activities are a very important part of the 
city's socioeconomic development strategy. They have had a 
positive impact on various economic activities and have helped 
increasingly develop the economic growth rate." 
  The export volume of industrial products and processed farm 
produce have increased with every passing day. "We have been 
able to maintain an annual increase in our import-export volume 
of approximately 15 percent. In 1993 the export volume of 
processed industrial products accounted for 64 percent of the 
city's total exports. Over 80 percent of the city's equipment 
and machinery were imported. Tourism and support services made 
up 15 percent of the city's annual revenue." 
  Foreign capital invested in the city is increasing. "Foreign 
invested capital in 1991 was as large as the figures of many 
previous years combined. In 1992, foreign invested capital 
increased 1.3 fold over 1991. In 1993, it was 1.8 times as much 
as that of 1992." 
  In the years to come, especially 1994, the city's foreign 
economic efforts will be directed at consolidating our existing 
markets, opening new markets, strengthening and establishing 
more market monitoring organizations, encouraging economic firms 
to find new foreign markets, striving to attract more foreign 
capital investment in the infrastructure and in the development 
of advanced technologies, and promoting the production of 
export-oriented goods. 
  [Correspondent] Could you, comrade, tell us whether 
effective foreign economic activities have had any impact on the 
city's economic development? 
  [Truong Tan Sang] "Foreign economic activities have been and 
are a very important factor for socioeconomic development in the 
city." Noteworthy is the fact that they have become a source of 
revenue for the state budget. "In 1993, revenue from taxes 
levied on imports and exports was estimated at 2,600 billion 
dong. This helped increase the city's 1993 budget revenue by 44 
percent over 1992." 
  So far, "the city has licensed 280 investment projects with 
a 
total investment capital of $2,238 million, of which 159 
projects with a total capital investment of $500 million have 
been deployed, providing jobs for 25,000 workers." 
  [Correspondent] "The operations of party and mass 
organizations in joint ventures with foreign countries have 
become an issue. What is the city party committee's policy 
toward this issue?" 
  [Truong Tan Sang] There are trade union organizations in a 
number of joint ventures with foreign countries. "But in 
general, setting up party and mass organizations in joint 
venture establishments has not been given due attention. That 
is why there have been disputes over privileges between workers 
and enterprise owners in certain establishments. These disputes 
have not been settled promptly, thus adversely affecting 
production and business environments. As the scope of 
investment will grow bigger in the future, the establishment and 
consolidation of such party and mass organizations must be 
carried out urgently in order to protect the legal interest of 
investors and workers within the framework of the law now in 
force." 
  [Correspondent]: Thank you, Comrade Chairman.

<F P=106> [Station correspondent Hoai Thu's essay: "Efforts by Dien </F>
Chau District To Fight Hunger and Poverty"] 
  [Summary] Nghe An Province's Dien Chau district has a 
population of 260,000, most of whom engage in agricultural 
production, planting various crops on a total area of 
23,000-24,000 hectares of land. Among them 14,000 hectares are 
planted with rice and 3,000 hectares with peanuts. In the most 
productive year, the district can produce 63,000 tonnes of 
grain. Its per capita in grain is 260 kg. People in the 
district also engage in fishing, salt production, and livestock 
breeding. 
  "However, after six years of implementing Resolution No. 10 
on the contractual system, only 65 percent of households in the 
district earn enough grain for self-consumption. The remaining 
35 percent face a grain shortage and numerous difficulties due 
to poverty, among them more than 11 percent experience hunger 
[dqois] from five to six months." 
  What is the main causes of hunger and poverty experienced by 
the abovementioned 35 percent of the district's households? 
Through our studies, we found that these households had 
insufficient capital, used poor cultivation methods, while the 
cost of production was too high and the price of rice was 
relatively low in the market. 
  "Indeed, more than half of the 35 percent poor households 
are 
short of capital; they have too many children, most of them are 
in poor health. Worse still, they could not pay their debts to 
the local agricultural cooperative year after year." 
  To overcome these difficulties, the district must strive to 
encourage the peasants to plant new high-yield rice and peanut 
varieties to attain an average rice yield of 45 quintals per 
hectar and peanut, 20 quintal per hectare. The district must 
also strive to plant more soybean and sweet potatoes on its 
fallow land to attain a production target of 70,000-80,000 
tonnes of grain by the year 1997. 
  The goal of the district is to overcome hunger by 1998, 
reduce the number of poor households by half, and help 40 
percent of the total households in the district lead a better 
life by the year 2000. 
  "The struggle against hunger and poverty is a difficult 
task. 
It requires coordination from various sectors and branches while 
efforts must be made from the top to the lowest level. It is 
necessary to carry out this struggle in close association with 
the implementation of the family planning program to reduce the 
population growth rate of the district from 2.4 percent at 
present to 1.7 percent in the year 2000."

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 10 -- Nearly 8,000 projects 
throughout the country have got loans of about VND [Vietnamese 
dong] 420 billion from the national fund since the launching of 
a credit programme two years ago, it was reported by the Central 
State Treasury. As a result, the programme has helped create 
335,000 jobs nationwide. Leading the programme was Ho Chi Minh 
City which gave loans of VND 36.13 billion to 317 projects, 
creating 16,500 jobs. Next was Hanoi which lent VND 24.29 
billion to 229 projects attracting 19,622 workers. 
  These projects are usually small and operate in the fields 
of 
aquaculture, sea fishing, small industries and handicrafts, 
building materials production and animal breeding. The state 
treasury and the concerned branches and services are seeking 
measures to streamline lending procedures to provide credits in 
time and help to use them effectively.

January Mid-Term Party National Conference Resolution] 
  [Text] 3. To uniformly build a market mechanism managed 
by the state in accordance with socialism: 
  We will continue to build a new and uniformed economic 
policy, persist in the transformation to the market mechanism in 
parallel with the consolidation of an effective state 
management, and continue to perfect all mechanisms and policies 
so that the market mechanism can operate effectively: 
  -- To ensure the independence of all business entities. 
State agencies will only manage state-related domains and will 
not directly control business activities. 
  -- Prices are to be determined by the market. 
  -- Lawful and healthy competition will be encouraged, while 
monopolies will be avoided. 
  -- Businessmen are entitled to profit as long as they 
operate within the laws. 
  -- The state will fix and subsidize the prices of certain 
merchandise that are vital socioeconomically within the scope of 
the market mechanism. 
  -- The state encourages the uniformed establishment of 
various markets: merchandise, services, labor, capital, 
technology, real estate, and so forth. 
  Which principles should a socialism-oriented state 
management 
apply? 
  -- The state should manage the whole economy and all 
economic sectors, not limit itself to the state-owned sector. 
  -- The centralization and unification of the government in 
macro-economic management should be strengthened in parallel 
with the expansion of responsibility and authority of sectors 
and localities in areas that they can manage more efficiently, 
while always respecting the independence of business enterprises. 
  -- The relevant ministries should strive to satisfactorily 
formulate development strategies, plans, and policies for their 
sectors; guide, support, inspect, and control all business 
establishments of various economic sectors in the localities in 
accordance with the state economic-technical management function. 
  -- The comprehensive inter-sectorial management of 
government ministries should be consolidated, so that all 
socioeconomic activities are put under the state's effective 
macro-management. 
  -- State authorities at all levels should carry out state 
management duties in their respective areas in all business 
establishments regardless of them being centrally- or 
locally-owned. 
  For the management task to be effective, we must: 
  -- Complete the legal system and resolutely enforce the 
laws. 
  -- Consolidate and develop the supervisory role the staff 
in planning agencies to strengthen planning for development. 
  -- Continue with the comprehensive and profound reforms of 
the financial and monetary systems. 
  4. To Take Care of Cultural and Social Issues: 
  The most thorough guiding concept of our party reflected in 
all cultural and social lines and policies is to care, nurture, 
and develop the human factor, which is both a motive and an aim 
of the revolution. The important issues in these domains at 
present are employment, social equity, level of public 
knowledge, a healthy and clean society, the development of 
national culture, and health care and protection. 
  -- What are the most important ways to create employment? 
  All people will cooperate with the state to invest more 
savings to accelerate industrialization and modernization, thus 
creating more jobs. 
  All citizens and economic elements, domestic and overseas 
investors alike, are to be encouraged to develop their business 
activities and expand their external relations, as development 
will help solve the employment issue. 
  -- On what basis do we set up our social equality policies? 
  Economic growth must relate closely to social progress and 
equality at each stage of its development. 
  Social equality is seen in the reasonable distribution of 
production resources and products of the economy, as well as in 
opportunities for development of each individual. 
  We will apply the principle that allows higher income for 
those who are produce and contribute more, and vice versa. 
Distribution is based mainly on labor and on capital 
contributed to business and production activities. Talents and 
skills are to be encouraged and valued. 
  The lawful accumulation of wealth should be encouraged, 
while 
programs to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty should be 
developed. We should see a growing number of people getting rich 
before others as a positive indication of development. 
  We will carry out suitable policies in credit, tax, and 
career training to create conditions for the poor to improve 
their chances of making ends meet and becoming better off. We 
should also motivate the richer sections of society to help the 
state assist those who are poorer with capital, production 
resources, experience, and advice for their own businesses. 
  The richer, developed regions should help the state assist 
poorer, and slower-developing ones. The state will have 
suitable policies to reserve investment subsidies for poorer 
regions, and will assign the richer regions the responsibility 
of supporting poorer ones. 
  The state should also have suitable policies and special aid 
for regions with unique difficulties and disadvantages in 
comparison to others. These include mountainous and remote 
regions, ethnic minority regions, and former revolutionary 
bases. On the other hand, these localities also have to help 
themselves by developing their potential and using subsidized 
capital efficiently. (To be continued)

<F P=106> [Sixth installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi </F>
20-25 January Midterm National Party Conference Resolution] 
  [Text] It is necessary to establish the all people's funds 
to repay those who have served the nation with merit. 
  We must formulate policy to regulate the wealthy, motivate 
mass organizations and individuals to voluntarily participate in 
various humanitarian and charitable activities. 
  Efforts must be made to enhance the citizens' duties, 
strengthen the community's responsibility to society, and 
develop our nation's tradition of benevolence. 
  -- What are the key measures formulated to effectively 
fight corruption? 
  The key measures include efforts to: 
  -- review, amend, or supplement mechanism, policies, laws, 
and procedures governing the activities of state agencies and 
government employees while trying to overcome loopholes in the 
management system; 
  -- renovate and consolidate financial management and 
bookkeeping; 
  -- streamline the mechanism, cut unnecessary expenditure, 
and guarantee sufficient salaries for wage-earners; 
  -- consolidate education and training for cadres and party 
members to heighten their revolutionary morality; 
  -- strictly carry out inspection, investigation, and 
control of agencies concerned and mass organizations to promptly 
detect corruption cases; and 
  -- promptly and seriously deal with those who are involved 
in corruption, especially in serious cases, in accordance with 
the law and regardless of their rank and position. 
  5. Strengthen national defense and security 
  While integrating our efforts for national construction, we 
must attach importance to national defense and security to 
satisfactorily protect the fatherland; defend national 
independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; maintain 
national security and politico- social stability; and adhere to 
the socialist construction orientation. 
  It is necessary to firmly grasp and continue to 
satisfactorily implement the common task of maintaining national 
defense and security, thoroughly understand the guiding thoughts 
set by the party Central Committee's Third Plenum, carry out the 
all people's comprehensive and protracted struggle to foil all 
schemes and acts of the "peaceful evolution," rebellion, and 
power seizures. 
  6. Continue to broaden external relations. 
  We must develop the achievements in external relations and 
continue our independent, sovereign, open-door foreign policy 
and diversified diplomatic activities. Efforts must be made to 
win more friends and reduce differences to create favorable 
conditions for national construction and defense, while 
positively contributing to the common struggle of people in the 
world for peace, national independence, democracy, and social 
progress. 
  7. Building the law-governed state of Vietnam that of the 
people, by the people, and for the people. 
  What are the characteristics of the law-governed state of 
Vietnam? 
  It is the state of the people, by the people, and for the 
people in which all aspects of social life are governed by the 
law. This will lead our country to progress in accordance with 
the socialist orientation. The law-governed state of Vietnam is 
established on the basis of strengthening and expanding the 
all-people's great unity bloc comprising workers, peasants, and 
the intellectuals under the party leadership. 
  In format, the law-governed state upholds the law and 
respects the three branches of power namely legislative, 
executive, and administrative powers, which is similar to the 
bourgeoisie law-governed state. We also study and apply some 
rational aspects of the bourgeoisie law-governed state. 
However, the characteristics of our law-governed state are 
different from the bourgeoisie law-governed state. As far as 
the nature of class is concerned, our state is established on 
the basis of the working class as symbolized by the leadership 
of the party, the vanguard unit of the working class. The party 
formulates lines and policies, and leads political organizations 
to implement them. Because our law-governed state is 
established on this basis, it has unique characteristics of a 
state that is of people, by the people, and for the people, 
resting on the worker-peasant-intellectual alliance. The state 
serves the interest of the laboring people and the nation, while 
the bourgeoisie law- governed state naturally protects 
capitalism and serves the interests of the bourgeoisie class. 
It cannot represent the interests of the working class and the 
laboring people. Our state upholds the law and manages all 
social activities through the law. The characteristics of our 
laws are different from those of bourgeoisie laws. Our laws are 
aimed at developing our nation in accordance with the socialist 
orientation, while the laws of the bourgeoisie state are aimed 
at protecting capitalism.

<F P=106> [Seventh installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi </F>
20- 25 January Mid-Term Party National Conference Resolution] 
  [Text] What were the policies and measures put forth by 
the conference to continue building the law-governing Vietnamese 
state? 
  -- Practising socialist democracy and strongly developing 
the people's collective mastery are the most important tasks and 
the fine characteristics of our state. To develop democracy, we 
must satisfactorily carry out the following: Protect human 
rights and other basic civil rights already inscribed in the 
constitution; scrupulously consider and resolve complaints and 
denunciations by the people; make arrangements for the people to 
participate in public affairs; contribute views to the 
formulation of party policies and important government bills, 
and improve electoral activities. To effectively achieve this, 
party organizations must firmly grasp the party's conceptions 
and policies, evaluate the actual situation, and devise plans 
and measures to get every job done. In practicing socialist 
democracy, we must resolve to fight bureaucracy, officialism, 
corruption, wasteful spending, and the abuse of privilege. We 
must fight manifestations of extreme democracy and adopt 
dictatorial measures against elements committing acts of 
betrayal against the fatherland, undermining national security, 
and violating the people's interest. 
  -- We must step up and improve the quality of legislative 
work, build a uniform and consistent legal system, and 
institutionalize party lines in all areas of the social life. 
  -- We must intensify our didactical dissemination of laws, 
improve the people's knowledge of and their sense of respect for 
the law, ensuring that the law is complied with scrupulously, 
uniformly, and fairly. 
  -- We must continue to streamline and renovate the state 
working apparatus, ensure a unified authority and clear-cut work 
distribution, and develop the effect of the three rights 
[quyeenf] -- legislative, executive, and judicial. We must act 
in accordance with the principles of democratic centralism. The 
political report puts forth the orientations for improving the 
working quality of the National Assembly, undertaking 
administrative reform, continuing to strengthen the judicial 
system organizationally and renovating its activities to develop 
the efficiency of the state working aparatus. 
  8. We must renovate and rectify the party, broaden the 
all-people great unity bloc, and consolidate the close 
relationship between the party and the people. 
  As initial efforts to review various aspects of 
party-building work have just been undertaken, there are issues 
which we must continue to study and review with more depth if we 
are to draw on correct experiences. The political report raises 
the following main points in party building: 
  a. "We must strengthen political and ideological work and 
ensure the political and ideological unanimity of the entire 
party. We must keep party cadres and members constantly aware of 
the party's conceptions and policies, improve their knowledge, 
and help them remain firm on the path toward socialism. We must 
creatively apply and develop Marxism-Leninism, Ho Chi Minh 
thought, and all the intellectual quintessences of our time, 
sensitively take hold of new things and correctly handle 
everything arising from reality." 
  Intensifying political and ideological activities is an 
urgent and fundamental duty arising from our party's leadership 
requirements in the present stage. It is important that the 
party must raise its knowledge to the level required of it by 
its tasks if it is to lead our national revolution to develop 
its advantges, seize opportunities, overcome all dangers, and 
surmout all ordeals. Because of the disintegration of the 
socialist system in the Soviet Union, confidence in the 
socialist path has somewhat wavered among certain segments of 
party cadres and members. Worse, certain people have opted for 
another path. They have propagated their erroneous conceptions 
that are at variance with party lines. We must intensify 
political theory indoctrination to consolidate the revolutionary 
stance of our party cadres and members, and attempt to "iron out 
erroneous viewpoints, illusionary conceptions, and idelogical 
vacillations. We must struggle against manifestations of 
opportunism, rightism, dogmatism, and conservatism. Party 
cadres and members must scrupulously comply with all party 
resolutions and directives and the state law and must not abuse 
democractic liberties to propagate view that are contrary to 
party lines." 
  "Party members, especially party cadres at various levels, 
must constantly steel their revolutionary qualities and ethics, 
and study harder to improve their knowledge." 
  b. "We must strengthen the unity and unanimity within the 
party and must adopt organizational principles for party 
activities, especially the principles of democratic centralism, 
collective leadership, and individual responsibility. We must 
steel our revolutionary ethics and build for ourselves a 
wholesome lifestyle against wasteful spending, corruption, and 
illegal dealings. We must guard against individualism, 
indiscipline, arbitrariness, despotism, departmentalism, and 
nepotism. We must attach importance to the safeguarding of the 
party and must maintain internal and national secrecy. We must 
guard against all the schemes and tricks aimed at causing cadres 
to deviate ideologically. We must increase our control over the 
implementation of the party's lines, policies, and regulations."

  [Text] ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu and Director 
General Hans Blix of the International Atomic Energy Agency 
[IAEA] secretly met today in a hotel near Narita Airport in 
Tokyo, and discussed the issue of the DPRK's, or North Korea's, 
nuclear facilities. 
  Foreign Minister Han landed at Narita Airport today, one day 
earlier than the scheduled stopover for his week-long visit to 
Russia, to meet Director General Blix, who had just arrived in 
Tokyo to attend an international conference. 
  The meeting was not opened to the press in view of North 
Korea's intensified criticism of the IAEA policies. The topics 
for discussion at the meeting are unknown, but it is believed 
that the two leaders discussed such issues as results of the 
IAEA inspections in North Korea last month and possibilities of 
North Korea's acceptance of the IAEA inspections in the future. 
  [Begin Blix recording] We talked about the need for the 
IAEA's early completion of inspections in the regions resisting 
them. [end recording] 
  Concerning the question of North Korea's nuclear development 
program, U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry is scheduled to 
visit Japan and the ROK next week. Nations concerned including 
Japan, have begun to move actively in preparation for the UN 
Security Council session in early May.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu and Hans Blix, chief of the U.N.'s nuclear 
monitoring agency, agreed Tuesday [12 April] that North Korea 
must permit the completion of inspections initiated last month 
on its suspect nuclear program. Han, on a weeklong diplomatic 
mission to Russia, Britain, and Belgium, arrived in Tokyo on 
Tuesday and met with Blix, director general of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who is here for a forum starting 
Wednesday in Hiroshima on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. 
  Blix and Han, during their hour-long meeting, studied 
Pyongyang's response to the U.N. Security Council's March 31 
presidential statement urging North Korea to comply with the 
nuclear safeguards accord and permit the conclusion of the 
checks, the South Korean Embassy in Japan said. 
  The IAEA has said two weeks of inspections in March were 
insufficient to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear 
materials for weapons purposes as alleged by the United States 
and other Western nations. 
  North Korea says it has fully complied with inspection 
criteria previously agreed upon and maintains its nuclear 
program serves strictly civilian purposes. 
  The nuclear row will top Han's agenda in Moscow, where he 
will meet Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and other 
government leaders from Wednesday through Friday. 
  "I expect Moscow to bring up its earlier proposal for an 
eight-way conference on the North Korean nuclear issue and I 
will explain Seoul's position," YONHAP NEWS AGENCY quoted Han as 
saying before departure. Moscow has suggested that both Koreas, 
China, the U.S., Russia, Japan, the United Nations and the IAEA 
try to resolve the nuclear controversy through a special 
conference. 
  According to YONHAP, Han said Seoul welcomes the Russian 
proposal but prefers that the U.N. handle the North Korean issue 
for the time being. 
  Han is scheduled to meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas 
Hurd in London on Saturday and will return to Seoul next Monday 
after attending a two-day conference of South Korean mission 
chiefs in Brussels.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Washington appears 
concerned that North Korea's connection with Japanese ruling 
quarters may lead to a softening of Tokyo's attitude toward 
Pyongyang, a Tokyo newspaper reported Tuesday. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's announcement of 
resignation Friday has raised concerns that some figures in the 
coalition may adopt a more conciliatory position toward 
Pyongyang, the SANKEI SHIMBUN reported from Washington in its 
evening edition. The SANKEI dispatch named Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Shinseito's [Japan Renewal 
Party] senior member Hajime Ishii as having close links with 
North Korea. 
  Hosokawa has so far expressed support for Washington's plans 
to seek economic sanctions against North Korea if Pyongyang 
continues to refuse thorough safeguard inspections of its 
nuclear program. 
  Takemura, speaking at Tuesday's evening news conference, 
dismissed the concern as a "laughing matter." 
  Government officials said they know that a number of 
politicians within the Japanese ruling coalition would likely 
support a political connection with North Korea, the SANKEI 
report said. 
  The officials allowed that Takemura's and Ishii's connection 
with North Korea may be entirely legitimate, but added that they 
hope Tokyo will not dilute its attitude toward the North Korean 
nuclear problem, the report said. Takemura and Ishii appear to 
have been singled out by Washington because of their involvement 
in a trip to North Korea in September 1990 led by then-Liberal 
Democratic Party power broker Shin Kanemaru. 
  "It is a laughing matter," Takemura told reporters in Tokyo 
on Tuesday, commenting on his reported political links with 
Pyongyang. Takemura and Ishii are also members of the 
Japan-North Korea Parliamentarians League, but Takemura denied 
that this was any indication that he had a political connection 
with Pyongyang. 
  Washington has spearheaded an international campaign since 
last March to persuade Pyongyang to accept full inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to ensure that its 
nuclear program is not being used to manufacture an atomic 
weapons arsenal. Pyongyang has denied allegations it is seeking 
to build a bomb, but its refusal to permit unfettered IAEA 
inspections has fueled suspicions that it may be diverting 
radioactive materials from its power plants to military purposes. 
  Two rounds of high-level talks between Washington and 
Pyongyang last summer yielded an agreement for inspections that 
were held last month. 
  The IAEA, however, was prevented from completing the 
inspections and the U.N. Security Council issued a presidential 
statement March 31 urging Pyongyang to permit completion of the 
checks.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Kazakhstan's President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev said Saturday [9 April] that Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation will not alter Japanese policy 
or affect agreements signed between the two countries. 
Nazarbayev told reporters at a Tokyo hotel that bilateral 
agreements will remain valid and projects planned between 
Japanese corporations and his country will remain unchanged. 
  Nazarbayev said that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
announcement Friday that he will resign was unexpected but did 
not come as a surprise. He said he received no prior indication 
that Hosokawa would announce his resignation when he met the 
prime minister on Thursday. 
  But Nazarbayev said he is aware that "when a large number of 
parties make up a coalition, the problems usually become complex. 
  "From an international perspective, it (Hosokawa's 
resignation) is nothing to be surprised about," he said. 
  Nazarbayev arrived in Japan on Wednesday for a four-day 
visit. In addition to his talks with Hosokawa, Nazarbayev met 
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Friday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Kazakhastan President 
Nursultan Nazarbayev left Tokyo Saturday [9 April], concluding a 
four-day visit that resulted in a pledge by Japan to offer 
financial aid for dismantling the nation's nuclear arsenal and 
promoting economic reform. 
  Before departing from Tokyo's Haneda Airport, Nazarbayev 
told 
reporters that the central Asian country will proceed with 
ongoing economic reform although he acknowledged it is 
impossible to achieve the reform without "pain." He also said 
that raising productivity through joint ventures with advanced 
countries, such as Japan, that have high technologies would 
contribute to preventing falling living standards of the people 
in the former Soviet republic. 
  In a joint statement signed by Nazarbayev and Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa Friday, Japan pledged to allocate 1,170 
million yen to Kazakhstan to help dismantle its nuclear arsenal 
inherited from the former Soviet Union. 
  Tokyo will also provide a loan totaling 12,982 million yen 
for improving railway infrastructure and tackling air pollution 
from thermal power stations. 
  The Export-Import Bank of Japan will extend an untied loan 
valued at 220 million dollars to support its transition to a 
market economy.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe implied Tuesday [12 April] that he might leave 
the main opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 
to run for a prime ministerial election in the Diet, an LDP 
legislator said. 
  Watanabe, head of one of the LDP's five major factions, 
showed the resolve in a meeting with a group of junior LDP Diet 
members, called the "Liberals," which is led by Seiichi Ota. In 
the meeting, Ota's group urged Watanabe to run in the prime 
ministerial election in both houses of the Diet. 
  Ota quoted Watanabe as saying, "(I) have an indomitable 
resolve." "(I) would like to form a new party to meet the 
request."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The leader of the 
Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), a group in the ruling 
coalition, said Tuesday [12 April] that former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
is unlikely to be chosen as a successor to outgoing Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi said, "Mr. Watanabe is outside the 
framework of the coalition. I have heard there is considerable 
criticism and rejection from opposition and ruling parties 
(against Watanabe's premiership). It's not so easy." 
  "Even if Mr. Watanabe would join the current ruling parties, 
how many people can he bring (from the LDP)? I doubt the number 
reaches as high as rumored. In that case, it would be quite 
difficult for the ruling parties to secure the majority (in the 
511-seat House of Representatives)," said Ouchi, the health and 
welfare minister. 
  A senior official of the LDP's Watanabe faction said Monday 
that Watanabe plans to form a new parliamentary group in the 
lower house in a bid to form a coalition government with three 
ruling parties -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito and 
the Japan New Party (JNP). 
  As the combined parliamentary strength of Watanabe's 
46-member faction, Shinseito, Komeito and the JNP stands at 161, 
Watanabe will need to win support from more than 95 LDP 
legislators who belong to other LDP factions in order to hold 
the majority seats. 
  Since last February, Watanabe has repeatedly held meetings 
with Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, who is regarded 
as the chief coalition strategist. 
  Shinseito and Komeito -- key forces within the ruling 
coalition -- are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe the 
next leader of a new coalition government in an attempt to oust 
the Social Democratic Party and new party Sakigake [Harbinger] 
from the coalition.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei 
Kono vowed Tuesday [12 April] to run in a prime ministerial 
election in the Diet that will pick a successor to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation last 
Friday, party officials said. Kono, president of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP), made the comment during a meeting of 
senior executive officials of the party, which was ousted from 
power last August following 38 years of uninterrupted rule. 
  Kono was quoted as saying, "(I) will fulfill duties as party 
president and run in the prime ministerial election." 
  "I think I should perform to the last (my) duties as head of 
a party with its membership totaling 220 members (in the House 
of Representatives)," he said. 
  "The party must act in unison," said Kono, in an apparent 
reference aimed at thwarting moves among the LDP to put up 
former Prime Minister Michio Watanabe as a prime ministerial 
candidate. "There are emerging political circumstances for the 
LDP to take the position of assuming responsibility," Kono said. 
  Kono accused the ruling coalition of failing to show a 
political perspective, spending time playing power games and 
lacking the qualifications to hold power. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori told the same session 
that 
the party may hammer out a policy accord with other parties 
before the Diet's prime ministerial election. 
  Watanabe's key ally present at the party meeting, Taku 
Yamasaki, opposed Kono's likely election bid, saying the party 
president need not be its candidate automatically. 
  It is not known when the prime ministerial election in both 
houses of the Diet will be called. 
  The seven-party coalition, which controls a majority in the 
two houses, is on the verge of a breakup because of sharp 
differences between two groups in the eight-month-old alliance. 
  The LDP, whose membership in the lower house stands at 219, 
is the largest single party in the Diet. The coalition 
controls 260 members in the powerful 511-seat lower chamber.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Opposition leader Yohei 
Kono indicated Tuesday that he intends to put himself forward as 
a candidate when the Diet chooses the next prime minister. He 
told a meeting of Liberal Democratic Party executives that LDP 
members should unite in the election, party officials said. 
  But he said he intends to have a "fair fight" with the 
ruling 
coalition, which has yet to choose its candidate to succeed 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his intention to 
step down last Friday. 
  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the LDP, supported Kono, 
saying it is natural for a party leader to run for the 
premiership, the officials said. 
  Kono rapped moves within the LDP to put forward former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe for the premiership, insisting 
that he as party president should be the candidate. 
  Backers of Watanabe argued that the party president need not 
be the automatic candidate, and Taku Yamasaki, deputy general 
secretary of the party, voiced opposition to Kono's comments. 
Yamasaki belongs to an LDP faction headed by Watanabe.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The governing coalition on 
Tuesday [12 April] took a step toward averting a split over the 
picking of a successor to departing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, top coalition officials said. 
  "I'm pretty sure we can solve our problems to maintain and 
develop our coalition government," Social Democratic Party (SDP) 
Secretary General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. 
  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) Secretary General Ichiro 
Ozawa, a top coalition strategist, also told reporters, 
"everything is going in the right direction," in a reference to 
the bickering among coalition partners over procedures to choose 
a replacement for Hosokawa. 
  At a session of their caucus on Tuesday evening, coalition 
executives concurred on the need to work out differences between 
them and coalition party leaders on the succession procedures, 
Kubo said. The top coalition officials will meet again on 
Wednesday morning to discuss the matter further, he said, adding 
he believes they can get down to the nitty-gritty of picking a 
candidate for the premiership from Wednesday. 
  While new party Sakigake (Harbinger), the Democratic 
Socialist Party (DSP) and the SDP favor the selection of a new 
premier at a forum of coalition chiefs, Shinseito, Komeito and 
Hosokawa's Japan New Party (JNP) contend the secretary 
general-level caucus should first discuss the matter. 
  Hosokawa, who remains in office until his successor is 
picked, had asked the coalition executives' forum to take charge 
of the selection business. 
  Earlier Tuesday, leaders of four coalition components met 
for 
a second time since Monday and shared the view that coalition 
chiefs should first discuss how to choose a candidate for the 
next premiership. 
  The four were Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura of 
Sakigake, Health and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi of the DSP, 
SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and Eiichi Nakamura of the 
Democratic Reform Party, a small parliamentary group in the 
House of Councillors. 
  Murayama twice proposed holding a meeting of coalition 
chiefs, once on Monday and again on Tuesday, to break the 
gridlock over the choice of a new premier, which poses a threat 
to the unity within the eight-month-old coalition. But leaders 
of four coalition partners -- Shinseito, Komeito, the JNP and 
the United Social Democratic Party -- rejected the bid and 
boycotted the two sessions. 
  The row over the procedures to find Hosokawa's replacement 
clearly revealed the deep gulf between the moderate-to-leftist 
Sakigake-DSP-SDP bloc and the more conservative 
Shinseito-Komeito camp over political philosophies and some 
fundamental national policies. 
  The known personal rivalry between Shinseito's Ozawa and 
Sakigake chief Takemura has also fueled the coalition's 
polarization into two blocs. 
  While hoping to install Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who 
heads Shinseito, as the new premier, the latter alliance has 
also been considering fielding former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a 
candidate to succeed Hosokawa. 
  Watanabe, whose close personal relationship with Ozawa is no 
secret, has signaled his readiness to run for the highest 
government office. 
  The Shinseito-Komeito bloc would give the boot to the SDP, 
the largest coalition contingent whose basic policies are still 
far apart from those of other coalition partners, should 
Watanabe decide to quit the LDP with a large number of his 
followers and join a part of the coalition, political sources 
said. 
  The ex-foreign minister said Tuesday he wishes to run for 
the 
premiership, "with an irreversible determination," even by 
launching a new party, said Seiichi Ota, a close associate of 
Watanabe. 
  While Watanabe's supporters are waging a campaign to have 
their boss selected as the LDP's candidate for the premiership, 
LDP President Yohei Kono himself vowed Tuesday to run in the 
parliamentary election to pick Hosokawa's successor. 
  The two men will meet Wednesday to exchange views on the 
selection of a replacement for Hosokawa, party officials said. 
  Sakigake, for its part, also showed interest in forming a 
tie-up with pro-reformers within the LDP, which was ousted from 
power last August for the first time in 38 years. Sakigake is 
an LDP breakaway party. 
  As the possibility increased of neither of the two plans 
bearing fruit, however, the squabbling coalition parties began 
moving to mend fences and maintain the current framework of 
their alliance. 
  "We faced a problem concerning the basis of the coalition 
this time," Kubo said. "I believe the coalition will grow 
solidified by overcoming problems like this."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The split in the governing 
coalition deepened Tuesday over how to pick a successor to Prime 
Minister Morihiro Hosokawa who announced his resignation last 
Friday, coalition sources said. 
  Leaders of three out of the seven parties in the coalition 
met again in the Diet, following the one on Monday. They were 
the heads of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the new party 
Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP). The head of 
a pro-SDP group in the House of Councillors, the Democratic 
Reform Party (DRP), joined the session. 
  SDP Chairman Tomiich Murayama, Sakigake leader Masayoshi 
Takemura and DSP Chairman Keigo Ouchi, DRP leader Eiichi 
Nakamura agreed in the meeting that they will never give the 
mandate on the choice of Hosokawa's successor to a lower-level 
forum made up of secretaries general, coalition officials said. 
  Heads of four other parties -- Shinseito, Komeito, the Japan 
New Party (JNP), and the United Social Democratic Party (USDP) 
-- again boycotted the top leaders' session proposed by the 
SDP's Murayama, arguing that the matter should first be 
discussed at the secretary general-level forum. They are 
Tsutomu Hata of Shinseito, Koshiro Ishida of Komeito, Hosokawa 
of the JNP, and Satsuki Eda of the USDP. 
  The SDP, Sakigake and DSP are wary that Shinseito Secretary 
General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa may take the leading role in the secretary 
general-level discussions over the choice of the successor. 
  After the three party leaders gave their blessings to 
Murayama's proposal to reserve the mandate to pick the new 
premier for themselves, the SDP-led camp conveyed its stand to 
the Shinseito-led forum, adding fuel to the intra-coalition 
hostilities. 
  Murayama, Takemura, Ouchi and Nakamura also agreed to band 
again whenever necessary, while monitoring how the Shinseito-led 
caucus would respond to their claim for the mandate, coalition 
officials said. 
  The Shinseito-led caucus has been insisting upon its 
authority to pick the coalition's next prime ministerial 
candidate on the strength of a statement by Hosokawa that he 
wants the caucus to take charge of decision-making on the 
"remaining" matters, they said. 
  However, Murayama rejected their interpretation, saying, 
"the 
premier's remark merely implied that he wants the caucus to take 
care of the remaining small businesses (until a next premier is 
picked)." 
  "In selecting the prime minister of a country, the meeting 
of 
the deputy chiefs of the parties should not be given the mandate 
to pick the premier," Murayama told the other three leaders from 
Sakigake, the DSP and the DRP. 
  Takemura told the top leaders meeting, "although I agree to 
make efforts to maintain the current combination, I want them 
(the Shiseito-led caucus) to feel repentant and amend the 
attitudes they have taken over the past eight months." 
  A Komeito official said of the rising intra-coalition 
standoff, "now it is impossible to mend fences." 
  "We cannot help altering a combination of political parties 
that comprise the ruling coalition government," he said. 
  Shinseito head Hata, who is the foreign minister, denied 
reports that the coalition is on the brink of collapse. 
  Hata told a news conference Tuesday, "it's true that various 
emotions are entangled." "But if we go back to the starting 
point of why we established the coalition, I think we can 
restore it." 
  JNP leader Hosokawa indicated there will be a recombination 
of parties in the eight-month-old ruling coalition, telling some 
party legislators "the coalition needs to accept a new group." 
  A separate standoff is beginning to undercut the solidarity 
of the No. 1 opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP), party sources said. 
  While the backers of former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe 
are waging a campaign to have him selected as the LDP's 
candidate for premiership, LDP President Yohei Kono announced 
his intention to run for premiership himself. 
  The LDP, the single largest party in the House of 
Representatives with a 219-legislator parliamentary strength, 
now stands a chance of sweeping back to power on the strength of 
the growing intra-coalition animosity, political sources said. 
  The majority in the 511-member lower chamber is 256. 
Watanabe backers said they have solicited the support from more 
than 40 LDP legislators by Tuesday. 
  If Watanabe wants to sweep to power as the head of a new 
coalition government, he needs to muster support of about 100 
LDP legislators, on top of the allegiance of the combined 
156-member strength of his own LDP faction, Shinseito, Komeito 
and the JNP, which are deemed to be ready to lend their support 
to Watanabe, the sources said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata denied suggestions Tuesday that the ruling coalition is on 
the brink of collapse over choosing a successor to outgoing 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hata, who is also a leader of Shinseito, one of the ruling 
parties, told a press conference the coalition has not broken up 
because meetings of the senior executives of the parties are 
still being held. "It's true that various emotions are 
entangled," Hata said. "But if we go back to the starting point 
of why we established the coalition, I think we can restore it." 
  He added that the coalition has solved various difficult 
problems since it came to power eight months ago. 
  The seven-party coalition is at odds over at what level to 
decide on a candidate to replace Hosokawa. The Social 
Democratic Party (SDP) called for a meeting of all the coalition 
party heads, but Shinseito, Komeito and the Japan New Party 
rejected the call. 
  Hata said Shinseito has already voiced its opinion in the 
executives' meeting that a meeting of the top leaders should be 
left to the last in deciding the succession issue. He suggested 
a meeting of executives and top leaders of the coalition 
together.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party 
(LDP) Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Friday [8 April] the 
party has no plan to appoint former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe as its vice president. 
  Mori told a press conference that he has no intention of 
asking Watanabe to become LDP vice president to meet calls for 
such a move within the party to strengthen the party leadership. 
"I don't think the leadership is so weak as to need 
reinforcement," Mori said, rejecting a charge from an intraparty 
group that the leadership is weak in fighting the coalition 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Mori criticized moves by some party members to have Watanabe 
promoted to the vice presidency, saying it could lead to an 
intraparty struggle.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Two Diet members of the 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are urging reform-minded members 
in the main opposition party to quit and form a new party, the 
ASAHI SHIMBUN reported Tuesday. The mass-circulation daily 
named the two as Michihiko Kano and Masayasu Kitagawa, both of 
whom have pushed for political and electoral reforms. 
  Kano, Kitagawa and their supporters are expected to leave 
the 
LDP in a day or two, at the earliest, the ASAHI said in its 
evening edition. 
  Kano has served as director general of the Management and 
Coordination Agency, while Kitagawa was once parliamentary vice 
minister of education. The two men are lobbying some 40 LDP 
legislators to join a new party they want to set up, and hope to 
get at least 20 members for it, the newspaper said without 
attribution. 
  Kitagawa is known for his close ties with new party Sakigake 
leader Masayoshi Takemura, who is the chief cabinet secretary. 
The pair plan to keep their distance from both the LDP and the 
ruling coalition, it said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Outgoing Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa on Tuesday urged coalition partners to halt an 
intracoalition standoff over key policies and ideologies to 
prevent the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) from sweeping back to 
power. 
  "It is critical to preserve the current overall combination 
of coalition partners by reviving the memory of the initial 
objective of the coalition," Hosokawa told Muneaki Samejima, the 
deputy secretary general of his Japan New Party. However, 
Hosokawa, who made a surprise resignation announcement on Friday 
over his personal financial deals, hinted it is also crucial to 
win over new defectors from the No. 1 opposition LDP saying, "it 
is important to have more new forces defect to our side." 
  Hosokawa's coalition stripped the LDP of its 38-year lock on 
power last August after dozens of LDP rebels splintered from the 
scandal-tainted party and joined the anti-LDP alliance. 
  In the campaign period that led up to the 1993 general 
election that brought him to power, Hosokawa made it clear that 
his chief aim was to oust the LDP, thereby revamping the 
political structure in place since 1955. 
  In a lecture meeting Tuesday afternoon in a Tokyo hotel, 
Hosokawa said he does not want to see Japan's power structure 
transformed back into the "1955 structure," where the LDP used 
to monopolize power on the basis of its pro-business, pro-U.S. 
economic and security policies. 
  He said, "although some politicians have proposed making 
Japan a `normal country' or a `country that shines,' or proposed 
getting social democrats and liberals together, these ideas are 
a mere ideological carryover from the now-defunct 1955 structure 
in which political debate was dominated by constitutional and 
security issues." 
  He was apparently referring to phrases coined by Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa who warned 
that the international community would not regard Japan as a 
"normal country" unless it assumed greater responsibility in the 
field of U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
  His reference to the phrase "a country that shines" revolved 
around Sakigake [Harbinger] leader Takemura's slogan that Japan 
would still receive respect from the international community 
even if it avoided taking a greater part in U.N. peacekeeping 
missions. 
  "Now that moves toward a reconfiguration of the political 
community have gained momentum since my announcement of the 
intention to step down, (the coalition) should unify themselves 
into a new party with their emphasis placed on a transformation 
of the nation's economic structure," he said. 
  However, Hosokawa sided with the position of Ozawa in 
dealing 
with Japan's defense policy in the face of North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development program. "We have to 
conduct domestic preparations so that we can respond 
appropriately to moves to be taken by the U.N. Security Council 
and relevant countries," he said. 
  He called for speeding up the process of toughening the 
relevant laws in advance in preparation for possible U.N. 
adoption of a resolution slapping economic sanctions on North 
Korea. 
  As for the burgeoning intracoalition hostilities over 
policies and ideologies, Hosokawa cautioned that the coalition 
might not be able to survive the current political turbulence 
which he compared to a storm at sea. 
  "Now that we are running a revolutionary government, we will 
not be able to survive the current storm unless we suspend the 
`theological dispute,' saying I like this man or dislike that 
person and taking issue with others' political tendencies or 
tactics," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister and Japan 
New Party (JNP) leader Morihiro Hosokawa indicated Tuesday there 
will be a recombination of parties in the eight-month-old ruling 
coalition, party officials said. Hosokawa, in a meeting with 
several JNP legislators, was quoted as saying, "the coalition 
needs to accept a new group." 
  The seven party coalition has shown signs of a split over 
the 
choice of a successor to Hosokawa who announced the resignation 
last Friday. 
  Three of the coalition parties -- Shinseito, Komeito and the 
JNP -- have strengthened solidarity, while the Social Democratic 
Party, new party Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party are 
forming a bloc against them. 
  There have [been] emerging signs of a split also in the main 
opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP has indicated 
willingness to join hands with the Shinseito-led group to run 
for the premiership.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa has refunded some of a loan extended by Sagawa Kyubin, 
a scandal-tainted trucking company, according to a newly-found 
document obtained by KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Hosokawa, who on Friday [8 April] abruptly announced his 
intention to resign, has come under attack over a 100 million 
yen loan he took from Sagawa Kyubin, as well as another 
financial deal related to the purchase of shares in Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT). Although Hosokawa has told 
the Diet he paid back the 100 million yen to Sagawa Kyubin, the 
opposition has alleged that he failed to do so, making the loan 
a de facto secret donation. 
  The newly found document is apparently a photocopy of part 
of 
Sagawa Kyubin's accounting data. It seemed to be copied from 
printed computer data of the company's accounts between 1986 and 
1988. It says the data are the item of loans extended by Sagawa 
Kyubin from the firm's balance sheet book. 
  According to the data, Hosokawa refunded 10 million yen 
respectively on May 28, 1986, February 10, 1987 and February 17, 
1988. 
  The dates and the amounts of money are the same as previous 
data submitted last December by Sagawa Kyubin to the Diet. 
However, the new document suggests the money was paid back 
through a bank, contrary to Hosokawa's explanation to the Diet 
that he had his secretary carry cash to refund Sagawa Kyubin. 
  Minao Hattori of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party 
said 
the loan which Hosokawa had his secretary refund may be a 
different loan from that stated in the new document. 
  The document was kept by a former Sagawa Kyubin employee who 
has entrusted it to an acquaintance. A former Sagawa Kyubin 
executive said the document apparently is of Sagawa Kyubin.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Planned hikes in utility 
and other public service charges are unlikely to put a damper on 
the economy, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [8 
April]. 
  The government has allowed in its economic forecast for a 
1.5 
percent rise in domestic prices stemming from the hikes provided 
for in the fiscal 1994 budget, Fujii told a regular news 
conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  The cabinet meeting reconfirmed the need to have related 
public utilities firms streamline their operations to avoid 
unnecessary rate hikes but did not decide to stop or squeeze the 
planned hikes. 
  Considering rate hikes proposed aside from the budget, Fujii 
said related ministries and agencies will decide on these based 
on the policy reconfirmed at the cabinet meeting. "There won't 
be much," he said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The latest statistics have 
yet not proved that the economy has hit bottom and prolonged 
political unrest may put a damper on public sentiment, Finance 
Minister Hirohisa Fujii said Tuesday [12 April]. "The economy 
is in a delicate stage" with both good and bad indicators, Fujii 
repeated at a news conference after a morning cabinet meeting. 
  Fujii was referring to a monthly economic report endorsed at 
the cabinet meeting. The report, compiled by the Economic 
Planning Agency, said the economy remains sluggish but included 
a phrase that some bright spots have emerged. 
  Fujii's cautious stance on the economy contrasts with that 
of 
Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and many private 
economists, who have recently suggested that the economy is 
showing signs of bottoming out. 
  The finance minister said the political uncertainty "is 
certainty not favorable" for corporate and consumer sentiment. 
He called for a settlement as soon as possible of the issue of 
choosing a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who 
announced his intention to resign last Friday. 
  Concerning tax reform, Fujii said, "the direction and track 
indicated by the Hosokawa cabinet will be inherited by any new 
cabinet." 
  "Tax reform should become the mainstay of any new cabinet," 
he said. The government has pledged to conduct a full tax 
reform, including permanent income tax cuts, by the end of the 
year, and promised in its March market-opening package to 
present details of the tax reform plan in June. 
  Legislators of both the ruling parties and the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party attached a provision to include 
permanent tax cuts in the tax reform when they enacted a 
single-year tax cut bill in March.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Barring a "big stumble," 
Japan's struggling economy is set to improve as bright signs 
emerge, economic planning chief Manae Kubota said Tuesday [12 
April]. 
  Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency 
(EPA), also told a regular news conference that Bank of Japan 
Governor Yasushi Mieno informed a morning meeting of economic 
ministers the economy is in a "delicate" phase, with recovery 
prospects still vulnerable. Noting that her agency's new 
monthly report cited some areas of "brightness" in the still 
"broadly sluggish" economy, Kubota cited such factors as 
improving corporate sentiment and consumption, with strong 
housing investment and higher purchases of durable goods and 
small cars. "If there is not a big stumble, the economy is 
headed in a good direction," she said. She cited such possible 
pitfalls as slack public works implementation due to the current 
political turmoil. 
  She quoted Mieno, who has also recently spoken of increasing 
bright signs in the economy, as citing such causes of 
uncertainty as domestic long- and short-term money market rates, 
as well as big changes in the U.S. stock and bond markets. 
Mieno said Japan's money supply growth remains weak as slack 
corporate demand for funding discourages banks from lending, 
according to Kubota. 
  She said the central bank chief also noted recent movements 
in various market rates, saying that the yield on 10-year 
government bonds briefly rose above 4.2 percent on worries over 
the high yen and a drop in stock prices. But he noted the 
unsecured overnight call-money rate remains "extremely low," she 
said. He cited recent moves by the Japanese currency up to 102 
to the dollar, back to around 105 and again to the 103 level, 
but the EPA chief said Mieno offered no comment on the moves. 
  Reflecting these uncertainties, long-term market rates have 
been showing "unstable" movements, trying to settle at levels 
that reflect economic conditions, Kubota quoted Mieno as saying. 
For her own economic outlook, Kubota cited an improving global 
trend, with U.S. and European economies brightening this year 
and most of Asia remaining strong. She also said that if this 
year's Japanese tax cuts are implemented as smoothly as planned, 
they could give an extra boost to an economy struggling to 
rebound. But she expressed concern about continued worsening 
trends in employment, citing a record high 3.18 percent 
unemployment rate for women in Japan.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Japan should in principle 
try to maintain self-sufficiency in rice, despite its decision 
to end the decades-old ban on rice imports, the Ministry of 
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in an annual report 
Tuesday [12 April]. 
  To that end, the fiscal 1993 white paper on agriculture says 
"a new control system" should be developed to ensure stability 
in domestic rice production and balanced supply and demand. 
The report does not mention any specifics of how such a new 
system should operate, although a ministry official said it is 
the first time for the ministry to use the phrase "new control 
system" in reference to rice in its official reports. 
  "This reflects the view that it's no good to just stick to 
the status quo," said Teruo Miyake, research division chief of 
the minister's secretariat. Miyake made the comment when 
reporters asked for comments on the existing rigid foodstuff 
control system. 
  Under the Food Control Law, the government regulates 
production and distribution of rice and bans commercial trade in 
rice. The law was also the legal backbone of Japan's ban on 
rice imports. Many consumer groups and farmers have criticized 
the law and its underlying system as outdated, since it was 
passed in 1951 when Japanese rice was in short supply. Under 
the law, the government used to buy much of the rice crop for 
resale to consumers at lower prices, but now buys less than a 
fifth and oversees the independent distribution of an additional 
40 percent. The remaining 40 percent is counted as being 
consumed by the farmers and their extended families, but some is 
distributed on the black market outside of government channels. 
  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced last December the 
partial lifting of the rice import ban as a concession to the 
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of global trade 
talks. But the food control law itself has been untouchable to 
date. Japan has also pledged to eliminate the remaining 
restrictions on imports of 12 agricultural products, including 
dairy products and corn starch, and to reduce tariffs on 
agricultural products. The report underlines the need for 
measures to minimize the impact on domestic farmers of the 
market-opening steps while promoting larger-scale farms to 
compete with imports. It also proposes the use of new 
technology and innovation to raise productivity under growing 
international competition. 
  Regarding the import of beef, which was liberalized in 1991 
under agreements with the United States and Australia, the 
report points to significant increases in both imports and 
consumption over the past few years. Per capita beef 
consumption for fiscal 1992 climbed 52 percent from fiscal 1985, 
but increased imports reduced self-sufficiency in beef from 72 
percent to 49 percent, the report says. It also notes that the 
sharp increase in beef imports has had a detrimental effect on 
domestic beef production, resulting in declining prices for 
wholesale beef and calves. The report urges promotion of 
large-scale beef production, selective breeding, and 
streamlining of production and distribution to slash production 
costs. 
  The report also touched on other topics: 
  -- The cool, wet summer last year caused record damage of 
1.3 
trillion yen to agricultural production, resulting in the worst 
rice harvest in the postwar period and a record 956 billion yen 
in damage to rice crops alone. 
  -- Food consumption by nonfarming households inched up 0.1 
percent in real terms in fiscal 1992. 
  -- Agricultural production rose 4.1 percent in fiscal 1992 
after a poor harvest in 1991, but remained below average as the 
agricultural production index stood at 99.4 against the base 
rate of 100 for fiscal 1990. 
  -- The agricultural work force fell 6.1 percent in fiscal 
1992, the largest drop in 12 years. 
  -- The 1992 food self-sufficiency rate was unchanged at 46 
percent on a caloric basis. The rate for grain was also 
unchanged at 29 percent. 
  -- Rice in Japan is about eight times more expensive than 
U.S. rice at the average exchange rate for 1993. Japanese rice 
was priced about four times higher than U.S. rice in the early 
1980s.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- The government Tuesday [12 
April] endorsed a bill to provide consumers with greater 
protection against accidents and injuries caused by defective 
products. The product liability bill would require consumers 
seeking compensation to simply prove that a product was faulty, 
instead of having to prove negligence by the maker which is 
necessary at present. 
  But the bill failed to include a provision holding makers 
liable for damage or injury through assumption of a link between 
the damage or injury and a product defect. The bill also limits 
the duration of liability by corporations to 10 years after 
products are put on the market, differing from the 20 years 
stipulated under the civil code. 
  Speaking before a regular news conference Tuesday, Economic 
Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota said the bill 
marks "a big turning point" for Japanese consumers. 
  Consumer protection in this country has improved to levels 
of 
the European Union, she said, terming the bill "the biggest 
reform effort for upgrading people's livelihood under the 
current cabinet." The bill is basically in line with 
recommendations made by the social policy council, an advisory 
body to the prime minister, in December last year. 
  The measure will be introduced in the parliament later 
Tuesday and could be implemented by the middle of 1995. It took 
almost 20 years for the bill to be finalized since the council 
first began debate on better consumer protection from defective 
products in 1975. 
  Under the bill, a product is regarded as defective if it 
lacks the safety that a user is entitled to expect. 
  Judgment on the safety will be made according to three 
criteria -- the nature and normally expected functions of the 
product, the timing of the product's shipment and whether or not 
it was in normal use. This is down from nine criteria 
recommended by the council. 
  The scope of products subject to the proposed law is defined 
as manufactured or processed products. 
  As a result, blood products, some of which were infected 
with 
the virus that causes AIDS, will be covered by the law. The 
council originally proposed that blood products be excluded. 
  The bill says those held liable for damage or injury are not 
only makers and importers but companies indirectly engaged in 
manufacturing, such as those indicated in a label of the 
product. But makers will be cleared of responsibility if they 
can show that defects could not have been foreseen even with 
up-to-date technologies available at the time of the product's 
distribution. 
  This provision is intended to avoid discouraging 
manufacturers from pursuing technological innovation, which 
would eventually work to the disadvantage of consumers, an EPA 
official said. 
  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai 
described the bill as "well balanced" in light of the overall 
framework of Japan's civil code and the current global trend 
toward better protection of consumers. 
  The Trade Ministry will make efforts to establish legal and 
other frameworks to upgrade products' safety, Kumagai told a 
regular press conference.

<F P=106> ["Eruption of Resentment" -- KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comments on the vigorous fighting of South Korean students and 
people against rice market opening by the Kim Yong-sam traitor 
clique which is warming up along with their anti-U.S., anti-war 
and anti-nuke struggle. Assessing this as an eruption of their 
pent-up grudge and resentment against the Kim Yong-sam group 
which has bartered away their vital rights to outside forces, 
after selling the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, the 
news analyst says: 
  The traitor Kim Yong-sam during his U.S. trip last November 
begged for an "international cooperation system" to hurt fellow 
countrymen and, in return for that, secretly promised a total 
opening of South Korea's rice market to the United States. This 
folly could be committed only by such heinous traitor as Kim 
Yong-sam who schemes to maintain and prolong his power with the 
backing of his master even if the lifeline of the six million 
farmers of South Korea must be cut off, the economy as a whole 
be driven into a fatal crisis and the entire nation fall a 
victim to a nuclear war of outside forces. 
  In an attempt to lull the angry public sentiments, the 
traitor staged the drama of dismissing the puppet minister of 
agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Behind the scene, he 
worked out a criminal document to widen the scope of farm market 
opening and is making haste with its "National Assembly 
approval." 
  With no bayonet-brandishing and deception can the fascist 
group block the righteous action of the South Korean people to 
defend the dignity of the nation and their vital rights. 
  Inevitable is the miserable doom of the treacherous regime 
of 
Kim Yong-sam.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- Yi In-mo, a former war 
correspondent of the Korean People's Army known as the 
incarnation of faith and will, who had been returned to the 
socialist motherland, sent letters to his friends in South Korea 
who had treated and looked after him like their own flesh and 
blood. 
  The letters were sent to Kim Sang-won and his wife in Kimhae 
County, South Kyongsang Province, who had brought home and taken 
a warm care of Yi In-mo when he had been living a hard life at a 
home for the aged, with his both arms and legs unable to move 
freely due to cruel tortures by fascist hangmen, and to Sin 
Chun-yong, a journalist of the magazine MAL, who had actively 
encouraged him in his writing of memoirs and edited his script, 
and to women Christians Pak Hong-cha and Yi Mi-sun who had 
rendered both material and moral aid to Yi In-mo until his 
return to the socialist motherland from the time he was 
suffering in prison, and to So Chun-sik, an unconverted 
long-term prisoner, who had fought together with him in prison, 
and to Yim Su-kyong, who had called on Yi In-mo to encourage him 
with ardent aspirations for the country's reunification. 
  Yi in the letters expressed thanks to them for their sincere 
help during his 34 year-long prison life and lonely life 
thereafter in South Korea, inquired after their health and wrote 
that he, a sick man unable to move around freely then, had 
completely recovered his health under the warm care of the DPRK 
and now enjoys a happy time with his family.

<F P=106> [Report by Yang Hyong-sop, alternate member of the Political </F>
Bureau of the Workers Party of Korea (WPK) Central Committee and 
chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), at a joint 
meeting of the DPRK Government, political parties, and public 
organizations at Pyongyang's People's Hall of Culture on 11 
April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Comrades: At a time when the national unity of a 
nation of 70 million is required more urgently than ever before, 
today we are holding a joint meeting of the republic's 
government, political parties, and public organizations to 
discuss practical measures to implement the 10-point program of 
great unity of the whole nation for national reunification 
personally worked out by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song on 
the occasion of the first anniversary of its publication. 
  Recognizing that this joint meeting has been convened at a 
very opportune time, now I am going to present a report "On 
Promoting the Indpendent and Peaceful Reunification of the 
Country by Thoroughly Implementing the 10-Point Program of the 
Great Unity of the Whole Nation for National Reunification," 
presented to the meeting as an agenda item. 
  As everyone knows, last April, at a grim time when a 
dangerous situation--in which a war could have broken out at any 
time on the Korean peninsula and in which the nation's supreme 
interest might have been infringed upon--was created due to the 
anti-republic maneuvers by outside forces and their followers, a 
handful of antinational forces, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song published the 10-point program of the great unity of the 
whole nation for national reunification, which he personally 
worked out based on his outstanding plan to open the nation's 
way of living by turning adversity into prosperity with the 
whole nation's united strength. [applause] 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, 
personally worked out by the great leader and adopted as the 
common action program of the nation for the peaceful 
reunification at the historic fifth session of the Ninth Supreme 
People's Assembly [SPA], brilliantly elucidates a wide road that 
can eliminate barriers lying on the road of national 
reunification with the nation's independent strength and achieve 
peace in the country and its independent and peaceful 
reunification. 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation 
clearly elucidates first of all the program's basic ideology for 
all of those who are concerned about the nation's destiny to 
firmly unite as one nation, transcending the differences in 
their residential districts and advocacy of ideology, and to 
make characteristic contributions for the country's 
reunification and for grandeur and prosperity of a reunified 
fatherland. The 10-point program also clearly elucidates the 
general goal of great national unity on founding an independent, 
peaceful, neutral, and pannational reunified state through great 
national unity; the ideological foundation of great national 
unity based on the love toward the nation and the spirit of 
national independence; and the principle of unity on achieving 
the nation's coexistence, coprosperity, and common interests and 
on serving everything for the cause of national reunification. 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation 
also extensively presents practical ways for great national 
unity, including the matters on suspending all hostile 
activities and on achieving mutual trust and unity between the 
North and the South; the matter on advancing toward the road of 
national reunification together, irrespective of one's advocacy 
of an ideology; the matter on protecting all assets belonging to 
individuals and groups and effectively utilizing them for 
national unity; the matter on achieving mutual understanding and 
trust of fellow countrymen and their unity through contacts, 
visits, and dialogue; and the matter on highly assessing those 
who have contributed to great national unity and to the cause of 
national reunification. 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation 
for national reunification is a great encyclopedia for national 
unity and the banner of national unity which integrates the 
valuable tradition of great national unity established in the 
days when the respected and beloved leader founded the 
Fatherland Restoration Society [FRS]--an original anti-Japanese 
national united front organization--during the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary struggle and led the anti-Japanese struggle for 
national liberation to victory by propagating the 10-point 
program of the FRS. The 10-point program also integrates the 
noble struggle experience attained in the struggle for building 
a new society and national reunification after the liberation. 
[applause] 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, 
which contains the respected and beloved leader's idea of great 
national unity and his noble will for reunification and 
patriotism, is the most reasonable and realistic great political 
program for national unity and a great charter for national 
reunification to which anyone who truly loves the country and 
the nation and desires national reunification can consent 
because of its thoroughly independent, patriotic, nation-loving, 
fair, and just position incorporating all situations. [applause] 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation 
is the noble crystalization of the great, broad politics and 
benevolence politics of our leader, who has devoted his entire 
life since he set off on the road of the revolution shouldering 
the destiny of the country and the nation for the country's 
independence and the national growth and prosperity all by 
himself and who embraces each fellow countryman with a 
boundlessly broad mind, accepting even those who committed 
crimes before the nation broadmindedly and generously, and 
leading the 70 million people toward reunification with tender 
care. [applause] 
  Truly, that the respected and beloved leader promulgated the 
10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for 
national reunification and bestowed the great program for 
national reunification on the entire fellow countrymen is 
another immortal achievement he has made in the glorious history 
of the struggle to pioneer the destiny of the country and the 
nation with great unity of the nation. It is a political event 
which has opened a new chapter of great national unity that must 
be recorded in national history as a remarkable event. [applause] 
  The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation 
commanded our nation's full support and consensus as soon as it 
was promulgated as it elucidated the ways to overcome the 
prevailing crisis and bring a breakthrough in the way of the 
nation. It vigorously encouraged and gave a strong impetus to 
the forward movement of the entire fellow countrymen toward 
national unity and national reunification. 
  As soon as the great leader's great historic reunification 
program was promulgated, the movement to implement the program 
was vigorously conducted as a pannational movement in the North, 
the South, and overseas, and the yearning of the entire nation 
for reunification became more intense than ever. The dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il--who devotes his all to bring our 
nation a reunified country upholding the noble will of the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song--elucidated specific directions and 
ways to vigorously wage the struggle to implement the 10-point 
program of the great unity of the whole nation on the basis of 
the entire nation. He exercised his wise leadership so that all 
the fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and overseas may 
unite on a pannational basis and launch themselves into the 
national movement to expedite and achieve reunification in the 
nineties. [applause] 
  Under the wise leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, we, in the northern half of the republic, have made 
every sincere effort to achieve reunification in the 1990's on 
united national strength under the uplifted banner of the 
10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. 
  In April 1993, we sent the text of the 10-point program of 
the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification 
to the authorities, political parties, public organizations, and 
individual personages in South Korea, including the chief 
executive [choegodanggukcha], and overseas compatriots, via 
international mail or various other means. And, in May 1993, we 
proposed an exchange of top-level special envoys of the North 
and South out of a single desire to open a road of national 
survival with the united efforts of the North and South and have 
repeatedly taken momentous measures to implement this proposal. 
  We also took positive measures last year to hold a 
pannational rally, which had taken place every year since 1990, 
in Seoul as a festival for the unity of the entire nation, both 
in name and in reality. We also opened the door to independent 
civilian dialogue [chajusonginnun mingan taehwa] and have made 
patient efforts to hold such dialogue. 
  South Korean people from all walks of life highly extolled 
the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation, 
describing it as the only banner of great national unity and a 
bright lighthouse that lights up the road of reunification, and 
are positively participating in the patriotic movement to 
implement this program. 
  The 5 million overseas compatriots residing in the five 
continents of the world have also launched the movement to 
collect 1 million signatures to implement the 10-point program 
of the great unity of the whole nation. They also proposed that 
this year be a year of great national unity and are vigorously 
waging a struggle for reunification and patriotism. 
  Revolutionary people of the world greatly supported and 
welcomed the 10-point program of the great unity of the whole 
nation because of its justness and compelling force. Over 200 
party and state leaders of the world have sent us messages or 
letters of solidarity to express their firm support for the 
10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. 
Furthermore, solidarity organizations in over 100 countries of 
the world, including the Asian Regional Committee for Korea's 
Reunification and the African Regional Committee for Friendship 
and Solidarity With the Korean People, are boldly launching the 
movement worldwide to support the 10-point program of the great 
unity of the whole nation. 
  This worldwide solidarity movement launched greatly 
encourages our people and vigorously inspires all fellow 
countrymen into a struggle for reunification and patriotism. 
  For the past year since the release of the 10-point program 
of the great unity of the whole nation for national 
reunification, the historic work of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song, compatriots in the North and South and overseas have 
been launching a reunification and patriotic movement for 
national reconciliation and unity, and the movement to extend 
solidarity with our people's struggle for independent, peaceful 
reunification has been launched worldwide. This vigorously 
demonstrates at home and abroad the justness and vitality of the 
10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation. This 
also shows that a new phase is being opened for national unity 
and fatherland reunification under the wise leadership of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. 
  On this occasion, when we are discussing practical measures 
to achieve reunification in the 1990's based the great unity of 
the whole nation, I, with the unanimous loyalty of all fellow 
countrymen, respectfully extend the great honor and warmest 
thanks to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, a peerless 
patriot, national hero, and lodestar of the fatherland's 
reunification, who released the 10-point program of the great 
unity of the whole nation, thus, brightly elucidating the road 
toward the fatherland's independent, peaceful reunification, and 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, our nation's destiny and 
symbol of the fatherland's reunification, who is leading us to 
break through the prevailing difficulties and achieve 
reunification in the 1990's on united national strength. 
[applause] 
  Comrades, achieving the great national unity by 
implementing the 10-point program of the great unity of the 
entire nation for national reunification is a very important 
matter related to the life and death of the nation today. 
  In his 10-point program of the great unity of the whole 
nation for national reunification, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song has taught: The unanimous demands and will of the whole 
nation is to achieve national reunification by terminating the 
history of division and confrontation which has lasted for 
nearly half a century. The whole nation should achieve a great 
unity to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of 
the fatherland. 
  The great unity of the whole nation is a basic condition for 
the independent and peaceful reunification of the fatherland. 
The reunification we desire is for the whole nation to 
harmonize and unite as one. 
  The 70 million fellow countrymen in the North, South, and 
abroad should first unite as one nation in any place and in 
whatever work, to consummate the historic cause for the national 
reunification, transcending differences in thought [sasang], 
ideologies [inyom], and systems. 
  The country's stern tensions created by outside forces and 
their few flunkeyistic and nation-selling follower forces within 
the nation require that we take more decisive steps 
[kyolchongjok chochilul chwihalgosul yoguhago issupnida] than 
ever before to achieve the great unity of the nation. 
  As is already known, the South Korean authorities, who 
finally broke up the exchange of special envoys appointed by the 
North-South highest authorities--which had been newly initiated 
by our side and carried out amid the great expectations and 
interest of the people at home and abroad--are unprecedentedly 
kicking up a reckless commotion of confrontation as a shock 
brigade of the imperialist reactionaries' anti-socialist and 
anti-republic plots and leading our country to the worst 
situation of extreme danger [wihomchonmanhan choeagui satae]. 
  Along with the United States, they have already formulated 
the so-caled New Operational Plan No. 5027 to invade our 
republic and have largely introduced lethal equipment--including 
fighter bombers, assault planes, and Patriot missiles--to South 
Korea from the United States. They have not only decided to 
again resume the provocative Team Spirit joint military 
exercise--which they had previously decided not to conduct--but 
also have inspired the atmosphere of war [chonjaeng punwigi] at 
home and abroad by loudly babbling that they should crush 
[apsal] someone by force. 
  Based on the unreasonable statement issued by the UN 
Security 
Council president, the South Korean authorities intend to 
escalate the commotion of pressure [apryok sodong] against us. 
Also, they are going to set a fire on a point of nuclear war by 
giving impetus to the nuclear development. 
  This clearly shows that the South Korean authorities have 
canceled the North-South agreement, promising nonaggression; 
nullified an agreement on converting the Korean peninsula into a 
nuclear-free zone; and pursued only confrontation and war. It 
is clear to everyone that when a fuse of nuclear war is ignited 
on the Korean peninsula, this will bring ruin to our country, as 
well as destroy our nation. 
  It is now the time for all 70 million fellow countrymen in 
the North, South, and abroad to unite as one in order to solve 
all problems arising in our nation from the principle of 
national independence. 
  All fellow countrymen in the North, South, and abroad should 
unite as one for the sake of national interest; prevent the 
disaster of an approaching nuclear war [tagaonun 
haekchonjaengui]; remove the wall of division; and open doors 
for independent and peaceful reunification. 
  To make all fellow countrymen in the North, South, and 
abroad 
firmly unite as one under the 10-point program of the great 
unity of the whole nation for national reunification, an arena 
for national dialogue reflecting the intention and demands of 
the 70 million fellow countrymen should be prepared. 
  All Korean compatriots should be aware of their lofty sense 
of responsibility and duty of being not only the masters who are 
responsible for the nation's destiny, but also the persons 
directly pioneering the nation's destiny, should confirm through 
frank dialogue that they are fellow countrymen who cannot live 
divided, and should seek concrete ways to achieve national unity 
as one nation, transcending ideologies and systems. 
  Proceeding from this desire we courteously propose to the 
South Korean authorities, political parties, and public 
organizations, individual figures, and compatriots overseas that 
a national conference be convened in either Pyongyang or Seoul 
to seek ways for great unity of the entire nation with the 
upcoming 15 August, one year prior to the 50th anniversary of 
national liberation, as an occasion. [applause] 
  The national conference may be in the form of a roundtable 
conference in which the authorities, representatives of 
political parties and public organizations, and individual 
personages in the North and the South and representatives from 
the compatriots overseas participate are on an equal footing. 
The conference may open-heartedly discuss the matters the whole 
nation is interested in, including practical measures to achieve 
great unity of the whole nation and the nation's common tasks 
which are raised as indispensable requirements in expediting 
reunification in the nineties. 
  Reflecting the desire of the compatriots in the North, the 
South, and overseas, I propose to send a letter containing the 
proposal for convening a national conference to the authorities, 
political parties, public organizations, individual personages 
in South Korea and to the compatriots overseas in the name of 
this joint meeting. 
  The letter containing our proposal for convening the 
national 
conference will, without doubt, evoke active support and 
sympathy among the compatriots in the North, the South, and 
overseas. 
  Also, I acknowledge that it is necessary to form a national 
conference preparatory committee composed of five delegates each 
from the North and South and overseas in order to successfully 
convene the national conference. 
  We think that it would be good to hold the first meeting of 
the national conference preparatory committee in Pyongyang or 
Seoul in around mid-May. 
  On this occasion, we demand that the South Korean 
authorities 
discontinue nuclear war exercises and abandon the international 
cooperation system for the sake of the great unity of the whole 
nation based on a stand of national independence and, thus, 
promote a favorable atmosphere for convening the national 
conference. 
  Our just patriotic cause of achieving the fatherland's 
reunification, the historic cause and the nation's earnest 
desire, with the great unity of the whole nation is 
ever-victorious. 
  Let us all more vigorously fight to achieve peace in the 
country and achieve reunification in the nineties based on the 
great unity of the whole nation in hearty response to the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song and under the wise leadership of the 
dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. [applause]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- A joint meeting of the 
Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, 
political parties and public organisations for accelerating the 
independent and peaceful reunification of the country by 
thoroughly implementing "10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" put 
forward by the great leader President Kim Il-song took place at 
the People's Palace of Culture on Monday. 
  Attending the meeting were Kang Song-san, Politburo member 
of 
the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and premier 
of the Administration Council, Kim Pyong-sik, vice-president of 
the DPRK and chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean 
Social Democratic Party, and other representatives of political 
parties and public organisations and officials concerned. 
  Yang Hyong-sop, alternate Politburo member of the WPK 
Central 
Committee and chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, 
delivered a report at the meeting. 
  The reporter said the 10-point programme of the great unity 
of the whole nation which was authored by the great leader and 
adopted as a joint action programme of the nation for peaceful 
reunification, for the unshakable independent and patriotic 
stand and fair and aboveboard stand running through all its 
points, serves as the most reasonable and feasible grand 
political programme of national unity and a grand charter of 
national reunification, which is acceptable to all who truly 
love the country and the nation and want the reunification of 
the country. 
  All Koreans should, above all, get united as one nation, 
irrespective of differences in ideology, idea and social system 
and occupation, in order to accomplish the historic cause of 
national reunification, the reporter said. 
  Stressing the need to arrange an arena of nationwide 
dialogue 
where the will and demand of the 70 million fellow countrymen 
could be brought together to closely unite all the Korean 
nationals in the North, the South and overseas in hearty 
response to the 10-point programme of the great unity of the 
whole nation, the reporter said: 
  All the Koreans, conscious of their heavy national 
responsibility and obligation to shape the destiny of the nation 
by themselves, must confirm through open-hearted dialogue that 
they are fellow countrymen who cannot live separated from each 
other and seek a detailed way of achieving national unity, 
transcending the ideology and system as the same nation. 
  Out of this desire, we courteously propose to the South 
Korean authorities, political parties, organizations and 
individual figures and overseas compatriots to have a national 
conference for seeking a way for great unity of the whole nation 
in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of August 15 this year, a 
year before the 50th anniversary of national liberation. 
  It may be a round-table conference to be participated in by 
the authorities and representatives of political parties and 
social organizations and individuals of the North and the South 
and representatives of overseas compatriots on an equal footing. 
  The participants may have an open-hearted discussion of 
practical measures for achieving a great unity of the whole 
nation, common tasks of the nation arising as prerequisites to 
realising national reunification in the '90s and other matters 
of concern for the whole nation. 
  I consider it necessary for the successful convocation of 
the 
national conference to form a preparatory committee of the 
national conference with five representatives each from the 
North, South and overseas. 
  We think that it is desirable to have the first meeting of 
the preparatory committee in Pyongyang or Seoul in mid- May. 
  We, availing ourselves of this opportunity, hold that the 
South Korean authorities must discontinue the nuclear war 
exercises and stop seeking an "international cooperation system" 
for the great unity of the whole nation, proceeding from the 
independent stand of the nation, to create a climate favourable 
to the convocation of the national conference. 
  Speeches were made at the joint meeting by Director Chong 
Mun-san of the Secretariat of the Administration Council; 
Vice-Chairman of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Korean Social 
Democratic Party Kim Yong-ho; Director of the Secretariat of the 
C.C., the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the 
Fatherland Yu Ho-chun; and Chairman of the C.C., the League of 
Socialist Working Youth of Korea Choe Yong-hae. 
  They urged the South Korean authorities to give up their 
foolish intention to solve something by relying on outside 
forces and respond to the proposal for the convocation of the 
historical national conference, accepting the 10-point programme 
of the great unity of the whole nation. 
  A letter to the South Korean authorities, political parties, 
organizations and individual figures and compatriots overseas 
was adopted at the meeting.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Foreign newspapers 
dedicated articles to the birthday of the great leader President 
Kim Il-song. 
  The Indian paper INDIAN TIMES in an article headlined 
"President Kim Il-song, Elder Statesman of the World" said: 
  His Excellency President Kim Il-song of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea was known as the youngest leader in 
the world in the 1940s and is lauded as the most veteran and 
authoritative leader today half a century since then. 
  President Kim Il-song is a great person who has a nearly 
70-year long history of political activities which can be said 
to be the whole life of a man. 
  He is the only statesman and practician in the world history 
of politics who founded the chuche idea and has applied it to 
practical activities. 
  The Korean people deem it a pride and happiness in national 
history to have such a leader. 
  The Bangladesh paper BANGLA BANI in an article headlined 
"Best Wishes for Longevity to President Kim Il-song" said: 
  History has recorded many famous leaders, but does not know 
such a great leader as President Kim Il-song. He is a great

as a true leader of the people. He has performed immortal feats 
in the struggle for the cause of the independence of the popular 
masses. 
  We wish a long life in good health to President Kim Il-song 
for the prosperity of Korea and the progress of mankind.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Celebration functions 
were held in different countries on the threshold of the 
birthday of the great leader President Kim Il-song. 
  A joint seminar took place in Harare, Zimbabwe. 
  In his report at the seminar N.T. Mawema, director of a 
department of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Zimbabwe African 
National Union-Patriotic Front and chairman of the Zimbabwean 
National Committee for the Study of the Chuche Idea, said: 
  President Kim Il-song is recognized worldwide as a genuine 
leader of the people. 
  History has registered many statesmen but such a great 
leader 
as President Kim Il-song cannot be found in it. 
  The chuche idea, the great guiding idea of the era of 
independence, has a strong attraction in leading the struggle of 
the world people to victory. This shows the exploits of the 
president as a rare thinker and theoretician. 
  Since President Kim Il-song successfully solved the problem 
of the succession of leadership for carrying forward the cause 
of socialism to accomplishment, the centre of the leadership of 
the cause of global independence and the cause of socialism has 
been established, firmly guaranteeing its victory. 
  A celebration meeting, a lecture meeting and an opening 
ceremony of a month of DPRK photo exhibition were held in 
Lusaka, Zambia, by the housing construction company of the Kim 
Il-song Institute of Agricultural Science in Guinea and by the

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The Russian paper 
VETERAN No. 10 carried an article headlined "Veteran Statesman 
of the World". 
  The article said: 
  President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea became a head of state in the 40s of the present century. 
In those days he was known as the youngest leader in the world. 
He is recognized as the most experienced and authoritative 
elder, a leader of worldwide fame, today nearly a half century 
since then. 
  He has some 70-year long record of political activities. 
There is no man who has political experiences of so many years 
like him, we dare say. 
  His policies have been lauded by the Korean people and whole 
mankind for years. This is interpreted as the incomparable 
greatness of his immortal idea and his feats as a leader. 
  Once, many states of the Third World considered the destiny 
of their nations in relation to the orientation chosen by the 
big powers of the East and the West. But President Kim Il-song, 
with his high national dignity based on the chuche idea, 
indicated the unique way of building a new society. Therefore, 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea could avoid the 
mistakes committed by the East European countries. 
  A U.S. journalist who witnessed the reality of Korea 
admitted 
that though the U.S. President was delighted to say socialism 
was living its last days, the socialism of Korea led by 
President Kim Il-song is victoriously advancing, gripping the 
hearts of the people of the five continents of the planet. 
  The Korean people deem it a great pride in their national 
history to have such a leader.

<F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN on Heroic Epical Record of Comrade Kim </F>
Il-song" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
comes out with a by-lined article titled "Respected Comrade Kim 
Il-song Is a Great Leader Who Has Fought His Way Through 
Rigorous Storms of Revolution With Iron Will." 
  In the first part, the article says respected Comrade Kim 
Il-song is a great leader of the revolution who has performed 
immortal exploits, which will shine through centuries, pushing 
his way through raging storms of revolution with his iron will 
and rare leadership ability. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: 
  "Although manifold grim tests hard to overcome cropped up in 
the way of our revolution including the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary war, the Fatherland Liberation War and postwar 
reconstruction, our leader met them with the iron will that the 
sky could fall and he would not care, and led the revolution and 
construction to a constant upswing with his extraordinary 
leadership ability." 
  The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song enjoys undisputed 
trust and praise from the revolutionary people of the world as 
the most veteran leader of the revolution in our time. 
  Our leader's high authority and prestige are attributable to 
the immortal exploits he has performed for the time and 
revolution, victoriously leading the protracted and arduous 
Korean revolution. 
  What is most important in his leadership of the Korean 
revolution is that he has valiantly pushed through countless 
difficulties and trials standing in the way of revolution with a 
matchless iron will. 
  His will is an iron will which wavers not a bit in any 
thunderbolt, an unexcelled offensive spirit of courageously 
meeting manifold difficulties and trials and an indomitable 
fighting spirit. It is a great mental power unrivalled in 
resoluteness, staunchness and principle. 
  Thanks to his iron will, the Korean people today win victory 
after victory in an acute confrontation with the imperialists. 
  What is also important in his leadership of the Korean 
revolution through grim trials of history is that he has 
victoriously led the revolution and construction, always full of 
confidence in victory and revolutionary optimism. 
  The just cause of revolution for the independence of the 
people is sure to win victory. This is an unshakable will and 
optimism which the great leader has maintained since the 
beginning of his revolutionary activities. 
  When some people who had been aspiring after socialism lost 
confidence after the collapse of socialism in some countries in 
recent years, the great leader instructed that the course of the 
change of the present situation must be viewed optimistically, 
not pessimistically. 
  Thanks to this revolutionary position and leadership of the 
great leader, the Korean people continue fighting staunchly for 
the accomplishment of the socialist cause of chuche, full of 
confidence in victory and optimism. 
  The great leader's leadership is also fully demonstrated in 
that he firmly believes in the people under the difficult and 
complex situation and unreservedly mobilizes their inexhaustible 
strength to push through the difficulties. 
  When you firmly believe in the people and rely on them at 
all 
times, you always emerge victorious; if you are forsaken by 
them, you always fail. This is the maxim the great leader has 
kept in his struggle and life since he embarked on the road of 
revolution. 
  With the noble idea of "believing in the people as in 
heaven" 
and wise guidance of the great leader who pushes ahead with the 
revolution and construction with absolute trust in the people 
and in reliance on them at all times, our socialist cause will 
constantly advance and emerge victorious, pushing through any 
storm and stress, with the great strength of chuche. 
  In the second part, the article says the proud history of 
our 
revolution which has emerged victorious through the rigorous 
storms of history under the wise guidance of the great leader 
teaches the people the precious truth of revolution. 
  The truth is that when the people fight, deeply trusting a 
great leader as their mental support, they can overcome any 
adversity and ordeal and win victory in the revolution, and that 
the unity of the leader and the people in a harmonious whole is 
a decisive guarantee for victory in the revolution. 
  Our people have been able to win a great victory in the 
revolution and construction, through so difficult and arduous 
struggles, because they have lived and fought staunchly with the 
great leader as their mental support at all times. 
  In our revolutionary ranks, the leader and the people are 
not 
merely in relation between the leader and the led, but they form 
a solid community, an integral whole of one ideology and will, 
breathing the same breath. The might of this integral whole is a 
main factor which has produced the singlehearted unity of the 
revolutionary ranks, strengthened our party and trained our 
revolutionary Armed Forces into an invincible combat unit. 
  Our people have a firm guarantee for victoriously advancing 
and accomplishing our revolutionary cause in any test and 
difficulty. 
  Our people are the most proud and happiest people in that 
they are under the wise guidance of the great leader and the 
dear leader who are victoriously leading our revolution through 
grim trials. We have a solid singlehearted unity, impregnable 
party and government, invincible revolutionary Armed Forces and 
a powerful independent economy with which we can advance the 
revolution and accomplish it with our own strength under 
whatever situation. 
  The history of revolutionary struggle of our party and 
people 
will shine forever as an ever-victorious history because the 
entire people are staunchly fighting in singlehearted unity with 
the great pride and honor of making revolution under the great 
leader and the dear leader.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- Thanks to the 
leadership of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song who has 
made uninterrupted trips to give on-the-spot guidance to the 
people all his life the Korean people are victoriously advancing 
the revolution and construction along a straight path, with the 
most correct line and policy of socialist construction, says 
NODONG SINMUN today. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: 
  "The leader's life can be said to be a life of constant 
trips 
of on-the-spot guidance to the people. The leader has rendered 
great services for the people all his life and he is making 
uninterrupted trips of on-the-spot guidance to the people still 
today in his eighties." 
  The author of the article says: 
  The history of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
revolutionary activities is recorded with protracted struggles 
and feats; it is a history of on-the-spot guidance, for which he 
has always found himself among the people and shared weal and 
woe with them. 
  He always goes wherever workers, farmers and working 
intellectuals live and work, hears what they want and demand, 
and fully reflects it in new lines and policies for a victorious 
advance of the Korean revolution. 
  The Chongsan-ri spirit and method, the revolutionary work 
method of our party, was created in the course of his continuous 
on-the-spot guidance. He guided Chongsan-ri on the spot for 
half a month, grasped with his keen insight the matured demand 
of our revolution at a new stage of development and clearly 
indicated the orientation and concrete tasks of socialist rural 
construction. In this period, he set a great example of the 
revolutionary work method, including the method of the superior 
helping the subordinate and giving precedence to political work 
in all affairs. 
  The unique policy of agricultural cooperativization, which 
was the first to indicate the way of transforming economic 
sectors on socialist lines before technical reconstruction, the 
Taean work system, a chuche-based system of socialist economic 
management, and the new system of agricultural guidance were all 
created and proved their worth in the course of his on-the-spot 
guidance. 
  In the course of his on-the-spot guidance, the great leader 
conceived and created with his tireless activities all the 
unique ideas, theories and policies of our party including the 
line of the ideological, technical and cultural revolutions, the 
rural theses, the theses on socialist education, the chuche 
method of farming promising bumper harvests under whatever 
unfavorable conditions, the invincible vitality of which has 
been fully displayed along with the victorious advance of our 
revolutionary cause. 
  If one believes in the people and relies on them, one gains 
everything and wins victory every time--this is the unshakable 
creed of Comrade Kim Il-song. So, he has traversed the long 
course of revolutionary struggle with absolute trust in the 
people and the firm determination to lead the revolution always 
in reliance on them. 
  There is no such leader as Comrade Kim Il-song who has 
performed great exploits, always finding himself among the 
people, sharing weal and woe with them and enjoying their praise 
and deep trust, with the noble idea of "believing in the people 
as in heaven" as his motto. 
  Our people deeply feel through their historical experience 
and reality how honorable and happy they are to live and make 
revolution under Comrade Kim Il-song who visits people for 
on-the-spot guidance all his life. They are staunchly fighting 
full of confidence and optimism, entrusting their destiny and 
future entirely to him. 
  It is because he always finds himself among the people, 
mobilizes them and leads our revolution from victory to victory, 
that the socialist cause of chuche is firmly defended, the 
challenges and aggressive moves of the imperialists and 
reactionaries were decisively repulsed and the Korean 
revolution and the cause of anti-imperialist independence have a 
bright future.

<F P=106> ["Guideline for Development of Chuche-Based Health Service" </F>
-- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates an article to the 20th anniversary of the publication 
of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's famous work "On 
Further Developing Health Care for the People" (April 9, 1974). 
  The author of the article says: 
  The work is a highly important guideline which opened a 
bright road of developing health service to a new, higher stage 
as required by the modelling of the whole society on the chuche 
idea. 
  The work says socialist medicine is preventive medicine, the 
basic mission of which is to prevent diseases and protect and 
promote the health of the people. 
  On the basis of a scientific exposition of the essence, 
character and basic mission of socialist medicine, the work 
calls for correctly implementing the party's policy of 
preventive medicine through energetic hygiene propaganda, 
hygiene culture, prevention of pollution and anti-epidemic work. 
  The work gives answers to all questions arising in the 
development of health care, including the enhancement of the 
standard of medical (?assistance), development of chuche-based 
medical science and technique and improvement of the quality of 
medical education. 
  The work has served as a powerful weapon in exalting the 
health care system of Korean-style socialism centred on the 
masses because it gives answers to theoretical and practical 
questions in the improvement of socialist health service and 
helps further develop health service as required by our 
revolution and the reality of health care. 
  A phenomenal progress has been made in health service and 
its 
material and technical foundation has been consolidated through 
the efforts to implement the tasks set out in the work over the 
last 20 years. 
  Today the number of doctors in Korea is 29.7 per 10,000 
people and that of hospital beds is 136. This is the highest 
level in the world. 18.4 times of medical service is given to 
each head of the population in a year. Life expectancy at birth 
is 74.5 years.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee 
[C.C.] of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] hosted a reception 
for a delegation of the National Democratic Congress of Ghana 
headed by its General Secretary Huudu Yahaya Monday evening. 
  Speaking at the reception, Politburo member and secretary of 
the C.C., the WPK Kye Ung-tae said the WPK highly estimated the 
leadership of Ghana in its strivings to expand and strengthen 
the party on a broad mass foundation and for the national unity 
of the Ghanaian people and stability of the country and 
independent development of the national economy under the 
correct leadership of respected His Excellency President Jerry 
John Rawlings. 
  "We express full support to the position of the independent 
external policy of the party and government of Ghana advocating 
a new international political and economic order, adhering to 
the idea and principle of the non- aligned movement and 
developing South- South cooperation," he said. 
  Noting that the international situation now demands the 
bonds of friendship and solidarity be further strengthened 
between the two parties and two countries striving for national 
independence and independent development of the country, he 
expressed the belief that the delegation's current visit to 
Korea would make a new contribution to the development of 
friendly relations between the two countries. 
  Speaking next, General Secretary Huudu Yahaya said the 
chuche 
idea is a great idea expounding the position and role of man in 
the world, and a new international economic order can be 
established only on the basis of this idea. 
  Ghana always follows with deep interest the development of 
the situation in Korea, and holds that the DPRK-USA relations 
should be solved peacefully on an equal footing, he said. 
  He noted that they learn a lot of things from the great 
leader President Kim Il-song, the most distinguished man in the 
present time. The idea of the great leader who has devoted his 
whole life for the people must be followed in many countries, he 
stressed.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Deputies to the state 
Duma of the Russian federation expressed deep concern over the 
situation of the Korean peninsula which had been brought back to 
an acute phase. 
  A joint statement was released on April 4 by seven deputies 
including the Deputy Speaker of the state Duma, A. Vengerovsky, 
and the chairman of the committee for issues of social 
federations and regional organizations of the state Duma, V. 
Zorkaltsev, with regard to the grave situation currently created 
on the Korean peninsula. 
  The joint statement said: "We are surprised and angered at 
the fact that some quarters of the United States, seeking the 
establishment of a so-called `new world order', have raised a 
new unjustifiable condition to our traditional ally, the DPRK, 
and are increasing the tension again, threatening that they will 
resume the `Team Spirit' joint military exercises with South 
Korea and not come to the third-round of the DPRK-U.S. talks." 
  The joint statement called upon the DPRK and the U.S. to 
take 
all necessary steps to continue the talks for guaranteeing peace 
on the Korean peninsula.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The Central Peoples' 
Committee and the Administration Council of the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea Thursday sent a joint message of 
greetings to the International Chuche Idea Seminar on 
Independence, Peace and Friendship which opened in New Delhi in 
celebration of the 82nd birthday of the great leader President 
Kim Il-song. 
  The current seminar is of particular significance as it is 
open at a time of historical turn when the cold war ended and 
the desire of the popular masses for independence has grown 
stronger than ever before, the joint message says, and goes on: 
  The chuche idea is the most independent idea for defence of 
the independence of the country and its free development against 
all manner of domination and subjugation; it is a peaceloving 
and internationalist idea which opposes aggression and war and 
urges the peoples of all countries to love and cooperate with 
one another and achieve common prosperity. 
  As they have strictly applied the chuche idea to the 
building 
of a new society under the wise guidance of the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, 
the Korean people have been able to build an independent 
socialism centred on the popular masses and firmly defend the 
sovereignty of the country and strengthen friendship and 
solidarity with the world progressive people in face of the 
imperialists' moves to stifle our country, which have been 
intensified as never before. 
  When the idea of independence, peace and friendship 
indicated 
by the chuche idea is upheld, the age-old desire of mankind to 
live a free and peaceful life in an independent world and 
achieve an eternal prosperity, uniting and cooperating with one 
another, will certainly be realized. 
  Although there still remain on the globe the old forces 
seeking domination and subjugation, aggression and war and the 
people's cause of independence is undergoing a grim test, it is 
temporary and no force on earth can arrest the onward movement 
of mankind on the track of independence. 
  The message expresses the belief that the seminar will make 
a 
great contribution to the accomplishment of the noble cause of 
mankind for realizing the idea of independence, peace and 
friendship and wishes the seminar success.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The seventh board 
meeting of the Asian Regional Institute of the Chuche Idea 
(ARIJI) was held in New Delhi on April 8. 
  The meeting reviewed the activities of the ARIJI after its 
sixth board meeting and discussed future tasks. 
  ARIJI Secretary General Govind Narain Srivastava made a 
report titled "Let Us More Energetically Study and Disseminate 
the Chuche Idea To Achieve Asian Independence". 
  The reporter said the achievements in the institute 
activities in the period of review are that it has been proved 
through realities that the confidence in socialism of chuche has 
rooted in the minds of the Asian followers of the chuche idea as 
a strong ideological pillar unshaken in any trial and the study 
and dissemination of this idea have been conducted in various 
forms and ways in close combination with the specific conditions. 
  "Those brilliant achievements are a precious fruition of the 
wise guidance and deep solicitude of the great leader His 
Excellency President Kim Il-song and the dear leader His 
Excellency Kim Chong- il," he added, and said: 
  "We are facing an honorable task at present to consolidate 
and develop these achievements and make a positive contribution 
to bringing about a turn in the consciousness of the popular 
masses who have risen up in accomplishing the noble cause of 
building an independent, new world. Outlining the task, he said: 
  "If the study and dissemination of the chuche idea are to be 
developed in conformity with the requirement of the realities, 
greater efforts should be directed to the study and 
dissemination of the ideas and theories of the dear leader His 
Excellency Kim Chong-il. 
  "In recent years His Excellency Kim Chong-il has developed 
and enriched the chuche idea and published many monumental works 
giving profound answers to the urgent problems raised by the 
present era. 
  "We should conduct brisk activities for the publication and 
dissemination of these works, study and disseminate the chuche 
idea with them as the basic textbooks, and study, analyse and 
solve the practical problems on the basis of the profound ideas 
expounded in the works. 
  We should expand the ranks of the followers of the chuche 
idea and, on this basis, broaden our organizations and 
strengthen ideological and moral unity and cohesion of their 
members, thus making our organizations a model for the 
collectives of socio-political life which serve the people's 
cause of independence. 
  "Clearly conscious that defending Korean socialism is 
immediately to defend our own idea, we should lift up louder 
voices exposing and denouncing the imperialists' anti-socialist 
moves and closely rally all the socialist forces under the 
banner of the Pyongyang declaration. And we should wage a 
vigorous movement against a nuclear war in Korea, solidarizing 
with anti-war, peace organizations and make a positive 
contribution to an early realization of the proposal for 
founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, mindful of 
the important position of the independent and peaceful 
reunification of Korea in achieving the independence and peace 
of our continent.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The 11th meeting of 
the board of the International Institute of the Chuche Idea 
(IIJI) took place in New Delhi on April 8. 
  The meeting dealt with the question of ensuring the success 
of the International Chuche Idea Seminar on Independence, Peace 
and Friendship to be held on the threshold of the 82nd birthday 
of the great leader President Kim Il-song, reviewed the 
activities of the IIJI in 1993 and discussed the action program 
for 1994. 
  Shuhachi Inoue, director general of the board of IIJI, made 
a 
report at the meeting under the title "Let Us Conduct More 
Energetic Study and Dissemination of the Chuche Idea for the 
Building of an Independent New World". 
  The reporter said the chuche idea founded by respected 
President Kim Il-song and developed in depth by esteemed 
Secretary Kim Chong-il serves as the guiding idea of our era, 
the era of independence, because it is the outlook on the world 
and the view of value indicating the way of realizing the 
independence of man. 
  Touching on the achievements made in last year's activities 
for the propaganda and dissemination of the chuche idea and its 
study, he said political parties of a number of countries have 
defined this idea as their guiding idea and are assiduously 
studying it and the chuche-based theory of party building and 
applying them to their party activities. 
  He outlined this year's tasks to invigorate the study of the 
chuche idea and its propaganda and dissemination. 
  "All the chuche idea study organizations and followers of 
the 
chuche idea," he said, "should continue to widely conduct the 
study and discussion of classical works of President Kim Il-song 
and Secretary Kim Chong-il, regarding them as the textbooks." 
  He stressed that they should deeply study and discuss the 
general principles and theories of the chuche idea in 
combination with practical problems, thus finding a correct way 
of building an independent, new world and accelerating the 
historical turn to this world.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The International 
Chuche Idea Seminar on Independence, Peace and Friendship opened 
in New Delhi on April 8, at which Prof. and Dr. T.B. Mukherjee, 
vice-director general of the International Institute of the 
Chuche Idea [IICI] and president of the Asian Regional Institute 
of the Chuche Idea, made a report entitled "The Chuche Idea Is a 
Scientific Doctrine Indicating the Road of Independence, Peace 
and Friendship". 
  The reporter said the universal truth of the chuche idea has 
been more eloquently proved by the trend of the development of 
history in which the desire of the popular masses to advance 
towards independence has grown more intense than ever before 
after the end of the Cold War. 
  "President Kim Il-song founded the chuche idea, the first 
man- centred doctrine in history, which scientifically shows the 
road of shaping the destiny of man, giving peoples high pride 
and consciousness of being the masters of the world and their 
own destinies and powerfully inspiring them to the building of 
an independent, new world, the century-old desire of mankind," 
he stressed. 
  Referring to the historical inevitability of the downfall of 
imperialism and the appearance of an independent, new world, he 
said: 
  "If the imperialists persist in their policy of strength to 
maintain and expand the old order of domination and subjugation, 
taking advantage of the collapse of the balance of forces in the 
world arena, they will not only face a strong resistance of the 
anti-imperialist independent forces but also be forsaken by 
their companions and meet their destruction in the long run. 
  "The downfall of imperialism is inevitable in the 
development 
of history but it will never quit the arena of history 
voluntarily. In order to hasten its fall it is urgent to form a 
broad anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. joint front. All the 
countries of the world aspiring after independence and peace, 
including the socialist countries and non-aligned nations, and 
political parties, public organizations and international 
organizations should join this front on a broad basis. 
  "Only when the developing countries realize regional 
economic 
cooperation under the banner of collective self-reliance is it 
possible to jointly defend the regional economic interests from 
the imperialist plunder and successfully ensure economic 
exchange and development among nations. 
  "The material foundation of an independent world will be 
laid 
when the gap in wealth between the developed capitalist 
countries and the developing countries is narrowed and 
homogeneity is increased in economic development. If an 
independent idea and culture are developed and the world 
political order is democratized to correspond with this material 
foundation, the knell of imperialism will be sounded and an 
independent, new world will come into being". 
  Noting that independence, peace and friendship are the basic 
idea of global independence, the reporter quoted respected 
President Kim Il-song as saying: 
  "Independence, peace and friendship are the common ideals of 
the progressive people of the world. The Cold War has ended and 
the democratic and independent development of the international 
community will be accelerated still faster. 
  The 21st century will be a new historic century in which the 
people of all countries will enjoy welfare and prosperity in a 
free and peaceful new world." 
  "The basic demand preferential in creating an independent, 
new world is to apply the idea of independence," the reporter 
said, and continued: 
  "Independence is the life not only of each man but also of 
each country and nation and, furthermore, the common life of 
mankind. 
  "Each nation must firmly maintain its independence and 
respect other's independence. 
  "Defending the principle of independence in international 
relations is not contradictory to internationalism but is the 
basis of true internationalism. 
  "The main target of struggle in realizing the idea of 
independence is the imperialist forces. This idea will be 
realized on a full scale when the anti-imperialist independent 
forces the world over check and frustrate the dominationist 
moves of the imperialists by their united strength. 
  "It is an indispensable prerequisite to the building of an 
independent, new world to prevent war and ensure peace of the 
world. To this end, it is necessary to get rid of the 
dominationist idea of power almighty favoring the settlement of 
all issues by strength, which is a mode of thinking in the Cold 
War. 
  "All the peaceloving forces should launch a vigorous 
struggle 
to check and frustrate the arms expansion by the imperialists, 
remove their aggressive military bases in other countries, get 
the aggressive military blocs dissolved, create nuclear-free, 
peace zones in many regions of the world and realize a universal 
and complete disarmament. 
  "It is an essential requisite to the building of an 
independent, new world to develop friendly and cooperative 
relations among peoples defending independence. An important 
question in developing those relations at present is to destroy 
the old international order and establish a new, fair one in all 
spheres, politic, economic and cultural. 
  "Developing South-South cooperation is an important way of 
ensuring friendship and cooperation among peoples and achieving 
common prosperity of mankind". 
  Calling for active propaganda and dissemination of the 
chuche 
idea, the reporter said: 
  "It is the chuche idea which scientifically indicates the 
main orientation and ways for the development of the present era 
heading for an independent, new world. It is the demand of the 
times and honorable duty to widely disseminate this idea. 
  "What is most important in propagandising and disseminating 
the chuche idea is to make a deep study of works of Comrade Kim 
Chong-il, the sagacious leader of the Korean people. His works 
consummate the precious experiences of the Korean people in 
successfully building anthropocentric socialism with a 
singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses and 
give profound answers to the important theoretical and practical 
problems arising in the advance of mankind along the road of 
independence in the present time. That is why his many works, 
including `The Historical Lesson in Building Socialism and the 
General Line of Our Party', `On the Fundamentals of 
Revolutionary Party Building' and `Abuses of Socialism Are 
Intolerable", have evoked a great sympathy among the progressive 
people of the world today." 
  The reporter stressed the need to conduct the work of 
disseminating the chuche idea among the broad masses of people 
through various art activities based on the chuche view of life 
and value and in combination with various socio-political 
activities such as the movement for democracy, anti-war, 
anti-nuke peace movement and environmental protection movement 
in close link with progressive political parties. 
  He said each chuche idea study organization should conduct 
the work of disseminating and applying the chuche idea by its 
own efforts in conformity with the interests of its people and 
specific conditions of its country and lead the popular masses 
to be the masters in this work. 
  He called for an energetic effort for the dissemination of 
the chuche idea to accelerate with redoubled vigor the building 
of an independent, new world where the ideals of independence, 
peace and friendship would be embodied.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- A declaration was 
adopted at the international chuche idea seminar on 
independence, peace and friendship held in New Delhi. 
  It says the seminar was a more significant and auspicious 
meeting as it was held on the occasion of the 82nd birthday of 
respected president Kim Il-song, the founder of the immortal 
chuche idea and guide of the popular masses' cause of 
independence. 
  "The seminar stressed in unison that though the onward 
movement of mankind is undergoing a test, it is temporary, and 
the present time is an era of a historic turn in which the 
people refuse the old world of domination and subjugation and 
they are advancing toward a new independent world," the 
declaration notes, and continues: 
  "Independence, peace and friendship are the basic idea which 
must be applied to the international relations for the building 
of a new world, independent and peaceful, in which the peoples 
of all countries around the world would develop and prosper 
alike, loving and cooperating with each other as the common 
masters of the world. 
  "The great chuche idea is the true outlook on the world in 
our era whereby mankind can realise its age-old desire to live 
and develop independently and creatively, loving and cooperating 
with each other in a free and peaceful world without domination 
and subjugation, aggression and war. 
  "We express full support and firm solidarity for the just 
efforts of the Korean people to reunify the country 
independently and peacefully, firmly defending the cause of 
socialism under the banner of the chuche idea. 
  "Today the entire Korean people are waging a resolute 
struggle to defend and develop socialism, singleheartedly united 
around dear Comrade Kim Chong-il, the outstanding leader of the 
Workers' Party and people of Korea and supreme commander of the 
Korean People's Army, thus powerfully demonstrating the 
advantages and invincible vitality of anthropocentric socialism, 
an embodiment of the chuche idea. 
  "It is a noble duty of the followers of the chuche idea and 
the progressive people the world over to actively defend the 
socialism of Korea from the attack and abuses of the 
imperialists and reactionaries. 
  "We strongly reject any attempt to stifle the socialism of 
Korea under the pretext of `nuclear issue', regarding it as an 
act going against the trend of the times toward independence 
and a challenge to the progressives. 
  "We must not be pessimistic but optimistic of the events of 
the last decade of the 20th century and greet the new century 
with firm readiness and determination to more vigorously push 
ahead with the onward movement of history toward independence. 
  "No force can turn back the powerful flow of our era toward 
the building of an independent, new world under the banner of 
the chuche idea and the cause of independence of the masses 
will certainly end in victory."
