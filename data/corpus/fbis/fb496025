  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Initial fiscal 1994 
budgets of prefectural governments nationwide, including the 
Tokyo Metropolitan Government, totaled 48,371.1 billion yen, up 
3.0 percent from the previous year, the Home Affairs Ministry 
said Friday [15 April]. 
  The growth rate for prefectural budgets for the year that 
started on April 1, excluding the budgets of Ishikawa, Kyoto and 
Nagasaki prefectures, was 3.4 percent, compared with 3.7 percent 
for the national government's local fiscal program for the year. 
  The three prefectures had compiled only minimal budgets due 
to their gubernatorial elections. 
  In the prefectural budgets, excluding those of the three 
prefectures, public works projects financed by local governments 
alone were expanded 10.0 percent from the previous year to help 
stimulate the economy. 
  The rate was lower than the 12.0 percent growth rate for the 
fiscal 1994 local fiscal program.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The head of a government 
tax panel indicated Friday [15 April] his support for adopting a 
new regional tax instead of simply raising the consumption tax 
as a new tax revenue source. 
  "It could be a tax on consumption...but new thinking is 
necessary," Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, an 
advisory panel to the prime minister, told reporters after a 
panel meeting. 
  Noting that the views were personal, Kato, emeritus 
professor 
at Keio University, said regional governments need their own tax 
sources to decentralize national authority and to improve 
regional social welfare. 
  His proposal apparently stems from a welfare tax plan that 
called for permanent cuts in national income and regional 
residents' taxes to offset a 7 percent welfare tax, which was 
proposed to replace the 3 percent consumption tax. 
  Under the current consumption tax system, the national 
government collects the tax and distributes a given amount as 
tax grants to regional governments. 
  The plan drew strong opposition from the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP) -- The largest of the ruling coalition parties -- 
and was scrapped a day after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
announced it in February. 
  But the SDP has recently relaxed its stance on accepting a 
higher consumption tax in view of increasing welfare costs amid 
an aging society. 
  Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii maintained his opposition to 
a regional consumption tax in his recent press meeting. 
  Kato said the issue will be discussed thoroughly at a 
working 
group for regional tax that was officially formed at Friday's 
panel meeting. 
  The group of 11 private experts will hold its first meeting 
on Tuesday, aiming to issue a report in May, Kato said. 
  The panel meeting centered on burden sharing between tax and 
social insurance in line with a welfare vision for the 21st 
century that was compiled by an advisory forum to the health and 
welfare ministry in March, Kato said. 
  He noted the panel will next meet on April 22 to continue 
studying welfare from broader aspects. 
  In line with requests made by Hosokawa at the first meeting 
on April 8, the commission is discussing permanent income and 
residents' tax cuts and net tax increases to realize a balanced 
tax system to cope with an aging society. 
  A final report offering several options for politicians to 
decide later is slated for issue in June.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Minivehicle manufacturers 
are seeking expansion of standards for minivehicles to improve 
their safety levels to those of regular-size vehicles, an 
industry association reported Friday [15 April]. 
  The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said the move 
was initiated by the association's special committee on 
minivehicles headed by Osamu Suzuki, president of Suzuki Motor 
Corp. 
  The association will formally decide on details of standard 
expansion, including the size of vehicles and maximum engine 
capacity, association officials said. 
  They said it is likely that the maximum engine capacity for 
minivehicles will be raised to 800 cc from the present 660 cc. 
  The Transport Ministry will launch a study on the 
modification of minivehicle standards after the committee comes 
up with a formal proposal, the officials said.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Petrochemical companies 
should change some of their business practices which seem to be 
hindering price competition, the Fair Trade Commission said in a 
report Friday [15 April]. 
  The commission said Japanese petrochemical firms generally 
negotiate with customers on prices for domestically produced 
naphtha by taking into account the average price for imported 
naphtha over a three-month period. 
  Although the practice was formed based on a Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry "administrative guidance" in 
1982, it seems to be a problem in terms of promoting fair price 
competition in the industry, the commission said. 
  In addition, the practice of setting prices for domestically 
produced resin higher than those for imported resin is also a 
problem, it said. The situation stems from reasoning that 
domestic firms provide after-sales service. 
  The commission also said joint sales ventures should be 
disbanded because they appear to hinder competition. There are 
seven such ventures at present, set up by petrochemical firms 
for sales of general-purpose petrochemical products. 
  The commission, however, said that since the autumn of 1992, 
prices for five petrochemical products, including naphtha and 
ethylene, had appropriately dropped along with import prices for 
the products' raw materials. The drops reflect the yen's rise 
against the U.S. dollar on foreign exchanges during the period.

  [Text] Growing Strategic Importance of DRAM 
Industry 
  1. Problems Surrounding DRAM Industry 
  2. Increasing DRAM Standing as a Strategic Commodity 
  3. Demand for Improvements in Efficiency 
  Introduction 
  In the midst of an unprecedented slump, the industrial world 
is undergoing extensive restructuring through the elimination of 
unprofitable units, cutbacks in investments in plants and 
equipment, personnel reductions, plant closures, and other such 
measures. This downsizing has even touched what has been 
considered until now "sacred ground"--namely, research and 
development. In order for a country like Japan without any 
notable natural resources to continue its prosperity into the 
21st century, however, there is no alternative but to give 
technology a central place in its industries. It is an 
undeniable fact that excessive restructuring will destroy its 
global competitiveness. A case in point is the dynamic 
random-access memory (DRAM) industry, which is one of Japan's 
representative high-technology fields. As investment costs soar, 
outsiders and not a few industry insiders have begun to voice 
their concerns about its future. There is also concern about the 
narrowing gap between Korea and Japan. In the following 
sections, the authors have sorted through some of the problem 
points that face the industry while giving their projections 
about its future direction. 
  1. Current Problems Surrounding the DRAM Industry 
  "Semiconductor integrated circuit" (IC) is really a 
collective term that covers a broad area. Roughly divided, it 
covers logic devices, such as the chips that perform the 
"logical decisions" of a computer, and memory devices, which 
store information. Microprocessor units (MPU's), which are the 
processing and control units in computers, are typical of the 
former; DRAM, the subject of this article, is typical of the 
latter. 
  Since entering the DRAM market in the latter half of the 
1960's, Japanese manufacturers, as part of a national effort, 
have steadily built up their strength by making full use of 
Japan's superior manufacturing technology and, in 1982, finally 
moved ahead of the United States to place first in the world in 
their field. However, when the supply-and-demand balance for 
4-megabit DRAM memory (hereafter, 4M), collapsed after a 
better-than-expected start, problems such as those discussed 
below suddenly came to the surface, bringing with them serious 
concerns about the industry's future. 
  A.. Soaring Investment Costs 
  The first problem is rising investment costs. Generally, 
heavy investments in equipment are needed to manufacture 
integrated circuits, but the burden is even greater when it 
comes to DRAM and even heavier still for improvements in levels 
of integration. The reason is that, compared to MPUs, where the 
"soft" aspects of circuit design are of the greatest importance, 
in the case of dynamic random access memory, higher value-added 
is sought on the "hard" side--in other words, in finding ways to 
integrate more memory elements on a fixed surface--and 
production is always being carried out with investments in the 
latest processing technology and equipment. Every three to four 
years, the level of integration for DRAM chips increases 
fourfold, an improvement which requires a higher degree of 
precision and complexity in the manufacturing process. Capital 
investments for the standard DRAM plant[.sup]1[/], adequate 
at the 30 billion yen level for 1 megabit of DRAM memory, 
increased to 50 billion yen for 4 megabits and to 80 to 90 
billion yen for 16 megabits and may even go as high as 100 
billion yen for 64 megabits. It is unclear what the investment 
efficiency is for individual DRAM businesses, but certainly 
efficiency is getting poorer with these increasingly enormous 
amounts of capital outlay, and many in the business are 
concerned whether they can turn a profit. 
  B. Korea's Rise to Prominence 
  Second, there is Korea and the speed with which its 
enterprises are catching up with Japanese's DRAM industry. 
Although Korea entered the field only in the mid-1980's, its 
three zaibatsu-affiliated companies (Samsung 
Electronics, Gold Star and Hyundai Ltd.), backed by a wealth of 
funds, have been pouring their investment dollars into the DRAM 
field. As a result, in terms of today's leading 4-megabit DRAM 
chip, Korea is said to be "shoulder-to-shoulder with Japan in 
mass production technology." In terms of volume, Korea has 
caught up with the United States and is second only to Japan. An 
"export drive"--where Korean companies are exporting products to 
the United States at prices 10 percent or so cheaper than 
Japanese goods--seems to be an important factor here, and many 
people share the pessimistic view that Japan will be 
outdistanced by the Koreans some day in the same way that Japan 
earlier took the lead over the United States. With products like 
dynamic random-access memory, manufacturers are not only faced 
with the struggle to improve precision and use the latest 
technology but, since generations change every three to four 
years, their products very quickly become out-dated, and the 
existence of a low-cost player who can rapidly bring down prices 
represents a very big threat. 
  C. Rising Investment Risk 
  Investment risks have gotten higher primarily because of 
technological advances. The need for higher integration has 
always preceded the birth of DRAM chips. Before, if technology 
failed to keep pace with new needs, manufacturers could put 
money into developing new products without all that great a 
risk. With the coming of the "mega" age, however, that has 
changed. With a lot of experience and development know-how 
behind them, manufacturers have been able to shorten the time it 
takes to develop new products and to calculate when to make such 
investments. For DRAM, a product which uses the latest 
technology, experience brings with it a rapid improvement in 
yield during the initial period of production. This gives rise 
to the kind of phenomenon or pattern one always sees; namely, a 
temporary imbalance is effected between supply and demand, which 
in turn causes prices to drop sharply. It becomes quite 
significant, then, that it has become possible for manufacturers 
to manipulate their timing. It is commonly known that when it 
came time for 1-megabit DRAM, while the majority of companies 
were reluctant to invest during the recession, others, by 
investing aggressively, were able to enjoy large profits during 
the initial period when the market was still undersupplied. The 
opposite happened with 4-megabit DRAM. Not wanting to repeat the 
mistake they had made with 1M DRAM, companies all rushed ahead 
to invest. Unfortunately, this happened to be an "off-crop" 
season for new electronic products, and in addition to widening 
the supply-and-demand gap through their own making, they brought 
about a large drop in profits. This happened recently enough to 
still be fresh in the industry's memory. In a word, the fact 
that manufacturers could manipulate their investment timing 
worked against them, giving rise to a situation where they could 
easily be influenced by the moves of every other player. This in 
turn has raised investment risks in the DRAM industry. 
  2. Increasing DRAM Standing as a Strategic 
Commodity 
  As these problems became clear, companies have adopt 
plans--for example, to expand their application-specific 
integrated circuit (ASIC) and MPU units--which are intended to 
"break [their] reliance on DRAM." In industrial circles, there 
is deep-rooted skepticism about the value of the DRAM industry 
itself, and one commonly hears criticisms that "DRAM is not a 
moneymaker" or "DRAM is low-level technology." However, one 
would have to say that too light a view of the DRAM industry is 
not only economically very dangerous but also strategically very 
dangerous. 
  A. High-Growth in DRAM Demand Expected 
  First of all, even compared to other semiconductors, DRAM 
will continue to be a high-growth product. That is because the 
demand for more bits (one bit, it will be remembered, is a 
single memory cell, or unit) is a demand for devices with larger 
memory capacity, which is essentially a demand for more DRAM, 
and this demand is expected to continue to show a high level of 
growth. Because they were disappointed in their expectations of 
the 4M during its initial period on the market, many 
manufacturers felt that "the need for higher integration might 
be on the decline." But, as mentioned earlier, the problem was 
mainly on the supply-side, and in fact, there have not been any 
signs since then of a slowdown in the growth in bit-demand. On 
the contrary, besides expecting to see more in the way of an 
information society in the future, one can expect to see 
"downsizing"--the shift toward smaller equipment--become the 
main current in computers. For example, if users shift from 
mainframes (which cost 500 million yen on average and have 8 
gigabits of memory) to personal computers (costing 300,000 yen, 
with 32 megabits of memory), the total memory per unit price 
(bits/price) increases about sevenfold, clearly showing that the 
same investment dollar buys much more in the way of DRAM memory. 
In fact, if we compare the amount of DRAM required by these two 
types of equipment for the years 1987 and 1992, we see that 
personal computers have significantly boosted the demand for 
memory. It is projected that in the future the amount of memory 
required by computers will increase sharply as MPUs and software 
improve[.sup]2[/]. Certainly, it would not be an exaggeration 
to say the "age of large DRAM memory consumption" is coming. In 
fact, taking time trends over the past 10 years to estimate the 
growth rate over the next five years[.sup]3[/], the authors 
projected that demand will still continue to grow at around 46 
percent on average. 
  It seems that growth of 20-30 percent in the money base can 
also be anticipated. Of course, there will probably still be a 
sharp drop in production; this seems to be unavoidable when 
there is a changeover from one generation to the next one. 
Generally, the shift to a new generation occurs when users feel 
it is to their advance to use a next-generation product rather 
than an existing product. The pattern with DRAM chips, because 
of improvements in yield, shows that next-generation DRAM prices 
(i.e., the unit price per bit) will move sharply downward, 
falling below prices for existing generation DRAMs when the 
older and newer generations cross paths (bit-cross). But, 
besides expecting the price of both generation DRAM's to drop, 
one also expects to see production volume [as measured in 
dollars or yen] fall below levels attained during the heyday of 
the outgoing, previous-generation DRAM. The reason is that there 
will be less demand for the outgoing generation of DRAM chips as 
users shift to newer products having four times as much memory 
capacity; on the other hand, demand for newer products will not 
grow sufficiently to make up for this decline. It is the 
essential nature of the DRAM industry that this pattern of 
generational change will keep repeating itself, and around each 
changing of the guard this kind of dip will probably occur. 
However, looked at in medium and long-range terms, DRAM 
production [as measured in dollars or yen], sustained by a 
growth in bit-demand, can be expected to continue to show 
double-digit growth[.sup]4[/], and when considered in terms 
of semiconductors as a whole, can be expected to maintain a high 
level of growth, second only to that of MPU's. 
  B. Spread Effects From DRAM Industry 
  Another reason for aggressively developing Japan's DRAM 
industry can be seen when one considers the strategic importance 
of this industry and the beneficial spread effects its 
development will have on the semiconductor industry as a whole. 
  As mentioned earlier, DRAM utilizes the latest semiconductor 
manufacturing processes, and by maintaining the field, Japanese 
manufacturers are sustaining the world's top manufacturing 
technology. It is not a matter simply of the technology being 
new. By putting to use manufacturing technology acquired during 
DRAM production or by utilizing manufacturing equipment that has 
already been paid off through DRAM production, they will make it 
possible to manufacture products other than DRAMs smoothly and 
at low cost. In that sense, DRAM continues to be the 
"foundation" of semiconductor production and Japan's "engine of 
technology." 
  Another trend that has been attracting attention in 
particular these days is the increasing demand for more advanced 
manufacturing technology for high-growth microprocessing units. 
During these past several years, there have been remarkable 
improvements in MPU performance. But higher performance also 
means more complicated circuits and, inevitably, higher levels 
of integration and, thus, more investment dollars. According to 
estimates, total investments for the microprocessing giant 
Intel's next-generation MPU's, including the cost of 
manufacturing more units, will reach 500 billion yen, or 20 
times the cost of its current MPU's. (Investment in the 
4-megabit DRAM developed by Japan's top manufacturer totals 
about 200 billion yen.) On the other hand, more manufacturers 
are entering the MPU field. Thus, the price competition among 
them is heating up, and even in the case of MPU's, which are 
considered a typical high-value-added product, an important 
question that has started to be raised is how businesses can 
hold down plant and equipment investment costs and manufacture 
their products cheaply. In short, even in circuit design (the 
"soft" side of the coin), superior manufacturing technology is 
needed and without it, MPU businesses have become increasingly 
likely to fail. In fact, barring only a few exceptions, American 
manufacturers who have withdrawn from the DRAM 
business[.sup]5[/] are said to be having a very tough time 
making MPUs. This, then, may be an opportune time for Japanese 
semiconductor makers to give full play to the production 
technology they have built up and their proficiency in 
manufacturing products while achieving a good yield. Of course, 
even if Japan does try to enter the field, it is still behind in 
terms of the software that is necessary for MPU production and 
it will not immediately be competitive in the MPU field. But, 
clearly, it would be to Japan's advantage to build up its 
strength in those areas, such as microprocessors, where it is 
lagging behind the United States and, in the meantime, expand 
its efforts in "second source" enterprises to manufacture MPU's 
under license from American makers. While contributing its 
production know-how, it will also be gaining additional MPU 
know-how. 
  Needless to say, aggressive investments in development are 
the best way to widen the gap between Japan and Korean 
competitors who are close on its heels. Certainly, Korean 
manufacturers have rapidly gained strength and, according to 
some analysts, will be bigger suppliers of the next-generation 
16M than Japan. But it is also a fact that a gap still exists 
between the two countries, and if Japanese makers continue to 
invest as they have until now, it is fully possible that Japan 
will be able to maintain its present edge. One reason is that 
Korean manufacturers are still heavily dependent on Japanese and 
American technology. They are currently paying out over 10 
percent of their sales for patent licenses, several percent 
points higher than what Japan is paying, and are said to be 
planning to continue aggressively importing new technology in 
the future. As can be seen, too, in the fact that Koreans are 
behind in circuit design technology, a point that will be 
touched on later in this report, Japan can still be considered 
ahead of Korea in terms of technology. Nor has Korea nurtured 
the growth of its semiconductor equipment manufacturing 
industry. Recently, joint development has been moving forward 
between Japanese and American semiconductor equipment makers, 
but just as the underdevelopment of the parts sector has become 
a weak point in Korea's consumer electronics industry, the lack 
of its own, domestic semiconductor equipment industry, the 
foundation for other related industries, is a major weakness. 
Thus, Korean manufacturers still have not shaken themselves free 
of their position as "trailers after Japan." What seems to be 
essential in order for Japan to maintain this lead are 
investments in the DRAM industry. 
  Thus, the DRAM industry in Japan is faced with a number of 
problems. But as the competition among countries heats up, 
rather than losing its importance as a product that Japan has 
led the field with until now, dynamic random access memory is 
becoming even more important for Japan than ever before. The new 
turn taken in the direction of MPU's is definitely not a 
mistake. Given the fact that Japan is still not fully 
competitive in this area, its semiconductor industry cannot 
continue to develop and prosper without the development of 
enterprises where the DRAM remains the core product. 
  3. Demand for Improved Efficiency 
  Future plans must then address the question of how the 
operations of the DRAM industry can be carried out more 
efficiently[.sup]6[/]. Steps already being taken by companies 
are described below. 
  A. Keeping Investment Costs Down 
  The first step is to hold investment costs down as much as 
possible. In order to achieve the kind of fast-paced, fourfold 
improvements that have occurred in integration every three to 
four years, it has become necessary for companies to invest 
aggressively in research and development, but with the "mega" 
age, the huge cost of development is climbing even higher. 
Companies are thus actively going into joint development 
projects--primarily with U.S. manufacturers--in an attempt to 
cut back even a little on their investment costs. 
  Increasingly popular also is the move seen among 
manufacturing plants to use their equipment and facilities in 
common to the extent possible and to use the same equipment for 
two or more DRAM generations. Manufacturers have already been 
setting up [assembly] lines to introduce new, next-generation 
technology during the latter half of the preceding generation's 
lifetime and creating the flexibility to produce two generations 
of DRAM. Recently, they have also been trying to cut down on 
costs by designing their plants and equipment (with the 
exception of those used for precision processing) so they can be 
used from one generation to the next. They have also been trying 
to cut costs by eliminating whatever differences they can in the 
methods used by different plants, which have operated in the 
past in all but a disjointed, uncoordinated fashion. Moreover, 
in areas where manufacturers have been competitively near 
equals, there has even been a move to standardize equipment 
across companies. Thus, it is not an exaggeration to say that 
"economization" has now become a key word for every company. 
  B. Controlling Supply Quantities; Seeds of Such a Technology 
Are Beginning To Sprout 
  As mentioned earlier, when the balance between supply and 
demand is upset during the start-up period, it leads to a steep 
drop in prices which, in turn, has a negative effect on profits. 
To avoid such situations as much as possible, companies have 
aggressively been looking into technology to control supply in 
terms of quantity, or volume. Typical of such technology is the 
single-wafer processing method; here, in the manufacturing 
process, silicon wafers (on which circuits are to be etched) are 
processed one piece at a time. In the "batch method," the main 
method used at present, 50 to 150 pieces are processed in one 
lot, leading to rapid improvement in yield along with a greater 
supply [of silicon chips] than may have been expected. This is 
one of the major reasons that the gap between supply and demand 
widens. By contrast, with the introduction of the single-wafer 
method, it becomes possible to a greater extent than at present 
to control supply quantities while achieving higher yields. 
Understandably, companies are thus moving ahead with 
preparations to seriously introduce this method from the 
64-megabit DRAM on. 
  C. Making DRAM a High Value-Added Product 
  Attempts are also being made to further establish a 
segregation of niche with Korea. DRAM is typical of a product 
that has a broad range of uses. And recently, as user needs have 
become more diversified, headway is being made in further 
diversifying DRAM's uses and turning it into an even higher 
value-added product: for example, as a "low-energy consumer," 
suitable for portable [computer] terminals; as a "high-speed" 
product, able to process voice and image data together in a 
single lump; and as a "special purpose DRAM," where memory sits 
on a single chip along with a logic circuit. In as much as such 
products differ from standard products in requiring circuit 
design and control technologies, it would seem that at present 
it would be hard for Korea to manufacture them on a large scale; 
for Japanese manufacturers, this may be an expedient way to 
avoid direct competition with Korean products. For low-grade 
products, manufacturers have already started to procure OEM 
[original equipment manufacturing] items from Korea and are 
moving into high value-added products while using Korean power 
to the extent possible for these low-grade items. This move 
toward creating separate niches will probably gather even more 
steam as time goes by. 
  D. Overseas Development 
  Until now, overseas development has referred primarily to 1) 
the opening up of markets in Europe and the United States in 
order to ease trade tensions, and 2) assembly production in 
Asian regions, where the aim has been to reduce the cost of 
labor-intensive processing. In only a few cases has large-scale 
production been carried out consistently in areas of high 
demand. But with the yen's appreciation to unprecedented levels, 
on the one hand, and with demand markets scattered randomly in 
different regions, on the other, it has become more important 
than ever for manufacturers to establish a global supply system. 
As products become more diversified, shortening the geographic 
distance between users and suppliers also takes on an important 
meaning from the viewpoint of accurately deciphering user needs 
and reducing the time for shipment and delivery. This disordered 
state is still evident in the overseas strategies of companies, 
but globalization is inescapable and will probably bring about a 
rapid overseas shift. 
  Conclusion 
  When the situation is viewed in this way, it becomes clear 
that recent perspectives on the DRAM industry often confuse its 
"essentially cyclical nature" with its "strategic significance." 
Certainly, the relative weight given to DRAM in Japan's 
semiconductor industry is becoming less significant, dropping 
from the 50 percent-and-above-level it has occupied thus far to 
the 30 percent-level today. With investments increasing yearly, 
it seems to some that DRAM is only becoming a heavier and 
heavier burden. However, as the authors have already mentioned, 
it is DRAM which continues to support Japan's semiconductor 
business, and recklessly weakening this support and curbing 
investments will not only lower the competitiveness of the 
semiconductor industry as a whole but also shake the very 
foundations of a country built on technology. In this sense, 
investment strategies developed from a long-term perspective can 
be seen as the very means by which to maintain a "high-tech 
Japan." While caution about ballooning investment costs is 
necessary, so too is a change of perspective necessary--a change 
where manufacturers will be seeing "a return on their DRAM 
investments through semiconductors." 
Footnotes 
  1. The example is for standard DRAM plants which process 
200,000 silicon wafers per month; with the 4-megabit DRAM chip, 
currently the industry's main product, this is equivalent to a 
plant which produces 3 million units per month. 
  2. For example, the Pentium, which [Intel] hopes will become 
the main, next-generation microprocessing unit, requires about 
four times more DRAM for existing equipment (see following). 
  3. The method used to make this estimate was as follows: 
  Y = 31.13701 + 233.1478x, 
  where Y = average change in bit-demand over a 
three-year period, X = the reciprocal of the time 
trend, or 1/time trend, and R[.sup]2[/] = 0.8799, 
D.W. = -2.76. 
  4. Hypothesizing that the unit price per bit would show a 
consist drop due to technological innovations, the authors 
estimated unit price, using trends over the past 10 years; by 
multiplying this estimated unit price by bit-demand, they came 
out with a 28 percent or so growth rate in DRAM-demand over the 
next 5 years. More specifically, the unit price per bit was 
estimated as follows: 
  Y = -0.003341714 + 0.09791906x + 
0.01502765d 
  where Y = unit price per bit and x = 
reciprocal of time trend, or 1/time trend, d = dummy 
variable (in 1984 and 1988, the years that 256K and 1M started 
to be mass produced in earnest and the unit price of bits rose, 
the value "1" was assigned to the dummy variable; "1" was not 
assigned in 1991 although that was the year mass production was 
started in earnest on the 4M. Because demand at the beginning 
lagged, the unit price of bits fell sharply). 
  R[.sup]2[/] = 0.8799, D.W. = 2.76 
  5. With the coming of the "mega" age, American manufacturers 
have withdrawn one after the other and at present, only three 
companies, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and Micron Technology, 
are continuing in the business. The first two are engaged in 
joint development with Japanese manufacturers. In part, this 
[withdrawal of companies] may be an indication that an 
aggressive turn has been taken in the MPU field. The primary 
reason, however, is that there are many specialist manufacturers 
in the United States who have not been able to keep up with the 
heavy burden of investing in equipment and research and 
development. As a result, American manufacturers are behind 
Japan in technological innovations and their mass-production 
systems. 
  6. As mentioned earlier, investment efficiency for DRAM 
alone 
is not clear. However, recovery seems to be the underlying tone 
for the semiconductor industry as a whole. According to a 
leading manufacturer, DRAM profits are "still showing adequate 
improvement."

  [Text] Trade Minister Satrio Budiarjo Yudono has told 
newsmen in Jakarta that Indonesia hopes all developed countries 
will be united in observing the agreement on liberal, fair, and 
non-discriminative international trade based on the GATT 
framework. 
  He said that following the signing of the final act of the 
Uruguay Round trade talks, Indonesia and other developing 
countries hoped their export products could gain more market 
access in the developed countries. 
  According to the minister, it is important for developed 
countries to open their markets to goods from developing 
countries considering that Indonesia, one of the developing 
countries, had already adopted a liberal trade policy in line 
with the outcome of the Uruguay Round talks. He said that apart 
from that, the developed countries should provide technical 
assistance to developing countries instead of attaching other 
conditional clauses to the trade agreement. 
  It is hoped that the Uruguay Round trade talks on textiles 
and agriculture could create a trade policy that is not 
contradictory to the agreement reached at Uruguay Round talks 
and that trade discrimination against developing countries will 
be eliminated.

  [Text] Jayapura, April 15 (ANTARA) -- Papua New Guinea 
(PNG) finally agreed to allow an Indonesian Government-designate 
land survey team to clearly define the borders dividing the two 
countries in preparation for the construction of lighthouses in 
the island's coasts. 
  "Indonesia will build two lighthouses in the south and north 
coastal areas of the island to prevent border violations with 
PNG usually committed by local fishermen," head of Border 
Affairs Department of the Jaya provincial administration M.D. 
Lewar said Thursday. 
  The plan was discussed during the border liaison meeting in 
1993 and was agreed in the first round of the meeting in March 
21 to 23, 1994 held in Lorengau, capital city of PNG's province 
of Manus, he said. 
  According to the Lorengau's agreement, the lighthouse in the 
northern coastal area will be built in the border of Skouw 
village, Jayapura regency and Wutung village, PNG's province of 
Sandaun, while the lighthouse in the south will be built in the 
borders of Irian Jaya's regency of Merauke and western province 
of PNG. 
  Apart from building lighthouses, Indonesia will also build 
five guard-houses as support facilities for the lighthouses, 
especially in th remote areas, he said. 
  Lewar expressed hopes that with the lighthouses, fishermen 
from Irian Jaya and PNG would better know which water they are 
fishing.

  [Text] President Fidel V. Ramos has approved the adoption 
of new measures to speed up the actualization of the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area or AFTA following the 
conclusion of the Uruguay Round negotiations under the General 
Agreement on Tariff and Trade or GATT. With the signing of the 
Uruguay Round final act this month, the ASEAN-member countries 
want to ensure that preferential treatment under the AFTA is not 
diminished. The ASEAN groups the Philippines, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Brunei Darussalam. 
  President Ramos approved three basic approaches as proposed 
by the Philippine Council for ASEAN Cooperation's Technical 
Board. These are: 
  -- Broadening the coverage of the Common Effective 
Preferential Tariff or CEPT by including products selected from 
the temporary exclusion list; 
  -- Broadening the same inclusion list by including 
unprocessed agricultural products from the permanent exclusion 
list; and, 
  -- Improving the existing AFTA CEPT inclusion list. 
  Under the first approach, some 52 items were first delisted 
from temporary exclusion list. These items are those classified 
as natural processed and those under Memorandum Order No. 95 
implementing the Magna Carta for Small Farmers and the 
government rationalization program. 
  A line-by-line evaluation of the remaining 662 items in the 
temporary exclusion list will be done to determine which should 
be included in the AFTA CEPT scheme based on a set of criteria. 
  Under the second approach, some unprocessed agricultural 
products will be lifted from the permanent exclusion list to 
conform with increasing criteria adopted by other member 
countries. 
  The third approach includes measures shortening from 15 
years 
to 10 years the period for bringing the tariff levels of 1,086 
[word indistinct] to 5 percent or less, as well as deepening the 
tariff cuts.

<F P=106> [Report by Marie Sena Ruiz] </F>
  [Excerpt] The threat of all rebel groups has weakened and 
the peace process being pushed by government is assured. This 
was the assessment made by the National Security Council [NSC] 
on the current economic and political situations in the country. 
  Briefing palace [presidential office] newsmen after the 
meeting in Malacanang, national security adviser Jose Almonte 
said all rebel groups, including leftist, rightist, and Muslim 
rebels, no longer pose a threat to national security. Almonte 
reported an overall improved peace and order situation and said 
government is completely in control of problems that debilitate 
the economy. 
  The NSC also adopted a resolution endorsing to Congress the 
amnesty proclamation announced by President Ramos. The 
resolution urged Congress to ratify the proclamation. 
  Also during the said National Security Council meeting, 
Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona said, the country's now 
poised for economic takeoff as economic and political reforms 
have been put in place. Guingona said the major economic 
reforms were designed to level the playing field to promote 
global competitiveness and make opportunities available to 
everyone. 
  On the economic front, acting Trade Secretary Ernesto 
Ordonez 
assessed the impact of the oil price increase and its subsequent 
rollback. The secretary said that the oil price increase hardly 
affected the prices of basic commodities because of measures 
adopted by government. 
  For his part, Finance Secretary Roberto De Ocampo 
underscored 
the importance of tax measures/alternatives to the oil levy, 
particularly the (?cost) and tariff program, (?special) 
progress, and completion of major projects of the government. 
  The fourth National Security Council meeting under the Ramos 
Administration was convened to address vital internal and 
external security concerns. 
  Meanwhile, President Ramos today ordered the Presidential 
Anti-Crime Commission [PACC] headed by Vice President Joseph 
Estrada to exert all efforts to stop the new kidnap gangs behind 
the latest kidnapping cases in Metro Manila and other parts of 
the country. 
  The chief executive also ordered the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines and the Philippine National Police to support the 
PACC in tracking down the kidnappers who are believed to be 
former members of the dismantled Red Scorpion Group. The 
president issued the order after receiving reports that several 
new kidnapping cases were reported in Metro Manila and Benguet 
province. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean 
Government announced Friday it has decided to withdraw 
unconditionally its demand on an inter-Korean envoy exchange as 
a condition for Pyongyang to hold further high-level talks with 
Washington. 
  The decision represents a major concession by South Korea 
and 
the United States and will likely raise the pressure on North 
Korea to allow additional checks of its nuclear facilities. 
  The government also said it will accept all North Korean 
escapees from Pyongyang-run logging camps in Siberia wishing to 
settle here. 
  The deputy prime minister and head of the National 
Unification Board (NUB), Yi Yong-tok, made the announcement 
following a meeting of cabinet ministers concerned with 
reunification and national security policy. 
  "The government has determined that it was practically 
impossible to resolve the nuclear issue through an exchange of 
special envoys," since North Korea has clearly shown that it has 
no intention of doing so, he said. Consequently, the government 
has decided against pushing the envoy exchange as a condition 
for a third round of U.S.- North Korea high-level talks any 
longer, Yi explained. 
  "However, there is no change in the government's position 
that the nuclear problem will have to be resolved above 
everything else," he said. "Inter-Korean dialogue must go on for 
mutual and simultaneous inspections of each other's nuclear 
facilities based on the joint declaration for denuclearization 
of the Korean peninsula," Yi said. 
  The deputy prime minister added that IAEA [International 
Atomic Energy Agency] checks of North Korea's nuclear sites will 
also have to be realized soon. With regard to North Korean 
loggers, Yi said the government, based on humanitarian grounds, 
has decided to accept all escapees seeking asylum in the South 
after following the proper legal procedures. 
  Seoul has received a promise from the Russian Government on 
the matter, he said, adding that concerned South Korean 
ministries would take early steps to accept them. 
  Based on the decision, the government is expected to discuss 
a third round of U.S.-North Korean talks and other problems 
related to the nuclear issue when Robert Gallucci, U.S. 
assistant secretary of state for political and military affairs, 
arrives in Seoul Friday. 
  "The United States' talks with Pyongyang are linked with 
inter- Korean dialogue," Yi said. Therefore, any decisions on 
U.S.-North Korean negotiations will be made in close 
consultation between Washington and Seoul, Yi said. 
  The deputy prime minister, however, hinted that inter-Korean 
dialogue besides the special envoy exchange would not be a 
condition for the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks. 
  Meanwhile, the government is expected to hold a 
working-level 
meeting of Foreign Ministry, Chongwadae [presidential office] 
and National Unification Board officials Friday afternoon to 
discuss ways to accommodate North Korean loggers seeking asylum 
in the South.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- China, Japan and Russia 
welcomed South Korea's flexibility when consulted beforehand 
about Seoul's decision to withdraw its demand for an 
inter-Korean envoy exchange, a Foreign Ministry official said 
Friday. 
  The decision, while aimed at turning the North Korean 
nuclear 
crisis away from international sanctions, would at the same time 
convince the world community including China that sanctions were 
inevitable if Pyongyang ignored even this incentive, the 
official said. 
  Seoul has attempted to break the nuclear impasse by saying 
it 
would no longer demand an inter-Korean envoy exchange as a 
precondition to North Korean-U.S. high-level talks. 
  The decision separates inter-Korean from North Korean-U.S. 
dialogue under Seoul's strategy to resolve the nuclear problem, 
leaving the issue to Pyongyang and Washington to untangle. 
  The North's recent behavior, such as threatening to turn 
Seoul into a "sea of fire," proved the South could not expect 
any progress in the nuclear dispute via an envoy exchange, the 
ministry official said. 
  "The decision to cut the link reflects the government's will 
to place prior emphasis on transparent inspection by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)," he said. 
  Washington was fully consulted about Seoul's move, he said, 
while China, Japan and Russia welcomed it, noted the official. 
  "If North Korea blocks progress on the inspection despite 
such efforts on our part, the international community will gain 
justification in seeking sanctions against it," he said.

<F P=106> ["Korea, U.S. Begin Whole New Ball Game With North Korea -- </F>
by Yi Tong-min"] 
  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Seoul and Washington 
began a whole new ball game against North Korea Friday with 
changed star players and match strategy. 
  South Korea announced it will no longer demand an envoy 
exchange with North Korea as a precondition to the next 
Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. In effect, Seoul has cut 
itself out and left North Korea and the United States to deal 
with the nuclear problem. 
  Reactions are split on whether Seoul made the right call. 
Some say it is a correction of what was a wrong-headed policy. 
Others say Seoul threw in the towel when there was no need to. 
  Critics point out that inter-Korean dialogue was not the 
real 
stumbling block to resolving the nuclear impasse. There is no 
guarantee that North Korea will open its nuclear program to 
outside inspection just because Seoul withdrew the dialogue 
demand, they insist. 
  Furthermore, the Kim Yong-sam administration has lost face 
by 
rescinding the principle held for years by his predecessors that 
for North Korea, "the road to Washington goes through Seoul." 
What Seoul risks with Friday's decision is that much greater. 
  The critics have a point when they say Pyongyang succeeded 
in 
cornering Seoul to get what it always wanted -- dialogue with, 
and only with, the United States that takes South Korea 
completely out of the picture. 
  But Seoul was more concerned with steering the nuclear 
problem away from a tense situation at the United Nations. 
Officials here explained they no longer felt an envoy exchange 
would help defuse the controversy and decided to let it go. 
  "Envoys were a means to a solution, not the final 
objective," 
said Kim Sam-hun, ambassador in charge of North Korean nuclear 
affairs. 
  Defenders of the new strategy say this was the only 
available 
incentive Seoul could give to North Korea to break the stalemate. 
  China, North Korea's staunchest ally, made clear to 
President 
Kim Yong-sam at last month's summit that it would exercise its 
veto power, not even abstain, if a resolution on imposing 
sanctions against Pyongyang came up at the security council. 
  In the face of such blatant opposition from a country whose 
support is the pillar of coordinated international action, Seoul 
had no choice but to yield in order to prove that it had done 
all it could to solve the problem diplomatically. 
  The government's tone has softened considerably compared to 
just last month when it kept talking about UN sanctions and 
hard-line action. High-level officials were declaring that 
Washington had to "show Pyongyang at least something" to make it 
comply with nuclear inspection demands. 
  "We can't say 'do this, do that.' We have to offer some 
incentives," said Kim, suggesting that Seoul and Washington were 
ready to make conciliatory gestures. 
  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is considering 
an early-May deadline for North Korea to permit additional 
inspections. Friday's announcement will significantly quicken 
the pace to meet that deadline. 
  The IAEA's first move is to propose negotiations to North 
Korea on discussing checks of facilities where access was denied 
during last month's visit. 
  Meanwhile, the United States will reopen contact with North 
Korea to discuss holding the next round of high-level talks. 
  Once the inspections and high-level talks are agreed, Seoul 
will propose a new form of inter-Korean dialogue. The type of 
dialogue will depend on the progress of nuclear negotiations. 
  Officials say the prime ministers' talks, suspended because 
of the nuclear row, or the inter-Korean joint nuclear control 
commission are favorable channels. 
  North Korean-U.S. high-level talks are also expected to gain 
speed. There are specific sites the IAEA wants to see -- those 
closed off to inspectors at last month's visit and the two 
nuclear storage sites. The IAEA also has to be present when 
North Korea changes the nuclear rods at its five-megawatt 
reactor. 
  In return for the above, Washington will take various steps 
toward improving relations. 
  It will take some time before the two sides can agree on 
diplomatic normalization. Washington is reminding Pyongyang of 
other stumbling blocks such as human rights, return of the 
remains of missing American soldiers from the 1950-53 Korean war 
and terrorism. 
  In any event, various stages lie in between -- a liaison 
office for one, a formula that Washington applied with China.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has 
prohibited its loggers working in Siberia from leaving or 
sleeping outside their camps, a Foreign Ministry official said 
Friday. 
  "North Korea permitted the loggers to go out and sleep on 
some special days in the past such as April 15, the birthday of 
President Kim Il-song, and Aug. 15, independence day from 
Japanese colonial rule, on a large scale. But this year the 
Pyongyang government banned it completely on April 15," the 
official said on condition he not be named. 
  North Korea seems to think that if Seoul admits defecting 
loggers to South Korea, more loggers will desert their camps. 
North Korean guards at the camps have thus increased 
surveillance of workers and banned movement to outside areas, 
the official said. 
  He expressed concern that North Korean loggers left camp in 
the past to buy daily necessities and food in Khabarovsk, but 
now they cannot do so.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Amid reports of a stream 
of North Korean people escaping from their communist country or 
from their logging yards in Siberia, North Korea has sharply 
reinforced border guards in areas bordering China and Russia, it 
was learned here on Friday. 
  "The brigade-strength North Korean border troops have 
recently been reinforced to the strength of a corps consisting 
of 30,000 to 40,000 men," Vice Unification Minister Song 
Yong-tae said. 
  Speaking at a panel talks at the National Assembly, Song 
said 
in the past loggers at North Korea-run logging yards in Siberia 
used to be granted special outings on Kim Il-song's birthday, 
April 15, the biggest public holiday of North Korea. 
  "We have a report indicating that this year no outings were 
allowed at all for their loggers in Siberia," Song said. 
  He said there had been no particular signs of armed 
provocation on the part of North Korea. 
  But, people there have lately been whipped into producing 
more military supplies in addition to daily necessities, and Kim 
Il- song's birthday is being observed in low-key celebrations 
this year, Song said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic 
Liberal Party (DLP) has decided to study various ways to help 
resettle North Koreans fleeing from Siberian logging camps, Rep. 
Paek Nam-chi, the party's policy coordinator, said Friday. 
  The party plans to meet with the government to discuss 
creating a special public fund, considering the enormous cost of 
providing the North Koreans with vocational training and housing. 
  Some 170 escapees, out of an estimated 25,000 loggers at 
Pyongyang-run camps in Siberia whose human rights are allegedly 
violated on a routine basis, are said to be seeking asylum in 
the South. 
  Seoul pledged on Wednesday to help them resettle either in 
the South or in a third country in accordance with international 
law. 
  Paek said, "helping the North Koreans resettle here is 
better 
for them than only giving them financial support. And as it is 
difficult for the government alone to deal with their 
resettlement, the government needs to induce businesses or other 
private organizations to provide support." 
  The most important thing, he added, is to avoid a split in 
national opinion on supporting the North Korean loggers from a 
humanitarian point of view. 
  "As both the ruling and opposition parties empathize with 
each other on the issue, we are willing to study jointly with 
the opposition party some National Assembly measures if 
necessary." 
  Paek said that the government needs to work out policies on 
a 
long-term basis to handle those who have escaped or will escape 
from North Korea. 
  "We will collect detailed data about the West German policy 
toward East Germans who escaped from East Germany and study 
devising legal and institutional measures," he said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- A regular, direct sea 
route between South and North Korea will open on April 18, 
business sources said Friday. 
  Sunho shipping company, a joint venture between South 
Korea's 
Samsun Shipping Corp. and China's Xianhu business group, has 
chartered a 4,200-ton containership from St. Vincent and the 
Grenadines and will send it from Pusan to the North Korean port 
of Chongjin on Monday. 
  The ship will carry 1,400 tons of construction equipment, 
which is to be transported again by truck from Chongjin to China. 
  The Pusan-Chongjin-Yanji route will shorten the time needed 
to transport goods to seven days, compared to the previous 40-45 
days on the Pusan-Dalian-Yanji route. 
  Sunho plans to operate ships on the route once a month on a 
regular basis, Samsun officials said. 
  The inter-Korean sea route became available after the Xianhu 
group contracted with the North Korean Government to jointly 
develop Chongjin port last June. Under the contract, the 
Chinese group has the right to use the port for 50 years. 
  Samsun opened a sea route from Inchon through a Chinese port 
to the North Korean port of Nampo early last year and is 
operating freighters on the route twice a month. 
  A Samsun official said, "if inter-Korean relations improve, 
goods transported through this direct inter-Korean sea route 
will also increase." 
  Samsun carried 5,000 tons of rice from Mokpo to the North 
Korean port of Najin in July 1991 -- a first for a Korean 
shipping company.

  [Text] Washington, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Secretary of 
Defense William Perry has delayed his April 17-19 visit to 
Seoul, citing the shooting down Thursday of two U.S. helicopters 
in northern Iraq by American fighters, diplomatic sources here 
said. 
  Perry, who was scheduled to leave for Tokyo and Seoul Friday 
to discuss the North Korean nuclear crisis, decided to postpone 
his trip because of the tragedy in which American F-15 fighters 
enforcing the "no-fly" zone over northern Iraq mistakenly shot 
down two U.S. Army choppers, killing more than 20 people, the 
sources said. 
  The Department of Defense notified the South Korean Embassy 
here of the delay, saying Perry's visit to Seoul will be 
rescheduled next week when the downing is cleared up, they said. 
The diplomatic sources, however, did not rule out the 
possibility that the visit could be delayed for a longer period 
if the mishap triggered a political and military uproar in and 
outside the United States. 
  The U.S. defense secretary was scheduled to meet with his 
South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae to tackle the North Korean 
nuclear problem in Seoul from April 17-19.

  [Text] The United States has erected many non-tariff 
barriers on its imports although it has put pressure on foreign 
nations to rectify their unfair practices, the Korea Trade 
Promotion Corporation (KOTRA) said, quoting a report of a U.S. 
civilian body. 
  In a report on U.S. unfair trade practices, the Citizens for 
a Sound Economy Foundation said that there are many unfair 
practices in the United States and certain barriers are higher 
than those in foreign countries. 
  The report pointed out that the United States has set up 
complicated guidelines on automobile fuel efficiency which have 
become non-tariff import barriers on European deluxe cars. 
  The body claimed that the United States has limited imports 
of dairy products to 2 percent of total U.S. production and 
tariffs are high at 10-20 percent although it puts pressure on 
foreign countries to open their farm markets. 
  It also pinpointed non-tariff barriers in services, claiming 
that foreigners are strictly banned from engaging in TV and 
radio broadcasting business in the United States although U.S. 
operators have pressurized foreign governments to open their 
markets. 
  In the public construction works, foreigners are obligated 
to 
use U.S. made construction equipment and material under the Buy 
American Act. 
  The body pointed out that the Bill Clinton administration 
plans to increase subsidies to industries and agriculture 
despite Uruguay Round accord on reduction of subsidies.

officially denied press reports that it has consulted with China 
on signing a bilateral friendship treaty. Responding to press 
reports that Seoul offered to sign the pact at ongoing policy 
planning talks in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Chang 
Ki-ho said, "the proposal was made just as an idea and it cannot 
be considered that we had any talks or consultations with 
Beijing on the matter." 
  The press had reported that Seoul proposed signing the 
treaty 
at the Beijing talks which opened Wednesday and that China 
responded positively to the offer.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Wu Xueqian, vice 
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative 
Conference, hinted at the possibility of revising the Chinese 
school textbooks that claim South Korea attacked the North to 
trigger the Korean war (1950-53) during his recent visit, but 
education authorities see little coming of it. 
  Since ties were normalized in August 1992, South Korean and 
Chinese textbook editors have discussed correcting inaccurate 
accounts of the other's country in school textbooks at several 
seminars, but failed to reach any agreement, Education Ministry 
officials said Friday. 
  One Chinese textbook reads: "A war erupted in Choson 
(Korea). 
American imperialists invaded the North." 
  Seoul wants it stated clearly that a Southward invasion took 
place, but Beijing is unwilling because it would mean China 
supported the invader. 
  The Chinese communists apparently wanted to assert they 
helped the North Koreans because a northward push by the 
Americans could have threatened their country, justifying their 
involvement in the war. 
  For Beijing's part, it wants Seoul to indicate that 
Manchuria 
belongs to its northeastern region and Taiwan is one of its 
provinces. 
  These disagreements make it unlikely that China will correct 
its textbooks anytime in the near future, officials here said. 
  The ministry, nonetheless, will continue to invite Chinese 
textbook editors to seminars and hold more discussions.

  [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The Trade 
Negotiation Committee (TNC) ministerial meeting closed on 
Friday, officially winding up the tough Uruguay Round (UR) talks. 
  Trade ministers from 125 countries adopted the Marrakesh 
declaration, signaling the end of the UR negotiations, and four 
ministerial decisions before they signed the final act wrapping 
up the seven-and-a-half-year UR process. 
  South Korean Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su 
signed the final act and the government procurement agreement 
but did not initial the accord on establishing the World Trade 
Organization (WTO), an annex to the final act. 
  The government plans to sign the accord after the National 
Assembly ratifies the UR agreement. 
  Under the final act, participating countries promise to 
accept the results of the UR negotiations and adopt domestic 
legal procedures to launch the WTO system as soon as possible. 
  With the signing, legal conditions were satisfied for 
inauguration of the WTO, which will replace the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) system that has regulated 
global trade since World War II. 
  The Marrakesh declaration established a preparatory 
committee 
for the WTO and devised the necessary measures to effectuate the 
WTO accord on Jan. 1, 1995, or the earliest possible date next 
year. 
  The four ministerial decisions cover trade and the 
environment, establishment of the preparatory comittee for the 
WTO, acceptance of and accession to the agreement establishing 
the WTO, and the organizational and financial consequences of 
implementing the agreement establishing the WTO. 
  The decision on trade and the environment regulates the 
establishment of the trade and environment committee in order to 
study the two areas' linkage at the WTO's first council meeting. 
  That on the creation of the preparatory committee concerns 
the effort to carry out a smooth change from the GATT to the WTO 
system. 
  GATT Secretary-general Peter Sutherland was appointed 
chairman of the preparatory committee in a private capacity. 
  The decision on the acceptance of and accession to the 
agreement regulates procedures in dealing with original members 
of the WTO and those countries which do not participate in the 
WTO or which have not confirmed country schedules in the goods 
and service fields. 
  That on the organizational and financial consequences 
flowing 
from implementation of the agreement establishing the WTO 
regulates donations for the WTO budget and the working terms of 
WTO staff. 
  Meanwhile, Minister Kim said South Korea should concentrate 
on using the WTO system effectively in the future. 
  "The UR negotiations confirmed free trade and 
multilateralism, and will serve as the most important momentum 
in world trade history," Kim said after signing the final act.

  [Text] Iraq has recently notified South Korea that it will 
temporarily close down its embassy in Seoul, citing poor 
economic conditions in the country caused by a long-standing 
U.N. trade embargo. 
  In the notification delivered to the Foreign Ministry April 
6, Baghdad hoped that despite the measure, "the friendly 
relations" between the two countries would be strengthened, said 
a ministry official. 
  He said the Iraqi government also promised to reopen its 
embassy here as soon as its economic conditions improve. 
  The Iraqi Embassy housed in a two-story building in 
Tongbinggo- tong, central Seoul, will be actually shut down late 
next month, said the official. 
  South Korea and Iraq established formal diplomatic ties in 
July 1989, upgrading the consulate-general in each others 
capital to an embassy. 
  The Seoul government, however, withdrew embassy staff, 
including the ambassador, from Baghdad in January 1991 when 
tensions were mounting in the Gulf region after the Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait the previous year. 
  South Korean diplomats so far have not returned to Baghdad. 
  The ministry official said a South Korean diplomat who is 
working as acting ambassador to Iraq is now stationed in the 
Jordanian capital of Amman. 
  Since setting up diplomatic ties in 1989, Iraq has not 
assigned an ambassador to Seoul and has been represented by a 
charge d'affaires. 
  While Iraq cited its economic predicament as the reason for 
its decision to close down the embassy in Seoul, some diplomatic 
observers here suspect the decision may reflect Iraq's 
dissatisfaction with Seoul for not reopening its embassy in 
Baghdad. 
  When reached by phone, Taha H. Mohammed, Iraqi charge 
d'affaires, rebuffed the speculation. 
  He emphasized the decision was from a purely economic 
motivation. 
  "We'll be ready to come back and open our embassy again 
(when 
the Iraqi economy gets better)," he said. 
  "We have found Korean people and companies cooperative with 
Iraq and I hope good relationship will still be maintained 
between the two countries," he added. (KKH)

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- The Defense Ministry 
will announce over the weekend a reshuffle of Army and Air Force 
officers affecting eight to 10 Army two- and three-star 
officers, informed sources said Friday. 
  The first military personnel changes by Defense Minister Yi 
Pyong-tae, the Army reshuffle will likely involve the discharge 
of three- and four-star generals who were members of the defunct 
Hana- hoe, a private politically motivated club of some Korean 
military academy-graduated officers once led by Former 
Presidents Chon Tu- hwan and No Tae-u. 
  Of the one- and two-star Hana-hoe members, some major 
generals will be discharged from active service and the 
remaining major and brigadier generals will be dismissed from 
important staff and division command posts. 
  The scope of the Army reshuffle will depend on whether Gen. 
Kim Chae-chang, deputy commander of the combined ROK-U.S. Forces 
Command, is discharged for his links with Hana-hoe, the sources 
said.

parliamentary revision of election laws and favor a generational

  They also expect the reforms will lead to clean politics,

800 citizens and 200 specialists (100 politicians and 100 
election management committee members) across the country 
conducted by Korea Research between April 11-14 under YONHAP 
News Agency's sponsorship. 
  Asked if the reforms would lead to a generational shift in 
politics by helping young, honest people enter the political 
arena, 84.5 percent of the citizen-respondents gave a positive 
reply and only 12.3 percent responded negatively. 
  Of the specialist-respondents, 85.2 percent were positive 
and 
14.4 percent negative. 
  Asked if the revised election laws would help realize clean 
politics, 82 percent of the citizen-respondents (96.6 percent 
for specialists) said "yes" and 15 percent (3.5 percent) "no." 
  Concerning President Kim Yong-sam's handling of state 
affairs, 13.6 percent of the citizens said "very good," 54.8 
percent "somewhat good," 26 percent "somewhat bad," and 3.1 
percent "very bad." 
  In the specialist group, 21.8 percent checked "very good," 
51 
percent "somewhat good," 18.3 percent "somewhat bad," and 6.9 
percent "very bad." 
  As for political party preference, the Democratic Liberal 
Party led with a 26.3-percent support rate, followed by the 
Democratic Party at 22.9 percent, the New Political Reform Party 
at 9.6 percent, the United People's Party at 2.5 percent and the 
New Korea Party at 1.9 percent. 
  Noteworthy is that 27.6 percent of the respondents favored 
none of the five parties. 
  Asked if the new election laws would clean up the four local 
polls slated for next year, 59.6 percent of the citizens 
questioned (85.6 percent for specialists) gave a positive reply 
and 36.9 percent (13.4 percent) a negative answer. 
  With regard to who played the leading role in effecting the 
political reforms, 40.4 percent (42.1 percent) pointed to 
President Kim Yong-sam, 22.3 percent (17.3 percent) the ruling 
party and 15.5 percent (23.3 percent) the opposition party. 
  The new election laws were generally well accepted, as 54.9 
percent (54 percent) said the opposition party would benefit 
more than the ruling party. 
  But the 50 million won-ceiling on election funds for every 
candidate provided for by the new legislation drew a negative 
reaction from the citizen-respondents: 57.2 percent said the 
ceiling would not be obeyed, while 39.4 percent replied it would 
be respected by candidates. 
  Some 69.8 percent of the specialist-respondents gave a 
positive reaction and 29.7 percent a negative one. 
  As to gifts from candidates, 81.5 percent of the citizen- 
respondents said they would reject them, while only 15.4 percent 
would accept them. 
  And 80.2 percent said that if they see a candidate violate 
the election laws, they would take action. 
  Asked who should play the most important role in 
establishing 
the new electoral system, 53.5 percent (50.5 percent for 
specialists) cited voters, 17.9 percent (15.8 percent) the 
government, 12.4 percent (24.8 percent) candidates and 7.1 
percent (3 percent) election management committees. 
  Asked if the new political fund donation system would help 
the opposition party, 73.8 percent of the specialist-respondents 
gave a positive reply and 25.3 percent a negative answer.

  [Text] Various statistical information, which had been 
under exclusive control of the government, will now be released 
to the public through the National Statistical Office (NSO). 
  On the supply list will be 440,000 statistics regarding 
about 
500 areas, including income, health, industry, labor, money, 
foreign exchange rates, inflation, economic growth and 
international statistics, NSO officials said yesterday. 
  The only exceptions from the free release will be such 
statistical figures that may infringe on individuals' privacy or 
private businesses' trade secrets, they said. 
  To gain access to the official statistics, one has to have a 
personal computer and subscribe to related computer network 
systems run by private information suppliers, the officials said. 
  For instance, Korea Securities Computer Corp. has already 
been providing stock market information through its Stocknet 
network from March and Dacom plans to supply a statistical 
service through its Chollian network from June. 
  Other than the computer network services, the statistics can 
be sold in the form of diskettes and magnetic tapes at the 
request of individuals and corporations with certain fees for 
using computers. 
  The NSO will also operate an ARS (audio response system) in 
the fourth quarter of this year, by which time it will provide 
ready answers on 1,000 basic statistics with only one phone call.

  [Text] Hanoi VNA April 15 -- The Hoa Binh Hydro-Electric 
Plant, the largest in Vietnam, has reached its full designed 
output of 1,920 mw [megawatts], with the launching of its eight 
and last turbine on Thursday morning. Construction of the plant 
was started on November 6, 1979, with assistance from the former 
Soviet Union, and is continued with the help of the Russian 
Federation. Since the first turbine became operational in 
December 1988, the plant straddling the Black River west of 
Hanoi, has supplied the country with 17.15 billion kwh [kilowatt 
hours]. Last year's output was 4.73 billion kwh, or 45 [as 
received] of the national output. The big ceremony held for the 
completion of the last turbine was attended, among other ranking 
officials, by Deputy Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong and visiting 
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Yarov. Prime Minister Vo 
Van Kiet also sent his congratulations to all the workers and 
specialists who have taken part in building this historic 
project. Finishing touches are being made to the plant, which 
is to be officially opened in September.

  [Text] The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry says Czech Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec will visit Vietnam soon. We now review 
the relations between Vietnam and Czech. 
  It will be an official visit by a Czech foreign minister in 
two years since the country separated into the Federation of 
Czech and Slovakia and it also is the first visit by a foreign 
minister from an Eastern European country following the end of 
the Cold War. The visit will be made in an international 
situation, which is changing positively. 
  Czech has attached a great importance to its traditional 
relations with Vietnam and other Asia-Pacific countries. Over 
many years, and particularly in the past two years, the 
relations between Vietnam and the Czechslovak Federation in 
general and Czech in particular, have been constantly 
consolidated and developed. Exchange of high-level visits has 
been made. Czech has helped Vietnam in training of thousands of 
students and apprentices and post-graduate students. Many now 
hold important positions in leading offices of Vietnam. 
  Vietnam and Czech have had labor cooperation for many years. 
In the near future, the two countries will continue to sign 
agreements on labor cooperation under which thousands of 
Vietnamese guest workers will be dispatched to Czech every year. 
Czech has also agreed to grant gratuitous aid to Vietnam in 
training another 200 Vietnamese apprentices and given 12 
scholarships to university students to study in Czech. The 
Czech Government has granted 13 million U.S. dollars in aid to 
help repatriate Vietnamese guest workers due to changes in 
Eastern Europe. In 1993, two-way trade turnover between Vietnam 
and Czech reached 13 million U.S. dollars. 
  During the coming visit to Vietnam, the Czech prime minister 
will be accompanied by dozens of businessmen to study Vietnam's 
domestic and foreign policies and economic renovation and to 
seek the possibility of strengthening and expanding cooperation 
with Vietnam in the new era.

<F P=106> [Article by Ho Xuan Nam, engineer, director of Chemical </F>
Engineering Corporation 13, and Thanh Cao] 
  [Text] For many years now, along with the Z121, Z131, and 
Z115 plants, the Z113 Plant has been using the techniques used 
by the military to produce explosives to produce industrial 
explosives to serve the national economic sectors. This is an 
economic commodity for which long-term guidelines have been set. 
In this sphere, it can be said that since the end of the 1970s, 
when the country encountered difficulties concerning aid, the 
national defense industry has been promptly providing a large 
quantity of explosives for the coal sector to support 
production. To date, the national defense industry has 
simultaneously produced everything from fuses and detonators to 
explosives. Some plants are turning to producing gelatin 
explosives, which is a type of explosive having many advantages 
during use. Along with this, the military's control and 
protection system has been perfected and consists of scientific 
research organizations, separate storehouses, and special means 
of transportation. Many of the explosive materials produced by 
the national defense plants and Z113 have won gold medals at 
international industrial fairs. In recent years, the use of 
explosives by the economic sectors has increased greatly. Our 
national defense plants have satisfied 50 percent of those 
needs. If the state invests a suitable amount, the national 
defense industry will be able to satisfy all of the domestic 
needs for explosives. 
  As everyone knows, explosives are a special type of 
commodity 
that can be used for both military and economic purposes. Thus, 
decentralizing control and investing in expanding production 
must be examined based on this special nature of explosives. The 
method that has been used up to now to decentralize control is 
very illogical. Two decades ago, when the country was 
concentrating everything for the front lines, the use of 
explosives in the economic sphere was concentrated mainly in the 
coal sector. Thus, it made sense for the government to make this 
sector responsible for controlling the materials. But the war 
ended a long time ago. Besides the coal sector, many other 
sectors such as the construction and communications sectors also 
use explosives. However, because the above decision has not yet 
been revised, control and distribution matters must go through 
the coal sector, which has given it a monopoly in distribution. 
This has created many problems, increased non-production 
expenses, and done much damage to both the production 
installations and installations that use explosives. 
  As one of the national defense plants directly involved in 
producing industrial explosives, we hope that the state will 
soon issue a decision in line with today's realities. This will 
enable the national defense plants to manifest their potential 
and better support economic construction. At the same time, this 
will contribute to promoting domestic production, to effectively 
implementing the Politburo's resolution on solidifying and 
expanding the national defense industry, and to increasing the 
country's defense strength.

<F P=106> [Summary of a speech by Senior Lieutenant General Tran Van </F>
Quang, chairman of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Veterans 
Association, given at the Third Plenum of the Central Committee 
of the Vietnam Veterans Association] 
  [Text] It's the nature of imperialism to interfere in the 
internal affairs of other countries in order to topple and 
enslave them. 
  The party has educated the Vietnamese people, particularly 
veterans, about that, and actual life has proven this during the 
revolutionary struggle. Even though they have suffered defeats 
in armed aggression, the imperialists have not changed their 
nature or plots. Now, along with making preparations to carry on 
armed aggression, their main method of aggression today is to 
cause turmoil and disorder and carry on "peaceful evolution" 
activities in an attempt to turn Vietnam into a dependent 
country within their orbit. Since the collapse of the Soviet 
Union and the socialist countries in Eastern Europe, they have 
promoted this strategy, which they refer to as a strategy for 
expanding victory. This is a very insidious strategy that is 
being carried on in two ways: They are stirring up turmoil and 
fostering local conflicts and carrying on "peaceful evolution" 
activities within each country in order to cause crises, 
poverty, and conflicts so that they can easily gain control. The 
situation in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, African 
countries, and a number of countries on other continents have 
proven this point today, there are 32 hot spots affecting 36 
countries. 
  In order to carry out this worldwide counterrevolutionary 
strategy, the imperialists have put forth four main policies: 
  a. Both compete and cooperate with the major capitalist 
countries -- Western Europe and Japan -- in order to share the 
responsibilities, which actually means working together to 
eliminate the regimes of the independent countries and divide 
world rule. 
  b. Continue to promote "democratization" in the SNG 
countries 
and Eastern Europe, which actually means to continue eliminating 
the achievements of socialism at the root and quickly promote 
the "capitalization" of those countries. 
  c. Continue to transform the remaining socialist countries, 
the most important of which are China and Vietnam, and use 
Vietnam as the spearhead in the attack, because China is a large 
country that would take much more time; once Vietnam has been 
transformed, this evolutionary process will be promoted in China. 
  d. Solidify and strengthen the political and military 
position of the United States in important zones, and gradually 
shift the center of immediate foreign affairs activities to Asia. 
  Naturally, this is a subjective plot of theirs. Today, with 
the negative lessons from the former Soviet Union, Eastern 
Europe, and other countries such as African countries that are 
suffering because of imperialist plots, the people of the world 
are on guard. The common trend today is toward national 
independence and peace. Internally, the American imperialists 
are facing many difficulties. They can't do everything they 
want. However, the decisive thing is that countries and peoples 
must be aware of their insidious plot and integrated offensive 
strategy--which includes political, ideological, organizational, 
economic, cultural, and social strategies, weapons, and both 
foreign and domestic forces--in order to constantly be on guard 
and actively defeat each of their stratagems and destructive 
plots. 
  Vietnam is one of the key points where the enemy is carrying 
on "peaceful evolution" and trying to cause disorder. After many 
years, their plans to infiltrate armed exiles into Vietnam in 
order to establish "war zones" and disrupt things have been 
defeated. Thus, they have decided that the main method used to 
attack Vietnam will be "peaceful evolution" in conjunction with 
zonal violence. And they are coordinating outside forces with 
domestic forces. In each specific area, they rely on the 
hard-core forces and use specific forms of activities legal, 
quasi-legal, illegal, political, ideological, economic, 
cultural, and so on in order to build up their forces and 
political strength and create the proper conditions for 
"peaceful evolution" and disorder. 
  As for strategic methods, they are using Cambodia and other 
conditions to penetrate Vietnam. They are blocking and 
destroying Vietnamese-Chinese relations. They are trying to 
prevent Vietnam from becoming strong economically, they continue 
to isolate us politically, and they are promoting ideological 
and moral decay. They are trying to penetrate state 
organizations, political and social organizations, and degraded 
and degenerate cadres, make use of the conflicts among the 
people and the mistakes of the cadres, and gradually invalidate 
the leadership of the party. Combining those two formulas 
disorder and loss of political stability and "peaceful 
evolution" will transform the system into a non-democratic, 
non-socialist system. 
  In reality, they have carried on many activities to stir up 
trouble and create political instability, causing certain 
difficulties for us. Not including 1992 and prior years, in 1993 
alone they carried out a number of activities. A typical example 
was what happened on 7 March in Ho Chi Minh City and nearby 
areas. They set off explosions, set fires, and planned to take 
over the city's radio and television stations and present 
themselves as a "government appealing for international help." 
With the spirit of vigilance of the people and people's security 
forces, we immediately crushed them. 
  Thanks to the vigilance of the people and the correct and 
timely manner in which things have been handled by the 
administrative organizations, their plots and stratagems have 
all failed. 
  Based on their activities, we can make generalizations about 
a number of their principal stratagems: 
  They have used the mistakes made by a number of localities 
in 
implementing the policies and the gullibility and superstitious 
nature of a number of people to stir up trouble. 
  They have set off simple and varied explosive devices and 
coordinated forces on the spot with forces from other localities. 
  They have united reactionary elements posing as religious 
people and reactionary elements among the ethnic minorities, a 
number of puppet troops, and puppets of the old regime who 
refuse to reform themselves. 
  They are in contact with people abroad and receive commands 
from abroad. 
  Following their defeats in 1993 and in prior years, they 
realized that the situation was not yet ripe. In their view, for 
the situation to be ripe, there must be four conditions: 
  1. Steps must be taken to ensure that the people, 
particularly elements of the upper class and those engaged in 
social activities, are vague about political concepts, lose 
their socialist orientation, and accept the doctrine of 
pluralism and multiple parties. The party's leadership and the 
administration's control must gradually be invalidated. They say 
that there is a "germ" of this today, but this has not yet 
become a tide, and they are not yet strong enough. 
  2. There must be activist forces within using many forms of 
organization, including social democracy and radical democracy. 
This exists today but is not yet strong enough. 
  3. The reactionary and backward forces and rabble-rousers 
must be united under a unified command. They say that this is in 
the process of being formed.) 
  4. Active support must be provided from abroad. 
  In order to bring about these conditions, they say that the 
resistance factions must be united and that well-known people 
must serve as the "banners" in propagating ideas and theories 
and carrying on legal and quasi-legal activities. Efforts must 
be concentrated on attacking a number of our positions and 
policies and specific mistakes made by us and on criticizing a 
number of leaders. 
  They say that Vietnam has a tradition of patriotism and 
national pride and that the CPV has seized the nationalist 
banner. Because of this, slogans such as "eliminate socialism, 
eliminate the communist party" cannot be used. Instead, the 
mistakes and difficulties of the party and administration must 
be used to gradually erode and invalidate the leadership of the 
party. Only then will it be possible to create the conditions 
for toppling the system. 
  Although the destructive activities mentioned above are 
important, they represent just the tip. Much more dangerous are 
their offensive activities on the ideological, political, 
economic, cultural, organizational, and espionage fronts. That 
is the core of their "peaceful evolution" offensive. 
  1. On ideological viewpoints, they have put forth the 
following requirements and contents: 
  They say that in the stage when the situation is not yet 
ripe, requiring the people to directly oppose socialism and the 
communist party is excessive. Thus, socialism should not be 
criticized in its entirety. Instead, attacks should concentrate 
on the basic points of socialism such as the dictatorship of the 
proletariat, a single leading party, human rights, freedom, and 
so on. In order to do this, they have proposed a "third path," 
which they say does not follow capitalism or socialism or any 
other doctrine except freedom and prosperity. This is really 
aimed at abandoning the socialist path to follow the capitalist 
path. They reject the leadership of the communist party and the 
dictatorship of the proletariat, saying that the dictatorship of 
the proletariat is undemocratic and that the leading party has 
replaced god in ruling the people. They argue that President 
Ho's choice has not been fulfilled. While independence has been 
won, there is no freedom or happiness. And because 
Marxism-Leninism has made mistakes, the party has had to 
renovate itself. But the party has gone only half-way in 
renovating itself and so people must demand that it renovate 
itself more. The basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi 
Minh thought must be abandoned and so on and so on. 
  2. They have put forth an action program -- which they call 
a 
scenario -- on Vietnam's transitional path. The contents are: 
  At the start, there is no need to eliminate the communist 
party, but the party must renovate itself further. The party can 
then transform itself into a non-Marxist party and implement a 
system of political pluralism. 
  The entire economy must be de-nationalized, the 
"independence" of the mass organizations must be assured and 
progressive and moderate political organizations must gradually 
come into being, with the tendency being toward political 
pluralism. Freedom must be expanded, opposition must be 
accepted, and so on. 
  If the above "scenario" is implemented, the communist party 
and Vietnam's social system will be transformed into the system 
that they want, and that will be a "victory without war." 
  They are disseminating the above arguments quite broadly 
using many means each week there are more than 100 documents, 
and in October 1993 alone there were 650 documents. They are 
also using meetings to propagandize the above theory and 
spreading rumors and sowing doubts. Recently, at a debate on 
Vietnam held by a number of Japanese businessmen, they mentioned 
having the CPV transform itself into a national party and having 
the Vietnamese system transform itself into a capitalist system. 
  3. On organization: 
  They are not only propagating an anti-socialist viewpoint 
but 
also following the organizational path. Besides gathering people 
to openly voice opposition, they are trying to penetrate us 
using a variety of methods such as holding scientific debates, 
having groups come and go, and reviewing cooperative plans on 
the economic, cultural, and social fronts. We do not oppose the 
debates on economic and cultural exchanges. We have studied and 
accepted the scientific achievements of man and the economic and 
social management experiences of other countries. But we must 
wage a resolute struggle against the viewpoints of the enemy, 
who are using every form and means possible to destroy our 
system. 
  4. The economy: 
  This is another very important struggle front against 
"peaceful evolution." Besides the economic embargo imposed by 
the American imperialists, the large capitalist countries have 
both fought for Vietnamese markets in order to reap large 
profits and also used the economic path in the hope of leading 
us into their trap. The following are a few examples: 
  They have promised to invest a lot, but in reality, they 
have 
invested very little. 
  They have invested mainly in private enterprises. 
  They have emphasized investing in the travel, services, and 
processing sectors. 
  Through economic activities, they have propagated depraved 
views and a corrupt culture, and they have bribed and corrupted 
cadres. 
  5. Culture, morality, and espionage: 
  These, too, are fronts on which they are attacking us. 
Depraved cultural products that stimulate violence and 
debauchery, propagate a pragmatic way of life, and destroy good 
morals and good customs are corrupting some of our youths and 
children. Espionage and the theft of national secrets and 
activities aimed at causing splits among the people pose an 
immediate and long-term danger to defending and building the 
country. 
  The "peaceful evolution" activities and other disruptive 
activities of the enemy forces pose a danger to the independence 
and path of development of our country. 
  Opposing and defeating those activities is a strategic task 
of the entire party, all the people, and the entire political 
system of the state. This is a struggle front to defend the 
system and protect the fruits of the revolution and our nation's 
path forward. As revolutionary leaders have said, this struggle 
is a struggle on the political, ideological, economic, cultural, 
security, national defense, and social fronts. It must be waged 
using both education, discipline, and the laws; it must be both 
peaceful and violent; production must be stepped up; attention 
must be given to the people's standard of living; and the enemy 
must be isolated and exposed in order to defeat them. 
  The immediate thing is to concentrate on the following: 
  We must adhere firmly to a revolutionary socialist 
viewpoint, 
thoroughly understand the renovation lines and targets of the 
party with a scientific basis, and implement [the lines] more 
and more effectively. While making an effort to contribute to 
the struggle to have a prosperous people, strong country, fair 
society, and civilized country with a socialist orientation, we 
must never forget that the expansion of production with many 
economic elements must have a socialist orientation. We must 
open the door and study the scientific and technical 
achievements of other countries, but we must not forget to 
adhere to the concept of independence, sovereignty, and 
self-reliance. We must expand investment cooperation in order to 
attract capital and raw materials and gain experience, but we 
must not forget the struggle to eliminate the opportunistic and 
destructive factors. We must be vigilant and actively criticize 
the erroneous arguments and the distortions of Marxism-Leninism 
and Ho Chi Minh thought, socialism, and the leadership of the 
party. 
  Democracy must be elevated along with maintaining discipline 
and the laws. Those two aspects are inseparable in building 
strength. Democracy starts from the interests of the people, by 
the people, and for the people. Discipline is necessary to 
defend democracy. 
  There must be active participation in mobilizing the masses, 
implementing the policy of great national solidarity, handling 
the "burning issues" and conflicts among the people, 
implementing the economic-cultural-social development programs 
and security and national defense programs in the localities to 
bring practical benefits to the people, and opposing corruption, 
smuggling, and other social evils.

<F P=106> [Article by Tran Quan] </F>
  [Text] The anticorruption and antismuggling struggle, which 
is a major policy of the party and state, is aimed at protecting 
economic development and wholesomeness in social life. This is 
also a need of the people in building a "prosperous people and 
strong country." But enemies of the revolution and political 
malcontents and deviates are using this struggle to weaken the 
people's confidence and destabilize the country. 
  They are making use of the widespread corruption and 
smuggling to "generalize," viewing all of our party and state 
organizations as "corrupt," and encouraging the "most depraved 
people, who can only cause destruction, to rebuild things." They 
do not accept the anticorruption and antismuggling struggle 
being carried on by the party and state. They are spreading 
distorted information, smearing the leading cadres of the party 
and state, and charging that those people are involved in 
corruption and smuggling. 
  Unfortunately, their improper activities have temporarily 
shaken a number of people who lack accurate information and 
knowledge about the present situation and increased their 
dissatisfaction with life today. Those black arguments, which 
continue to be passed on "along the street," are causing 
confusion in public opinion. But the black clouds cannot obscure 
the sun. The entire world recognizes the important and positive 
achievements scored by our country in the renovation movement. 
There is no way that the enemy can refute that. Those 
achievements prove that most of our cadres and party members and 
most of our people are adhering firmly to the wonderful 
traditions and, for the people and country, are exploiting the 
advantages and struggling to overcome the shortcoming and 
weaknesses in order to ensure that the revolution continues to 
make great strides forward. Only a few cadres and party members, 
including a number of high-level cadres, are degraded, and they 
are gradually being purged. Because of this, we think that while 
we must resolutely and urgently promote the anticorruption and 
antismuggling struggle, we must also heighten vigilance and 
promptly block the actions of the enemy and malcontents who are 
making use of this struggle to destroy the country. To do this: 
  Maintaining political stability today must be regarded as 
the 
leading task in building a "prosperous people and strong 
country." The main thing is to stabilize the feelings of the 
people and not allow the enemy and malcontents to start a 
"psychological war." When propagandizing the anticorruption and 
anti-smuggling struggle, the mass means of information must also 
give attention to exposing the actions of the enemy who are 
misusing that struggle to stir up trouble and ruin things so 
that they cannot make use of the loopholes in the contents and 
methods of implementation. 
  The party committee echelons must monitor things and adhere 
to public opinion in order to promptly implement suitable 
propaganda policies and actively prevent the various types of 
"psychological warfare" from doing any damage. Having doubts and 
fearing that blocking the counterpropaganda arguments will 
"hinder democracy" are misconceptions about democracy. Such 
doubts and fears represent a failure to distinguish clearly 
between the legitimate aspirations of the people and the plots 
of the enemy and arguments of the malcontents. 
  The judicial organizations must promptly find and prosecute 
those who are intentionally distorting the truth with the aim of 
tarnishing the reputation of the honest people in the party 
leadership and administrative organizations and disrupting the 
building of the country or who are intentionally publishing 
illegal materials. Disrupting the stability of the country and 
destroying the people's confidence in the revolution can 
sometimes do greater damage than the material value of many 
cases of corruption and smuggling added together. 
  The party and state must constantly elevate the principle of 
democratic centralism. Cadres and party members must make an 
effort to maintain a concept of organization and discipline and 
be on guard against the "psychological warfare" and other 
destructive plots of the enemy. They must not speak in an 
unprincipled manner or in ways that unintentionally aid the 
enemy. 
  A number of people are still uncertain about the the term 
unprincipled "freedom, openness, and democracy." They do not 
realize that this is the weapon that enemies and reactionaries 
are using to attack the party in power. We have many good 
lessons to help us be aware of these plots and prevent them from 
interfering with the implementation of the present struggle 
against negative aspects.

  [Text] The Vietnam Second Catholic Solidarity General 
Committee held its fourth plenary session in Hanoi this morning. 
  In past years, the patriotic emulation movement by Catholics 
as well as activities of the Catholic solidarity committees of 
provinces and cities countrywide have been focused on 
implementing the resolution of the Vietnam Catholic Solidarity 
General Committee's third plenary session. Catholics of all 
strata have placed their confidence on and carried out pretty 
well the policies of the state in all socioeconomic aspects. In 
many localities, Catholics have positively contributed 
suggestions and opinions on drafts to amend laws such as the Law 
on Land, Tax Law, on so forth. They also responded well to 
social and charity activities. Many localities have effectively 
provided poor Catholics with material help or cash amounting to 
many million dong. 
  In anticipation of the National Congress of the Vietnamese 
Catholicism, which will be held in 1995, the Catholic solidarity 
committees of all localities have actively continued to 
consolidate their organization and reformed their activities; 
have motivated Catholics to step up their production and 
business activities in all fields of agriculture, industry, 
forestry, and so forth; and have encouraged young Catholics to 
participate in the national defense movement, in campaigns to 
eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, in campaigns to reward 
family with meritorious deeds, as well as in campaigns to fight 
social vices.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Loud songs of loyalty 
sung by overseas Koreans are ringing out from the stages of the 
12th April Spring Friendship Art Festival which is open in 
Pyongyang in celebration of the birthday of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song. 
  Participating in the festival are an art troupe of Koreans 
in 
Japan, an art troupe of Koreans in China and an art troupe of 
the International Federation of Koreans for Reunification. 
  The art troupe of Koreans in Japan is putting on stage "Song 
of Best Wishes Presented by the 700,000 Compatriots" at the 
Pyongyang Grand Theatre. 
  The tune, song and dance "Holiday" is the curtain-raiser of 
their colorful program consisting of soloes, choruses and 
dances. In "Holiday" the performers say that the 700,000 
Koreans in Japan wholeheartedly extend congratulations to the 
great leader, becoming flowers of loyalty and filial piety, 
calling the spring holiday in April, the month of his birth, a 
spring holiday of Korea, a spring holiday of the sun. 
  Hong Yong-wol, a "Kim Il-song Prize" winner and people's 
actress, passionately sings the song "Leader, Please Accept our 
Wishes" to be acclaimed by the audience. 
  Merited actor Yi Yong-su in the solo "A Happy Memory" sings 
loudly that Marshal Kim Chong-il is the father, saying that his 
deep loving care and broad smiles always give new courage and 
show a bright road. 
  The dancers in the dance "Spring Flowers" present on a vivid 
canvas the loyal hearts of the people in the homeland and the 
700,000 Koreans in Japan who will always hold the dear leader 
Marshal Kim Chong-il in high esteem to the tune of the song 
"Flowers in Full Bloom All Over the Country", with light red 
fans in their hands. 
  The Korean artistes from China are putting on stage the 
narration and song "Let us Sing of our Bliss in Having Sagacious 
Leader" and other numbers, touching the heart's cord of the 
audience. The performers loudly sing of the pride and 
happiness of the Koreans who are enjoying all the blessings of 
the world, though they are living in an alien land, as they have 
the great leader and the dear leader. 
  The performers of a woman solo and trio, in the song "Our 
General is the Greatest", highly laud the greatness of General 
Kim Chong-il who is the dearest father of the soldiers of the 
Korean People's Army, who calls at posts among bushy young pine 
trees and travels with them through the sky and the sea and who 
deals a sledge-hammer blow at the enemy. 
  The artistes of the International Federation of Koreans for 
Reunification are putting on stage the dance "Night of 
Pyongyang, Don't Advance", the female duet "The Old Home in the 
Snow," the female solo "I am Your Eternal Son" and other numbers. 
  The dance "Night of Pyongyang, Don't Advance" makes the 
audience feel the national pride of living in the socialist 
homeland under the guidance of the great leader and the dear 
leader. 
  The audience are deeply impressed by the performances of 
overseas Korean artistes who find it hard to repress their 
longing and reverence, embraced in the bosom of the great leader 
Generalissimo Kim Il-song and the dear leader Marshal Kim 
Chong-il.

<F P=106> [Interview via telephone with Toshiro Kishi, NHK </F>
correspondent in Pyongyang, by NHK announcer Yoshiaki Kawabata 
at the NHK studio in Tokyo -- live] 
  [Text] [Kawabata] An event will be held in Pyongyang 
tomorrow marking the 82nd birthday of North Korean President Kim 
Il- song. North Korea has allowed a group of NHK correspondents 
and correspondents from an American television station to cover 
the event, issuing them visas. 
  North Korea has permitted the NHK correspondents to cover 
the 
event for the first time in twenty months. Pyongyang has 
refused to permit foreign correspondents to cover activities in 
that country in the intervening time. North Korea's decision to 
permit foreign correspondents to cover the event amid mounting 
international tension following its refusal to allow inspections 
of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency is drawing attention. I will interview NHK correspondent 
Yoshiro Kishi who is now in Pyongyang. 
  Kishi, the 82nd birthday of President Kim Il-song will be 
celebrated tomorrow. What is Pyongyang like? 
  [Kishi] It is fine in Pyongyang and the temperature is high. 
The streets are festooned with national flags and a variety of 
flowers to celebrate the North Korean leader's birthday. 
Tomorrow is a national holiday. I see many women carrying 
large shopping bags believed to contain food for picnics. There 
is a festive mood in Pyongyang. I anticipated military tension 
over the so-called nuclear issue before I arrived here, but see 
no signs of such tensions at all in Pyongyang. 
  [Kawabata] Kishi, you visited Pyongyang two years ago. Have 
you found any changes this time? 
  [Kishi] Yes. I visited Pyongyang to cover the 80th birthday 
of President Kim Il-song. At the time, a pompous event was held 
to celebrate his birthday. This time the event is likely to be 
relatively low key. 
  [Kawabata] Kishi, North Korea has allowed NHK and American 
correspondents to cover the event. Why has North Korea decided 
to permit them to do so? 
  (Kishi] To be honest, we were hard-pressed to obtain visas 
from North Korea. I heard that President Kim Il-song and 
Secretary Kim Chong-il made the final decision. Military 
tensions have been mounting on the Korean peninsula over the 
so-called nuclear issue ever since a solution through dialogue 
has been stalemated. The acceptance of NHK and American 
correspondents by the North Korea leaders is of great 
significance. I have felt North Korea's strong will to resolve 
the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue. I will pay 
attention to how North Korean authorities will deal with our 
coverage activities. 
  [Kawabata] Thank you very much.

noble cause of reunification, closely united in one mind and 
purpose under the banner of the ten-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation," he stressed.

group of former heads of state and government and politicians 
from different countries led by ex-President of Costa Rica 
Rodrigo Carazo Odio visited Mangyongdae Wednesday. 
  At the old home in Mangyongdae where the great leader

story about this historical home. 
  After going round the revolutionary sites on the Mangyong 
hill, former member of the parliament of France and member of 
the European Parliament Pierro Ceyrac said Mangyongdae is a very 
beautiful place. "The Korean people look up to, revere and 
follow President Kim Il- song because he has performed great 
feats for them, always finding himself among them," he noted.

which is being built by Korean People's Army soldiers, former

soldiers participating in construction for the welfare of the 
people. He expressed the belief that the Korean people would 
certainly achieve progress. 
  After inspecting the three-revolution exhibition, former 
Prime Minister of Egypt Aziz Sedky said Korea has built a 
wonderful independent national economy. He noted that Korea has 
attained self-sufficiency in nearly all things because its 
policy is correct. 
  "Agriculture has developed and the people are well off as 
good policies for the people are pursued in your country," he 
said, adding: "All the people are evenly off. This is 
important." 
  After making a round of the Mangyongade School Children's 
Palace, General of the Army Jeannou Lacaze, former chief of 
staff of the Armed Forces of France, member of the European 
Parliament and chairman of the union of independentists, said he

regarding them as "kings" of the country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- Senior party and 
government officials Thursday appreciated the 17th part of the 
multi-part feature film "The Nation and Destiny" which has been 
released on the occasion of the April fete. 
  Appreciating the film were Kang Song-san, Pak Song-chol, Kim 
Yong-chu and other senior party and government officials, Yi 
Chin- kyu, first vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee 
of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(Chongnyon) who is heading a congratulatory group of Korean 
residents from Japan participating in the April 15 celebrations, 
and members of congratulatory groups, delegations and visiting 
groups of Koreans overseas from various regions. 
  The 17th part of "The Nation and Destiny" which has been 
completed as another masterpiece under the energetic guidance of 
the party is based on the life of Ho Chong-suk who was intensely 
loyal to the party and the leader till her last moments. 
  Through the chequered destiny and mental development of the 
heroine who joined in the communist movement in the 1920s when 
she was still a girl, the film shows in a profound artistic 
depiction the truth that one can not fight a worthy struggle to 
save the destiny of the motherland and the nation when one is 
not guided by a sagacious leader.

<F P=106> ["It Is Life and Soul of Socialist Cause To Ensure </F>
Uniformity of Ideology and Leadership"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
dedicates a signed article to the 20th anniversary of the 
publication of "Let Us More Firmly Establish the Monolithic 
Ideological System in the Whole Party and the Whole Society", a 
famous work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il (April 14, 
1974). 
  The article says it is the greatest feat of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il that he put forward the great idea and 
policy of establishing the monolithic ideological system in the 
whole party and the whole society and has successfully applied 
it and made the revolutionary ranks one socio-political organism 
in which the leader, the party and the masses are united closely. 
  It stresses that the party has raised it as a fundamental 
question decisive to the future and destiny of the cause of the 
party and socialism to ensure uniformity of ideology and 
leadership and brilliantly carried it into practice. 
  Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: 
  "Our party raised anew the principles of establishing its 
monolithic ideological system to meet the requirements of the 
development of the revolution in the 1970s when the modelling of 
the whole society on the chuche idea was put to the fore and has 
further deepened this work." 
  The article goes on: 
  He published a famous work "Let Us More Firmly Establish the 
Monolithic Ideologikal System in the Whole Party and the Whole 
Society" on the basis of a scientific analysis of the practical 
requirements of the development of our revolution, and set forth 
the outstanding idea and theory of more firmly establishing the 
monolithic ideological system in the whole party and the whole 
society. 
  This idea and theory of our party comprehensively 
consummates 
the principled requirements for further deepening this work in 
keeping with the demand of a new higher stage of modelling the 
whole of society on the chuche idea, and revolutionary policies 
for its realisation. This idea and theory is an original one 
which was the first in history to systematize and perfectly 
standardize all the theoretical and practical matters arising in 
the establishment of the monolithic ideological system in an 
integral way on the basis of the revolutionary outlook on the 
leader, and a great one indicating the road of accomplishing the 
revolutionary cause of chuche. 
  The exposition of this great idea and theory which has 
brought about a revolutionary change in the building and 
activities of the Workers' Party of Korea and in the struggle 
for accomplishing the socialist cause is a noble expression of 
the unshakable will of Comrade Kim Chong-il to purely inherit 
and accomplish the revolutionary cause started by the respected 
leader President Kim Il-song. 
  The immortal exploits performed by the WPK in the work for 
establishing the monolithic ideological system in the whole 
party and the whole society lie in that it has built up a great 
army of revolutionaries of chuche type unfailingly loyal to the 
party and the leader and made the revolutionary ranks an 
integral whole in ideology and purpose in which the leader, the 
party and the people shaje the same destiny. 
  Another exploit of the WPK in the work for establishing its 
monolithic ideological system finds expression in that it has 
wrought great miracles in socialist construction by intensifying 
its leadership over the revolution and construction. 
  The article further says: 
  The imperialists and reactionaries are trying to stifle 
Korean- style socialism more frantically than before. But, we 
are resolutely fighting against the enemy without any 
vacillation because we have the firm singlehearted unity around 
the party and the leader, a powerful independent national 
economy and self-reliant national defence. This clearly proves 
the wise leadership and great exploits of the WPK which has 
successfully led the work for establishing the monolithic 
ideological system in the whole party and society.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The idea of "believing 
in the people as in heaven" of great innovative significance for 
the development of the Korean and the world revolution is the 
maxim and philosophy of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
who began his revolutionary activities with mixing with the 
people and has pushed through the rigorous storms of the 
revolution. 
  It is the greatest happiness and fortune of the Korean 
people 
to have Comrade Kim Il-song who regards the people as heaven and 
devotes everything to the noble cause for the people all his 
life. 
  This is stressed in an editorial article of MINJU CHOSON 
Tuesday. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying: 
  "`To believe in the people as in heaven' is my maxim and 
philosophy. Ever since I embarked on the road of revolution, I 
have served the masses of people, regarding them as heaven and 
made the revolution in reliance on their strength." 
  In the first part, the article says respected Comrade Kim 
Il-song is the people's leader who has made the noble idea of 
"believing in the people as in heaven" his maxim and philosophy. 
  This outstanding idea calls for regarding the people as the 
most valuable and greatest beings in the world, absolutely 
trusting them and relying on them at all times. 
  Proceeding from his unshakable viewpoint and position that 
the masses of people are responsible for the revolution and 
construction and in charge of them, the respected leader 
propounded the great idea that when one believes in the people 
as in heaven and relies on them, one gains everything and wins 
victory every time. 
  Go to the people when difficulties crop up in the way of 
revolution, when you are hungry, when you are thirsty and when 
you are sad. This is the unshakable creed of our respected 
leader. With this creed, he began his revolutionary struggle 
with mixing with the people, and has always found himself among 
the people, never neglecting his contact with them, and 
triumphantly fought his way through the protracted trials of 
revolution, sharing weal and woe with them. 
  His idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" is the 
basic idea running through the immortal chuche idea, the guiding 
idea of our party. This idea serves as an invariable guiding 
compass which provides the revolutionaries and communists with a 
scientific knowledge of the decisive role of the people, who 
transform the world and shape their own destiny, and enables 
them to resolve every problem in reliance on the inexhaustible 
strength of the people. 
  In the second part, the article says Comrade Kim Il-song is 
a 
great leader who has brilliantly embodied in our revolutionary 
practice the noble idea of "believing in the people as in 
heaven," his maxim and philosophy. 
  He has mapped up lines and policies reflecting the will and 
interests of the people and carried them into effect and 
established the most popular mode of politics -- the work system 
and order for service to the people. 
  He expounded that the revolutionary struggle and 
constructive 
work are chiefly aimed at realising the desire and demand of the 
people for independence, and saw that the revolutionary lines 
and strategy and tactics were worked out always our own way on 
the basis of the people's desire and demand and every problem 
was solved with their own efforts. 
  He regards the will and demand of the people as absolute, 
respects them to the maximum and solves every problem to suit 
their tastes, saying that the revolution is for the people and 
what they say is good is always good. This fundamental idea 
runs through the course of his shaping lines and policies. 
  He formed chuche-type political organisations whose noble 
mission it is to serve the people and established within them a 
well-regulated work system and order of looking after the 
people's destiny in a responsible manner. 
  All the officials subordinate everything to the people and 
do 
anything in their interest as required by the party's slogan "We 
serve the people" and a unique mode of politics suited to the 
essential nature of Korean-style socialist society centred on 
the masses has been established throughout society. This is a 
patent proof of the sagacity of Comrade Kim Il-song's leadership. 
  In the third part, the article explains that the respected 
leader's noble idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" is 
a great idea which has been applied to our revolutionary 
practice and displayed a great vitality. 
  Our people have boldly broken the established concepts, 
common knowledge and all mysticism and established their new 
tradition and new model with unprecedented heroism and 
creativity and ushered in a new history of epoch-making changes 
in this land. The source of the strength of this great creation 
is the idea of "believing in the people as in heaven." 
  This noble idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is being unswervingly 
carried forward and brought into fuller play by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding thinker and theoretician 
and a tested statesman. 
  The dear leader enjoys deep respect and trust from the 
Korean 
people and the world revolutionary people and has the highest 
authority among the state leaders in the world for his great 
traits of always leading the revolution and construction 
victoriously under the fast-changing situation, turning 
adversity into favorable conditions with a firm belief in the 
people and in reliance on them and for his imperishable exploits 
for the party and the revolution, the country and the people.

<F P=106> ["Korean Revolution With Leader and People in Perfect </F>
Harmony Will Be Ever-victorious" -- KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
describes the unity of the leader and the people in harmonious 
whole as the greatest gain of the Korean revolution and the 
source of the invincible might of Korean-style socialism. 
  The paper in an editorial dedicated to the birthday of the 
great leader President Kim Il-song stresses that the whole 
history of the Korean revolution is proud annals which have seen 
the achievement of the perfect unity between the leader and the 
revolutionary soldiers, between the leader and the people and 
victorious advance of the revolution based on its might. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying: 
  "Since the dawn of our revolution, the Korean communists 
have 
been convinced that they could carve out the thorny 
revolutionary road only under the leadership of the great 
Comrade Kim Il-song, and have won victories, enduring all 
ordeals, and lived and fought with everlasting, single-hearted 
loyalty to him, entrusting their destinies entirely to him." 
  The editorial continues: 
  Since the beginning of his revolutionary activities, the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has always believed in the 
people and found himself among them in leading the revolution, 
unreservedly displaying the qualities and traits of a great 
leader of the people. 
  The great leader believes in the people and the latter trust 
and follow him. The bonds between them are those of kinship 
between the father and his children; they are so unbreakable 
that they can withstand any storm and stress and accomplish 
anything. Thus, the Korean revolution began with the harmonious 
unity between the leader and the people and has traversed a 
brilliant course on the basis of its might. 
  The perfect unity between the leader and the people is a 
mighty strength in resolutely defending the cause of 
Korean-style socialism. 
  The might of perfect unity between the leader and the people 
is fully demonstrated in the Korean revolution because it is one 
living body of common destiny and an integral whole in ideology 
and purpose. 
  He has always sincerely trusted the revolutionary soldiers 
and people and regarded their destiny as his own, while the 
people have absolutely trusted him as the centre and top brain 
of their lives and resolutely defended him. 
  Still today he is leading the people along the road of 
socialism, unswervingly assuming responsibility for their 
destiny, and the people are entrusting their destiny to the 
party and the leader and fighting with the unshakable resolve to 
follow them forever. 
  Our people have staunchly fought, taking the immortal chuche 
idea as their unshakable faith and the only banner of unity 
since the great leader founded this revolutionary idea. 
  The unity of our people in ideology and purpose is growing 
stronger because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is 
constantly developing the chuche idea to perfection. 
  The perfect unity between the leader and the people is 
mighty 
because it is being carried forward and consolidated through 
generations for the accomplishment of the cause of socialism. 
  The vigorous advance of the whole party, the entire people 
and the whole army closely united behind the dear leader shows 
that the harmonious unity between the leader and the people, 
which has been formed and consolidated through history, is being 
successfully carried forward with eternal vitality. 
  The source of the solidity of our perfect harmony is the 
great leader's idea of "believing in the people as in heaven." 
Our perfect harmony based on this great idea will never be 
broken. 
  The integral whole of the leader, the party and the people 
has been, is and will remain the lifeline of our socialism and 
the all- conquering banner. 
  We must make the advance of our revolution a history of the 
most tight bonds of kinship between the leader and the people, 
between the leader and the soldiers in the future, too.

  A collection of short stories "Victory" is based on the 
fatherland liberation war. 
  Writers of the publishing house are energetically working on 
full- and medium-length novels of various themes. The 
full-length novel "The Hill of Life" by Kim Yong-hwan depicting 
an official who devotes his whole life silently to the 
development of stock breeding and the medium-length novels "A 
New Morning on the Planet" and "A Daughter of the Coal Field" 
which exhale strong odor of the motherland and the hometown will 
see the light before long. 
  Kim Chin-song is writing the full-length novel "We Ask 
History the Question" and Chang Song-hun the full-length novel 
"Flowing Stars" on the theme of national reunification.

<F P=106> [Discussion by Noboru Takeshita, former prime minister, and </F>
Hirotaka Akamatsu, former Social Democratic Party of Japan 
secretary general, entitled: "An Admonishment to Messrs. Ozawa 
and Hosokawa;" moderated by unidentified BUNGEI SHUNJU staff 
member; date and place not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Takeshita] Many politicians are graduates of 
Waseda University, but it is rare to find an alumnus of Waseda 
under the old system, the Higher Institute [college] of Waseda 
University, like you. [passage omitted] 
  [Akamatsu] Around 1955 I was still going to primary school. 
[passage omitted] It must be admitted, however, that at that 
time the Socialist Party was high-spirited at the least in its 
determination to take the reins of government. But after a 
while, it became natural for the Socialist Party to be one half 
of the LDP in its strength, thus creating a 1.5 order rather 
than the two big parties. 
  [Takeshita] One merit of the order of 1955 was, to put it in 
good terms, the sharing of diplomatic roles -- the LDP toward 
the nations siding with the West and the Socialist Party toward 
those of the Eastern camp. That kind of diplomacy was not 
backed up by force of arms, but in an active sense it could be 
interpreted that Japan since the period of the occupation by the 
allied powers has made crafty, in a sense, use of two parties. 
For example, the Socialist Party used to tell the Eastern camp, 
"We want to be on good terms with you, but it is difficult to do 
so because we are at loggerheads with the stubborn LDP." On the 
other hand, the Western nations made demands on Japan to bear 
more burdens as it gained economic power little by little. Then 
the LDP used to make such excuses as, "We fully understand, but 
in view of the opinions represented by the Socialist Party we 
are not at liberty to go along with you." In the field of 
trade, Japan utilized the friendly-firms method to do business 
with all areas of the world. Thanks to such methods and to the 
advantages of free trade in both the East and West camps, Japan 
has become the world's biggest economic power. 
  In addition, with the expression "Siding With the Working 
People," the Socialist Party contributed to preventing society 
as a whole from suffering a gap between the rich and the poor 
and becoming one governed by the law of the jungle in a free 
economy where originally the rule of competition is at work. By 
incorporating the "principle of equality" -- the roots of 
socialism -- into the establishment, Japan succeeded in 
maintaining a balance with "liberalism" and the "rule of 
competition." The existence of the Socialist Party contributed 
to full institutionalization of such social security systems and 
welfare policies as the world's leading medical insurance and 
pension systems. I have a strong conviction that the existence 
of the Socialist Party contributed to the maintenance of 
so-called equality by mitigating the gap between the rich and 
the poor and by preventing the strong from eating the weak, 
which is permitted under the rule of competition. 
<H5>  Having Become A "Yu" Party </H5>
  [Takeshita] What I like to add is the inevitability of 
realignment in the political world. It is due to the fact that 
the double-faced diplomacy is no longer needed because one side 
of the East-West camps has disappeared and that Japan, with more 
than 100 billion dollars in ordinary surplus, has come to a 
point where a distinct diplomacy with an identity has to be 
carried out. Political realignment was long due domestically, 
because the Cold-War structure itself went through fundamental 
changes and partly because we [the LDP] lost the trust of the 
people. 
  [Akamatsu] Our Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is no 
longer allowed to carry on in the 1.5 order. We labelled 
ourselves the "party of the working people," but now we have to 
ask ourselves whether we are earnestly pursuing policies fit to 
represent the "party of the working people." "Rengo," which 
boasts 8 million in membership has almost become a dualistic 
structure, and owners of medium and small enterprises are 
casting votes in favor of the LDP. 
  The order of 1955 has lost its meaning as a reflection of 
the times, and I am afraid that we cannot create our own regime 
nor system unless that order of 1955 is smashed. Simply 
speaking, we were pursuing the idea of how to surpass the 
opponent LDP under the order of 1955, but now we have to take 
the idea of creating an entirely new political structure by 
finishing off the old order itself. 
  My father was a Diet member when I was born. So it seems 
that I came into the world with the Socialist Party tatooed on 
my body. [laughter] I had such a thorough education in 
socialism that I made rounds distributing Socialist handbills 
from primary school days and became a Socialist Party member at 
18. But now that Socialist Party itself [the SDPJ] has changed. 
  The present coalition government does not need to maintain 
its present shape, and it probably will not. Pairings may 
change in accordance with various alliances and unions, and the 
LDP may even come back to power. In the future, various 
situations may take place, and that is in accordance with a 
democracy. Looking at it from a different angle, it is more 
than natural for the government to change hands. "The 
government would change hands if it were in power for 10 years" 
will become common sense. In the meantime, Japan's political 
society will mature. I do not know whether it will be a 
multiparty system or a two-big-party system, but it never will 
happen that one political force will continue to rule for 10 or 
20 years. And that is how it should be in the first place. 
  [Takeshita] The coalition government came into being simply 
because we were under criticism, for which I was one of the 
responsible persons. The LDP is the leading political party in 
the Diet by holding the largest number of Diet members, but as 
it did not win a majority under criticism, it is natural for 
somebody else, whether it be a coalition or something else, to 
take over the reins of government from the LDP. In principle, 
the LDP must exert efforts to take the political initiative as 
the leading political party, but I myself had a clear-cut view 
that the LDP had to step down. 
  When the LDP became an opposition party, a certain man made 
an interesting comment that "the LDP now has become a `yu' 
party, Mr. Takeshita. By order of the Japanese syllabary in the 
line starting with `ya,' it is gruelling for `yo-to' [ruling 
party] to become 'ya-to' [opposition party] but you are 
somewhere around `yu' [in between the ruling and opposition 
parties]." 
  [Akamatsu] Ha, ha, ha... 
  [Takeshita] I groaned when I heard him say that. Modesty 
aside, I did so because I had been well aware of the importance 
of a government. 
  It is no use only howling "the ruling parties are 
unpardonable." Thus, the LDP cannot quite become an opposition 
party to the bone. Therefore, it remains a "yu" party with a 
strong desire not to shake the foundation of the state, to put 
it in clean expression. I myself am not quite used to being 
completely on the opposition side. 
  When the idea of a national welfare tax was brought up for 
the first time, for example, I recalled the time when a 
Socialist Party member had pointed out, "Hey, Take-san, make it 
a special-purpose tax," when the consumption tax was introduced 
in 1988. Cause and effect were not distinct enough to make it a 
special-purpose tax, as in the case of the gasoline tax, and as 
rudiments of public finance tell you, a special-purpose tax will 
lead to financial rigidity. So, I replied that it will be used 
for various welfare purposes. 
  Asked about the basis of the 7 percent tax rate of the 
national welfare tax concept, Prime Minister Hosokawa replied 
that "it was a rough estimate," and I did not wonder. It cannot 
be helped that he has less accumulation of knowledge than I and 
others who have been engaged in tax affairs for scores of years. 
Because this government was created following the LDP's loss of 
confidence and the people are allowing it to exist, 
inconsistencies such as not knowing answers to abrupt questions 
or taking some time to work out policies should be generously 
tolerated, in my opinion. 
  [Akamatsu] It is contradictory for me to criticize it, but 
it is certain that the SDPJ will be laughed at if it insists om 
making the tax an objective one. Even "democrats" within the 
SDPJ are saying stop it. If the tax were classified a 
special-purpose tax, approximately 10 trillion yen out of about 
a 70-trillion-yen budget would be fixed, leading to financial 
rigidity, and the tax rate should be raised automatically when 
the pension fund dries up. Is it not more fundamental to 
consider changing the character or the mechanism of the budget 
as a whole to a welfare-style budget? I think it is wrong to 
think that welfare will advance if the tax is made a 
special-purpose tax to be used only for specified purposes. 
  However, the idea came out all of sudden, and the SDPJ was 
compelled to say "it is going to be a special-purpose tax for 
welfare" in an emergency. As the situation developed, Mr. 
Ichikawa of Komeito and Mr. Ozawa of Shinseito could not help 
but acknowledge "it is all right with us to make it a 
special-purpose tax." Both sponsors and those who accepted the 
idea are to blame. I was worried what would become of it if the 
proposal were accepted. 
  [Takeshita] In the coming gray-haired society, it is too 
heavy a burden for the income tax to take care of welfare of the 
aged. I had explained, therefore, that the tax burden should be 
spread out thinly and evenly at the stage of consumption, and I 
also made clear that "it has a character of something like a 
special-purpose tax." So I feel I am a little responsible. 
  By saying that a discussion of a pseudo-special-purpose tax 
reflects a kind of opinion, I maneuvered the debate on the 
consumption tax to, or pulled it into the arena of the Diet. 
  [Akamatsu] Because you are a crafty politician. [laughter] 
It is the opposition party's way of thinking to make tax revenue 
the source of funds for specific purposes while responsible men 
in the government cannot say such things. Regrettably, the SDPJ 
has a long way to go to be a genuine ruling party. At any rate, 
the recent Hosokawa concept was very reckless. 
  [Takeshita] His government is young and the idea could be 
termed rough and ready. 
<H5>  Popularity Rates of Takeshita and Hosokawa </H5>
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Wednesday, 9 February marked exactly half a 
year since the Hosokawa regime was established. Despite being 
called glassware, it has successfully managed to deal with 
various important problems. Although premature, what are your 
evaluations of the half year of the Hosokawa regime? 
  [Akamatsu] Generally speaking, it has a 70 percent rating in 
popular support, although it went down to 50 percent when the 
idea of a national welfare tax was revealed. This reflects the 
underlying sense among the people that the government has made 
politics something close to them, rather than what it has 
achieved. It is worthy of high evaluation. It has dealt with 
various problems such as deregulation of controls, redeeming the 
margin gained by high yen rates, rice problems, political 
reform, and measures to give impetus to a stagnating economy. 
It may take some time before an evaluation is made on their 
effects. 
  It has been said time and again that the SDPJ is standing in 
the way, but a close watch will reveal that a kind of tug-of-war 
like that between the LDP and the Socialist Party during the 
order of 1955 is being waged among the ruling coalition because 
the SDPJ is in it. Thus, the course of policies is settled in 
an agreeable direction. 
  [Takeshita] The popularity rate is astonishingly high. But, 
it does not reflect the actual evaluation of achievements, and 
as Mr. Akamatsu pointed out, the rate incorporates expectation 
and encouragement. On the contrary, the LDP was in power for a 
long time and it was judged by its actual record. And that rate 
fell to a single-digit figure in my case when the consumption 
tax was finally enforced. Somebody encouraged me, "Come on Mr. 
Take. Stand firm until it drops to 3 percent." 
  [Akamatsu] That is the consumption tax rate. [laughter] 
  [Takeshita] Still, the sense of expectation is going on and 
time is too short for actual evaluation of achievements. In 
such a problem as rice, a negative legacy left over by the LDP 
was dealt with successfully. During my cabinet days, beef and 
oranges were liberalized and the rice problem could have been 
settled within the Uruguay Round if it had been treated in the 
same manner. 
  It was said that Japan gained the most in the GATT system. 
The biggest future problem lies in domestic measures. As to 
recoupling [measures to compensate income], Germany and France 
have a traditional consciousness that agriculture is an 
important tourist resource, plays a role of preserving the land, 
and provides a resting place for urban inhabitants and therefore 
those in rural districts are encouraged to preserve the pastoral 
scenery as it is. And this consciousness serves to support the 
recoupling measures. In Japan's case, a change of consciousness 
is also necessary. Compensation should not continue to take the 
form of farmers wearing headbands clamoring for rice price 
hikes, but urban dwellers should also support the farmers as 
preservers of the land and natural scenery. If the problem is 
dealt with smartly in such a manner, I think the Uruguay Round 
agreement will lead to a more advantageous direction for Japan 
and the whole world. 
<H5>  `A Muffler Does Not Become Me' </H5>
  [Takeshita] If you would allow me to use a rough expression, 
I think it is all right for political reform to go through many 
trials and errors; defects are corrected if there are any. 
[passage omitted] 
  Roughly speaking, there are only single member constituency 
systems and proportional representation systems as methods of 
conducting elections. However, elections are held in many 
countries in a way suitable to their national conditions and no 
absolute way exists to conduct them. In Japan's case, I do not 
mind changing the system, if Japan is not confident that the 
multiple-member constituency system is the best. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] By the way, how do you evaluate Mr. 
Hosokawa as a person? 
  [Akamatsu] When I asked my supporters "why" they "like Mr. 
Hosokawa," the largest number of them answered he has a 
refreshing air, followed by a "clean" image. And that 
impression leads to his very high popularity. In the case of 
contributions from the Sagawa trucking company, Mr. Hosokawa 
disposed of the money the same way as Mr. Ozawa did, dividing it 
into separate accounts of one million yen each. While Mr. Ozawa 
was exhaustively criticized for that matter, Mr. Hosokawa 
received mild criticism. I think he is a very lucky man. 
  Apart from his appearance, he has political skill for having 
managed to maintain the coalition of eight different groups for 
the past half a year, by making compromises where necessary. It 
is questionable, however, whether his way of handling matters 
will be successful in the future, now that such measures as 
political reform and the pump-priming measure of reducing taxes 
beforehand have passed. With an eye on the forthcoming 
elections, every political party is trying to display 
outstanding characteristics in its political stance. In 
particular, Mr. Ozawa is decisively on bad terms with Mr. 
Takemura and I am afraid that the combination of Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] is actually 
impossible in the next elections. 
  It depends entirely on Mr. Hosokawa's leadership whether the 
two big questions of cooperation in the elections and the 
formation of a new political party are successfully solved. In 
retrospect of the process that led to the formation of the 
current coalition, none other than Mr. Hosokawa is able to do 
it. And the maintenance of the coalition depends on whether he 
succeeds in settling the matter. 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Takeshita, you have known Mr. Hosokawa 
from his youth, did you ever think of his becoming prime 
minister one day? 
  [Takeshita] Well, he has given me an impression of a 
so-called new leader. He is gentle characteristically, and I 
have associated with him for a long time, including our personal 
relationship. When he was governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, he 
seemed to have a comparatively high evaluation of his 
achievements backed by overwhelming support from prefectural 
inhabitants. 
  I experienced going to international meetings with him. When 
we were attending a meeting in Davos, Switzerland, a skiing 
resort, he went skiing after meetings. I did not ski because I 
was afraid of breaking a bone. He is for sure a skiing star. 
  [Akamatsu] As a matter of fact, he represented his 
prefecture as a skier at a national athletic meet. 
  [Takeshita] He has something we old ones do not. He is 
taller than we and a neck scarf fits him perfectly. If I wear a 
scarf, people might think that I caught cold. [laughter] 
  From my old-fashioned sensibility, you will really feel the 
heavy responsibility once you take charge of the government. I 
was prime minister for one year and seven months and served 
under Prime Minister Eisaku Sato for seven years and eight 
months. During that time I had felt like I was climbing up 
stairs step by step with a heavy load on my back, with eventual 
relief upon completing the reversion of Okinawa in the end. 
  Mr. Hosokawa was reported to have done quite a bit of 
redecorating of the official residence of the prime minister, 
but he must be feeling that grueling load of the knapsack of his 
administration biting into his shoulder. 
<H5>  Artificial Image of Mr. Ozawa </H5>
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Ozawa seems to have quite an influence 
over the Hosokawa coalition government. In the case of Mr. 
Takeshita, you are one of the foster parents by having had him 
as deputy chief cabinet secretary and raising him to important 
positions from the time of the Sosei-kai. Meanwhile, Mr. 
Akamatsu has experienced big debates with him at 
representatives' meeting of the ruling coalition parties and 
worked together to form the Hosokawa regime. Now, please tell 
us your opinions of Ozawa. 
  [Takeshita] It is a difficult subject for me to speak on. 
He served as minister of home affairs and chairman of the 
National Public Safety Commission, both posts of an attestation 
official, but later when I formed a cabinet I asked him to 
become deputy chief cabinet secretary, one rank below the 
attestation official. I certainly acknowledge his ability, 
because he managed to settle the problems of U.S. participation 
in Japanese construction projects and Motorola car phones once 
he had been given full authority. He settled the construction 
issues and solved problems before economic friction flared up. 
The Motorola issue is pending, but he is a tough negotiator, I 
am sure. I do not think he is well versed in English, but I 
highly appreciate his ability for settling problems, not quite 
in a smart manner but by holding fast and getting to the point. 
  Characteristically he is well described as "hito-mishiri" 
-- shy with strangers. In other words, he is shy. These days I 
have had no contact by phone neither have I had a serious talk 
with him, but I am compelled to think that it is an artificial 
image to make Mr. Ozawa responsible for everything that is done 
forcibly. He was born in 1942 and is six years senior Mr. 
Akamatsu, but certainly he is a politician of the future. He is 
not a man of the past like us, and his artificial image should 
be cast off and he must work in that direction. 
  [Akamatsu] I agree that his image, good or bad, has 
certainly been inflated too much and has become artificial. 
  From the initiation of the coalition government to working 
out the political reform bill, he has not dashed through 
everything. I think he is a kind of politician who knows very 
well when to withdraw and where to make a compromise, because he 
has gained political experience under the guidance of Mr. 
Takeshita. Aside from being good or bad, Shinseito and the SDPJ 
in the coalition are far apart in their policies and eventually 
they have to decide on matters by compromise. The same thing 
can be applied to SDPJ Chairman Kubota, and in that sense Mr. 
Ozawa is a more subtle man of compromise than the public thinks. 
  By the same token, Mr. Ichiro Ozawa is nothing more nor less 
than Mr. Ichiro Ozawa himself. So, I think he deserves a better 
appraisal of his real image. I do not know who is responsible 
for the artificial image. If he is judged by a wrong image, the 
political situation may well be misjudged. 
  [Takeshita] In view of the present relationship between the 
ruling and opposition parties, the problem of reducing taxes 
before taking measures to make up for them cannot be settled 
without "confidence" and "a relationship of mutual trust." By 
confidence, I mean the determination that this policy must be 
carried out or the support of a majority. The relationship of 
mutual trust means such a relationship that both ruling and 
opposition parties mutually understand what the intentions of 
the other side are, something like that kind of cooperation is 
needed to prevent bills from being passed at the last moment 
with a natural understanding that the SDPJ takes an opposing 
action. When such a confidence and relationship of mutual trust 
exist, most issues are settled well by the method of 
consultation between the ruling and opposition parties. 
  The other day, somebody complained that "at present both 
confidence and a relationship of trust do not exist" and I 
admonished him "not to say such things." 
  [Akamatsu] At present, such a relationship of trust does 
exist within the ruling parties as firm as it can be, but not 
between the ruling and opposition parties. When the political 
reform bill was finally worked out, I told Mr. Ichikawa, "You 
have not sided with the SDPJ even once while drafting the bill, 
despite your repeated reference to "sha-ko-min" [collaboration 
among the SDPJ, Komeito and DSP (Democratic Socialist Party)]. 
He replied, "I intentionally took such an attitude only to work 
out the bill. So do not hold a grudge against me." By the same 
token, I tell him what I have in mind without hesitation and he 
talks back instantly upon hearing a view he cannot agree with. 
I think it is better to associate with each other in such a way 
without caring too much for coming into harmony with the other 
party. 
<H5>  Two Big Parties Or Tripartite Structure? </H5>
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] At long last, political reorganization has 
become a matter of reality. Mr. Masayoshi Takemura mentioned 
three points as fundamentals of forming a new political party in 
relation to the political reorganization: its basic policy plus 
its views on the times and methods it will employ and its 
constitution. What will be the axis which future political 
reorganization will concentrate on? Please expound on your 
opinion of this. 
  [Akamatsu] In my opinion, the next election at the least 
should be dealt with in the coalition framework. It is better, 
however, to think separately about the matter of forming a new 
political party and how to deal with the election. In this 
connection, the basic policies should be identical, even if they 
are rough and general. 
  Then, what are the guidelines for deciding on the new 
framework after all? Messrs. Takemura and Ozawa have already 
made their guidelines clear, but they are ambiguous about what 
to do with the international contribution and the problem 
related to amendments to the Constitution. They have to make it 
clear where they are going to take the nation, to be an ordinary 
country or a brightly shining nation. They have yet to 
distinguish themselves not with ideology, but with ideals of 
justice or freedom. Even the LDP is divided through various 
opinions, and our side has not yet clearly defined our 
framework. But one thing is clear, our side is destined to 
split among itself. 
  In my personal opinion, the coalition cannot win in the 
forthcoming election unless the seven coalition parties are 
firmly united against the powerful LDP. And when the coalition 
wins a landslide it will become something like the Imperial Rule 
Assistance Association [before World War II]. Then, the 
coalition will have to split into two in accordance with 
aforementioned ideals or fundamental policies, and I think it 
would work better for Japan's politics to have three parties, 
including the LDP. 
  But the leftist group of the present SDPJ will not run on 
the ticket of the coalition because other political parties 
would not support it. I have told Mr. Sukio Iwatare: "You and 
members of your group think that the new election system is 
designed to destroy minority parties, but that is a 
misunderstanding." "In a proportional-representation 
constituency, one can be elected by winning 250,000 votes. 
Although winning more than 250,000 votes has become necessary 
because votes are counted by blocks, in principle you will be 
elected by mustering 250,000 votes. Therefore, you had better 
organize a political party, something like a "goken-shinto" [New 
Party for Safeguarding the Constitution] in accordance with your 
political ideals and beliefs." 
  The SDPJ should not remain an entity by forcing people to 
change their beliefs but rather should negotiate a divorce by 
consent to make full use of its members beliefs and political 
principles by forming a new political party. That will become a 
matter of course as such matters as the demarcation of 
constituencies, the selection of candidates, and actions by the 
reformist group in the LDP make progress. 
  The point is that we will side with the line of "from Mr. 
Gotoda to Mr. Yokomichi," as Mr. Takemura said, by letting 
obstinate people within the SDPJ go. Official policy study 
meetings with the Japan New Party have been held many times 
already, and I think that our policies are the closest. If I 
may borrow the expression by Mr. Yamagishi of Rengo [Japanese 
Trade Union Federation], my basic idea is that we should support 
the B group of the conservatives and bring it together with the 
liberals of the SDPJ and the DSP. 
  [Takeshita] I said that a political realignment is 
inevitable, and I think that "freedom" and "equality" are the 
two nuclei of ideals when a political reorganization is under 
way. Therefore, something like two big political parties are 
good for Japan eventually in that the spirit of justice and 
equality and the principle of competition which respects freedom 
coexist. 
  With respect to the Constitution, there once was such a 
difference in positions, which can be simplified in terms of 
safeguarding the Constitution and proposing amendments to the 
Constitution. My way of interpreting the Constitution is that 
the obligation of observing the Constitution includes Article 96 
of Chapter IX, which provides for constitutional amendments. 
And those who advocate safeguarding the Constitution are 
interpreted as observing the spirit of the preamble of the 
Constitution-- internationalism, pacifism, and fundamental human 
rights or to protect the sovereignty residing with the people 
and democracy. And those in the LDP who advocate constitutional 
amendments are also believed to be observing what is said in the 
preamble. 
  Such a simplified classification of either safeguarding the 
Constitution or advocating constitutional amendments is no 
longer so clear-cut, and today versatile views are held on the 
Constitution, and debates are maturing. I think that the trend 
is in transition in the direction of having two big political 
parties. With respect to the political realignment, we have the 
wrong question because we are in the past perfect tense. 
  [Akamatsu] No, not in the past perfect tense. (laughter) 
  [Takeshita] I did not mean to be discourteous. From now on, 
politics is in the hands of the new generation such as Mr. 
Akamatsu. I think that men like myself deserve to exist to 
fulfill the duty of storytellers at the most. The "Kojiki" 
[Record of Ancient Matters] was compiled in accordance with what 
Hieda-no-Are told from memory, so storytellers should exist. I 
will discipline myself to be a storyteller, not to lead in 
politics. It is said, "Wise men learn from history while fools 
learn from experience." I have a little experience (laughter), 
and also a little knowledge about history. 
<H5>  Where Is the LDP Heading? </H5>
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Takeshita, where do you place the LDP in 
what you said about the inevitable future political realignment? 
  [Takeshita] It will rid itself of the obstinacy and bigotry 
of reactionary conservatives. It may not be an appropriate 
expression, but I think the LDP will survive self-reformation, 
just as the SDPJ has "democrats" within the party. The LDP is 
expected to undergo various movements while the demarcation of 
single-seat election constituencies is carried out. Through 
such movements, the LDP will continue to play the role of 
carrying on the accumulated knowledge of having maintained 
government for a long time after the war in a series of trials 
and errors, despite mistakes. Conservatives are to maintain and 
safeguard the so-called universal values, and the LDP should 
continue to exist as a political party that can immediately 
respond to the needs of the times. 
  [Akamatsu] Because Mr. Takeshita may feel awkward in saying 
things about the LDP, let me say what I think from my 
standpoint. Basically, the conservatives will continue to 
survive among the Japanese people in the future. I do not think 
that they will unite in one organization. As Mr. Ozawa and his 
supporters have said, there will certainly be "new 
conservatives" and conservatives opposing them. 
  Whatever shapes they take, it is most probable that they 
will 
be divided into "old conservatives" and "new conservatives." It 
may be impossible for us "Democrats" to be incorporated into 
their camps. Then it will be realistic to anticipate a 
combination of two conservative groups and one liberal group. I 
think it is most probable that such a system will come into 
being, irrespective of the shapes of their combinations. 
  Although I am not critical, Mr. Ozawa's idea of having two 
conservative parties is based on a simple premise that his party 
is overwhelmingly powerful and therefore "it is all right to 
have one more party." 
  Mr. Ozawa's basic strategy seems to be that his party 
should have overwhelming power; otherwise, Japan cannot fulfill 
its role in the world to the fullest extent; or the rate of the 
consumption tax cannot be raised to 10 percent; or it cannot 
fulfill with responsibility what it has proposed in spite of 
people's repugnance. And that is how Mr. Ozawa is decisively 
different from us. 
  [Takeshita] Unlike the new political parties, the LDP should 
explore the way to make the best use of its wisdom of policies 
and accumulated knowledge by working hard together within the 
party. 
  For example, Japan's explanation of its planned tax cuts was 
insufficient in the recent Japanese-U.S. economic framework 
talks for a new economic partnership. The United States was 
critical of the Japanese plan because it perceived mistakenly 
that the tax cut was intended for only one year, which was not 
the case. It was not explained that the consultative meeting on 
the tax system planned a further examination of more tax cuts in 
its later full-scale discussions. In this respect, I doubt 
whether Mr. Clinton, who is two years Mr. Akamatsu's senior, 
possessed that much information. 
  The report of the aforementioned consultative meeting on the 
tax system merely indicated what the tax system should be but 
was not intended to recommend pump-priming measures. Therefore, 
I would rather think that a tax cut should have been carried out 
first as a pump-priming measure. Its pump-priming effects will 
be mitigated when the tax cut is implemented from this January, 
and the rate of the consumption tax is to be raised in April 
1995, as everybody knows. This is where the LDP should be 
consulted to provide its wisdom. 
  [Akamatsu] It is not good to be reckless. 
  [Takeshita] So, with confidence and trust, the matter should 
have been referred to a consultative body composed of both 
ruling and opposition parties, and it should have agreed to cut 
the tax by 20 percent this year with ceiling of the cut for an 
individual set at 2 million yen. Then the real tax cut could 
have taken place during the current Diet session. Criticism 
could have been avoided if such an explanation were made to the 
United States. 
  [Akamatsu] The tax cut cannot actually be felt if a direct 
refund is not made to the people. 
<H5>  Wisdom Is Required To Deal With Numerical Targets </H5>
  [Takeshita] As an old saying goes, "The mind rules the 
body," 
and illness and business conditions are at the mercy of the 
thinking of the people. Japanese consumers' thinking currently 
is to postpone buying new cars although the time has come to 
replace old ones. Therefore, they have to be shown concrete 
figures of how much of a tax cut they can expect. Then they 
will spend money. 
  In setting numerical targets, I think that both sides had 
room for compromise. For instance, at the Japanese-U.S. 
structural impediments initiative talks, I succeeded in working 
out a 430-trillion-yen public investment program for the ensuing 
10 years with the talks with U.S. Secretary of State Baker 
serving as its basis. The amount of 415 trillion yen was 
compiled by multiplying by 1.5 the past 10 years of investment 
in public projects, and a reserve fund of 15 trillion yen was 
added to it. 
  Therefore, the issue of setting numerical targets in the 
recent framework talks could have been discussed by presenting 
whatever our side could have decided on and having the two sides 
discuss this, thus being devoid of policies leading to managed 
trade. 
  [Akamatsu] That is a good idea. 
  [Takeshita] The remaining problem of government procurement 
can be dealt with independently to a certain degree, such as 
introducing U.S. medical equipment to hospitals at national 
universities, and talks will progress about the problems of 
Motorola and those of a financial nature [insurance]. 
  [Akamatsu] Actually, Japanese insurance policies and the 
like 
are superior quality-wise, and the United States is urging 
stronger controls to prevent Japanese insurance companies from 
entering the U.S. market. Contrary to what it urges on 
deregulation, the United States is moving in the other direction. 
  [Takeshita] Yes, it is. Because U.S. insurance companies 
cannot form such organizations as "Nissei's sales ladies." 
(laughter) 
  [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Looking at the coalition, we find that a 
political realignment will not proceed if the coalition is to be 
maintained, while the political foundation will become unstable 
because the coalition will split when a political realignment is 
pursued. Despite such a contradiction, do you still intend to 
maintain such a front until the next election? 
  [Akamatsu] If the coalition cannot be maintained, the 
election will follow. Because of demarcation [of 
constituencies] problems, the new system will require about six 
months to allow voters to familiarize themselves with it, thus 
restricting the prime minister's ability to dissolve the Diet. 
  [Takeshita] That is right. From now on is the crucial 
period. And I keenly feel that the new era has come. Today I 
personally experienced the difference between the new and old 
alumni. 
  [Akamatsu] The evaluation of Mr. Takeshita will have to be 
entrusted to a future generation, as you said you wished would 
be the case. (laughter) I would like you, as a senior figure 
in politics, to guide and teach me, especially in how to grasp 
the thinking of people. The coalition is very poor in handling 
and maneuvering the elite group of several thousand bureaucrats, 
and I hope that you will give us guidance in the future for the 
benefit of Japanese politics and the administration. 
  [Takeshita] I am much obliged to you.

  [Text] Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, commenting on the failure of the suppression of the 
Khmer Rouge, said his patience in dealing with Thailand was 
wearing thin. He noted that the report carried by the Thai 
newspapers on the recapture of Pailin town by the Khmer Rouge 
was untrue, adding that such a report was an indication of 
Thailand's backing for the Khmer Rouge guerrillas. 
  Earlier Prince Ranariddh said, in a rather aggressive tone, 
that the three tanks used by the Khmer Rouge during an ambush 
against the Phnom Penh troops came from Thai soil and claimed 
that two of them were destroyed by the Phnom Penh government 
troops. 
  As of the time of this report, there has not been any 
reaction from the Thai Government leaders because the Thais are 
celebrating their traditional new year, Songkran, from 12-14 
April. However, Thai officials including the foreign minister 
clearly announced that Thailand had noting to do with nor did it 
provide any support for the Khmer Rouge. They asserted that 
Thailand wants to see genuine peace restored in Cambodia because 
peace in Cambodia will also mean safety for the Thai people 
along the border with that country. Stray artillery shells from 
the fighting in Cambodia frequently landed on Thai soil, forcing 
border villagers to run to safe places. 
  Prince Ranariddh has reportedly been implementing an 
aggressive foreign policy toward Thailand. Recently, he accused 
Thailand of helping Pol Pot flee Pailin into Thailand as the 
Phnom Penh troops were launching offensives against the town. 
Several foreign news agencies reported his accusation against 
Thailand worldwide. After the Thai Government openly voiced its 
discontent over Prince Norodom Ranariddh's groundless 
accusation, the prince simply denied his own statement on Pol 
Pot seeking refuge in Thailand, saying what he meant was that 
the Khmer Rouge or Pol Potists were the ones who fled to 
Thailand. 
  An analyst who has long observed the Cambodian situation 
noted that Prince Norodom Ranariddh has been making attempts to 
reduce Thailand's influence over his country, especially in the 
economic field. The Thai baht currency is widely accepted and 
influential in Cambodia. The Cambodians prefer baht to 
Cambodia's reil currency because the latter's value is nothing 
more than plain paper. Moreover, the listing of the baht 
currency as one of the world's 20 strongest currencies by 
international monetary institutions has further fanning up the 
anti-Thai sentiments in Cambodia. 
  The analyst also warned that Cambodia will try to project 
more accusations against Thailand onto the international arena 
in a bid to use the hands of the world community to push 
Thailand out of its economic circles. He noted that some 
countries might be waiting for an opportunity to replace 
Thailand in Cambodia's economy.

  [Text] Washington, April 14 KYODO -- Defense Secretary 
William Perry on Thursday [14 April] abruptly postponed a visit 
to South Korea and Japan planned for next week following the 
accidental downing of two U.S. helicopters by American jets over 
northern Iraq. 
  A Pentagon spokesman, Maj. Steve Little, said he does not 
know when Perry will be able to make the trip. 
  "We don't know yet how long it will be delayed. The 
scheduling is definitely a problem," little told KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE by phone. 
  The Pentagon issued a statement about the cancellation of 
Perry's trip hours after a senior Defense Department official 
briefed reporters on the upcoming visit, which would have been 
Perry's first to the region since becoming defense chief in 
early February. 
  "The decision (to postpone the trip) was made to allow 
Secretary Perry time to ensure that the families of those who 
were killed are fully supported, to guarantee a thorough 
investigation, and also to review the existing procedures," the 
Pentagon said. 
  Perry was originally scheduled to arrive in Seoul on Sunday 
and travel on to Tokyo on Tuesday before returning home on 
Thursday.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- Departing Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale 
agreed Friday [15 April] to continue cooperating with each other 
in further enhancing ties between Japan and the United States. 
  The two reached the accord at a dinner party hosted by 
Mondale and his wife, Joan, at the U.S. envoy's official 
residence in central Tokyo, Hosokawa told reporters. Hosokawa's 
wife, Kayoko, also attended. 
  Mondale reportedly voiced regret over Hosokawa's decision to 
resign due to the Diet paralysis on the fiscal 1994 budget, 
which was spawned by allegations of his financial improprieties. 
  Mondale also called on Hosokawa to continue working with him 
after his resignation to further promote bilateral relations, 
the premier said. 
  Hosokawa, 56, who suddenly offered to step down last week, 
will remain on board until his successor is chosen. 
  Friday night's dinner party followed an earlier invitation 
from Hosokawa asking the Mondales to his official residence.

  [Text] Seoul, April 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has again 
threatened to pull out of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) should Washington continue pressuring Pyongyang over its 
nuclear development program. 
  North Korean Ambassador to Moscow Son Song-pil made the 
threat at a recent press meeting, saying the International 
Atomic Energy Agency's report on its "unsatisfactory" inspection 
of North Korea's facilities and the failed Pyongyang-Washington 
talks have heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, NAEWOE 
PRESS, Seoul's official North Korea watcher, reported Thursday 
in quoting Radio Moscow. 
  Washington has pressed for strong action and Pyongyang 
should 
now adopt countermeasures, Son was quoted as saying. North 
Korea "could carry out its decision to withdraw from the NPT 
last year." 
  Son reiterated that the nuclear dispute can be settled only 
through North Korean-U.S. dialogue, saying the American threat 
to use force poses a grave obstacle, NAEWOE reported.

<F P=106> [Interview with Senior Lieutenant General Tran Van Quang in </F>
Paris on 29 October 1993 by N.S.] 
  [Excerpt] At the end of October 1993, Senior Lt. Gen. Tran 
Van Quang headed a delegation of the Vietnam Veterans 
Association that had come to Paris to attend the congress of the 
French ARAC Veterans Association. On the afternoon of 29 
October, Senior Lt. Gen. Tran Van Quang visited the Association 
of Vietnamese in France and met with more than 50 Vietnamese 
veterans of the Second World War at the association's 
headquarters at 16 Petit Musc, Quarter 4, Paris. On this 
occasion, Senior Lt. Gen. graciously granted an interview to 
DOAN KET. [passage omitted] 
  [DOAN KET] In the past period, every time the head of the 
American administration has reviewed the embargo against 
Vietnam, "secret files" on "American MIAs" have always came to 
light. Some people have even said that you were the author of 
one of those "files." 
  [Quang] As you know, in recent years, each time the American 
government has raised the issue of ending the embargo against 
Vietnam, damaging stories about American MIAs have appeared. The 
so-called "secret files" are part of this. In 1992, people 
published a photograph and claimed that the picture showed an 
American still alive in Vietnam. They also claimed that the 
Vietnamese government had sent a number of prisoners of war to 
the former Soviet Union. In fact, American officials have 
admitted that those stories are all fabrications. As for the 
"secret file" supposedly written by me, after meeting with me 
and investigating the matter thoroughly, General Vessey, the 
special envoy of the American president, and Senator J. Kerry 
admitted that "the materials are not believable." The reason is 
that the data are inaccurate. The number of prisoners of war 
mentioned in the materials are even greater than the number 
disclosed by the American government. What is interesting is 
that people have said that I reported those data to the 
Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party in September 1972. 
But at that time, I was in command on the Tri Thien-Hue front. 
  What is the reason for these fabrications? It's because a 
number of Americans remain stubborn and want to poison 
Vietnamese-American relations. But as people know, continuing 
the embargo against Vietnam is immoral and contrary to the trend 
toward cooperation and friendship between nations, and this is 
making it difficult for us to rebuild our country. And in 
addition, this is harming American businessmen. I think that 
with an independent foreign line that desires to be friends with 
all countries that are striving for peace and stability and the 
development of our country and with the struggle of the 
wholesome forces in the world, including those in the United 
States, the effectiveness of the American embargo will gradually 
decline. 
  [DOAN KET] Vietnamese in France in general and readers of 
DOAN KET in particular would like to know more about the Vietnam 
Veterans Association, of which you are the president. In 
particular, people would like to know more about the spirit and 
contents of the association's activities. 
  [Quang] The Vietnam Veterans Association is a mass 
organization whose task is to foster solidarity among all 
discharged cadres and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army and 
guerrillas who fought in the wars to liberate and defend the 
fatherland. We want to help each other to maintain a spirit of 
patriotism and the tradition of "Uncle Ho troops," help each 
other became a part of ordinary life, and look after the 
material and spiritual lives of each other. Other tasks of the 
association are to contribute to maintaining political security 
and defending the fatherland, disseminate experiences to the 
young generation, participate in the socioeconomic programs, and 
contribute to foreign affairs activities, particularly with 
veterans in other countries. With a tradition of patriotism and 
love for socialism, the Vietnam Veterans Association is doing 
its utmost to hit the above targets, and initial results have 
been achieved. Thus, the party and state and the people have 
confidence in the association, and they have given us 
encouragement and help. 
  [DOAN KET] What are your views on those Vietnamese who 
fought 
in the Saigon army and who are now living abroad? 
  [Quang] As for Vietnamese who found in the Saigon army, we 
feel that except for a small number who are still reactionaries, 
the great majority of these people, both officers and enlisted 
men, are patriotic people. Today, our country is independent, 
democratic, free, and united. National construction and national 
valor are stimulating all people to abandon the old hatreds and 
look to the future. We believe that those people will gradually 
awaken. With the great solidarity policy of the state, many of 
those who once worked for the Saigon regime are now making an 
effort to become integrated into the life of the people. They 
are seeking profits and and happiness in the movement to restore 
the country, and they are proud of the very important 
achievements scored by the fatherland. As for our veterans, we 
hope that those people will forget the past, look to the future, 
and quickly become integrated in the free and independent life 
of the country. Our forefathers said that "one drop of blood is 
more precious than a pond of water." The peoples of the world 
and many governments in the world are encouraging and supporting 
our renovation movement and so how can those people, who are 
Vietnamese, stand outside this tide? 
  On this occasion, on behalf of all Vietnamese veterans, 
through DOAN KET I would like to wish all Vietnamese now living 
in France happiness and good health. We hope that they will 
return to their beloved fatherland and contribute to building 
the country so that it can catch up with the other civilized 
countries in the world and have a brilliant future.

<F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Van Thu] </F>
  [Text] Industrial explosives have been in use in Vietnam 
for about a century now. After the north was liberated, we 
continued to use explosives to mine coal and metal ore, quarry 
rock, and build roads and bridges and hydroelectric projects. 
Each year, we consume about 10-20,000 tons of industrial 
explosives. In the past, these were imported mainly from the 
(former) Soviet Union and China. 
  During the past 5 years, in accord with the policy of 
coordinating national defense with the economy, military 
organizations have stepped up research and produced 
approximately 4-5,000 tons of industrial explosives a year, 
satisfying some of our needs for such materials. Making full use 
of the surplus capabilities in national defense production, in 
the coming years, the volume of production may reach 10,000 tons 
a year. Many groups of scientific and technical cadres from the 
Technical General Department, the National Defense Industry and 
Economics General Department, the Military Technical Institute, 
and the Explosives Technical Center at the Military Technical 
Institute who have gone abroad to do research and familiarize 
themselves with the manufacturing of military explosives have 
had a chance to view the production of industrial explosives. 
  In many countries, the production of industrial explosives 
is 
coordinated closely with the production of military explosives, 
with those production installations directly subordinate to the 
military or to industrial ministries. The production of 
explosives (both military and non-military) involves special 
techniques, many years of experience, and, in particular, ranks 
of skilled technical cadres and workers and means of preventing 
explosions. 
  During the past 5 years, on behalf of the state, the State 
Science and Technology Commission (now the Ministry of Science, 
Technology, and Environment) has guided research in 
manufacturing industrial explosives. This has included many 
state-level topics, an example of which is the KC-03 program. 
The results of the research are very encouraging, and they have 
soon been used in production. Almost all of the state-level 
topics have been allotted to installations in the military, and 
the topics have been inspected by more than 10 state-level 
scientific and technical councils with the participation of the 
Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment, the Labor 
Safety Inspection Committee (Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, 
and Social Affairs), the Fire Protection Department (Ministry of 
Interior), explosives experts from the Science and Technology 
Department and the Coalimex Corporation (Ministry of Energy), 
the Mining and Geology College, the Military Technical 
Institute, the Military Explosives Center [MEC], and the 
National Defense Industry and Economics General Department. The 
topics and products inspected include black explosives and 
slow-burning fuses (Z121), Ammonite AD1 (Z113, Z121), fire 
conducting line (Z121), lighted and electrical fuse boxes 
(Z121), TX1 and TZ1A explosives (Z131), TMN 15 explosives 
(Z115), VEOT explosives (MEC), Zerno 21/79 (Z121), TNT (Z131, 
Z113, Z115), Watergel TNP1 (MEC), and Watergel TFD 15 (Z115). It 
is predicted that Watergel TNP2 and gelatin explosives (MEC) 
will be examined this year. 
  Since 1991, the Ministry of Science, Technology, and 
Environment has given the task of building and improving 
industrial explosives laboratories to the Military Explosives 
Center and allotted funds to it for this. Today, explosives that 
are produced domestically or imported from abroad are all 
inspected at this center, with the exception of safety tests for 
methane gas and coal dust, which are conducted in the explosion 
chamber at the Mine Chemicals Enterprise (Coalimex). 
  Military installations have been given permission to 
manufacture many types of fireworks, sky-rockets, mortars, small 
firecrackers, ocean rescue flares, sports ammunition, and 
bullets for hunting rifles to serve the needs of the people and 
major festivals. 
  As for the national defense industry, the Z131 and Z113 
plants plan to import the technology needed to manufacture 
advanced industrial explosives. This will be imported from 
several countries. 
  Gelatin explosives first began to be manufactured during the 
late 1970s in France, Sweden, England, and the United States and 
have been in common use in the world for the past decade. Sweden 
calls this Emulite, and China calls this gelatin explosives. 
Countries refer to this as oil gelatin, because it is composed 
of two basic compounds: a very thin continuous oil compound 
around a non-continuous compound consisting of very small drops 
of an oxygenated saline solution one-tenth of a micron in size 
having a strong bee-hive structure because of mixing the gelatin 
agents. Besides this, people have said that as compared with 
such highly explosive materials as gas bubbles, plastics, and 
small crystals one-tenth micron in size, gelatin explosives have 
many advantages. For example, they are very safe, they withstand 
water well, they are very effective in breaking up rock, they 
are easy to charge in the mines, they give off little poisonous 
gas, and so on. Using watergel and gelatin explosives is the 
path that we must follow in order to gradually replace the older 
types of explosives such as ammonite, TNT, zerno, and dynamite. 
Once we are able to produce these domestically, the cost of 
gelatin explosives will drop greatly (approximately $500 per 
ton). Today, imports cost about $700-1,100 per ton, depending on 
the type and the country selling the explosives. 
  For several decades now, the state has had a policy of 
closely controlling explosives. In 1968, it promulgated Standard 
83 KHKT-LDTBXH-NV, which made the science and technology sector 
-- formerly the State Science and Technology Commission -- and 
the labor and internal affairs sectors responsible for 
controlling all aspects based on the functions assigned. Today, 
the general stipulation in our country is that the production, 
storage, and circulation of industrial explosives, both within 
and outside the military, are to be monitored by the Ministry of 
Science, Technology, and Environment, the State Labor Safety 
Inspection Committee, and the Fire Protection Department, and 
things must be done in accord with Explosive Materials Standard 
TCVN 4586-88 and Decision 237 QD promulgated by the State 
Science and Technology Commission (now the Ministry of Science, 
Technology, and Environment) on 10 June 1988. 
  In 1994, construction activities need more and more 
industrial explosives to mine coal, quarry rock, manufacture 
cement, build railroads and expressways, build hydroelectric 
projects, and satisfy other needs of daily life. In the face of 
this situation, we feel that the state should soon conduct 
studies and establish mechanisms and procedures concerning 
controlling the production of industrial explosives and, in 
particular, concerning the supply and distribution of industrial 
explosives. Steps must be taken to avoid irrational obstacles 
and having to go through so many unnecessary intermediary steps 
as at present. Some people think that controlling supply and 
distribution should be unified in one ministry (the Ministry of 
National Defense or the Ministry of Energy). Others think that 
the Ministry of Energy should supply and distribute explosives 
within the sphere of the coal sector and that the Ministry of 
National Defense should supply and distribute explosives in the 
other sectors. These plans are too bureaucratic and rigid. When 
engaged in buying industrial explosives from foreign 
corporations including ICI, SNPE, The Bac Phuong TQ Corporation, 
and the NFC TQ Corporation. We observed that they directly 
distribute and export the products that they produce without 
having to go through any intermediary corporation. 
  Based on the specific situation concerning studying, 
manufacturing, distributing, and controlling industrial 
explosives in many countries and in Vietnam today, we propose 
that if the state authorizes a sector to produce or import a 
product, it should also allow that sector to directly supply and 
distribute that product. This will reduce unnecessary 
intermediaries, and reduce the cost of producing coal, cement, 
ore, and rock and encourage research and the production of many 
types of essential industrial explosives while still maintaining 
safety and security. This is because each sector that produces, 
supplies, and distributes industrial explosives will be 
monitored by state organizations. We believe that in the coming 
period, with respect to industrial explosives, new advances will 
be made in research, production, and use to support the building 
of our country.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- A national meeting 
took place at the 6,000-seat theatre of the February 8 House of 
Culture here today to celebrate the birthday of the great leader 
President Kim Il-song. 
  A portrait of the great leader President Kim Il-song was 
placed on the platform of the meeting hall. 
  The meeting was attended by O Chin-u, member of the 
Presidium 
of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee [C.C.] of the 
Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] and minister of People's Armed 
Forces, Premier Kang Song-san and Vice Presidents Yi Chong-ok, 
Pak Song-chol and Kim Yong-chu who are Politburo members of the 
C.C., WPK, Vice-President Kim Pyong-sik who is chairman of the 
Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, and 
other senior party and state officials. 
  Yi In-mo, a former war correspondent of the Korean People's 
Army known as the incarnation of faith and will, was present at 
the meeting. 
  Also attending the meeting were the members of the 
congratulatory group of Koreans from Japan led by Yi Chin-kyu, 
first vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the 
General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), 
which is visiting the homeland to participate in the April 15 
celebrations, and other congratulatory groups, delegations and 
visiting groups of Koreans overseas from different regions of 
the world, Choe Hong-hui, president of the International 
Taekwon-do Federation, and other Koreans overseas. 
  Premier Kang Song-san made a report at the meeting. 
  He said the Korean people in the North and the South and 
abroad and the world's revolutionary people are significantly 
celebrating the birthday of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
as a great auspicious fete of the nation and as a common 
revolutionary holiday of mankind. 
  The whole course of the revolutionary activities of Comrade 
Kim Il-song is shining brilliantly as decades of tremendous 
struggle and creation in which he has devoted his all to the 
national liberation and prosperity and to the people's freedom 
and happiness, the reporter said, and went on: 
  Comrade Kim Il-song is an unexcelled great man and an elder 
in the world revolution who has brought about a fundamental 
change in the destiny of our nation and made immortal 
contributions to the human cause of independence, the cause of 
socialism, covering the whole course of his life with the 20th 
century which witnessed a new epoch in the history of the 
struggle for human liberation and great changes on the world 
political map. Human history records many high-reputed leaders 
of the working class, but it knows no such a leader as respected 
Comrade Kim Il-song who has adorned the most profound, diverse 
and long annals of heroic epic with the greatness of his 
leadership and the rich content of his exploits in triumphantly 
paving the path of the revolution through raging storms and with 
his influence on the times and the development of history. 
  Comrade Kim Il-song is the great leader of the working class 
and other working masses with extraordinary ideological and 
theoretical wisdom, leadership ability and virtues. 
  He is a great master of thought and theory who founded the 
chuche idea reflecting the demand of our era, the era of 
independence, indicated the path of the Korean revolution and 
provided the working class and other working masses with an 
invincible weapon for freedom, liberation and socialism. 
  Basing himself on the chuche idea, he propounded theories, 
strategy and tactics for all stages and fields of the revolution 
to realise the independence of the popular masses and 
systematized the leadership method to guide the people's cause 
of independence to victory, thus developing the revolutionary 
thought of the working class to a new, higher stage. 
  He is a great statesman and a genius of creation and 
construction. With an unexcelled clairvoyance, scientific 
penetration, iron will and rare leadership ability, he trained 
the Korean people into a revolutionary people with a strong 
sense of independence through the application of the chuche idea 
and victoriously led the difficult and arduous Korean revolution 
in reliance on the inexhaustible strength of the people and 
built a powerful country of chuche, an impregnable fortress of 
socialism, in the East of the world. 
  He wisely guided the work to strengthen the driving force of 
our revolution and enhance its role, pushing through manifold 
trials and crossing the deathline and thus liberated the lost 
country, founded the Workers' Party of Korea, a new type party, 
and consolidated it into a steel- like party. 
  He made much effort to firmly equip our people with a 
revolutionary idea of independence and train them into an 
invincible combat unit harmoniously united with the party by 
giving definite precedence to the ideological revolution and 
consolidated the driving force of our revolution into an 
unbreakable socio-political organism. 
  His clairvoyance finds expression in that he perfectly 
prepared the inheritance of the revolutionary cause as required 
by our revolution and people's desire from long ago with an 
insight into its historical necessity and gave guidance in 
firmly establishing the organisational and ideological basis and 
leadership system of the party to carry forward the 
revolutionary cause of chuche to a brilliant completion through 
generations. 
  In Korea today, the invincible Workers' Party of Korea 
firmly 
stands in the centre of the revolutionary ranks, and the popular 
masses, who have withstood all trials, sharing their destiny 
with the party in the protracted course of revolutionary 
struggle, are unreservedly displaying their creative ingenuity 
in the revolution and construction, united around the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in one mind, upholding the noble 
intentions of the great leader with loyalty. 
  The whole party, the entire army and all the people has 
formed a mighty driving force to successfully carry forward the 
revolutionary cause of chuche to accomplishment through 
generations, firmly united around the dear leader in one idea 
and purpose on the basis of revolutionary obligation and noble 
comradeship. This shines as the most precious feat which will 
remain recorded forever, which Comrade Kim Il-song has performed 
for the party, the revolution and the people, putting forth all 
his energy till this day. 
  Comrade Kim Il-song has resolved all the problems 
independently and creatively in conformity with the specific 
conditions of our country from the chuche-based stand in the 
whole period of his revolutionary activities, carried out the 
anti- imperialist, anti-feudal democratic revolution and the 
socialist revolution successfully and in a unique way and 
accelerated socialist construction to perform feats for the 
century in building socialism of chuche on this land where 
independence, self-sustenance and self-reliance in national 
defence have been definitely realized. 
  Noting that he is a tender-hearted father with a noble 
virtue 
of holding the people dearest, the reporter said: The idea 
"believing in the people as in heaven" is the great ideological 
source of popular politics which he has applied consistently as 
the maxim of his life. 
  The feats performed by Comrade Kim Il-song in leading the 
revolutionary struggle and constructive work of our people along 
an ever-victorious road are a most precious revolutionary wealth 
which is of immortal significance in the revolutionary cause of 
the working class and other popular masses for independence. 
They will shine forever along with the onward movement of 
history and the revolutionary cause of our party and people 
advancing under his guidance will be always invincible. 
  The whole party and the entire people should hold tighter 
the 
socialist banner of chuche, upholding the leadership of the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il in order to defend the socialist 
cause from the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of the 
imperialists and reactionaries and further develop it. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song said: 
  "The whole party and the entire people must fully support 
the 
leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il to defend our socialism 
centred on the popular masses and successfully accomplish the 
revolutionary cause of chuche. Herein lies the firm guarantee 
for carrying forward the socialist cause to accomplishment." 
  In order to firmly defend and accomplish the socialist cause 
of chuche started by Comrade Kim Il-song and promote the 
reunification of the country, big efforts must be continuously 
directed to the strengthening of the singlehearted unity of the 
party and the revolutionary ranks around the leader and 
uninterrupted innovations be effected in socialist construction, 
the reporter said. 
  Noting that the United States and its followers, the South 
Korean authorities, are rushing headlong along the road of 
confrontation and division and bringing the situation in Korea 
again to the perilous brink of war, committing all manner of 
perfidious acts, the reporter said: This only reveals their 
vulnerability. 
  He further said: 
  We do not like empty words. 
  The entire people and officers and men of the People's Army 
will maintain a more mobilized and strained posture than ever 
before in face of the prevailing situation and, if the enemy 
unleash a reckless war of aggression, ignoring our patient 
peaceloving efforts, the army and people will unite in one body 
and mete out a stern punishment to the enemy and resolutely 
defend our socialist motherland and the sovereignty of the 
nation under the ever- victorious leadership of the supreme 
commander of our revolutionary Armed Forces Comrade Kim Chong-il 
so that it could not tread on an inch of our land and a blade of 
grass. 
  Then a speech was made by the head of the congratulatory 
group of Koreans from Japan visiting the homeland to celebrate 
April 15.

<F P=106> [Speech by Kang Song-san, member of the Political Bureau of </F>
the WPK Central Committee and premier of the DPRK Administration 
Council, at a central report meeting marking DPRK President Kim 
Il- song's birthday held at the 8 February Hall of Culture in 
Pyongyang on 14 April--live] 
  [Text] [applause] Comrades: Today our people are 
significantly commemorating the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song's birthday--the greatest national holiday--amid the 
socialist general march we are accelerating overflowing with a 
great pride in firmly defending, protecting and glorifying 
popular mass-centered socialism of our country, which has 
embodied the chuche idea. 
  Marking this day, the entire nation overflows with endless 
emotion and hope, and is filled with the sense of boundless 
admiration of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  Brothers in the South, who are courageously fighting for 
independence, democracy, and national reunification; all 
overseas compatriots; and the revolutionary people of the world; 
are also significantly commemorating the great leader's birthday 
as a great national holiday and as a common revolutionary 
congratulatory event of mankind. 
  The entire course of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's 
revolutionary activities has been brilliantly embroidered with 
annals of gigantic struggle and of creation during which he 
dedicated everything to the nation's happiness [haengbok] and 
prosperity and to the people's freedom and happiness [haengbok]. 
[applause] 
  Under the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's leadership, our 
revolution traversed the victorious road of honor by breaking 
through various trials and difficulties. Even amid a grave 
situation in which the imperialists and reactionaries are more 
viciously waging anti-socialist and anti-Republic maneuvers more 
than ever before, our revolution is vigorously advancing without 
wavering even a slightest degree by demonstrating indomitable 
nature of the chuche revolutionary cause. 
  Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and 
people, pioneered our revolution after embarking on the road of 
national liberation at an early date by shouldering the destiny 
of the fatherland. He constantly led our people's cause of 
independence-- the socialist cause--along the single road of 
victory with uncommon wisdom and outstanding leadership. He made 
immortal achievements in the progress of mankind and in the 
development of world revolution. At this significant occasion to 
mark the revolutionary April holiday, the greatest national 
holiday, I extend the greatest honor and warmest congratulations 
to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song together with ardent 
admiration and unanimous loyalty and the sense of reverence of 
all party members and people. [applause] 
  Comrades, our people victoriously carried out the difficult 
and complex struggle for the nation's sovereignty and prosperity 
under the banner of the chuche idea for a long period of time 
since the Korean revolution was pioneered. The greatest national 
fortune that our people have during the entire course of this 
sacred and valuable struggle is the fact that we are upholding 
the great leader at the van of the revolution. 
  As was illustrated by the course of revolutionary struggle 
of 
the working class and working people for independence, only when 
the popular masses, although they created history and developed 
society, come under the precise leadership of the leader 
[suryong] who organizes and leads their struggle, can they have 
the position and play the role of the independent main force of 
history. 
  Only when the popular masses come under the leadership of 
the 
outstanding leader, can they become the master of their destiny 
and pioneer the independent and creative life. This has been 
clearly proven by our nation's ordeal-filled past and by today's 
brilliant reality. 
  Our people upheld the respected Comrade Kim Il-song--the 
great leader--for the first time in a national history of 
several thousand years and came under the wise leadership of the 
leader. As a result, we could emerge as a glorious people who 
are in charge of the chuche revolutionary cause. We could free 
ourselves from being the most miserable sufferers of a history 
of affliction. Thus, our people came to have the honor of being 
the independent people who are pioneering the victorious road of 
socialism--the valuable revolutionary road. [applause] 
  Because we uphold the outstanding leader [suryong] who has 
great ideas and leadership and the matchless leader [cholseui 
yongdoja] at the van of the fatherland and revolution, our 
people became strong and dignified people who are confidently 
pioneering the victorious road of socialism even amid 
unprecedented worldwide political storm without a slight degree 
of wavering by upholding the chuche revolutionary banner. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song opened a new origin in 
the history of struggle to liberate mankind, and brought about a 
basic turn in our people's destiny in the 20th century, when 
great changes were registered in world politics, while leading 
his life. He is a peerlessly great man and an elder statesman of 
world revolution who made immortal achievements in the socialist 
cause, the cause of independence of mankind. [applause] 
  History of mankind has recorded up to now a great number of 
reputed leaders of the working class. However, there was no such 
a leader as the respected Comrade Kim Il-song who victoriously 
shaped the revolutionary road and illuminated profound, 
diversified and long heroic annals with greatness in leadership, 
with richness in achievements, and with the influence over 
development of time and history. [applause] 
  The respected Comrade Kim Il-song is the great leader of the 
working class and working people who has ideological and 
theoretical wisdom and leadership and unprecedented moral 
character. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song created the chuche idea 
which reflected the demand of our era--the era of 
independence--and illuminated the road of Korean revolution. He 
is the great thinker and theoretician who provided the working 
class and working people with invincible and ever-victorious 
weapon for freedom, liberation and socialism. [applause] 
  The people's destiny can be pioneered only under the 
leadership of the correct ideology. The socialist society can 
develop along the correct road of advance without wavering even 
amid the whirlpool of history only when it is led by the 
revolutionary idea which correctly reflects the demand of the 
time and aspirations of the people. 
  The cases in many countries where socialism collapsed in 
recent years seriously illustrate that when the people face an 
ideological crisis without precise guiding ideology, their 
destiny would be cruelly trampled underfoot by traitors of the 
revolution and (?opportunists) and the revolution, which 
victoriously developed through arduous struggle, would fail 
midway, and thus the people cannot avoid painful frustration. 
  Because the immortal chuche idea brightly illuminated the 
road of our advance, our people could attain victory and made 
advance by upholding the banner of independence--the 
revolutionary banner-- without any deviation over a long period 
of time up to present while pioneering difficult and complex 
road of revolution in the outdated colonial semi-feudalistic 
society in Asia. 
  The chuche idea created by the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song is the most correct guiding ideology for the revolution 
and construction which reflected the independent aspiration and 
demand of our era and of the working people. [applause] 
  Based on the chuche idea, the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song elucidated all theories, strategy and tactics for all 
steps and all domains of revolution to achieve independence of 
the popular masses, and carried to accomplishment the method of 
leadership to lead the cause of independence of the popular 
masses to victory. Thus, he developed the revolutionary idea of 
the working class onto a new higher stage. 
  Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary idea, which proceeded 
from and has embodied the principle of the immortal chuche idea, 
is the precious fruition of the great leader's long, profound, 
diversified, unique and encyclopedic ideological and theoretical 
activities. Creation of the chuche idea is the greatest, shining 
achievement made by the respected leader before time and 
mankind. [applause] 
  Today the imperialists and all sorts of the enemies of the 
revolution are clamoring that the collapse of socialism in many 
countries means a victory of capitalism and an end of socialism, 
thus, advertising that the ideology of socialism is wrong. This 
is a complete [word indistinct] of history and realities and is 
nothing but a foolish sophistry designed to block the driving 
force of scientific socialist idea. 
  The course of the Korean revolution which has victoriously 
pioneered the road toward independence, the road toward 
socialism, through its protracted struggle and the 
centuries-long transformation and today's world trend of seeking 
independence vividly prove the universal truthfulness of the 
chuche idea that the idea of socialism is correct and that men 
who are the persons directly in charge of its realization are 
precisely the masters of everything and decide everything. 
  The chuche idea, which sparked early in the dawn of the 
Korean revolution and has fully demonstrated its correctness and 
vitality through the practice of protracted revolutionary 
struggle, has become the basis of the socialist ideology, which 
is most superior in our times and the lifeline of our country's 
ever-victorious and invincible socialism. It has also become the 
immortal beacon and the encouraging banner of the world's 
revolutionary people who love justice and truth and who seek 
independence. [applause] 
  The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song is the 
great statesman and the genius of creation and construction who 
has built a powerful country of chuche and an invincible 
fortress of socialism in the Orient of the world by embodying 
the chuche idea with his matchless farsightedness, scientific 
insight, iron-like will, and extraordinary leadership ability 
and by not only fostering our people into a revolutionary people 
who have strong sense of independence, but also leading the 
complicated and arduous Korean revolution to the single road of 
victory on the strength of the inexhaustible might of our 
popular masses. [applause] 
  Already in the early period of his embarkment on the road of 
the revolution, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song elucidated 
the noble truth that the basic problem in the popular masses' 
struggle for independence is first of all to organizationally 
and ideologically awaken the popular masses, who are the main 
force of the struggle for independence, and, thus, to enhance 
their creative roles. Since then, the great leader has wisely 
led the work of strengthening the main force of our revolution 
and enhancing its role while personally surmounting numerous 
trials and crossing countless deadlines. 
  The anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle organized and led 
by 
the great leader Marshal Kim Il-song was the glorious 
revolutionary struggle which firmly built the main force of our 
revolution; which, on the strength of it, developed the 
anti-Japanese struggle for national liberation of our country 
and the Korean communist movement to a new high stage and 
realized the cause of national liberation; and which, thus, 
provided our party's brilliant revolutionary tradition. In his 
anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle period the great leader 
Marshal Kim Il-song, as the young general of his twenties and as 
the immortal legendary hero, received absolute trust and 
infinite reverence from all of the nation and victoriously led 
the overall Korean revolution which centered on armed struggle. 
As a result he provided the powerful main force of the Korean 
revolution, regained the divested fatherland for our people, 
and, thus, recorded an immortal, new victorious chapter in the 
history of the oppressed people's struggle against colony and 
for national liberation. [applause] 
  That the respected and beloved great Marshal Kim Il-song 
founded the Workers Party of Korea [WPK], the new type of chuche 
party, and has strengthened and developed it into an iron-like 
party is the great historic achievement which has provided a 
guarantee for certain victory in firmly strengthening the main 
force of our revolution and in achieving the final victory in 
the socialist, communist cause in our country. [applause] 
  Even in the complicated and confusing situation right 
after the liberation, the respected and beloved leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song completed the cause of founding our party, which he 
had persistently carried out from the days of the anti-Japanese 
revolutionary struggle, and strengthened and developed our party 
into the powerful staff office [chamobu] of the Korean 
revolution. As a result, our people could possess their own 
tested leading political organization, strongly unite around the 
party, and vigorously advance revolution and construction. 
  The entire course of the struggle which the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song waged to found our party and strengthen and 
develop it was a worthwhile course for building a new 
chuche-type party. And, for the first time in the history of 
our country's party building, a [calligraphy] brush was embossed 
in the party's emblem in addition to the hammer and a sickle 
during the days of this honorable struggle. This was a valuable 
experience in building a popular masses-oriented party. 
  We have fully embodied the theory of chuche in party 
building 
and party work under the correct leadership of the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song and our party Central Committee. As a 
result, the WPK today fully demonstrates its strength as an 
invincible party that has embued itself with a single idea 
[sasangjok ilsaekhwa], achieved organizational unity, and put 
down deep roots among the popular masses based on one idea, the 
leader's [suryong] revolutionary idea, and as a mature and 
tested party with a bright future that firmly ensures continuity 
in ideology and leadership [sasanggwa yongdoui kyesungsongul 
hwakkohui pojang] and leads the people's cause of independence 
to victory. [applause] 
  Based on the fundamental principle of the chuche idea, the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has attached great importance 
to indoctrinating and reforming the people in a revolutionary 
manner, given top priority to the ideological revolution, and 
made strenuous efforts to arm our people with revolutionary 
ideas and raise them into an invincible combatant rank that has 
achieved harmonious unity [honnyon ilcherul irun] with the 
party. In this way, he has consolidated the rock solid main 
forces of our revolution into a social and political organism 
with a force that no one can break. This is an immortal 
achievement. 
  Today our people have become revolutionary people who have 
strong independence, and such people cannot be found anywhere 
else in the world. This is because they possess a high sense of 
independence and are strongly united around the party under the 
leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  The noble ideological and spiritual feature [pungmo] of the 
Korean communists and our people who were raised under the care 
of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is that they strongly 
believe their leader [suryong] and their party and devote 
themselves to carrying out the chuche revolutionary cause after 
being strongly united around them [their leader and their 
party]. This is the solid ideological and spiritual basis of 
the single-hearted unity between the party and the popular 
masses in our country. 
  In consolidating the main forces of our revolution's trait 
of 
being as solid as a rock, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
has wisely led the work of responsibly building the party's 
organizational and ideological basis and leadership system for 
responsibly taking care of the people's destinies in both the 
distant future of the fatherland and of the revolution. In this 
way, he has provided a firm guarantee for inheriting and 
completing the revolutionary cause. This was an immortal 
achievement. [applause] 
  The revolutionary cause of establishing independence among 
the popular masses is carried out continuously generation after 
generation. And, we must carry out, in a farsighted manner, the 
work of strengthening the main forces of the revolution in 
compliance with the demand of the revolution's development to 
ultimately complete this historic cause. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's most brilliant 
foresight lies in the fact that he earlier perceived the 
historic inevitability of victory in the revolutionary cause, 
made complete preparations for such a victory in compliance with 
the demand of our revolution and the earnest desire of our 
people, and strongly built the party's organizational and 
ideological basis and leadership system for brilliantly 
inheriting and completing the chuche revolutionary cause 
generation after generation. 
  Today, in our country the WPK stands firmly at the center of 
the revolutionary ranks. It also is single-heartedly united 
around the popular masses' dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who 
has shared the same destiny with the party and overcome all 
trials through the prolonged revolutionary struggle. It also 
loyally upholds the great leader's lofty intention and and fully 
demonstrates its creative power in revolution and construction. 
  The entire party, the entire Army, and all people have 
formed 
powerful main forces that will brilliantly inherit and complete 
the chuche revolutionary cause generation after generation after 
being united around the dear comrade leader based on a 
revolutionary moral obligation, noble comradeship, and a single 
idea and will. This is the noblest achievement that the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song has devotedly brought about for our 
party, revolution, and people throughout his life and that will 
be cherished in the hearts of people of all generations. 
[applause] 
  Today, the expression "single-hearted unity of the 
leader, the party, and the masses" can only be applied to our 
country. The single-hearted unity has entered a phase of full 
development in our generation under the leadership of our 
supreme commander General Kim Chong-il through a grand march for 
modelling the whole society after chuche and for implementing 
the programs. [applause] 
  Our people's single-hearted unity centered around the great 
leader and the great party is the source of the might and 
invincibility of our country's socialism and fundamental factor 
for our revolutionary cause to remain unshaken in any storm, 
continue for generations, and become ever-victorious. 
  By independently and creatively solving all problems in 
chuche point of view and in compliance of our country's 
situation during the entire course of his revolutionary 
activities, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song brilliantly 
carried out anti-imperialist, antifeudal, democratic, and 
socialist revolution, accelerated socialist construction, and 
established chuche-based socialism on this land where 
independence, self-reliance, self-defense are firmly realized, 
thus marked an achievement of the century. [applause] 
  The popular masses-centered socialism of our own style, 
which 
is today deeply rooted in our country gaining absolute support 
and consent of all the people, is the greatest exhibit of our 
revolution established by the respected and beloved Comrade Kim 
Il-song through arduous struggles all his life, and is the 
cradle of our people's life and happiness. [applause] 
  Our country, which in the past had once lost its glory in 
the 
world's map, creatively carried out various democratic plans 
after the liberation, provided an excellent prerequisite for the 
continuous implementation of socialism, stood firm in the 
international stage holding the banner of the DPRK, which is 
proud of the name, built up its own regular revolutionary armed 
force, displayed the honor of the heroic Korea in the world 
after the war by winning great victory in the fatherland 
liberation war against the armed bandit aggression of U.S. 
imperialists, which proudly called themselves the world's 
strongest, consolidated a firm basis of self-reliant national 
economy after the war with the Chollima great advance on the 
ruin where everything was destroyed by the war, and established 
an advanced socialist system. These are brilliant fruitions of 
the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song's firm 
chuche-oriented position and ever-victorious indomitable strong 
will, and extraordinary leadership, and the great victory of the 
party's chuche line. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song created the world's 
model of socialism by elucidating all the aspects of the new 
socialist and communist construction theory and method in the 
chuche point of view after the victory of the socialist 
revolution and establishment of the socialist system in our 
country, by wisely leading our party and people to carry them 
out. [applause] 
  Our future is brightly enlightened by the line of the three 
revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture on continuous 
revolution under socialism as elucidated by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song. Because of the great leader's outstanding 
and tested leadership, the works of reforming people's ideology 
and fostering communist humans, which are decisive factors for 
defining the development and destiny of socialist society after 
the establishment of a socialist system in our country, are 
guaranteed with precedence and ceaseless miracles. Innovations 
were marked in economic and cultural construction due to the 
masses' upsurge in revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity, 
brilliant achievements were made in the work of making all the 
society members revolutionary, working class, and intellectual, 
and of making the people's economy chuche- oriented, modern, and 
scientific, and of consolidating the socialist, political and 
ideological basis and material as hard as rocks. [applause] 
  Today, all people are equally enjoying the most worthwhile 
and happiest lives in all areas -- political, economic, and 
cultural -- as genuine masters of the state and society in our 
county. Genuine socialism, where all people enjoy independent 
and creative lives without exploitation and oppression while 
being practically guaranteed the social equality at a same 
material and cultural living standard, is what mankind had 
dreamed simply as an ideal for centuries and what many 
revolutionary martyrs desired and bled for by devoting their 
valuable lives. This genuine socialism has come true in our 
country and is now vigorously demonstrating its unique charms 
and boundless vitality in the world. 
  In our country, socialism has become our people's firm faith 
and unalterable daily routine, and it has also become 
inseparable with our destinies. It is the destiny of socialism, 
our people, and our fatherland. [applause] 
  The chuche socialism, which the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il-song has pioneered by devoting all his life, and to which all 
people entrust their destinies and their future, is constantly 
being advanced and developed in a new and higher stage for 
modeling the entire society after the chuche idea under the 
leadership of the respected and beloved leader [chidoja] General 
Kim Chong-il. 
  In the genuine society of the people, where chuche [word 
indistinct] has brilliantly been embodied, each person highly 
displays beautiful communist traditions under the collectivist 
slogan, "One for all, and all for one," lives the most 
worthwhile political life that an independent human being can 
enjoy, a sound and abundant cultural life, and an equal and 
happy material life, and vigorously advances while foreseeing 
the prosperous future of the fatherland and the revolution, 
filled with hope and optimism. This is the true look of chuche 
Korea, which advances perfectly along the socialist road under 
our party's leadership. [applause] 
  Today, socialism of our country has constantly and firmly 
[?emerged and developed to be] an invincible fortress that no 
frantic maneuver [parakchok chaektong] by imperialists or 
reactionaries can dare to smash. 
  Our people have firm faith in the justness and invincibility 
of the chuche socialist cause, which they themselves chose and 
firmly consolidated with their own strength under the wise 
leadership of the party and the leader, and they are filled with 
the fervent resolution to fight to achieve its ultimate victory. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is a benevolent parent 
who has the lofty trait of endlessly loving the people. 
[applause] 
  After personifying his love for the people at the highest 
level, respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has 
embroidered the most brilliant history of serving the people 
during the whole course of his revolutionary activities. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has shared everything 
with the people during his whole life, considering the truth, 
"One can gain the world when one believes and depends upon the 
people, and one will be always defeated when one leaves the 
people and is abandoned by them," to be a historic lesson. He 
has practiced the best politics for the people while sharing 
sufferings, joy, blessing, and happiness with them. 
  The ideology of serving the people as though they were 
heaven 
is the great ideological source of the people-oriented politics 
that the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has 
invariably embodied and considered as his lifelong maxim. 
[applause] 
  With lofty ideology, the great leader Comrade Kim Il- 
song has brilliantly pioneered the victorious road of the 
revolution together with the people on the road of his arduous 
struggle which was full of ups and downs without stepping back 
or hesitating once. 
  The respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song has said that 
it is precisely our people who give him courage, faith, and 
encouragement during difficult periods of the revolution and 
that it is also our people who give him wisdom and methods that 
enabled him to lead revolution and construction on a correct 
road. Even today, through his on-the-spot guidance, he is 
directing great efforts to realize our people's long-cherished 
desire -- for everyone to eat white rice and meat soup, live in 
a tile-roofed house, and wear silk clothes -- at the earliest 
possible date. 
  All of the people-oriented policies in our country today are 
the noble fruition of the great leader Comrade's great love for 
and confidence in the people. [applause] 
  The respected and beloved leader's invariable love for the 
people is a boundlessly broad fatherly bosom which warmly 
embraces all the people without discrimination. [applause] 
  Thanks to the great leader's bosom of love as broad as an 
ocean, millions of our party ranks have been brought up, the 
indomitable revolutionary force of arms have been firmly 
prepared, and the entire society has become one big 
revolutionary family which is united with comradery. 
  Thanks to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's warm 
solicitude that is as broad as an ocean, an amazing development 
is being witnessed today in which those who once engaged in 
anticommunism, turning away from the country and the nation, now 
devote themselves to patriotic and nation-loving work. They 
have transformed themselves to live true lives. Likewise, a 
legend has been created in which an invincible fighter of the 
WPK, who had kept revolutionary principles and integrity for 
decades amid the enemies' evil acts and appeasement, has been 
embraced to the socialist fatherland's bosom. Whether they are 
in the North, in the South, or abroad, and irrespective of what 
ideology, political view, faction, religion, and history of 
political life they have had, they are all joining in the sacred 
cause of reunification, looking up to the respected and beloved 
Kim Il-song as the great father of the nation. This is because 
the leader's bosom is so warm and broad. Because our people 
have the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who has the most 
sublime virtue, as their father, they entrust all their destiny 
and future to the leader and enjoy rewarding and happy lives in 
the bosom of the leader. 
  The leader has the people in mind, and the people truly 
trust 
the leader from the bottom of their hearts and uphold him with 
utmost loyalty and filial duty. This is the great ethos of our 
society and the great pride of our chuche fatherland today. 
[applause] 
  Truly, the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
-- who has made immortal achievements in the cause of 
independence and the cause of socialism of the popular masses 
for the protracted period of time since he initiated the Korean 
revolution under the banner of the chuche idea up to this day 
with his outstanding ideology, extraordinary leadership, and 
noble virtue -- is the great lodestar of the struggle for the 
complete liberation and eternal happiness of mankind. [applause] 
  Today, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, who has been 
waging the struggle for the fatherland, the people, and the 
revolution day and night throughout his whole life, is still 
wisely leading the entire party, the whole country, and all the 
people to the historic march for the victory of the socialist 
cause and for the independent reunification of the country today 
with his vigorous energy and extraordinary revolutionary sweep, 
standing at the head of the revolution. Immortally significant 
in the revolutionary cause of the working class and the masses 
of working people for independence, the respected and beloved 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song's achievements registered in leading 
our people's revolutionary struggle and construction to an 
ever-victorious road are the noblest revolutionary assets which 
will shine forever along with the advance of history, while the 
revolutionary cause of our party and our people who are 
advancing under the great leader Comrade Kim Il- song's 
leadership remains ever-victorious and invincible. [applause] 
  Comrades: Our revolution, which has surmounted multilayered 
barriers in victoriously advancing under the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song's leadership, is today vigorously advancing 
to a new developing stage, and our party and people are faced 
with heavy but honorable revolutionary tasks today. 
  The internal and external situation of our revolution is 
still complicated and tense, and safeguarding and defending the 
socialist cause from the anti-republic and antisocialist 
maneuvers perpetrated by the imperialists and reactionaries and 
further developing the socialist cause are the lofty and 
responsible duty that our party and people have been assigned 
for the times and (?the revolution). To successfully perform 
this important duty it is imperative for the entire party and 
all the people to uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
leadership and to advance forward, more firmly grasping the 
banner of chuche socialism. [applause] 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To defend 
our country's popular masses-centered socialism and to 
brilliantly comsummate the chuche revolutionary cause it is 
imperative for the entire party and all the people to properly 
uphold Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership. The firm guarantee for 
inheriting and consummating the socialist cause lies precisely 
in properly upholding Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership. 
  The chuche revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song is synonymous with our party's revolutionary 
cause, and the fundamental key to brilliantly consummating our 
party's cause, that is, the chuche socialist cause, lies 
precisely in upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's 
ideology and leadership. [applause] 
  Although the imperialists and reactionaries are perpetrating 
the antisocialist and anti-Republic maneuvers today more 
viciously than ever before, any high-handedness, threat, or 
blackmail by the enemy cannot frighten our people who are 
advancing along the dear comrade leader's leadership and 
upholding the great leader nor can they block our march. 
[applause] 
  Even under today's complicated situation we should always 
cherish in our hearts the infinite national fortune of upholding 
the great leader [widahan suryong] and the great leader 
[widaehan yongdoja], who is leading with certainty the chuche 
revolutionary cause to the single road of victory with iron-like 
will and matchless courage, and excellent strategies and 
tactics, should more properly uphold the party and the leader 
[suryong] with infinite loyalty, and, thus, fly the banner of 
chuche socialism higher as the enemies' challenge becomes more 
vicious. [applause] 
  To firmly safeguard and defend the cause of socialism of 
chuche pioneered by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, to 
consummate it to the end, and to expedite national 
reunification, it is imperative to continuously concentrate 
great efforts on strengthening singlehearted unity of the party 
and the ranks of the revolution in the future as in the past. 
  The singlehearted unity of our party and the ranks of the 
revolution today are being deepened steadily by the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong-il who has mastered the features and talent as 
the people's leader. Carrying out the Korean revolution to the 
end by following the Paektu march under the party's leadership 
is precisely the firm faith and will of our people. [applause] 
  We should more firmly defend the singlehearted unity of our 
revolutionary ranks which has been firmly deepened under the 
party's leadership and should further consolidate and develop it. 
  All party members and the working people should make loyalty 
to the party and the leader [suryong] as their firm faith, 
conscience, and moral root with the firm faith and strong will 
that as long as the great leader [widaehan suryong] and the 
great leader [widaehan yongdoja] stand at the forefront our 
revolution will be victorious without fail and should 
demonstrate this loyalty in every moment of their daily life. 
  All party members and the working people should firmly arm 
themselves with the revolutionary ideology, that is, the chuche 
idea, should think and act only according to the party's 
ideological will, and should become the fortress and shield 
which resolutely safeguards and defends the party and the leader 
[suryong] politically, ideologically, and with life. 
  Holding aloft the slogan, "What the party decides we will 
do," Thoroughly implementing all lines and policies set forth by 
the party by holding aloft the slogan, "What the party decides 
we will do" and, thus, effecting a constant upsurge in socialist 
construction is an important task which arises in strengthening 
the might of the popular masses-centered socialism of our own 
style and in exalting its superiority highly. 
  Upholding this year's New Year address by the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song, tasks he set forth at the 21st plenary 
session of the sixth party Central Committee, and his historic 
letter to the national agricultural meeting, all party members 
and the working people should bravely surmount all difficulties 
and barriers with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude, which is the banner of the victory of our revolution, 
and should accelerate the general march of socialism with the 
spirit of adding the speed of the nineties to Chollima. Thus, 
they should thoroughly implement the party's agriculture-first, 
light industry-first, and trade-first policy; should firmly give 
priority to coal industry, power industry, and railway 
transport; and should continue to develop metal industry. In 
this way, they should effect innovations in all sectors of the 
national economy. 
  Today, the United States and its follower, the South Korean 
authorities, are not only perpetrating various acts of breaching 
faith, but are also dashing further toward the road of 
confrontation and division, thereby again leading the situation 
of our country to the dangerous brink of war. However, the 
provocative acts of outside forces and the flunkeyist, 
nation-selling Kim Yong-sam ring who flatter and submit to 
outside forces, are being recklessly perpetrated after losing 
the ability to reason, and only reveal weakness. 
  We do not like to utter empty talk. All the people and 
officers and men of the People's Army will maintain a mobilized 
and tense posture [tongwondoego kinjangdoen taese] more firmly 
than ever before to cope with the prevailing situation, and if 
the enemies ignite the fuse of a reckless war of aggression by 
turning away our patient peace-loving efforts, our Army and 
people will unite as one and impose stern chastisement on 
enemies and resolutely defend our socialist fatherland and our 
nation's sovereignty under the ever- victorious leadership of 
Comrade Kim Chong-il, the supreme commander of our revolutionary 
armed forces, in order not to allow them to arbitrarily touch 
even one inch of land or a blade of grass in our fatherland. 
[applause] 
  Under today's situation, we should further strengthen the 
country's barriers; make firm political, ideological, and 
military preparations to actively counter any of the enemy's 
provocative acts; and thoroughly set up an ethos of actively 
supporting the People's Army and valuing the Army throughout the 
entire society. 
  Keenly realizing the party's slogan, "We serve the people!" 
all functionaries should deeply mingle with the masses, further 
inspire their revolutionary zeal and creativeness, become a 
standard-bearer in implementing the party's line, and set 
practical examples in all work by standing at the head of the 
masses. Thus, they should become true loyal servants who are 
devotedly working for the people. 
  Only victory lies ahead of our people who are staunchly 
fighting to defend the chuche socialist banner with conviction 
in sure victory and revolutionary optimism under the wise 
leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. [applause] 
  Upholding the banner of the chuche idea and the three 
revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture, let us all 
vigorously advance toward new victory in the revolution in firm 
unity with the party Central Committee headed by the respected 
and beloved Comrade Kim Il-Song. [applause] 
  Together with the people's ardent loyalty and endless 
admiration for the respected and beloved leader, I respectfully 
wish Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and 
people, good health and long life, national reunification, 
everlasting prosperity for the nation, and accomplishment of the 
chuche revolutionary cause. [applause, shouting of hurrah] 
  Long live Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party 
and people! [applause, shouting of hurrah] 
  Long live the glorious WPK, the organizer and guide of all 
triumphs of the Korean people! [applause, shouting of hurrah]

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- A national seminar was 
held here Tuesday on the occasion of the birthday of the great 
leader President Kim Il-song.

President Yi Chong-ok, Secretary of the C.C., WPK Kim Ki-nam, 
Vice- Premier of the Administration Council Chang Chol, 
officials concerned, party cadres and men of science, education, 
culture and art and the press. 
  Speeches were made at the seminar on various subjects 
including "The Respected Leader Comrade Kim Il-song Is a Great 
Thinker and Theoretician Who Has Laid an Ideological Foundation 
of Socialism Centred on the Masses", "The Great Leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song Is a Genius of Creation and Construction Who Has 
Laid Solid Material and Technical Foundations of Socialism" and 
"Respected Comrade Kim Il- song Is a Great Leader of the 
Revolution Who Has Provided Basic Guarantee for Carrying Forward 
the Socialist Cause of Chuche To Accomplishment". 
  The speakers were unanimous in saying that the respected 
leader whom the whole world looks up to as the sun of mankind is 
a distinguished leader of the era of independence who started 
and has led to victory the socialist cause of chuche with his 
unique idea and great revolutionary practice, regarding it as 
his maxim in life to "believe in the people as in heaven", and a 
benevolent father of the people who is bringing into reality an 
independent and creative life, the age-old desire of mankind, 
with his politics of trust and love. 
  Noting that the respected leader is a great thinker and 
theoretician who has provided the lifeblood of the Korean-style 
socialism by creating the immortal chuche idea, the speakers 
pointed out that he has successfully built a great pyramid of 
socialism by consistently applying the political idea of 
independence with his unswerving revolutionary faith and firm 
will. 
  They explained that the great leader set forward the most 
correct guideline for the working-class army building and 
military activities by founding the chuche-based military 
thought with self- reliance in independence as the core and 
fostered invincible military forces capable of guaranteeing the 
socialist cause with credit. 
  Saying the great leader has, for the first time in the 
history of the communist movement, perfectly solved the question 
of carrying forward the guidance of a political leader and 
provided a basic guarantee for the completion of the socialist 
cause, they stressed that this is the greatest of exploits 
performed by him.

  [Text] Singapore is our friend. The leaders and the 
peoples of Myanmar [Burma] and Singapore enjoy close affinity in 
that they were under colonial rule, and had shaken off the 
shackles not just once. 
  Today, Singapore is a shining example of success through 
sheer dint of their leaders having strived to achieve, and also 
deliver as they have vowed. Under capable leadership, the 
city-state shows others what they must do if they are to succeed 
likewise. 
  Myanmar and Singapore have a record of longstanding 
bilateral 
relations. Way back in September 1952, when Singapore was still 
a Crown colony attached to Britain, Myanmar maintained a 
consulate in there. Its status was raised to Consulate-General 
in April 1961. 
  Myanmar accorded recognition to the new Republic of 
Singapore 
on 14 August 1965, barely five days after it withdrew from 
Malaysia and became an independent and sovereign state. 
  The following year, on 12 August, Myanmar and Singapore 
established diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level when U 
Pe Kin, the doyen of the Myanmar diplomatic corps and then 
resident in Kuala Lumpur was concurrently accredited to 
Singapore until his retirement in February 1971. 
  The leaders of Myanmar and Singapore have enjoyed mutual 
regard. Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew is synonymous with 
discipline and safeguarding of Asian values and those junior to 
him are understood here in this country as being no less 
fastidious when it comes to defending and upgrading what is 
Asian and good. 
  There have been exchanges of visits by top leaders, either 
formal or informal, and the mutual esteem they have shared is 
reflected by the sentiments of the peoples. 
  Myanmar has the resources, Singapore has the expertise. A 
combination of the two has brought forth fruitful results. 
Recently, when there was economic change, Singaporean 
entrepreneurs were among the first to see how much they could 
invest for mutual benefit. 
  Singaporeans know what can be achieved together, with a 
sense 
of mutual accommodation, and they find investments in Myanmar 
hold good prospects. 
  Singapore has also much to offer in the field of 
development, 
and being one of the 'Four Tigers', we can count on her to help 
us with almost anything we might want to do, plainly put. 
  Premier Goh Chok Tong is no stranger to us. He has been here 
before and his arrival today reassures us of further cementing 
the already strong ties.

  [Text] A new era in Malaysian-Cambodian relations has begun 
with the three-day visit this week of Prime Minister Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed to Phnom Penh. The ties between the peoples of 
the two countries had begun centuries ago. The relations have 
always been cordial. In Dr. Mahathir's words, Malaysia will 
take every means to improve the existing interaction. Cambodia 
has always remained close to the hearts of Malaysians. The 
civil war that had raged in that country with the government 
facing the lots of the three guerrilla factions had been a 
matter of deep concern for the Malaysian Government and people. 
Malaysia was in the forefront among countries that wanted 
Cambodia to return to a peaceful era. Malaysia played a leading 
role in the Cambodian peace process and in the United Nations 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia or UNTAC. 
  Malaysia has always felt that peace in Cambodia is vital for 
the stability and prosperity of the Southeast Asian region. In 
his talks with the Cambodian president [as heard], Prince 
Norodom Sihanouk, and co-prime ministers, Prince Ranarridh and 
Mr. Hun Sen, Dr. Mahathir invited Cambodia to consider becoming 
a member of the ASEAN family. With the participation of 
Cambodia and possibly Vietnam and Laos, ASEAN can turn into a 
vital organization for regional cooperation. A more united 
Southeast Asia will make countries of the region stronger and 
more capable of facing the challenges of the future in a world 
that is becoming increasingly competitive. The Malaysian 
premier expressed his hope that ASEAN with the participation of 
all the ten countries of the region, including Myanmar [Burma] 
can work with the other countries of East Asia to develop a more 
resilient and progressive pattern of prosperity in the region. 
Already, Southeast Asia is now acknowledged as one of the 
fastest growing economic regions in the world. With the entry 
of the other four countries, ASEAN can become an entity that 
will be looked upon with awe and admiration. 
  A fruitful outcome of the Malaysian premier's visit to 
Cambodia is the agreement between the two countries to set up a 
joint commission to enhance bilateral cooperation. Cambodia is 
already benefiting from the Malaysian technical assistance 
program. It has also requested Malaysia's help in the areas of 
training, rural development, oil refinery and exploration, 
forest management, and the rehabilitation of its palm oil and 
rubber plantations. Cambodia has also sought Malaysia's advice 
on the setting up of free trade zones. Malaysia is ready to 
send its officers to conduct seminars and training courses for 
their Cambodian counterparts. Cambodia has opened its doors to 
foreign business investment. The large number of businessmen 
and entrepreneurs in Dr. Mahathir's delegation is reflective of 
Malaysia's keen interest in that country's economic 
reconstruction and development program.

  [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's first ever visit to 
Laos has laid the impetus for the development of two-way trade 
and investment. The move will help Laos to integrate with the 
world economy. To this end, a bilateral payments agreement has 
been signed. The pact will facilitate increased two-way 
economic and investment linkages. At the same time the 
agreement reinforces the investment guarantee agreement signed 
in 1992. 
  The visit is also significant for it demonstrates Malaysia's 
commitment to the economic development of Laos in the context of 
South-South cooperation. With this, more Malaysian investors 
will be encouraged to invest in Laos. 
  Malaysia is not contented with enhancing only bilateral 
links 
with the Indochinese nation. It wants Laos to be an important 
part of Southeast Asia, thereby positioning itself to contribute 
significantly to ASEAN. To this end, Malaysia will do its 
utmost best to facilitate its entry into the six-member 
grouping. By being a member, it will be able to participate in 
regional development projects. For example, the Growth Triangle 
concept could be extended to this part of Southeast Asia. In 
addition, ASEAN could emerge as a stronger grouping. This is 
why Laos, along with other Indochinese countries, must strive 
for economic development. Even more vital is that these 
countries must resolve whatever problems they have in a peaceful 
manner. They only know too well the destruction and untold 
misery of war. It is a new era for ASEAN and Laos must be part 
of this economic prosperity and the great need to preserve 
understanding, the sentiment of goodwill and nurture cooperation 
in view of the global changes and development. 
  Therefore, ASEAN has the ability to go forth in development 
-- to be more effective with the full membership of ten 
countries including Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Myanmar 
[Burma]. With this, Dr. Mahathir's visit to Laos is all the 
more significant. Although Malaysians have gone into logging, 
road construction, and hotel renovation, there is much potential 
for expansion. Malaysia has lots to offer in terms of expertise 
in areas such as mining, timber extraction, plantation 
management, and downstream processing of agriculture and mineral 
resources. Other areas include finance, engineering 
consultancy, infrastructure, and tourism. Since Laos has given 
priority to developing its energy needs, Malaysian companies 
should look to exploiting this potential. It is important that 
businessmen of both countries have greater contacts. For Laos, 
it will help in transforming its national economy to one based 
on market forces. Malaysians can gain in terms of new markets 
as well as through reversed investments by taking advantage of 
cheaper costs in Laos. The shortcomings and bottlenecks faced 
in Laos indeed provide opportunities which can be exploited by 
Malaysians. 
  Currently, Malaysia's investments in Laos is not 
substantial. 
But this could be a thing of the past if Laos' economic 
potential is truly exploited for mutual benefit. In this way, 
Malaysia would have done its part in assisting a fellow 
Southeast Asian country in taking its rightful place as an 
important part of the region.

  [Text] Malaysia will play a role to have the UN economic 
sanction against Iraq lifted if the country has indeed satisfied 
the conditions imposed by the world body. Law Minister Datuk 
Syed Hamid Albar said Malaysia felt that if the UN conditions 
had been satisfied, the economic sanction should be reviewed. 
  He told reporters this after talks with visiting Iraqi 
Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf at his office in Kuala 
Lumpur. He added Malaysia wished to see peace prevail in West 
Asia and did not want innocent people to suffer from economic 
sanction. He said it was Malaysia's hope that the right and 
sovereignty of nations would always be respected. 
  Syed Hamid said Muhammad Sa'id had requested Malaysia's help 
in having the economic sanction against his country lifted. The 
Iraqi minister said that his country had satisfied all UN 
conditions and had submitted documents to this effect. The 
documents would be submitted to the Malaysian Government for 
further action. 
  Muhammad Sa'id arrived in Kuala Lumpur this afternoon for a 
three-day visit as part of a tour of various countries to enlist 
their support for the lifting of the sanction. Malaysia is the 
first stop for the Iraqi minister.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 16 Apr (INA)--Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf has stressed the need to implement 
Paragraph 22 of UN Security Council Resolution 687 providing for 
allowing Iraqi exports to the world after Iraq has honored its 
obligations in accordance with relevant UN resolutions. 
  Al-Sahhaf, currently on an official visit to Malaysia, 
explained, in a news conference at the Iraqi Embassy in Kuala 
Lumpur yesterday, that the aim of his visit is to brief 
Malaysian officials on the latest developments in the relations 
between Iraq and the UN Security Council, the effects of the 
continued unjust blockade imposed on Iraq since 6 August 1990, 
and Iraq's implementation of UN Security Council resolutions. 
  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that Iraq's compliance with 
the 
relevant UN Security Council resolutions has obviously confused 
the UN Security Council. Evidence of this is that a majority of 
the permanent members states--such as China, France, and 
Russia--as well as nonpermanent member states are demanding that 
the economic blockade be lifted as soon as possible and that an 
appropriate timetable be set. 
  Asked about the extent of damage caused by the 30-state 
aggression, the minister explained that during the U.S.-led 
aggression, approximately 107,000 tonnes of explosives were 
dropped on Iraq, equal to six nuclear bombs similar to the type 
used by the U.S. forces to bomb Hiroshima at the end of World 
War II. 
  The minister said that all these explosives were dropped on 
Iraq's cities and on its civilian and services facilities, thus 
causing interruptions in civilian services, especially in the 
health, sanitary, and agricultural fields. As a result, he 
said, there has been a big increase in the mortality rate among 
children and the elderly.

  [Text] Malaysia may dispatch more sophisticated weapons to 
its troops if the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina is worsening 
and endangering the lives of Malbatt [Malaysian battalion] 
members. Defense Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun Razak said the 
dispatch of the weapons will, however, be implemented after the 
UN approval. Presently, the weapons used by Malbatt members are 
meant only for self-defense and not for combat purposes. 
However, if the situation changes for the worse, the government 
will not hesitate to send more sophisticated weapons to its 
troops in Bosnia. He also criticized the Serbs for detaining 18 
UN peacekeeping troops in an area not far from Sarajevo on 
Thursday [14 April]. 
  Speaking after he attended a ceremony to present literary 
awards in Kuala Lumpur, the minister said even though Malbatt 
members risk their lives in Bosnia, they are fearless in 
carrying out their duty. He added that Malbatt members will 
continue to serve in Bosnia under the UN peacekeeping banner 
because local people welcome their presence. He stressed that 
even though Malaysia is unhappy with the UN stand against the 
Serbs, it hopes that the world community will not bow to the 
Serbian demands.

  [Text] Malaysia's trade surplus improved 71.1 percent to RM 
[Malaysian ringgit] 3.8 billion in 1993 from RM2.2 billion the 
previous year. 
  As for the month of December 1993, a trade surplus of 
RM388.6 
million was recorded from deficits of RM850.2 million and 
RM479.6 million in October and November 1993 respectively. 
  The December surplus was, however, 50.5 percent off the 
RM785.4 million surplus recorded in December 1992, the 
Department of Statistics said. 
  The continued higher surplus in 1993 was attributed mainly 
to 
buoyant growth in exports which expanded 16.9 percent to RM121.2 
billion compared with imports which expanded 15.8 percent to 
RM117.4 billion. 
  The main export increases were manufactured goods (up 32.7 
percent), machinery and transport equipment (up 29.6 percent), 
and miscellaneous manufactured articles (up 9.7 percent). 
  The growth in imports was mainly contributed by machinery 
and 
transport equipment imports which expanded 18.4 percent and 
manufactured goods (up 10.7 percent). 
  Machinery and transport equipment and manufactured goods 
accounted for 70.7 percent of total imports in 1993. 
  The department said earnings from major primary commodities 
showed a mixed performance against strong growth for exports of 
manufactured products. 
  Commodities which recorded higher export revenues were 
thermionic valves and tubes, photocells, and others which rose 
30.4 percent, while crude petroleum exports dropped 12.1 percent.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 17 (AFP) -- Cambodian MPs are 
seeking to formally outlaw the Khmer Rouge guerrilla group and 
to evict them from premises they maintain in the country's 
capital, a senior government official said Sunday. 
  Members of the Cambodia People's Party (CPP), also known as 
the Phnom Penh party, part of the country's three-party 
coalition government, are planning to table a motion backing the 
action when parliament reconvenes in the next two weeks, the 
official said. 
  The parliamentarians need the support of their coalition 
partners in the royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an 
Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia], to 
get the two-thirds majority necessary to carry the motion in the 
120 strong national assembly, the government official said. 
  It is not known how many MPs support the move. 
  Co-Premier Hun Sen -- a CPP leader -- who was due to visit 
Bangkok to discuss "border problems" following allegations that 
the Khmer Rouge had attacked government forces from positions in 
Thai territory, decided to postpone the visit until after 
parliament had voted on the motion, the official said. 
  The move to outlaw the guerrillas comes after the Khmer 
Rouge 
refused co-Prime Ministers Hun Sen and Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh's offer of a ceasefire for the April 13-15 Khmer New 
Year celebrations. 
  Hun Sen has said the ceasefire offer was a sign of the 
government's willingness to negotiate with the rebels. 
  But the recalcitrant Khmer Rouge, which has shown no sign of 
compromise, appears to have exhausted the patience of both the 
government and King Sihanouk. 
  The guerrillas recent kidnapping of an Australian and two 
Britons further exacerbated matters, the official said. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng told AFP that the king 
advocated the move by the national assembly "to isolate the 
Khmer Rouge as rebels." 
  "We have kept the door open but the Khmer Rouge never joined 
the reconciliation process," Sar Kheng said, adding: "Now we 
should not talk anymore about keeping the door open." 
  Government officials said King Sihanouk was "disappointed" 
that the Khmer Rouge did not follow through with his recent 
peace proposal for the rebels. 
  Under the plan, certain "acceptable" members of the radical 
faction would be given senior cabinet posts in exchange for the 
Khmer Rouge ceasing all guerrilla activity, opening up their 
zones and merging their fighters with the national armed forces. 
  In a recent interview with the Phnom Penh Post, the king 
described the government's offensive against Pailin and its 
March 19 seizure of the Khmer Rouge's stronghold, as 
"legitimate, unavoidable and most laudable." 
  The Khmer Rouge office and residence facing closure under 
the 
MP's motion was set up here following the 1991 signing of 
Cambodia's UN-brokered peace plan, which lead to elections last 
May. 
  The Khmer Rouge, however, boycotted the polls, which saw the 
former resistance allies in the FUNCINPEC party, and the 
Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, form a coalition government 
with the radical faction's arch foe, the Phnom Penh party. 
  Despite continuing a guerrilla campaign in the countryside 
against the new government, the Khmer Rouge were allowed to 
maintain representatives in the capital. 
  This anomalous situation stemmed from King Norodom 
Sihanouk's 
hopes for a national reconciliation plan which would include the 
Khmer Rouge, and from the government's subsequent policy of 
"keeping the door open" for the guerrillas. 
  Prior to postponing his trip to Bangkok, Hun Sen said this 
was one of the major issues on the agenda for his talks with the 
Thais. 
  "Some Thai officials said the Khmer Rouge are not yet 
illegal 
because they have representatives in Phnom Penh," he said. 
  "I want to say officially that no other people or party 
except the Royal Government is legitimate, and that the Khmer 
Rouge office in Phnom Penh is the internal policy of the Khmer 
Nation," Hun Sen said.

  [Text] According to what King Norodom Sihanouk said on 12 
April, popular audiences will be held once a week to solve 
various issues on which there is a conflict of opinions between 
people and officials. 
  The second popular audience, expected to be held on 21 
April, 
will solve various problems that are still pending. It is to be 
specified that at the 12 April popular audience, four major 
issues were solved and accommodated. Of all the four problems, 
one seemed to have remained contentious. That was the issue of 
the Olympic market. Despite this, the king intervened to end 
the conflict by proposing that the Thai Bunrong company 
recognize that the Olympic market is 50 percent owned by 
traders. The king of Cambodia further said that this does not 
mean that the Thai Bunrong company or the government bow to 
traders, but it would achieve compromise and social stability. 
He further said that many foreign companies plan to invest in 
Cambodia, and the obstacle blocking this is the Khmer Rouge [KR] 
group. 
  King Norodom Sihanouk also specified that if all Cambodians 
agree to compromise regardless of their party affiliation, 
Cambodia will quickly develop, and many foreign investors will 
bring a lot of capital to invest in Cambodia.

<F P=106> [PASASON 16 April issue: "Lao People Wholeheartedly Welcome </F>
Malaysian Government Delegation."] 
  [Text] In response to the invitation of His Excellency 
[H.E.] Khamtai Siphandon, prime minister of the Lao People's 
Democratic Republic [LPDR], H.E. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir bin 
Mohamed, prime minister of Malaysia, will lead a Malaysian 
Government delegation on an official friendship visit to the 
LPDR on the morning of 16 April. 
  In regard to this significant event in the relations between 
Laos and Malaysia, multiethnic Lao people throughout the 
country, as well as Vientiane residents, are very pleased and 
feel highly honored to have an opportunity to wholeheartedly 
welcome the delegation of the Malaysian Government. This 
official friendship visit to the LPDR by the Malaysian prime 
minister and his delegation follows an official friendship visit 
to Malaysia by H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in early 
December 1992, during which the Lao and Malaysian governments 
signed agreements for the promotion and protection of 
investment; economic and science and technology cooperation; and 
air transportation. The three agreements serve as a very 
important symbol of the future relations and cooperation between 
Laos and Malaysia. Therefore, the visit to the LPDR by the 
Malaysian prime minister and the delegation not only shows the 
good friendship of Malaysian people with the multiethnic Lao 
people but is also a most important event in the history of the 
relationship between the two countries, which will become a firm 
base for the effective enhancement of bilateral relations and 
cooperation in the immediate future and in the long run and will 
be a new milestone. All this is to serve the interests of the 
two peoples of Laos and Malaysia and contribute to the continued 
efforts to promote an atmosphere of peace, friendship, and 
cooperation in the Southeast Asian region, as well as in the 
world. 
  Laos and Malaysia belong to same region, have rendered 
support to each other, and have shared good friendly relations 
and neighborly cooperation. Their peoples have similar 
characteristics and behavior. They love peace, maintain 
self-mastery and ownership of the country, enjoy independence, 
and admire progress and justice. They have never caused trouble 
for others. Neither have they interfered or invaded other 
countries. They have courageously carried out struggles with 
great endeavor and patience for a long time for the sake of the 
independence of their respective countries. 
  Malaysia is an active member of the nonaligned movement, 
having played a consistent role and taken an firm stance 
regarding the principles and objectives of the movement. 
Concerning this, the peoples of Laos and Malaysia have had good 
understanding of and trust in each other, and have thereby 
enjoyed good bilateral relations for a long time. Both sides 
have tried to promote relations in various aspects. In 
particular, after the visit to Malaysia by H.E. Prime Minister 
Khamtai Siphandon, Lao-Malaysian ties have improved more 
extensively and rapidly than before. 
  The multiethnic Lao people wish the official friendship 
visit 
to the LPDR by the Malaysian prime minister and his delegation a 
glorious success, thus contributing to the further enhancement 
and promotion of the relations and cooperation between the two 
countries in a more expansive and effective manner. All this is 
for the benefits of the peoples of Laos and Malaysia, as well as 
for peace, friendship, and cooperation in the region and the 
world.

  [Text] The present low-key economic cooperation between 
Malaysia and Laos is preventing the expansion of trade by the 
two countries. The lack of communications and the insight of 
trade opportunities in both countries is also another factor 
affecting the trade expansion. This was stated by Datuk Sri Dr. 
Mahathir Mohamed when addressing a seminar attended by 
businessmen of the two countries in Vientiane, Laos. The 
two-way trade amounted to only U.S. $18 million although several 
Malaysians had invested in many projects in the country such as 
road building and hotel renovation. The prime minister expressed 
confidence that cooperation in various fields could be 
increased. The prime minister arrived in the Laotian capital 
today on a second leg of a visit to Cambodia and Laos. Datuk 
Sri Dr. Mahathir is expected to sign a bilateral payment 
arrangement pact to boost commercial ties with Laos.

  [Text] Bangkok, April 15 KYODO -- Thai Prime Minister 
Chuan Likphai has called off a visit to Japan because of its 
political uncertainty following Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's resignation announcement, Thai Foreign Minister 
Prasong Sunsiri said Friday [15 April]. 
  Chuan was scheduled to pay a six-day official visit to Japan 
from April 22 to discuss emergency rice imports and bilateral 
economic cooperation. 
  Following Hosokawa's surprise announcement on April 8 that 
he 
will resign, Egyptian President Husni Mubarak postponed a trip 
to Japan slated for April 18 to 21 apparently because of the 
anticipated government change.

  [Text] Supreme Commander Air Chief Marshal [ACM] Woranat 
Aphichari has cancelled his planned trip to Cambodia next week, 
according to a Thai military source who gave no reason for the 
decision. The decision followed Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Hun 
Sen's cancellation of a planned trip to Thailand to discuss 
border security problems, but there was no confirmation the two 
were linked. 
  An ASSOCIATED PRESS report from Phnom Penh yesterday quoted 
First Premier Norodom Ranariddh as saying Second Premier Hun 
Sen's trip had been cancelled. The report said Ranariddh did not 
explain why. Hun Sen had announced earlier that he intended to 
make an "urgent working visit" to Bangkok, and that he intended 
to arrive yesterday. 
  A reliable source at the Foreign Ministry confirmed Hun 
Sen's 
cancellation, but said there had been no fixed date for his 
arrival. "It seems there is a communication gap between Hun Sen 
and Ranariddh," said the source, who asked not to be named. The 
Cambodian Foreign Ministry had advised nine days ago that Hun 
Sen wanted to visit Thailand after the Songkran holidays, from 
April 14- 16 in Cambodia, but no date had been fixed, the source 
said. 
  Hun Sen said a few days later he would visit Thailand on 
April 16, but was informed that would be inconvenient, and the 
date of his arrival was left open. The Cambodian Foreign 
Ministry advised on Thursday that the trip was off. 
  The Thai Military source said yesterday Woranat's planned 
trip had nothing to do with current Thai-Cambodian border 
tensions, triggered by the fighting between Phnom Penh 
government troops and guerrilla forces around the former Khmer 
Rouge base of Pailin. 
  Woranat's trip had long been scheduled for April 19-20 and 
was at the invitation of Cambodian co-Defence Ministers Tie Banh 
and Tea Chamrat, but the Cambodian government had attempted to 
link the trip to the current tensions. The announcement of the 
changed travel plans came as the two governments are embroiled 
in a war of words over Thailand's alleged support for the Khmer 
Rouge. Both countries have threatened to bring the matter to 
the United Nations' attention. 
  The Thai Embassy in Phnom Penh was informed of the change in 
Woranat's plans on Friday. Cambodian authorities informed the 
embassy on Thursday that Hun Sen's trip to Thailand was 
cancelled, according to the sources. 
  An embassy source told THE NATION yesterday the decision to 
cancel Woranat's trip had still not been conveyed to the Phnom 
Penh government because Cambodians were still on holiday. 
Cancellation of ACM Woranat's visit followed a meeting on 
Friday of senior Thai government and military officials 
concerning security along the Thai-Cambodian border. The 
officials resolved to send a diplomatic note protesting 
"continued groundless accusations" by some Cambodian leaders 
that Thailand is still supporting the Khmer Rouge, and to verify 
Bangkok's position. 
  Although the protest letter has not been delivered because 
of 
the holiday, an unofficial copy was faxed to the Cambodian 
Foreign Ministry on Friday night. The officials at Friday's 
meeting also discussed the next steps if the diplomatic note 
fails to achieve rapprochement. 
  Complaints from Cambodian leaders that Thailand is assisting 
the Khmer Rouge have become more frequent and more public since 
Phnom Penh troops captured Pailin on March 19. The town had 
been a vital economic lifeline for the Khmer Rouge, serving as a 
centre for the export of logs and gemstones to Thailand. 
  The guerrilla group refuses to abide by the terms of a 1991 
peace agreement intended to end more than a decade of civil war, 
and boycotted UN-supervised general elections. The elected 
government was subsequently formed without them. 
  Ranariddh said on Wednesday he was losing patience with 
Thailand for failing to crack down on Khmer Rouge forces, which 
he charges take refuge in Thai territory. He and Cambodian 
military leaders have also charged without presenting any 
evidence that Khmer Rouge tanks threatening government forces 
around Pailin have been operating from Thailand.

  [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday 
said the cancellation of the planned trip by Cambodian Co-Prime 
Minister Hun Sen had nothing to do with strained relations 
between the two countries. 
  Surin said the cancellation was not motivated by repeated 
Phnom Penh charges that Thailand was still supporting the Khmer 
Rouge. 
  Surin also denied that the cancellation partly stemmed from 
a 
fact that Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri had strongly 
critcized Cambodian leaders who publicly charged that Thailand 
provided safe haven for the Khmer Rouge fleeing Pailin after the 
defeat. 
  Cambodia's Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, during 
a recent visit to Malaysia, charged that Thailand was not 
sincere in solving the Cambodian internal conflict by still 
supporting the Khmer Rouge. 
  Prasong said that the Cambodian leader broke a promise which 
that the two countries would not accuse each other in public. 
[sentence as published] He also said that Cambodian government 
failed to produce evidence on the charges. 
  Hun Sen had previously said that he would visit Thailand 
after April 1 but later cancelled the trip, citing inconvenience. 
  Coinciding with Hun Sen's cancellation Supreme Commander ACM 
Woranat Aphichari's planned trip to Cambodia next week has also 
been called off. 
  However, there is no report to confirm that the two 
cancelled 
trips are related. 
  Hun Sen and Thai leaders were expected to discuss border 
security problems. His planned trip came after the Phnom Penh 
troops seized the Communist faction's major stronghold of Pailin 
early last month. 
  Surin said the Thai government leaders were now preparing a 
trip of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai to Malaysia. Therefore it 
would be inconvenient for Hun Sen to visit Bangkok. 
  Surin stressed that Thailand still wanted to foster good 
relation between the two countries. 
  "We don't want to see fighting and violence in Cambodia. We 
want to see peace," he said. 
  He also said that he did not want to let the allegations 
affect future cooperation between Thailand and Cambodia, citing 
a discovery of natural gas in the Gulf of Thailand off Cambodia 
in disputed territory.

  [Text] Regarding the accusations made recently by various 
leaders of the Royal Cambodian Government on Thailand's 
assistance to the Khmer Rouge, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
wishes to make the following points: 
  1. The Royal Thai Government categorically denies the 
accusations that Thailand has helped certain Khmer Rouge leaders 
to escape into Thailand and that Thailand has given support, in 
whatever form, to the Khmer Rouge to launch attacks on the 
Cambodian Government troops. 
  2. Thailand is surprised and disappointed by these 
continuing 
groundless accusations, because the Thai Government has clearly 
and consistently stated to the Cambodian leaders that it 
recognizes and fully supports the elected Cambodian Government. 
At the same time, we have firmly stated that we shall not 
interfere in the internal affairs of Cambodia nor do we wish to 
become involved in the internal fighting of that country. 
  3. It is certainly not in Thailand's interest to assist the 
Khmer Rouge or to support a continuing military conflict in 
Cambodia. As an advocate of peace in Cambodia and a signatory 
to the Paris Peace Agreement, Thailand wishes to see durable 
peace and prosperity in Cambodia. This fact is reflected in 
Thailand's untiring support for the peace process in Cambodia 
and in our substantial aid and assistance in the rehabilitation 
and reconstruction of Cambodia. We strongly support the noble 
guidance of His Majesty Phreahbat Samdech Norodom Sihanouk that 
there should be genuine national reconciliation. Continued 
conflict in Cambodian would only erase the gains and 
achievements for which Thailand and ASEAN, together with the 
international community, have worked so long and hard. 
  4. The Royal Thai Government wishes to refer to the 
discussion between the prime ministers of the Kingdoms of 
Thailand and Cambodia during the official visit of His 
Excellency Mr Chuan Likphai to Cambodia in January 1994. We 
recall that the two sides agreed not to resort to the media, but 
would utilize established diplomatic channels to clear any 
misunderstandings or settle any issues which may arise. 
  5. It is regrettable that the Cambodian Government has not 
approached the Royal Thai Government to seek any clarification 
concerning the alleged Thai assistance to the Khmer Rouge but 
instead chose to make unfair and unfounded accusations against 
Thailand through the press. Continued accusations by the 
Cambodian Government could adversely affect the good relations 
and understanding between the two countries and peoples, to 
which Thailand attaches great importance. We wish to stress 
once again to the Cambodian Government that the agreement 
reached by the prime ministers of the two countries should be 
strictly implemented and we would welcome any proof or concrete 
evidence from the Cambodia Government in support of the 
accusations. 
  6. The Royal Thai Government is seriously concerned over the 
border situation as a result of the continued fighting along the 
Thai-Cambodian border. The fighting has in many ways affected 
the safety and livelihood of the Thai villagers along the border 
areas. Therefore, we wish to urge the Cambodian Government to be 
especially vigilant regarding the following matters: 
  6.1 Not to allow its troops to intrude into Thai territory. 
There have been many confirmed reports on intrusions by 
Cambodian Government forces over the past several months in 
several border areas. 
  6.2 Not to fire into Thai territory. Shellings by the the 
Cambodian Government troops' artillery have on many occasions 
landed on Thai territory causing injuries to Thai villagers and 
damage or destruction to their property. 
  6.3 Suppress and eradicate illegal and criminal activities 
on 
the Cambodian side of the border.

<F P=106> [Letter from Thai Ambassador to Burma Wirasak Futrakun to </F>
the SUNDAY POST] 
  [Text] Sir: Allow me to offer my view on some points which 
were made in the editorial that appeared in your distinguished 
newspaper (THE SUNDAY POST) on 10th April 1994, entitled, "It's 
time-wasting telling Burma what press freedom is about." 
  1. I have never heard of the incident that was mentioned in 
the editorial involving the Thai Ambassador and the Burmese 
Foreign Ministry in the aftermath of the 1988 uprising in Burma. 
I doubted whether the Burmese Minister reportedly slammed one of 
Thailand's English language dailies on the table before the Thai 
envoy could take a seat. 
  For during my tenure in Myanmar [Burma] up until now, I have 
never encountered a display of bad temper by any of the 
ministers to me. The people of Myanmar on the whole are devout 
Buddhists like the Thai people. Therefore, such display of angry 
emotions is considered inappropriate. 
  Even during the heights of some crises, such as the Hill-491 
incident, the Myanmar authorities were never rude to the Thai 
ambassador. Whenever a protest had to be made to the Thai side, 
the tone of the message of the Myanmar side was always more in 
sorrow that such things should not have happened between friends 
rather than in anger. 
  2. The invitation to H.E. Brig Gen Myo Thant, Minister for 
Information of Myanmar, to visit Thailand is not aimed at 
"erasing Rangoon's doubts that the (Thai) government supports 
press criticism of the State Law and Order Restoration Council," 
but is part of the high-level exchanges between Thailand and 
Myanmar for the purpose of promoting friendly ties between two 
neighbouring countries. 
  We need to have a long-term perspective about Myanmar as our 
largest immediate neighbouring country which we must maintain 
and promote cordial relations if we desire peace and prosperity 
for our people living in ten provinces along our Western border. 
  3. Our good-neighbour policy towards Myanmar is not based on 
a desire for economic gains as crassly alleged by some so-called 
Western experts on Myanmar. If you look at the actual foreign 
investment figures of the Foreign Investment Commission of 
Myanmar, Thailand places fourth (US $70.17 million) behind South 
Korea (US $96.38 million), the United States (US $200.25 
million), and Singapore (US $240.63 million). There is no more 
logging or fishery concessions for Thai companies in Myanmar. 
  We pursue the present policy towards Myanmar simply because 
we want to have Myanmar as a good neighbour. I often told my 
Western colleagues that where you stand depends on where you 
sit. I also asked them why did the British Government pursue 
constructive engagement policy towards South Africa while other 
western countries sought to isolate and sanction it. In our 
case, a peaceful and prosperous Myanmar is in Thailand's 
national interests. 
  4. Regarding your objection to the names "Myanmar" and 
"Yangon," these are ancient and indigenous names used in our 
neighboring country. Myanmar has been trying to shed her 
colonial legacy associated with the names or the pronunciation 
given by her former colonial power. Does the BANGKOK POST wish 
to continue to constantly remind our neighbouring country of her 
colonial past, thereby repeatly pouring salt into old wounds? 
  Wirasak Futrakun, ambassador of Thailand, Union of Myanmar.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- World political and 
public circles are calling for a peaceful settlement of the 
nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. 
  Six organizations of Mali including the Malian Committee for 
Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, 
the Malian Peace Movement and the Anti-Imperialist Youth Union 
of Mali called an emergency meeting on April 1 and issued a 
joint statement. 
  The statement sharply denounced the United States for 
recklessly acting against peace and security of the world by 
stepping up preparations for a new war on the Korean peninsula. 
  Noting that the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises and deployment of Patriot missiles in South 
Korea might carry the situation of the Korean peninsula into 
extremes, it expressed indignation and apprehensions for the 
grave situation created in the region owing to the unjustifiable 
attitude of the United States and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The Political Bureau of the C.C. [Central Committee], the 
Communist Party of India (Marxism) in a statement said the U.N. 
Security Council should get itself free from the U.S. pressure 
and take a fair and aboveboard position to find a negotiated 
solution of the problem of nuclear inspection. 
  The Socialist Party of Kazakhstan in a statement April 5 
said 
it has in the past invariably supported the efforts of the DPRK 
to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful 
way. It expressed the belief that the DPRK's efforts would 
surely be successful. 
  The presidium of the Committee of "Peace and Today" of 
Russia 
in an appeal sent to the U.N. Secretary General on March 30 
pointed out that the all-out campaign launched by the United 
States and its followers is aimed at creating another "flash 
point" on the Korean peninsula. 
  The appeal called upon the United Nations to exert due 
efforts to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula in a 
peaceful way, not by unjust pressure and policy of strength or 
"sanctions".

<F P=106> ["What Is S. Korean Puppets' 'Nuclear' Clamour For?" -- KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today 
throws light on what the South Korean puppets are really seeking 
in raising a hue and cry over "the nuclear issue" of the North, 
following outside forces. 
  The analyst says: 
  Clear is the purpose of the South Korean puppets in getting 
frantic in their "nuclear" clamour, tailing behind foreign 
forces. They seek to isolate the North in the international 
arena, find a pretext for another war against the North, stifle 
it with the help of outside forces and gratify their design to 
"unify the country by invading the North." 
  They also seek to divert the attention of the people 
elsewhere and dull the people's discontent with them by the 
"nuclear" clamor, thus saving the ever-worsening crisis of their 
rule. 
  Their "nuclear" clamour is, in the final analysis, an 
intolerable criminal act to prop up the power by leaving the 
nation to the mercy of big powers. Their "nuclear" clamour is 
designed to facilitate their nuclear arms development and impede 
the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 
  The nuclear armament of the South Korean puppet clique, 
along 
with Japan's, has entered a grave stage, creating quite a stir 
in the world. It is nobody's secret that South Korea is 
developing nuclear weapons. 
  Reporting about the development of nuclear weapons by South 
Korea, newspapers of the United States, Britain and other 
countries said plutonium stockpiled by South Korea amounted to 
ten tons and it would reach about 24 tons around the year 2000. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group, however, has balked the DPRK- U.S. 
talks, fooling world public opinion over the "nuclear issue" of 
the North, which reminds us of a thief crying "stop thief!" This 
is aimed at obstructing a solution to the nuclear issue at the 
DPRK- U.S. talks to keep South Korea under the U.S. "nuclear 
umbrella" and accelerate the nuclear arms development under it. 
  But, the South Korean puppets have nothing to get in the 
"nuclear" clamour. 
  They must clearly understand that their treacherous acts in 
playing the role of a shock brigade in the "nuclear" clamour of 
the imperialist reactionaries and fooling the nation will bring 
themselves to destruction.

<F P=106> [Dishonest and Rude Act"--KCNA headline] </F>
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The South Korean 
authorities refused to take over our letter to the South Korean 
authorities, political parties, organizations and individual 
figures and overseas Koreans. 
  Commenting on this unreasonable act of the South Korean 
authorities, a news analyst of NODONG SINMUN today says: 
  If they had had a shred of patriotism and desire to achieve 
peace and peaceful reunification of the country, they should 
have positively responded to our fair proposal for the 
convocation of a national conference for seeking a way of great 
national unity. 
  The South Korean authorities, however, refused to take over 
our letter, preposterously claiming that the proposal "ignores 
North- South dialogue" and it is not "conducive to improving 
North-South relations." This is, in every respect, an 
unreasonable, rude act and a challenge to the entire fellow 
countrymen desirous of reonciliation, unity and reunification. 
  By turning down our proposal and balking the convocation of 
a 
national conference, the South Korean rulers are fully revealing 
their criminal nature as the very one who does not have dialogue 
for reunification but keeps others from having dialogue and 
seeks only confrontation, division and a war against the North. 
  The South Korean authorities would be well advised to look 
squarely at the reality, act with discretion and stop such anti- 
national acts as obstructing the convocation of a national 
conference. 
  The whole nation will keep tabs on their follow-up action.

<F P=106> ["Reckless War Moves Against North Must Be Stopped </F>
Immediately"--KCNA headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam 
puppet clique recently called a "meeting of security-related 
ministers" and issued orders to "examine and strengthen" their 
"policy against the North" and "security posture". And the U.S. 
ambassador to South Korea, the commander of the U.S. forces 
present in South Korea, the puppet defence minister, foreign 
minister and others were closeted to "re-examine" the war 
preparedness of the U.S. forces and the South Korean puppet army. 
  This tells that the Kim Yong-sam group advocating "civilian" 
politics is a group of war fanatics obsessed with the fever for 
Northward invasion overshadowing the successive ruling quarters, 
and it furnishes a clear proof that they make a war against the 
North a fait accompli, says a NODONG SINMUN article today. 
  Noting that military adventures of the puppets assume an 
extremely dangerous nature as they are timed to coincide with 
the massing of ground, naval and air forces in and around the 
Korean peninsula, the article goes on: 
  This notwithstanding, the United States and the South Korean 
puppets allege that the North is to blame for the aggravated 
tensions and the danger of war on the Korean peninsula. 
  It is the height of folly for the United States and the 
South 
Korean puppets to raise a hue and cry over "provocations" by the 
North. It is they who totally reversed the agreed conclusions 
reached at the DPRK-USA contact in New York and aborted the 
DPRK-USA talks for a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula. It is also they who aborted the inter-Korean 
working-level contact for the exchange of presidential envoys 
between the North and the South and have been carrying the 
situation into extremes with their reckless war rackets. 
  It is as clear as noonday that they are intending to light 
the train of war against the North on some unreasonable pretext 
while massively beefing up their Armed Forces and staging 
nuclear war exercises. 
  The United States is trying to frighten others by military 
threats and attain something therefrom, styling itself "a 
superpower". But it is a big miscalculation. 
  The Kim Yong-sam group's scheme to prolong its remaining 
days 
in return for plunging the nation into a nuclear holocaust by 
following outside forces is a foolish daydream. 
  We want peace but will never beg for it. We do not want war 
but are never afraid of it. 
  The United States and the South Korean puppets must promptly 
stop their criminal war moves against the North.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Working people and 
students in the northern half of Korea have condemned the South 
Korean puppet clique for scheming to open the rice market. 
  The speakers at a meeting held at Kim Chaek University of 
Technology on April 11 said the opening of agricultural market 
is a brazen-faced act which can be perpetrated only by such 
fellows as the traitor Kim Yong-sam, who makes no bones of 
treachery and disguise and does not hesitate at betraying the 
interests of the country and the nation, motivated by a lust for 
power. 
  They said the South Korean rulers have offered not only the 
rice market but also all the human and material resources of 
South Korea for the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea and have 
exacerbated North-South confrontation and pushed ahead with 
preparations for a war against the North, according to the U.S. 
strategy aimed at stifling the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. 
  The speakers at meetings held at the Haksan Cooperative 
Farm, 
Hyongjesan district, and the Chilgol Cooperative Farm, 
Mangyongdae District, Pyongyang, branded Kim Yong-sam, who has 
throttled the peasants and devastated agriculture, as the most 
heinous traitor to the nation. 
  They called on the peasants and other people of South Korea 
to invigorate the struggle against the opening of the rice 
market throughout South Korea so as to decisively smash the Kim 
Yong-sam group's anti-national moves and finally defend the rice 
market.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Students, incensed 
against the anti-national opening of agricultural market, 
reportedly assaulted Friday the branches of the "Democratic 
Liberal Party" in Kwangju and Taegu, South Korea, making the Kim 
Yong-sam clique of traitors upset. 
  Hundreds of students in Kwangju staged a fierce 
demonstration 
in front of the South Cholla Provincial branch of the "DLP", 
chanting slogans urging the South Korean authorities not to sign 
the "protocol of Uruguay Round of world trade talks." 
  Meanwhile, students in Taegu staged a demonstration in front 
of the Taegu branch of the "DLP" before occupying its building 
and staging a sit-in. 
  They shouted slogans rejecting the "parliamentary 
ratification" of the final act of the opening of the 
agricultural market and urging the resignation of the Kim 
Yong-sam regime.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- Yoshiyuki Oe, chairman 
of the Japan-Korea Friendship Data Centre and president of the 
S.B.B. Company, Ltd., of Japan, was interviewed by KCNA on April 
14. 
  Recalling that false reports on the nuclear issue of the 
Korean peninsula are set afloat, he said: 
  I consider the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] unfair. 
  Because it is used to put pressure upon the countries which 
are trying to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, ahile 
closing its eyes to some nuclear weapon states including the 
United States. 
  The United States regards those countries which refuse to 
follow its will as enemy states and puts pressure on them. 
  Hence, it is not good. 
  The shipment of Patriot missiles into South Korea by the 
United States and its scheme to resume the "Team Spirit" joint 
military exercises of late are bringing the situation on the 
Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain, driving it to 
the brink of war. 
  Such dangerous moves must be checked without fail.

<F P=106> ["Invariable Aggressive Design of Japanese Militarism"--KCNA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- Japan is trying to 
become a military power and expand its sphere of influence and 
establish domination over Asia and, furthermore, the rest of the 
world with the backing of its military strength, says NODONG 
SINMUN in a signed article today. 
  Noting that the Japanese reactionaries are oblivious of the 
historical lessons from the defeat which they suffered while 
engaging themselves in the aggression and colonial rule in the 
past, and are running along the same road, the article says: 
  This is clearly manifested, first of all, in their attempt 
to 
justify the aggressive crimes committed by old Japan. 
  They allege that their past aggression and war were aimed at 
"saving" and "protecting" Asian countries from the "danger of 
aggression and subjugation" by some others. 
  Their remarks mean that they would repeat the aggression and 
war of old Japan in the future, too, zecause they are not crimes. 
  It is a stark historic fact that old Japan enforced a 
colonial policy toward Korea. The colonial rule of the Japanese 
imperialists over Korea was the most heinous one the like of 
which could not be seen in the world. The Japanese 
reactionaries' attempt to justify it is an outrageous act and a 
mockery of the Korean people. 
  The militarist ambition of the Japanese reactionary circles 
finds its manifestation in their talk about "superiority" of the 
"Yamato nation". Now, the Japanese reactionaries are preaching 
"self- confidence" and "superiority" of the "Yamato nation" to 
instill the idea of overseas expansion and domination over other 
nations into the Japanese people. 
  Their militarist ambition also finds its graphic expression 
in the fact that they are trying to expand the self-defensive 
right of Japan outside its territory, describing preemptive 
attack as an "exercise of Japan' right of self-defence". 
  Their claim to accomplish the "sacred cause" of the "great 
empire of Japan" means to realize their wild ambition of 
domination today. 
  Their much-touted "building of a new Asian order" is also 
intended to establish an order of Japan's domination over Asia. 
  The Japanese reactionaries must renounce the militarist mode 
of thinking and attitude.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Tae-hui, director 
of the international department of the Central Standing 
Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan (Chongnyon), issued a statement on April 13 denouncing the 
Japanese reactionaries who argue that a "countermeasure" with 
regard to the socalled nuclear "suspicion against North Korea" 
must be one of the "basic policies" of the next regime. 
  "Such argument is aimed at intensifying the hostile policy 
toward the DPRK. It can never be overlooked," he said. 
  Expressing resentment at the fact that the Japanese 
reactionaries are joining the United States in the criminal act 
of breaking international faith, and pursuing a hostile policy 
toward the DPRK through a strengthened "international 
cooperation system" of the United States, Japan and South Korea, 
he said: 
  "It is very dangerous that some quarters of the ruling 
coalition are crying for the 'establishment of a crisis control 
system' to cope with 'a case of contingency in Korea' and even 
'an amendment of the law' for the dispatch of the 'self-defence 
forces' to Korea, while describing 'North's nuclear development' 
as a fait accompli. 
  "It is noted in Asian countries, too, that such attitude of 
the Japanese reactionaries means involvement in the increase of 
tension in northeast Asia. 
  "We strongly demand that a next regime of Japan, whatever it 
may be, bear full responsibility for the past colonial rule over 
Korea and rectify the unjust hostile policy toward the DPRK and 
the repressive policy against the Koreans in Japan."

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- A joint statement 
denouncing the West for slandering the DPRK over the fictitious 
nuclear arms development was released on April 13 by G. E. 
Gamza, first secretary of the Amur Regional Committee, V. V. 
Grishukov, first secretary of the Maritime Territorial 
Committee, and L. A. Golub, first secretary of the Khabarovsk 
Territorial Committee, of the Communist Party of the Russian 
Federation, staying in Korea. 
  The joint statement says the smear campaign launched by the 
western media at the instigation of the ruling quarters of 
capitalist countries is aimed at concealing the nuclear ambition 
of the Japanese militarist forces and the South Korean ruling 
quarters which are stepping up the production of nuclear weapons 
in secrecy. 
  Through such vilifications, the aggressive forces of the 
United States, Japan and South Korea are seeking to take the 
edge off the successes made by the Korean people in socialist 
construction under the guidance of the great Comrade Kim 
Il-song, before the world public opinion and to tay a foundation 
for openly destroying the triumphant socialism of Korea, the 
statement charges. 
  It stresses that they would conduct brisk activities for 
rousing the entire far eastern people in Russia to positively 
support and encourage the Korean people's struggle.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- A resolution on Korea 
was adopted recently at the 7th pan-African conference held in 
Kampala, Uganda. 
  The resolution denounces the continued threat and blackmail 
of the United States to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea. 
  It says: 
  The conference is concerned over the scheme of the United 
States of America to venture a military intervention for 
destroying the nuclear development capacity of Korea which is 
being used for a peaceful purpose. 
  The USA must open first its own nuclear facilities to an 
international inspection. This is the only fair and peaceful 
solution for avoiding genocide. 
  The conference denounces the reckless massacre committed by 
the USA in Iraq and demands that it should not repeat this 
mistake in Korea. 
  The 7th pan-African conference also calls upon all the 
countries to promote the peaceful reunification of the Korean 
peninsula, helping the Korean people in the North and the South 
solve the question of reunification by themselves.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- The General Federation 
of Trade Unions of Korea [GFTUKK] and the World Federation of 
Trade Unions [WFTU] published a joint statement here on April 17. 
  According to it, a delegation of the WFTU consisting of its 
Secretary General Alexandr Jarikov and Secretary Debkumar 
Ganguli paid a visit to the Democratic People's Republic of 
Korea from April 12, 1994, at the invitation of the GFTUK. 
  The secretary general of the WFTU, in the name of the 
delegation, congratulated Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader 
of the Korean people and president of the Democratic People's 
Republic of Korea, on his birthday and sincerely wished him good 
health and a long life. 
  The GFTUK noted with high estimation that the WFTU has made 
a 
great contribution to the people's struggle against imperialist 
and neo-colonialist aggression and for freedom and sovereignty 
under the current international situation marked by a manifold 
crisis. 
  The GFTUK also expressed satisfaction with the consistent 
efforts of the Asian and Pacific regional office of the WFTU to 
tighten the relations of friendship and cooperation among the 
trade unions in the Asian and Pacific region on the basis of 
independence. 
  The WFTU delegation got deep impressions everywhere it went, 
witnessing Korean working people under the guidance of the 
Workers' Party of Korea and its leaders making strenuous efforts 
to further consolidate socialism, a society free from domination 
and subjugation, exploitation and oppression, poverty and 
unemployment, the age-old desire of mankind, fighting against 
the U.S. imperialists maneuvers. 
  The WFTU delegation resolutely denounced the deployment of 
Patriot missiles in South Korea, demanded that the U.S. 
authorities give up their intrigues, and urged the United 
Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency not to allow 
their names and authority to be abused. 
  The WFTU delegation reaffirmed its unflinching support to 
the 
stand of the DPRK to turn the Korean peninsula into a 
nuclear-free, peace zone and achieve an independent and peaceful 
reunification of the country by founding the Democratic 
Confederal Republic of Koryo. 
  The GFTUK and WFTU manifested their common stand that all 
the 
peace- and justice-loving anti-imperialist forces should firmly 
unite on the joint front against the ever-increasing imperialist 
and neo-colonialist aggressive policies in order to realize 
democratization of the international community and establish an 
equitable new international economic order. 
  Both sides called upon the world's working class, the most 
active defender of justice and truth and the very one 
immediately responsible for the independent rights and demands 
of the laboring masses, to take the lead in this struggle. 
  Both sides expressed sympathy with the view that the 13th 
WFTU congress would occasion a new turn in developing the WFTU 
into an organization capable of facing up to challenges of the 
changed situation.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- CNN International of 
the United States reported Thursday about the Pyongyang visit of 
former heads of state and government and politicians of 
different countries. 
  It telecast streets of Pyongyang in festive mood, 
Pyongyangites and people on Mansudae Hill. 
  It said Pyongyang seemed to be in a obviously Pacific 
atmosphere with the 82nd birthday of President Kim Il-song being 
celebrated, not to be the capital of a country seeking a war. 
  It also said any tenseness and alertness could not be seen 
in 
the faces of those who gathered on Mansudae Hill to lay bunches 
of flowers before the bronze statue of President Kim Il-song. 
  It noted that faces of people on camera seemed to be easy 
and 
smiling and it was impossible to find out any sign proving that 
their country has been termed as the most dangerous ignition 
point in the world at least. 
  Noting that utterances about a war were exaggerated, it said 
the door of dialogue for a solution to the nuclear crisis was 
still kept open.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- A congratulatory 
message came to the great leader President Kim Il-song today 
from the Central Committee of the South Korean National 
Democratic Front [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) on his birthday. 
  The message says President Kim Il-song founded the chuche 
idea to provide the universal truth of the perfection of man, a 
mighty sword for the transformation of the nature and society 
and has built a powerful socialist state independent, 
self-sustaining and self- reliant in national defence, on the 
land of chuche cultivated by himself. 
  Noting that it is a feat of the century worthy of particular 
note that he has perfectly solved the question of succeeding to 
the revolutionary cause, it stresses that as chuche Korea has 
the leader at its head and is guided by the sagacious leader 
Comrade Kim Chong- il possessed of literary and military 
accomplishments, it has gained a far-flung fame as an invincible 
country with solid, singlehearted unity of the leader, the party 
and the masses and as an ever- victorious country strong enough 
to defeat any aggressor forces at one blow. 
  "Advancing under the bright rays of chuche with the great 
leader as the sun of the nation, Hanminjon and the people of all 
walks of life have been able to steadfastly maintain the 
life-line in shaping the destiny and continue the movement for 
turning the fascist colony into an independent and democratic 
land, without slightest vacillation in spite of the fascist 
suppression and the grim trials and adversities," it says. 
  The message expresses the resolution to hasten the modelling 
of Hanminjon on the chuche idea, invigorate the righteous 
anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle for national salvation and 
activate the reunification movement under the banner of the 
10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation with 
the immortal chuche idea of the great leader and his constant 
view of "believing the people as in heaven" as the motto of the 
life and struggle. 
  It wishes President Kim Il-song good health and long life.

of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on his birthday. 
  The message says the over 80-year-long glorious history of 
the respected leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song is the noblest 
history of the people's leader who has performed great feats 
that will be recorded for ever in golden letters in the history 
of the homeland and in the human history of the struggle for the 
cause of independence. 
  It notes that after embarking on the road of revolution, he 
founded the immortal chuche idea and has victoriously led the 20 
years of the anti-Japanese revolution and the 50 years of 
creation and construction and built a powerful socialist state 
independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in national 
defence, in the country. 
  It stresses that he has successfully solved the question of 
succeeding to the cause of socialism and carrying it to 
completion. 
  "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with brilliant 
intelligence, extraordinary leadership ability and deep love for 
the people has ushered in a great heyday of the cause of chuche, 
developing the chuche idea founded by the respected leader to be 
the guiding idea of the era of independence," it notes. 
  The message says Koreans in Japan, with the honor and pride 
of being overseas citizens of chuche Korea, will make a greater 
contribution to implementing "10-point programme of the great 
unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country" 
put forward by the great leader and achieving the reunification 
in the '90s. 
  It wishes Generalissimo Kim Il-song good health and long 
life.

<F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 15 April editorial: "Our Revolution Which Is </F>
Advancing With the Harmonious Unity of the Leader and People 
Will Always Be Victorious"] 
  [Text] Today in our country the leader [suryong] and 
people are in harmonious unity [honyon ilche] and are 
victoriously advancing the chuche socialist cause. We are 
meaningfully marking the respected and beloved leader's birthday 
at a time when all people's resolve and will to complete the 
socialist cause to the end under the leadership of the party and 
the leader [suryong] have been further consolidated and when the 
honor and dignity of our fatherland, which is advancing under 
the uplifted banner of chuche, are displayed vigorously. 
  Our people and revolutionary people of the world are now 
celebrating the felicitous festival of April with great joys and 
emotion and extending the greatest honor to the great leader 
Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  The respected and beloved leader's birth is the most 
significant historic event in which the people's great sun rose 
and a great festive event never before seen in the long history 
spanning 5,000 years. 
  The proud history, in which our people have demonstrated 
lofty dignity as the masters of their own destinies after being 
united in close ties of kinship with the leader [suryong], and 
our fatherland's brilliant future are linked to this honorable 
day. 
  As time passes and as the revolution advances far, our 
people's hearts are more and more filled with great national 
pride in upholding the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and a 
warm sense of loyalty and filial devotion with which to better 
serve [tojal mosigo] the leader [suryong] and uphold the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership. 
  Throughout the long period from the day when he embarked on 
the revolutionary road, the respected and beloved leader Comrade 
Kim Il- song has devoted himself to promoting the people's 
freedom and happiness. Throughout this long period, only the 
people have existed in the great leader's heart, and our leader 
[suryong] has always existed in our people's hearts. Today in 
our country this harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] 
and people is being further consolidated into an unbreakable 
one. This gives our people a belief in certain victory and 
boundless strength and firmly guarantees the bright future of 
the cause of socialism of our own style. 
  Harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people 
is the greatest achievement in the Korean revolution and the 
source of the invincible strength of the socialism of our own 
style. A fundamental key to victory in socialist construction 
and confrontation with the imperialists is harmonious unity 
between the leader [suryong] and the people. The leader 
[suryong] is the popular masses' top brain [choego noesu] and 
the leader [yongdoja] of the revolution, and the people are the 
masters of revolution and construction and those in charge of 
revolution and construction. 
  The people can display their boundless strength as powerful 
main forces of the revolution, defeat any powerful enemy, and 
vigorously carry out revolution and construction when they 
achieve harmonious unity with the leader [suryong]. 
  From the cultivating period of our revolution up until 
today, 
our people have resolutely waged struggles while upholding the 
great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and strongly uniting around the 
leader [suryong]. 
  The entire history in which our revolution was cultivated 
and 
advanced is brilliant as a proud annals in which harmonious 
unity was achieved between the leader [suryong] and the 
revolutionary warriors and the leader [suryong] and the people 
and in which victories were won based on the strength of such 
unity. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has pointed out: Since 
our revolution began, the Korean communists firmly believed that 
they can cultivate the turbulent road of the revolution only 
when they uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in the 
forefront and walked along the road of struggle and victory 
after overcoming all trials. They have also entrusted their 
entire destinies to the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and 
lived and fought with single- hearted loyalty toward the leader 
[suryong] though they might live even for a moment. 
  The Korean revolution has embarked upon an ardent and 
complicated road ever since its beginning. 
  Since the beginning of Comrade Kim Il-song's revolutionary 
activities, the great leader has always trusted in the people 
and found himself among them leading the revolution. As a 
result, he has unreservedly displayed the qualities and traits 
of the great leader of the people. 
  Thanks to the greatness, prominent leadership traits, and 
lofty personality of the respected and beloved leader [suryong], 
the Korean communists and people have been able to forecast the 
victory of the revolution, as well as their future and have been 
able to trust and follow him as the savior of their destinies. 
  The great leader [suryong] believes in the people and the 
latter trust and follow him. The bonds between the leader 
[suryong] and the people are those of kinship between the father 
and his children. Also, so unbreakable are their bonds that 
make it possible to do anything under any harsh circumstances. 
Thus, from the beginning, our revolution has began with 
harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people and 
has traversed a brilliant course by its might. 
  The harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the 
people is a great driving force that has constantly led our 
revolution and construction to become ever-victorious by 
withstanding the harsh storm of history. 
  The revolution is accompanied by difficulties and trials. 
Because there is the harmonious unity between the leader 
[suryong] and the people, we can boldly defeat any imperialist 
powerful enemy, as well as overcome harsh difficulties under all 
circumstances. This is the truth that has been proven in the 
long and ardent history of our revolution. 
  Our people had no other choice but to pioneer their 
destinies 
by confronting other powerful enemies all the time under the 
most disadvantageous and ardent situations. In this harsh 
course, there was once a difficult time that determines the 
destiny of the revolution, as well as periods in which we should 
carry out the vast and heavy tasks. However, we have been able 
to embark upon the single road of victory all the time without 
the slightest faltering as a result of the invincible unity and 
cohesion of our people who are firmly united around the 
respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song. 
  Whenever we have a difficult time, the respected and beloved 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song has trusted our people and solved all 
problems with them. Also, our people have fought against 
enemies by entrusting their destines to the leader [suryong], 
thus respecting him. 
  If we had not had the harmonious unity, in which the leader 
[suryong] and the people are firmly united, we would not have 
defeated the imperialists during the two rounds of wars against 
them, nor smashed [punswae] enemies' plots, nor effected the 
great upsurge of Chollima during the difficult period of the 
postwar, nor established the socialist power -- independent, 
self-reliant, and self-defensive -- on this land. 
  Experience shows that the harmonious unity between the 
leader 
[suryong] and the people have a boundless might that makes it 
possible to defeat all powerful enemies and to effect a greater 
upturn in the socialist construction. The harmonious unity 
between the leader [suryong] and the people is a great might in 
resolutely safeguarding and adhering to socialism of our own 
style today. 
  We are now carrying out the revolution and construction by 
acutely confronting the imperialists. The imperialists are now 
viciously maneuvering to isolate and crush [apsal] our country 
-- a fortress of socialism -- throughout all areas, such as 
politics, military affairs, the economy, and diplomacy. The 
single-hearted unity between the leader [suryong], the party, 
and the masses are, however, further strengthened. 
  Now, our party and the revolutionary ranks have cherished a 
firm faith that one will surely win a victory only if one 
vigorously fights on under the leadership of the dear leader 
Comrade Kim Chong- il, thus upholding the great leader Comrade 
Kim Il-song. Our people today are the invincible people who 
have a firm faith and determination to endlessly share their 
destinies with the leader [suryong], thus cherishing deep in 
their hearts the greatness of their leader [suryong]. 
  Because all people are firmly united around the leader 
[suryong] and the leader [yongdoja] with their burning faith to 
resolutely safeguard their leader [suryong] and their leader 
[yongdoja], we have boldly smashed [chippusida] any threat, 
blackmail, and maneuvers of aggression by the imperialists and 
have firmly safeguarded the socialist feats, as well as the 
nation's dignity and honor. This is a great demonstration of 
the invincible might displayed by the harmonious unity between 
the leader [suryong] and the people. 
  It is the great pride of the Korean communist movement to 
have established the harmonious unity between the leader and the 
people early in the opening-up period of our revolution and to 
have advanced the revolution and construction with the might of 
the unity. 
  The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the 
people that has highly been displayed in our revolution lies, 
above all, in the fact that the leader and the people have 
become a community bound firmly together into a single life by 
common fate. 
  The leader and the people are linked with each other by 
common fate. In the revolutionary struggle, the leader is the 
pioneer and protector of the people's destinies, and the people 
are an invincible fortress that protects and defends the leader. 
The revolutionary rank can demonstrate its limitless strength 
when relations between the leader and the people are not only 
those between a leader and his followers, but also those linked 
by blood, in which they share life and death. 
  The whole course of the arduous and well-tried Korean 
revolution is literally a course in which the leader and the 
people have struggled while sharing sorrow and joy and 
entrusting their destinies and future to each other. 
  The respected and beloved leader has trusted the 
revolutionary fighters and the people from his heart and 
regarded their destinies as his own, saying that always only a 
true heart can fuse our blood and the people's blood in an 
artery, while the people have absolutely trusted, resolutely 
protected, and defended the leader as the center of their lives 
and as their supreme head [choego noesu]. 
  The Korean revolutionaries and people have fought by 
devoting 
their lives without hesitation to shield the respected and 
beloved leader against the enemy's bombshell with their hearts. 
This is their lofty trait. 
  This exalted ideological and spiritual world can be 
personified only by faithful revolutionaries who identify not 
only their faith, will, ideology, and emotion but also their 
private thoughts with their leader's. This trait was the 
ideological and spiritual source of the creation and 
consolidation of the inseparable, harmonious unity between the 
leader and the people. 
  The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is leading the people 
along the single road of socialism today, too, holding the 
responsibility of their destinies to the last, and the people 
are fighting with a firm faith to entrust their destinies to the 
party and the leader and to follow them to the end of the world. 
Because of this identity of fate, the harmonious unity between 
the leader and the people has constantly been consolidated and 
developed in our country. 
  The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the 
people also lies in the fact that they are a community bound 
together by common ideology and will. The most important tie 
that links the leader and the people is the identity of 
ideology. When the leader elucidates the victorious course of 
the revolution and renders ideological leadership, the people 
come to uphold the leader as their teacher and firmly unite 
themselves based on his ideology. 
  Since the creation of the immortal chuche idea by the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song in an early stage through a 
scientific envisagement of the demand of the times and the 
people's desire, our people have stoutly struggled with this 
revolutionary idea as a firm faith and as the only banner of 
unity. In those days of the struggle, our people learned by 
keen experience that they can achieve the prosperity of the 
fatherland and the victory of the revolution only by fighting 
along the road indicated by the respected and beloved leader, 
and they have upheld the leader as their great teacher. 
  The linkage between the leader and the people has been 
guaranteed by the ideological identity of sharing will and 
destinies based on the chuche idea. Today, thanks to the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who has constantly developed to 
complete the chuche idea, our people's ideological identity is 
being consolidated even further. 
  Our party and the revolutionary ranks are the community of 
chuche-type revolutionaries -- who struggle with the leader's 
revolutionary ideology, the chuche idea, as a firm faith -- 
bound together by ideology and will. All party members and 
working people breathe, speak, and act only in conformity with 
our party's ideology and will. 
  When the party and the leader present a new line or policy, 
the entire party and all people rise as one to live and struggle 
according only to it. Thus, the harmonious unity between the 
leader and the people has limitless strength. 
  The might of the harmonious unity between the leader and the 
people also lies in the fact that it has been succeeded, 
developed, and consolidated through generations so as to 
consummate the socialist cause. 
  Blood unity between the leader [suryong] and the people 
was and is very important and will be all the more important. 
The people wage struggles after strongly uniting around the 
leader [suryong] in order to complete the revolution to the end. 
As the revolution deepens and develops today in our country, 
harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and the people is 
being further consolidated. 
  The entire party, all the people, and the entire Army are 
vigorously fighting after strongly uniting around the dear 
leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. It shows that the harmonious unity 
between the leader [suryong] and the people, which was formed 
and consolidated and developed historically, has eternal 
vitality and is brilliantly inherited. Through their actual 
experiences and realities all party members and workers have 
come to have the belief that they can enjoy worthwhile and happy 
lives and complete the socialist cause to the end when they 
uphold the dear comrade leader. They also entrust their entire 
destinies to the party and the leader [suryong]. As a result, 
our revolutionary rank takes pride in the fact that it is an 
invincible combatant rank that has achieved strong unity based 
on a single goal and aspiration and a single idea and will and 
advances to complete the chuche cause. The noble revolutionary 
spirit, with which this rank is filled, is the revolutionary 
belief and strong will that the rank, just like the fallen 
anti-Japanese revolutionaries who fought by even unhesitatingly 
risking their lives to resolutely defend the great leader, 
upholds the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and fights forever. 
Thanks to this, harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] 
and the people highly demonstrates its boundless might in our 
country as time goes by. This provides our fatherland and 
revolution with bright prospects. 
  When we recall the long history of the communist movement, 
the most solid harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] and 
the people is achieved only in the Korean revolution, which is 
led by the great leader. A crucial key to the achievement of 
this invincible unity is the greatness and nobleness of the 
ideas, leadership, and virtue of the respected and beloved 
leader, the great father [widaehan oboi] of our party members 
and workers and our fellow countrymen. 
  The source of the solidity of our harmonious unity is the 
respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's idea of 
believing in the people as in heaven. The idea of believing in 
the people as in heaven, an idea that one considers the people 
to be heaven, is an opinion and motto that the great leader 
cherishes in the entire course of revolution and construction. 
The chuche idea's profound principle that one considers the 
popular masses to be the masters of revolution and construction 
and relies on their strength comes from idea of believing in the 
people as in heaven. The chuche-oriented theories and 
leadership methods also come from this idea. 
  In resolving any issues concerning revolution and 
construction, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has given 
priority to the people's interests, had their aspirations and 
demands reflected on all lines and policies, and made all 
efforts to implement those aspirations and demands. The idea of 
believing in the people as in heaven is reflected on all lines 
and policies Kim Il-song presented historically, from the lines 
on building the party, the country, and the Army, which he 
presented at the early stage of building new society, and to the 
party's revolutionary economic strategy today. 
  The revolutionary strategies and tactics which the great 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song present for the sake of the popular 
masses; the people-oriented policies; the favors which the party 
and the leader [suryong] do each family and each individual on 
an equal basis give rise to the people's absolute trust for the 
party and the leader [suryong] and strongly connect the party 
and the people in a single artery. 
  Just like the idea of believing in the people as in heaven 
is 
eternal, our solid harmonious unity which was achieved based on 
this great idea will not shake. The most solid blood ties 
between the leader [suryong] and the people were formed in our 
country because the achievements which the respected and beloved 
leader has brought about in the struggle for the popular masses' 
cause of independence are great. 
  A great leader [yongdoja] wins respect and trust from the 
people not because someone stands him in front; he does so 
because of his own achievements. Numerous boundlessly difficult 
and massive tasks never before seen in history were presented in 
our people's struggle for sovereignty and independence. In the 
long revolutionary course, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
has led every stage and type of struggle to victory in order to 
carry out the cause of independence in our era. And, in this 
process, he has brought about immortal achievements, which will 
remain brilliant forever in the history of mankind, in 
political, economic, political, and cultural fields and all the 
other fields. 
  The achievements of building the chuche-type party and the 
people's government, which responsibly take care of the popular 
masses' destinies; the achievements of building the people's 
genuine revolutionary armed forces, which defend the people's 
freedom and happiness; the achievements of raising our people 
into revolutionary people who have a strong sense of 
independence; the achievements of building popular 
masses-centered socialism of our own style in this land where 
only backwardness and poverty prevailed; and all the other 
achievements which the respected and beloved leader has brought 
about win admiration from all people. 
  The history of any other country in the East or West or in 
the past or present age has not seen a leader [yongdoja] like 
our respected and beloved leader, who has brought all historic 
achievements for the people as best as he can and raised the 
people's position to the peak of the era. 
  The achievements which the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song 
has brought about are immortal achievements which he has brought 
about for the people while riding out the road of arduous 
struggle with the people. 
  In bringing about these achievements, the respected and 
beloved leader has faced all hardships that a revolutionary may 
face and has overcome trials and difficulties. 
  During the days of the anti-Japanese struggle, he personally 
took the lead in the arduous march to break through the line of 
death and find a way out; after the liberation, he first 
embarked on the road toward building the country; and today, 
when he is over 80 years old, is giving on-the-spot guidance to 
plants and enterprises and farms across the country and devoting 
himself to giving greater happiness to our people. This 
devotion to and sleepless and restless efforts for the 
fatherland and people by the respected and beloved leader is 
incomparable to anyone else's. Therefore, every time they think 
of the great leader's achievements for them, our people 
consolidate their determination to better serve the leader 
[suryong] with loyalty, devotion, and single-mindedness. 
  The most solid harmonious unity between the leader [suryong] 
and the people was achieved in our country because the respected 
and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song's virtue is great and 
because his people-oriented trait is boundlessly noble. 
  A great politician has noble virtue, and the people become 
happy because of such a virtue. The respected and beloved 
leader's politics is the politics of love and trust and that of 
virtue. 
  The great leader, who started the revolution by winning 
comrades, has not hesitated to face any hardship if it were for 
his comrades and people, considered having many comrades to be 
the most important asset, and considered winning love and trust 
from the people to be the greatest happiness. In this way, he 
has written the most beautiful annals of revolutionary 
comradeship and human love. 
  Millions of members of our party rank were raised amid the 
respected and beloved leader's revolutionary comradeship and 
human love, and single-hearted unity was achieved in the entire 
society in which all people are strongly united based on 
comradely love and revolutionary moral obligation. 
  The respected and beloved leader's is a great bosom that 
amazes all people and leads them into a single worthwhile 
revolutionary road. 
  The boundless love in trusting anyone who has embarked on a 
revolutionary road and leading him to a worthwhile struggle; the 
boundless magnanimity in embracing even those who have different 
political views, religions, or classes and leading them to a 
noble patriot road; and the generosity in leading even those who 
have committed mistakes on a revolutionary road to make a fresh 
start and responsibly taking care of their destinies to the end: 
This is the nature of the great leader. 
  Captivated by this character of the great leader Comrade Kim 
Il- song, who is a human being of human beings and a politician 
of politicians, the revolutionary warriors follow him, the 
people follow him, and all fellow countrymen follow him. 
  The respected and beloved leader, who is best in ideology, 
best in achievements, and best in virtue, is truly the eternal 
sun for the survival of our people and nation. 
  Today our people have an honorable and rewarding task of 
further solidifying the ties of kinship with their leader 
[suryong] and their leader [yongdoja] and vigorously 
accelerating the general onward march of our-style socialism 
with the might of wholehearted unity. 
  The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has noted: We should 
attach the greatest importance to the unity and cohesion of the 
party and the popular masses, strengthen and develop it onto a 
higher plane, and make the party a mighty party taking deeper 
root in the popular masses. 
  The wholehearted unity of the leader, the party, and the 
people has been and will be the life line of our style socialism 
and the ever-victorious banner. We must make the road of our 
revolution's onward march a history of the strongest ties of 
kinship between the leader [suryong] and the people and between 
the leader [yongdoja] and the fighter. To do this, all the 
party members and working people should, above all, unite around 
the party and the leader with the great pride in being blessed 
with the happiness of having the leader. 
  The greatest happiness of the people is enjoying the 
leadership of the great leader [widaehan suryong] who has 
brilliant wisdom, outstanding leadership, and noble virtue. 
Their greatest misfortune is having a wrong leader [kajang kun 
purhaengun yongdojarul chalmot mannanungosida]. This is well 
proven by the long history of the international communist 
movement and today's reality. Socialism, which was built over 
decades, fell in many countries, and the people in those 
countries are in distress. The fundamental cause of this was 
that they did not have the leader who is faithful to the cause 
of socialism and the people. 
  Our people are a proud people who have always lived enjoying 
the tested leadership of the great leader [suryong] and the 
great leader [yongdoja] throughout the entire period of the 
revolution and construction. Upholding the respected and 
beloved Comrade Kim Il-song, our people have been able to 
display their glory of a great people who have traversed the 
road of independence and socialism without deviation. Upholding 
the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, they are able to display 
their pride in being a happy people inheriting and completing 
the cause of the revolution most brilliantly. 
  The greatest blessing our people enjoy is the blessing of 
having the leader. Greeting the festive 15 April holiday, we 
must bear this happiness deeper in our hearts and renew our 
resolve to devote ourselves to the party and the leader with 
utmost loyalty and filial duty. 
  We must have a firm faith that we will never fail to be 
victorious because we have the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il--the general of generals who is skilled in both 
literary and military arts and tames a fierce head wind--as the 
great leader [yongdoja] of our party and people and as the 
supreme commander of the revolutionary armed forces, and crush 
any maneuvers of the imperialists resolutely with a 
revolutionary offensive. 
  Because we are blessed with the happiness of having the 
leader, we must be loyal and dutiful to the leader. The faith 
in and the revolutionary volition to the leader--this is a warm 
conscience not forgetting the benevolence of the leader who has 
brought us up as a revolutionary and who has given us true life, 
and it is a firm revolutionary principle of not deserting our 
pledge to the leader even in a solitary island in the distant 
sea or on a guillotine. The ties of kinship with our leader are 
more firmly connected and unbreakable by this faith and fidelity. 
  All the party members and working people must not only 
cherish their loyalty to the great leader and the dear comrade 
leader as their firm faith but make it their conscience, 
morality, and life so that they can firmly prepare themselves to 
be loyalists and dutiful children not knowing any change of mind. 
  Resolutely adhering and adding luster to our-style 
socialism, 
which was built by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and led 
by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is the loftiest duty of 
all the party members and working people. In the superior 
chuche socialist system and in all the gains of the revolution 
built in this land are the labors of the respected and beloved 
leader Comrade Kim Il-song which he devoted in the long and 
arduous path of the revolution, as well as the blood and 
perspiration of the revolutionary martyrs who were boundlessly 
loyal to the leader. No matter what complicated situation may 
be created against us and no matter what trials may overtake us, 
we can never give up these gains or allow them to be damaged. 
  With unswerving confidence in the correctness and future 
of the chuche-based socialist cause pioneered on our own, all 
the people should more firmly bear the revolutionary 
determination to follow the road of socialism to the end under 
the leadership of respected and beloved supreme commander 
General Kim Chong-il. 
  All the party members and working people should invariably 
implement revolutionary lines and principles, including the line 
of three revolutions, construction of self-reliant national 
economy, and the military line of self-reliance which have been 
consistently adhered to by the great leader and the comrade dear 
leader, and should further vigorously accelerate the general 
march movement of socialism of our own style. 
  We should manifest the might of socialism of our own style 
to 
the whole world by marking a new advance in the struggle to 
implement the party's revolutionary economic strategy while 
highly displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and 
fortitude. Consolidating our party and people's single-hearted 
unity centered around the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il into 
an impregnable fortress is a firm guarantee for inheriting and 
completing the chuche-based socialist cause to the end. 
  All functionaries and party members should inherit our 
revolution's tradition of single-hearted unity, always bear in 
mind the great leader's teaching that we should strengthen 
reunification and cohesion with the dear leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il as the center, and regard the teaching as a firm 
guidance to all party works and activities. 
  As did the anti-Japanese revolutionary martyrs, who had the 
great Comrade Hanbyol as the center of the cohesion and 
leadership and staunchly defended him in the past, we should 
defend our destiny and defender Comrade Kim Chong-il as bullets 
and gun shells to the end. 
  We should strengthen the ranks' principal cohesion based on 
the faithfulness toward the party and the leader and 
revolutionary comradeship, and make our society a big family 
with the great leader and the dear leader as our father, and 
develop it as a warm society where everyone helps and leads each 
other as real brothers. 
  More than 80 years have passed since the great sun rose in 
the dark sky of Korea. What our people have invariably kept in 
their minds during the meaningful days when the most significant 
incidents of the 20th century took place is the enthusiastic 
wish to uphold the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song for 
thousands and tens of thousands of years until the sun and the 
moon vanish. 
  Our people's respect grows as more new records are added to 
the chronicle of the chuche cause. With the great pride and 
self- confidence of upholding the great leader Comrade Kim 
Chong-il -- the most experienced leader of our times -- our 
people will vigorously fight on to complete the chuche-based 
socialist cause. 
  Our revolutionary cause, which is vigorously advancing with 
the harmonious unity between the great leader and the great 
people, is forever victorious and indomitable.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said Monday that North Korea would not defy world opinion as 
expressed in a recent statement by the U.N. Security Council 
president, nor would it dare any military provocations in the 
face of joint South Korean- U.S. security arrangements. 
  Addressing the opening session of the 43rd annual conference 
of the Pacific-Asia Travel Association [PATA] at the Korea 
exhibition center, Kim predicted South Korea would join the 
family of developed nations "as a new member before the 20th 
century is out," stressing the country's march "into a better 
tomorrow will never falter." 
  "The Korean people are full of confidence and energy despite 
North Korea's nuclear arms development and its capacity for all 
other kinds of irrational behavior," he added. 
  Welcoming delegates from 40 countries, Kim noted the 
Asia-Pacific is taking center stage: "Nations in this region are 
now pulling together to forge an era of concord and cooperation, 
putting to rest their past enmity and confrontation. In 
response, the Republic of Korea has also been striving to 
promote the shared prosperity of this part of the world, working 
especially through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
forum. 
  "The Republic of Korea has realized almost miraculous 
development and has overcome numerous adversities stemming in 
particular from the tragic partitioning of its land. In a 
single generation, it has managed to turn itself into an Asian 
model of democracy and a market economy. Especially since I 
took office, our country has wiped out the vestiges of our dark 
past while... promoting internationalization... and creating a 
society free of misconduct and corruption, a healthy society in 
which freedom and justice flourish. Our economy is regaining 
vitality, and a new dynamism is pervading all sectors of 
society." 
  Kim, saying tourism is helping to narrow the economic gap 
between developed and developing nations by promoting 
cooperation, expressed hope that the Seoul PATA conference would 
provide "a major impetus to international cooperation to 
underpin this new era of openness, as well as open up new 
horizons for the travel industry in the 21st century."

  [Text] New York, April 15 (YONHAP) -- North Korea's top 
leader Kim Il-song flatly denied possessing or thinking of 
possessing nuclear weapons in a press conference with Western 
reporters Friday. 
  He said he wants to visit the United States to do some 
hunting, fishing and to "make friends." 
  The 82-year-old ruler of the most isolated nation of the 
world said anyone who wants a war on the Korean peninsula must 
be out of his mind, adding his country will never use nuclear 
weapons against Koreans. 
  Parts of his two and half hour press conference was 
broadcast 
on Cable News Network (CNN) whose Beijing bureau chief Mike 
Chinoy was among the Western press group that went into North 
Korea to report on Kim's birthday April 15. 
  He reacted with irritation when asked about North Korea's 
suspected nuclear program, saying the international community 
demands to see nuclear weapons that North Korea simply doesn't 
have. 
  It's useless to own nuclear weapons, Kim said in the press 
conference, North Korea doesn't have the delivery system to 
launch such weapons, and his country is too small to attempt 
nuclear tests. 
  But other than denying any nuclear development, Kim made no 
reference to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s demands 
for additional inspection on the North Korean nuclear complex. 
  Kim described how he was proud of his heir-apparent son Kim 
Chong-il and denied reports of his failing health, saying he is 
in good condition.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The head of the North 
Korean delegation to the eighth round of inter-Korean 
working-level talks will likely be relieved of his post due to 
trouble caused by his remarks at talks threatening to turn Seoul 
into a "sea of fire," South Korean Government officials said 
Sunday. 
  Pak Yong-su, also deputy director (vice-minister level) of 
the Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of 
the Fatherland, has been in an awkward position since the threat 
triggered international criticism. 
  Pak's position was seemingly worsened by Seoul's withdrawal 
of its demand for an envoy exchange, the officials said. 
  "We saw Pak trying to make his ability acknowledged by the 
North Korean leadership during the eighth round of inter-Korean 
talks," they said. "The only way for Pak to survive seems to be 
proving his value once another round of working-level talks 
resumes." 
  The officials added, however, "It is not likely that he will 
survive because we are not pursuing the exchange of envoys." 
  North Korean officials have recently tried to appease the 
international community, with Workers' Party Secretary Kim 
Yong-sun explaining that Pak's remarks were made out of 
excitement. Moreover, one of the other delegates to the meeting 
said on a Pyongyang talk show that Pak's remarks had been 
distorted by the South.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S. 
officials reaffirmed Monday that Washington will not hold 
further high-level dialogue with North Korea unless the latter 
allows satisfactory international nuclear inspections. 
  The inspection deadline is early May as indicated in last 
month's U.N. Security Council presidential statement, Kim 
Sam-hun, South Korea's ambassador on North Korean nuclear 
affairs, said after meeting his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci 
in high-level consultations here. 
  The two sides also reaffirmed the principle that 
inter-Korean 
dialogue is indispensable to fully clearing up the nuclear 
problem. 
  "The most immediate issue is getting North Korea to accept 
additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
(IAEA)," Kim told reporters after nearly three hours of talks. 
  The next Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks will be the 
final opportunity to resolve the nuclear dispute, the ambassador 
said. "The South Korean and U.S. Governments are ready to 
discuss North Korea's interests and demands in the political, 
security and economic fields related to improving relations once 
the nuclear obstacle is out of the way." 
  Kim suggested adjustments in the North Korean-U.S. "small 
package deal" that included suspension of this year's "Team 
Spirit" military exercise that Seoul and Washington stage 
annually. 
  South Korea and the United States announced earlier the 
maneuvers would be cancelled this year on condition that North 
Korea allowed full nuclear checks. 
  "We can't say that the entire agreement is void, but 
adjustments are inevitable," said Kim. 
  Gallucci, assistant secretary of State who was appointed 
chairman of the newly established U.S. senior policy steering 
group on Korea, flew into Seoul on Sunday. 
  The consultations came immediately after Seoul announced 
last 
week that it would no longer demand inter-Korean dialogue as a 
precondition for the third round of North Korean-U.S. 
high-level talks. 
  Kim was at pains to emphasize that Seoul has not given up on 
inter-Korean channels. 
  "The two countries confirmed the principle that the issues 
of 
the Korean peninsula, including the nuclear situation, have to 
be solved through inter-Korean dialogue," said Kim. 
  "We agreed that while South-North Korean and North 
Korean-U.S. talks should be harmonized, the two channels must be 
managed as complementary," he said. 
  But future South-North dialogue "will have to carry 
substance 
and be meaningful," he said. "The dialogue will be aimed 
specifically at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula." 
  The timing and format of the dialogue are under negotiation 
between Seoul and Washington, he said, citing the inter-Korean 
Joint Nuclear Control Commission and prime ministers' talks as 
possible examples. 
  The ambassador denied speculation that Washington may hold 
the next high-level meeting with Pyongyang just on North Korea's 
promise to permit further IAEA inspections. 
  "There must be full and complete additional inspections by 
the IAEA," he said. 
  Kim referred to the March 31 statement by the Security 
Council president which asked the IAEA to report back to the 
council on North Korea's nuclear program in a few weeks, which 
is tacitly understood as early May. 
  "You can assume that the period mentioned in the statement 
is, in actuality, the deadline," he said.

  [Text] It was learned that the ROK and the United States 
held high-level talks on 18 April to deal with the North Korean 
nuclear issue. 
  In the talks, the two sides reaffirmed their previous 
position on the immediate resumption of the third round of the 
U.S.-North Korean talks if North Korea accepts additional 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  Yi Kang-tok reports: 
  [Begin Yi recording] Today, Kim Sam-hun, our side's nuclear 
ambassador, and his U.S. counterpart Robert Gallucci held 
high-level talks to deal with the nuclear issue and held the 
same view that the third round of the U.S.-North Korean talks 
would be held only after realizing additional inspections of 
North Korea's nuclear facilities. 
  The two countries agreed to seek sanctions through the UN 
Secretary Council if North Korea fails to accept additional 
inspections by next month. 
  Since the UN Secretary Council president's statement called 
for dialogue among countries concerned, the two sides also 
agreed to resume the U.S.-North Korean working-level talks in 
New York if North Korea first proposes contacts. 
  They shared the same view that inter-Korean talks are 
necessary for the realization of the joint declaration on the 
denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. However, they agreed 
to set the date for resumption of the inter-Korean dialogue 
after watching the developments of the nuclear issue, including 
the resumption of U.S.- North Korean high-level talks. 
  In particular, the two countries have decided to have close 
consultations on specific items to be discussed in U.S.-North 
Korean talks, which will take place if North Korea allows 
additional inspections. 
  In today's talks, the two sides decided to resume the Team 
Spirit joint exercise in the event the North Korean nuclear 
issue continues to experience rough sailing and to map out 
detailed measures when U.S. Defense Secretary visits Seoul on 19 
April. [end recording]

  [Text] Pusan, South Korea, April 18 (YONHAP) -- Two U.S. 
Navy transport ships carrying Patriot missiles arrived in the 
southeastern port of Pusan on Monday [18 April]. 
  The 13,000-ton "Comet" and 16,460-ton "Meteor" left the U.S. 
Navy Base in Oakland bound for Pusan on March 23, with an 
undisclosed number of Patriot launch pads and other equipment 
aboard. 
  These missiles, in addition to others due to arrive sometime 
in the future, are expected to be deployed at military bases 
here by April 29, military officials said. 
  The Patriot anti-missile missiles are a more advanced 
version 
than those used during the Gulf war in 1991. 
  A military official said, "the Patriot anti-missile missiles 
will considerably reinforce the air defense capability here. It 
is the most effective defense system against possible air 
attack."

<F P=106> [Article by Chang Yong-sop] </F>
  [Text] Washington, April 15 (YONHAP) -- Now that South 
Korea has withdrawn the proposed inter-Korean exchange of 
special envoys as a prerequisite to the third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks, attention is focusing on 
whether Seoul's initiative will provide a clue to solving the 
nuclear question. 
  It may be premature to jump to conclusions but cautious 
expectations are being voiced in Washington that because of the 
move, working-level U.S.-North Korean talks may resume around 
next weekend to discuss additional inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
  In fact, a few signs backing up such expectations have 
trickled out of the communist country in recent days. 
  One was Western press representatives' invitation to North 
Korea for the April 15 birthday of President Kim Il-song, aged 
82. 
  The invitees included correspondents from CNN-TV and the 
WASHINGTON TIMES in the United States and Japan's NHK-TV. 
  The invitation was taken by North Korea watchers as a 
conciliatory gesture by the normally intransigent North Koreans. 
  In an interview with CNN-TV, Kim Yong-sun, a Workers' 
(communist) Party secretary involved in inter-Korean affairs, 
said, "We do not want a war and are prepared to return to the 
table of dialogue." 
  Kim then tried to tone down the inflammatory remark, "in a 
war Seoul will be turned into a sea of fire," made by the chief 
North Korean delegate to a recent inter-Korean working-level 
meeting at Panmunjom. 
  It was this statement that prompted Seoul and Washington to 
take hasty steps to ship sophisticated defensive weaponry to 
South Korea. 
  Diplomatic sources here observe that once Kim Il-song's 
birthday celebrations are over, North Korea may renew dialogue 
with the United States as a face-saving tactic. 
  The sources say that North Korea is well aware of the 
early-May deadline for its acceptance of additional inspections 
and that it would face harsher pressure if it failed to heed the 
deadline. 
  One source said, however, that even if working-level talks 
resumed late next week, rough sailing would await the two sides 
before they could manage to hammer out an agreement on 
additional checks. 
  The North Koreans are likely to continue demanding that 
working- level Washington-Pyongyang talks precede additional 
checks, while the United States will maintain that a full 
inspection of all declared facilities should occur before any 
talks with North Korea. 
  State Department Spokesman Mike Mccurry made it clear at a 
press briefing Friday that no further U.S.-North Korean talks 
would take place before inspections have ensured the continuity 
of nuclear safeguards in North Korea. 
  In other words, Washington's strategy is to address the 
issue 
of inspecting undeclared North Korean facilities at a third 
meeting by winding up the question of looking into declared 
sites before the talks open. 
  North Korea's plan, on the other hand, is to obtain the 
maximum possible concessions from the United States by using the 
card of additional inspections of its declared facilities.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
editorials carried by ROK vernacular newspapers on 16 April on 
the ROK Government's withdrawal of the demand for an exchange of 
envoys before the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Aftermath of the Abandonment of the Proposal 
that Special Envoys Be Exchanged Before U.S.-North Korean Talks." 
  The editorial reports that the exchange of special envoys 
was 
"not an idea from which one can expect much." It then writes: 
"We must be wary of the possibility that U.S.-North Korean 
talks will proceed toward the direction of turning a blind eye 
to North Korea's possible possession of one or two nuclear 
weapons." 
  The editorial continues: "If U.S.-North Korean talks are 
held as a result of the ROK Government's abandonment of the 
proposal that special envoys be exchanged before U.S.-North 
Korean talks, those talks must provide ways to ensure the 
transparency of the North Korean nuclear issue." It concludes: 
"We must show North Korea that its efforts toward a military 
buildup in the post-cold war era will only hasten its own 
destruction." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "Abandonment of the Exchange of Special 
Envoys and the Reformulation of Policies." 
  The editorial reports that from the beginning the special 
envoy exchange plan was unrealistic and inefficient and that 
even if the North and South had exchanged special envoys, those 
envoys would have merely been busy visiting the North and South. 
  The editorial continues: "The ROK Government must 
consolidate cooperative relations with the United States and 
propose North-South dialogue to North Korea, separately from 
U.S.-North Korean negotiations, to resume the operation of the 
North-South Joint Nuclear Control Committee to ensure that the 
North and South pursue mutual inspections and achieve the 
denuclearization of this region." The editorial continues that 
the "ROK Government must boldly allow North-South economic 
cooperation" if North Korea accepts inspections from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and special inspections of 
its two unreported facilities. 
  The pro-government SEOUL SINMUN carries on page 3 an 
800-word 
editorial entitled "We Must Lead North Korea to Dialogue." 
  The editorial describes the government's abandonment of the 
special envoy plan as an "important change" in the policy toward 
North Korea. The editorial writes that the abandonment of the 
special envoy plan can serve as an "efficient means to pressure 
North Korea," adding: "This is because this may warn North 
Korea that if it rejects reforms and opening up and pursues its 
nuclear program, its system can be shaken entirely. It is 
important for us to find means to lead North Korea to beg for 
dialogue with South Korea." 
  The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word 
editorial entitled "North Korea Must Take Corresponding 
Measures." 
  The editorial first writes that the government's abandonment 
of the special envoy plan can serve as a "breakthrough in 
resolving the North Korean nuclear issue." It then asks the 
related government ministries to realize that North Korea's 
"ultimate goal is to buy time to develop nuclear weapons, rather 
than merely using the nuclear card in diplomacy." The editorial 
concludes: "As long as the reason we abandoned the exchange of 
special envoys is clear, North Korea must take corresponding 
measures as a matter of course. It must unconditionally receive 
additional inspections by early May as demanded by the UN 
Security Council president's statement. It must no longer try 
to get concessions from the United States and leave South Korea 
out in the cold."

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- North Korea has again 
proposed a grand national meeting that smacks of a mass rally in 
an effort to solve inter-Korean problems. 
  The proposal was made by Supreme People's Assembly 
(parliament) Speaker Yang Hyong-sop at a meeting of government 
and political party leaders held in Pyongyang on April 11. Yang 
offered to hold a grand national meeting in Seoul or Pyongyang 
on Aug. 15, the 49th anniversary of Korea's liberation from 
Japanese rule, to discuss ways of achieving grand national unity. 
  Among the big shots taking part in the April 11 meeting were 
Premier Kang song-san, Vice Premier Kim Pyong-sik and Workers' 
(Communist) Party Secretary Kim Yong-sun, to name but a few, 
according to the official North Korea watcher here, NAEWOE press. 
  Yang also proposed that invitations be sent to leaders of 
the 
government, political parties and social organizations in South 
Korea as well as well-known Koreans overseas asking them to come 
to the grand national meeting. 
  The proposed meeting, in its style and agenda, is similar to 
the all-Koreans' sessions the North Koreans have proposed in 
their propaganda offensive against South Korea over the years. 
  Yang, saying the meeting should discuss achieving unity 
among 
all Koreans for national reunification, proposed the creation of 
a preparatory committee comprising five figures apiece from 
North and South Korea and overseas Korean communities. 
  Pyongyang's fresh offer on a grand national conference is 
considered by many North Korea watchers here as an attempt to 
renew its unification front scheme, with a view toward turning 
its defensive position in inter-Korean relations to its 
advantage. 
  Means of solving such inter-Korean problems as tension over 
the nuclear issue must be discussed at government-level talks. 
But the North Koreans want to hold an all-Koreans' meeting 
smacking of a mass rally in an apparent move to confuse South 
Korea, analysts say. 
  It should be pointed out that the proposal came after North 
Korea ruptured the working-level inter-Korean dialogue on 
exchanging special envoys by threatening to turn Seoul into "a 
sea of flames" if war breaks out. 
  It should also be noted that whenever inter-Korean relations 
reach an impasse, the North Koreans come up with a unification 
front scheme disguised as an all-Koreans' meeting to change the 
situation in their favor. 
  In May 1990, President Kim Il-song presented a five-point 
unification program to the Supreme People's Assembly during its 
plenary session. The program envisioned forming a unification 
front, among other things, widely seen here as a scheme to cause 
social confusion in a South Korea that was then in a fever for 
unification. 
  And in April last year, North Korea's parliament adopted 
President Kim Il-song's 10-point program for national 
unification through grand unity, which also called for a 
unification front. 
  The unification front scheme camouflages the North Korean 
unification strategy to stir up revolution in South Korea. The 
recent grand national conference proposal should be seen in the 
context of this strategy because it came just a year after the 
North Korean parliament adopted the 10-point unification 
program. The proposal is thus seen by many analysts of North 
Korean affairs here as a tactical variation of its unification 
strategy. 
  The proposal may also be regarded as an attempt by the North 
to solve its problems with the South and the United States over 
the nuclear dispute, by seeking a consensus of all Koreans 
around the world on the issue. 
  With the U.N. Security Council-set deadline for additional 
inspections of its nuclear facilities approaching, North Korea 
needs a breakthrough and the grand national meeting proposal may 
be seen as a way out through unofficial dialogue with South 
Korea. 
  Analysts say the North Koreans must feel the all-Koreans' 
meeting will help solve the nuclear issue in their talks with 
the Americans. 
  They observe that Pyongyang will intensify its propaganda 
offensive against Seoul by publicizing its grand national 
conference proposal.

<F P=106> [Article by Yu Yong-ku: "Kim Il-song's Health Deteriorating </F>
With Geriatric Diseases"] 
  [Text] Although North Korean President Kim Il-song, who has 
just turned 82, is still continuing political activities, he is 
suffering from various geriatric diseases. He often falls into 
a comatose state these days, thus signaling a red flag in his 
physical condition. 
  Although President Kim Il-song has boasted to foreign 
visitors that he keeps healthy thanks to his "optimistic outlook 
on life," informed sources, such as those who have recently 
visited North Korea and met President Kim Il-song and Chinese 
medical circles, say that his physical health has been 
deteriorating with each passing day because of various geriatric 
diseases, such as senile dementia, enlargement of the lump on 
the back of his neck, neurotic disorder of the lumbar vertebra, 
heaviness in the chest from a heart pacemaker, and mental 
confusion. 
  When he appeared on the rostrum of the Kumsusan Assembly 
Hall 
in Pyongyang to deliver a New Year's address on 31 December it 
was revealed that he has distinct difficulty in walking 
resulting from retrogressive arthritis. 
  The arthritis causes pain in the area above the hip, so he 
has to be assisted by two or three secret servicemen when he 
climbs up stairs. 
  The most distinct proof of the deterioration of his health 
is 
a speech disorder resulting from senile dementia. While reading 
this year's New Year's address, he made errors and his 
pronunciation was indistinct from a droop in his lower lip. 
These errors and indistinct pronunciation of words occurred 
some 70 times during this year's New Year's address, compared 
with 30 times during his 1993 New Year's address. 
  Because of the senile dementia, his right hand trembles, he 
has difficulty in chewing food, and frequently uses a 
handkerchief to wipe off the area around his mouth. 
  His sight has deteriorated to the extent that he has to read 
documents in large printed letters with reading glasses. The 
hearing in his right ear is so deteriorated that he frequently 
says, "What did you say?" For this reason, when he receives 
foreign visitors, he has Sony Japanese-made speakers installed 
in each seat. 
  The lump on the back of his head, which is an obesity-caused 
tumor, is confirmed to have deteriorated so much that it presses 
against the larynx nerve. 
  The lump is not life-threatening, but an operation to remove 
it is impossible because it is located close to the cranial 
nerve. Some 10 doctors recommended by the CPC performed an 
acupuncture procedure in October 1992, but he still suffers from 
increasing pain from the pressure on the larynx nerve. Because 
of the neurotic disorder of the lumbar vertebra, President Kim 
Il-song has recently reduced the length of his discussions and 
speeches to one hour and half an hour respectively under 
ordinary circumstances. He refrains from traveling by airplane 
or by car on unsurfaced roads, which can adversely affect the 
lumbar vertebra. 
  He also avoids standing or walking for long periods of time. 
He uses a wheel chair when he is at his villa. 
  The degree of his shaking backward and forward while 
standing 
has increased compared with last year, as witnessed by many. 
  In addition, President Kim Il-song, who has cardiovascular 
disease, invited a medical specialist from the former East 
Germany at the end of 1972 to perform an operation to dilate his 
heart blood vessels and to insert a heart pacemaker. In 1987, 
he was operated on again for the insertion of another aid device 
by a French surgical specialist. Since the end of 1991, medical 
doctors from the General Association of Korean Residents in 
Japan have regularly visited North Korea to check his physical 
condition. In February 1992, however, he was unconscious for a 
few minutes, so he received a secret treatment at a villa in 
Chongjin for one month in the middle of September of that year. 
  Meanwhile, with Kim Il-song's health deteriorating with each 
passing day, the North Korean authorities are reported to be 
training those who resemble Kim's appearance and constitution, 
selecting them through an advertisement on "recruiting actors 
for a documentary film" for security and acting training, 
including intonation and walking-style training, to prevent 
confusion that may result after Kim Il-song's death.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) started routine safety checks Monday at 
nuclear power facilities in South Korea. 
  Two IAEA inspectors, A. Bodadilla Muchino of Mexico and I. 
Acquah of Ghana, arrived in Seoul Sunday for a one-week 
inspection of nuclear reactors in Kori, Uljin and Youngkwang, as 
well as nuclear processing facilities. 
  They begin their official duties by examining documents and 
records on management and storage of nuclear fuel and comparing 
them with on-the-spot field studies. 
  They will change the batteries and film of surveillance 
equipment and seal some areas when necessary. Storage of used 
nuclear fuel will also come under investigation. 
  Officials said the IAEA conducts routine inspections every 
two months of the heavy-water reactor at Wolsung and every four 
months of the other eight light-water reactors. 
  The inspectors will first visit the Seoul office of the 
Korea 
Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) to study records on its 
research reactor and management of nuclear fuel. 
  They will then tour the research center at Taeduk science 
town and check KAERI's research facilities and manufacture of 
heavy- water fuel as well as its processing of Australian 
uranium. 
  They also plan to investigate KAERI's light-water fuel 
manufacturing company to check its use and storage of uranium 
imports.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam 
said on Monday that now is a crucial period for national 
security and what is most important in this stage is the morale 
of the armed forces. "A high military morale springs from 
courage, confidence and hope. You military leaders should be 
clean-handed and imposing if only to earn love and trust from 
people," Kim said. 
  The president, the supreme military commander, made the 
remarks while meeting at Chongwadae [presidential office] a 
group of senior Army and Air Force officers who were reassigned 
in Saturday's reshuffle. 
  He also asked military officers to try to contribute to 
forming a better relationship between Korea and the United 
States. "Since the U.S. Administration values reports from 
field military commanders, we can have smoother relations with 
Washington depending on your efforts," he said. 
  The military leaders the president met included Gen. Chang 
Song, deputy commander of the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces 
Command, and Lt. Gens. Kim Sok-won, Kwak Tong-to, Yu Chae-yol, 
Kim Chong-nam, Yu Chong-kap and Pak Chon-taek.

<F P=106> [Article by Kim Chang-yong] </F>
  [Text] The newest chapter in the international trade order 
will be a mixed blessing for the Korean economy and its 
advantage, or disadvantage, will be chiefly dependent on how the 
nation copes with it. 
  It will ease all tariff and non-tariff barriers, making the 
world a border-less market for globally competitive companies. 
It will simultaneously mean a losing game for less competitive 
companies even in their home markets. 
  "The world will be exposed to the law of the jungle in which 
the lion has the largest share," one economist said, noting "We 
can no longer provide visible or invisible shelters for our 
industry." 
  The process of the Uruguay Round [UR] negotiations, which 
brought a victory to the United States and the European Union 
and a negative impact, if not a defeat, to most other economies, 
was a "fierce war itself" as the Federation of Korean Industries 
[FKI], the lobbying group of large companies, put it. 
  Public officials and private analysts cite sharp tariff cuts 
for manufactured goods, abolition of non-tariff discriminations 
and clarified and justified procedures for the settlement of 
trade disputes as some of the potential bonuses to the exports 
of Korea's manufacturing sector. 
  Reinforced regulations on anti-dumping ruling will 
particularly save Korean companies from threats and actions by 
advanced countries including the U.S., EU and Australia. Korean 
products have been slapped with anti-dumping charges from time 
to time. 
  Improved conditions for overseas investment will also draw 
foreign capital into the nation, while encouraging local 
businessmen to invest abroad. 
  All in all, manufacturing industries are expected to get 
more 
than they lose under the Uruguay Round agreement. 
  Major advanced countries, which have not lowed tariffs since 
the start of the multilateral talks in 1986, are obliged to 
slash the rates gradually, thus enhancing the competitiveness of 
products exported by developing countries and thereby giving 
them higher chances of access. 
  Imports are not likely to jump drastically, officials said, 
on the ground that its concessional tariffs are set at 8.1 
percent for the 2001, the final year of implementation of the 
new round, which is higher than the currently actual rate of 7.9 
percent. 
  The Korean Institute for International Economic Policy 
recently estimated exports growth, to be caused by the freer 
world trade order, at 2,250 billion dollars on the annual 
average. 
  Imports will grow a meager 720 million dollars, according to 
the brain trust for the Economic Planning Board [EPB], the top 
economic agency. 
  The state-run Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and 
Trade gave a conservative forecast--a 620-710 million dollar 
jump in exports and a 60 million dollar rise in imports. 
  "The Uruguay Round will be a plus for our economy from the 
macroscopic and long-term perspectives," said a high-ranking EPB 
official who is campaigning to calm down controversy over what 
many Koreans just call "UR." "Korea, over half whose gross 
national product comes from trade, has to pursue prosperity 
through international economic ties." 
  The free trade regime will be a great disservice to some 
light industries like footwear, textiles and garments, which are 
being dogged by products from newcomers including China, 
Malaysia and Thailand, needless to say agriculture. 
  In the agricultural field along, UR damages will amount to 
an 
estimated 7.7 trillion won (approximately 9.6 billion dollars) 
over the next seven years, resulting in the exodus of half of 
the rural population to urban areas, according to the Korea 
Rural Economic Institute. 
  The influence of the UR on Korea's economy will be 
commensurate with its countersteps. 
  Assistant Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Sok-hwan 
stressed the need for the "decisive role" of private enterprises 
in stepping up their competitiveness and image worldwide. 
  "The settlement of the new trade regulations forces the 
administration to trim its intervention in the private sector in 
the course of its technical development, trade and other overall 
business activities. The government will remain as a supporter 
and the private sector will take the initiative in this regard." 
  Business organizations appeared passive as if they were 
little concerned about the drastically new system which 
dismissed two agriculture, forestry and fisheries ministries as 
scapegoats to appease angry farmers and fishermen, backed by 
opposition lawmakers and students in Korea. 
  The FKI commented, "It is necessary to nurture 
competitiveness of some industries that have comparative edge in 
the world market. A new economic climate should also be created 
in which business activities are subject to market mechanisms." 
  The Korea Foreign Trade Association called for technological 
innovation and management reform, while the Korea Federation of 
Small Business regretted the administration's unpreparedness for 
the order.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- A blockbuster plan for a 
grand alliance of opposition parties and dissident groups is 
afoot again following a meeting of representatives of the 
Democratic Party [DP] and two minor parties last Saturday. 
  Reps. Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and Yi 
Chong-chan of the New Korea Party got together to bid farewell 
to Yi Ki-taek, chairman of the Democratic Party (DP), who is 
scheduled to visit the United States. It was at this 
get-together that the three opposition leaders agreed to form a 
working-level body to tackle problems related to formation of a 
unified opposition party. The agreement is described by many as 
"a step forward" from a similar pact reached last January, 
according to political analysts. Since an undercurrent for a 
unified opposition party has been flowing for sometime, 
discussions on the alliance are expected to pick up steam once 
the working-level body is set up, they said. 
  The need for this grand alliance is being felt by opposition 
politicians as they look toward elections for heads of 
autonomous local governments, they added. Nevertheless, the 
prevailing opinion among independent observers is that the 
notion of rallying all opposition parties together under one 
flag is easier said than done since each party has its own 
built-in problems as well as differences in political colors and 
tendencies. The problems would become even more complicated if 
the opposition parties were to embrace all dissident groups, 
they said. 
  The key to the proposed alliance is held by the DP and the 
United People's Party, whose positions differ considerably. The 
New Korea Party, which currently has only two lawmakers, poses 
few problems for a union, they said. Within the DP, the various 
factions have reportedly reached a consensus on a unified 
opposition party. 
  Chairman Yi Ki-taek and leaders of the "non-mainstream" 
factions such as Reps. Kim Sang-hyon and Kim Won-ki are prepared 
to play active roles in carrying out the move. Despite their 
stated willingness to work for an opposition union, skeptics 
wonder what stance each faction leader would take when it came 
to nominating candidates for the local elections, for instance. 
The skeptics ask: Would they give up the interests of their 
factions willingly for the good of the whole? Another area that 
would pose quite a problem is inclusion of dissidents, analysts 
said. 
  A merger of the three opposition parties would be much 
easier 
than a union of all "dissident personalities," some of whom 
espouse radical politics. In this connection, keen public 
attention was focused on the recent formation of "the new era 
plaza," a group that includes DP lawmakers like Yi Pu-yong, Che 
Chong-ku and Yim Chae- chong and such dissidents as Kim Kon-tae 
and Chang Ki-pyo. A majority of DP members are said to favor 
embracing dissidents in a proposed opposition alliance. But 
there could be many -- most of them unexpected -- problems as it 
would mean a union of establishment politicians with dissidents, 
the analysts said. 
  As for the United People's Party, a merger with the other 
opposition parties would present a much more difficult problem. 
Party representative Kim Tong-kil has responded to the overture 
for an opposition alliance but Rep. Han Yong-su and others are 
advocating "a union in stages." In other words, they want their 
party to embrace small splinter parties and groups and 
independent lawmakers first before talking about an opposition 
alliance. 
  Rep. Han Yong-su said, "We are not against a unified 
opposition party, but we believe we have to build our party up 
first by absorbing splinter groups." 
  As these comments indicate, the proposed grand opposition 
alliance is still on the drawing board. It can enter the 
starting blocks only when all parties and groups arrive at a 
consensus on unity.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The nation on Tuesday 
marks the 34th anniversary of "the April 19 revolution," which 
toppled the corrupt regime of Syngman Lee and carries deep 
significance for President Kim Yong-sam as he claims to be the 
legitimate heir to the spirit of reform and political integrity. 
  As soon as Kim was inaugurated as the first civilian 
president in more than three decades last year, he officially 
placed the April 19 uprising in its proper historical context, 
calling it "a revolution." 
  Kim has not only issued orders to "sanctify" the tombs of 
those felled by the bullets of policemen during the student-led 
uprising, but also became the first president to visit the 
Suyuri cemetery and pay his respects to the dead. 
  President Kim's particular feeling for the revolution is not 
unrelated to the government's plans to host commemorative 
activities with bereaved family members and other groups 
associated with the event, sources said. 
  Government preparations come as the ruling Democratic 
Liberal 
Party and the main opposition Democratic Party are locked in 
debate over which side boasts more members who played an active 
role in the uprising. 
  "What the students aimed for on April 19, 1960, was 
precisely 
the democratization of the country," President Kim said. 
  It was a popular uprising against corruption and injustice 
and intended to realize a just and clean society, Kim said. 
  Kim placed his civilian government "on the extension" of the 
April 19 revolution and vowed to develop its spirit, according 
to the presidential office at Chongwadae. 
  President Kim has visited the cemetery on April 19 every 
year 
except in 1981 and 1982, when he was under house arrest. 
  Time and again, Kim has emphasized that historical 
evaluations of the April 19 uprising must be revised since the 
administrations of former Army generals that followed have tried 
only "to beautify" the military coup on May 16, 1961. 
  The April 19 uprising toppled the Lee government but, taking 
advantage of the ensuing political chaos, Gen. Pak Chong-hui and 
his associates in the military grabbed power a year later. 
  Since the student uprising have been belittled under the Pak 
government and its successors with dubious legitimacy, President 
Kim believes his administration must help correct inaccuracies 
about the uprising and preserve its historical significance. 
  Under a presidential order, Seoul City started last October 
to double the size of the Suyuri cemetery and build a 
commemorative building there costing 15 billion won. The 
renovation work is expected to be completed on April 19, 1995. 
  On Tuesday, Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang will attend a 
ceremony sponsored by the government. Smaller ceremonies on the 
provincial and municipal levels and other commemorative events 
are scheduled. 
  President Kim, the heads of the two other branches of 
government and some 500 dignitaries are expected to pay their 
respects at the cemetery.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The Korea high-speed 
rail construction authority has agreed to pay 2,101.6 million 
U.S. dollars to Gec Alsthom in return for the Anglo-French 
consortium's supply of trainsets and technology in connection 
with the multi- billion-dollar Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway 
project. 
  The authority said Monday it will use the trainsets, related 
equipment and overall control system of Gec Alsthom's "train a 
grand vitesse" (high-speed train) on the 430.7-kilometer 
Seoul-Pusan line. 
  Under the agreement, the French company is also supposed to 
transfer TGV construction technology to South Korean companies 
-- Hyundai Precision and Industry Co., Daewoo Heavy Industries 
Co. and Hanjin Heavy Industries Co. 
  Pak Yu-kwang, president of the Korea high-speed rail 
construction authority, said a contract will be drawn up soon 
paying Gec Alsthom 6,009.5 million French francs for trains made 
by the French company and 1,069.8 million dollars for those made 
by South Korean firms. 
  The price was about 270 million dollars lower than Gec 
Alsthom had suggested last July. 
  The financing will come from France's export and 
export-related funds, carrying the condition of repayment in 10 
years with an eight-year grace period. 
  The South Korean authority and France's Banque Indosuez are 
discussing other details of redemption such as interest rates, 
Pak said. The agreement enables the South Korean authority and 
Gec Alsthom to embark on the Seoul-Pusan high-speed railway 
construction project, which is expected to finish by 2002. The 
authority sent a report on the agreement to the Transportation 
Ministry Monday and is awaiting government approval. The 
ministry will approve the agreement after consultations with the 
government committee on high- speed rail construction and 
President Kim Yong-sam before the authority draws up the final 
contract with Gec Alsthom in May, Pak said. 
  To ensure the TGV's performance and transfer of all 
technology, South Korean manufacturers and the authority will 
jointly participate in the TGV construction from the design 
stage, according to Pak. The TGV should be given the 
international quality control standard "ISO-9000" series and Gec 
Alsthom will help the South Korean firms secure the ISO 
standards, according to the agreement. 
  The authority and Gec Alsthom will cooperate to wind up all 
technology transfers by the year 2002 so that South Korean 
businesses can make TGV trains on their own from then on. The 
South Korean companies will secure the intellectual property 
rights for the transferred technology, and they are supposed to 
give 2 percent of the selling price for 12 and a half years from 
the contract day if they make deals to transfer the TGV 
technology to third countries. 
  The TGV will begin service between Seoul and Taejon from the 
year 2000 and run between Seoul-Pusan line from 2002. Meanwhile, 
the TGV's top speed on the Seoul-Pusan line will be 300 
kilometers per hour, according to the authority.

  [Text] Seoul, April 18 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul District Civil 
Court's ruling on Monday in favor of the plaintiff in a sexual 
harassment case has set an important precedent for women facing 
similar troubles. 
  The case was brought by a Seoul National University (SNU) 
teaching assistant, identified only as Miss U, against her 
professor known as Mr. Sin, seeking 50 million won (about 62,000 
U.S. dollars) in compensation for mental anguish due to sexual 
harassment. Presiding Judge Pak Chang-u of the court's panel 
No. 18 ruled, after nearly six months of hearings, that the 
defendant must pay 30 million won to the plaintiff. 
  The judge decided that although the defendant claimed the 
plaintiff took action to gain revenge for her dismissal as a 
teaching assistant last August, her anguish caused by the 
defendant's sexual harassment, such as unnecessary physical 
contact, "is recognized in view of the witnesses of the 
plaintiff and her colleagues and other evidence." 
  The historic ruling is expected to spur many women suffering 
sexual harassment to take action at the risk of disclosing their 
secret problems. 
  In the court struggle, the defendant was supported by 
women's 
organizations and the SNU student government, which put up 
posters on campus last August charging Professor Sin with 
frequent sexual harassment -- trying to embrace Miss U from 
behind and rubbing her shoulders, for example. The women's 
organizations and the student government also formed a joint 
committee to draft measures against sexual harassment. 
  Professor Sin filed a countersuit charging Miss U with 
libel, 
claiming she brought the case merely to take revenge for her 
dismissal. 
  After four court hearings over nearly half a year, the 
verdict at last went in favor of the plaintiff. 
  The joint committee welcomed the ruling, calling it historic 
in that it has set a favorable precedent for women subjected to 
sexual harassment. But it noted that the ruling overlooked 
sexual discrimination and disadvantages in employment, thus 
failing to recognize sexual harassment as a social problem. 
  A poll of 458 working women conducted by the joint committee 
last November showed 87 percent of the respondents had 
experienced sexual harassment. Only 17.5 percent said they had 
taken action against their tormentors, including demanding an 
apology. Miss U's lawyer, Yi Chong-kol, said the ruling greatly 
increases the possibility that women will win sexual harassment 
cases in the future.

<F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>
  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 16 (AFP) -- The British Embassy 
warned foreigners Saturday against travel in Cambodia because 
they could become Khmer Rouge [KR] targets as three foreigners 
abducted by the guerrillas were reported alive and well. 
  "We have unconfirmed reports that any foreigners may be 
targetted by the Khmer Rouge," an embassy statement said. 
  "You should take extreme care and should not travel on roads 
where the Khmer Rouge occasionally operate," the statement said. 
  If travel was absolutely necessary, foreigners were advised 
to move in convoys. 
  A senior embassy official would not speculate on whether the 
kidnapping of foreigners was a new Khmer Rouge tactic. 
  But the official said the travel advisory was in reaction to 
the "best available evidence" and was designed to "alert but 
not alarm" the expatriate community. 
  Co-Interior Minister Yu Hokkri told AFP that the Khmer Rouge 
leadership may have ordered their guerrillas to kidnap 
foreigners in order to use them as bargaining chips in the event 
of negotiations with the government. 
  Although the Khmer Rouge strongholds are in the north and 
northwest of the country, pockets of guerrillas operate in most 
provinces. 
  Australian former model Kelly Wilkinson, 24, her British 
boyfriend, Dominic Chappell, 25, and a British friend, Tina 
Dominy, whose age was not given, were reported to be alive and 
well, friends in the capital said Saturday. 
  The trio was spotted by local people near the area where 
they 
were abducted Monday by Khmer Rouge guerrillas on National Route 
4, about 130 kilometres ( [word indistinct] miles) southwest of 
the capital. 
  The American Embassy backed the British advisory "100 per 
cent" while the Australians agreed with the need for "increased 
vigilance and extreme caution." 
  An spokesman for Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth 
Evans also told reporters in Canberra that the three people 
kidnapped were apparently in good shape. 
  "Elements of the armed forces have made contact with other 
Khmer Rouge elements in the province and apparently there are 
reports that they are alive and, to all intents and purposes, 
well," the spokesman said. 
  But another Australian official said there was still no 
ransom demand and no contact had been made with the abductors. 
  Two Khmer-speaking Australian police officers, who served 
with the recent United Nations peacekeeping mission here, were 
expected to arrive soon to help the efforts to secure the 
release of Wilkinson and her two friends, an embassy official 
said. 
  Wilkinson's father, Peter, and brother Sean, both from 
Queensland, Australia, arrived here Friday and were reported to 
have left for the southern coastal town of Sihanoukville 
Saturday. 
  Wilkinson and Chappell run a popular restaurant in the port 
and resort town and were returning there from the capital when 
they were taken by Khmer Rouge guerrillas. 
  The Australian's mother, Gabrielle Wilkinson, welcomed news 
of the sighting. "This is certainly the news we have been 
waiting for -- a confirmed sighting," she said. "That's 
wonderful." 
  Meanwhile a representative of the aid agency Food for the 
Hungry International (FHI) said there was no response to a 
letter from King Norodom Sihanouk calling for the immediate 
release of one of their American aid workers, Melissa Himes. 
  "There was supposed to be a response mid-morning, then it 
was 
delayed," the aid agency official said, adding that there might 
be news later Saturday. 
  Himes and two Cambodian colleagues are entering their third 
week of captivity. 
  Police identified their captors as Khmer Rouge, but FHI 
spokesman Robin Shell said they appeared to be a rogue unit. 
Their affiliation was not clear.

  [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Romesh Chandra, 
honorary president of the World Peace Council [WPC], in an 
interview with the KCNA correspondent in India on April 9 said 
that the grave danger of nuclear war created by the United 
States on the Korean peninsula is a serious challenge to the 
Korean people and peaceloving forces of the world desirous of 
peace on the Korean peninsula and its reunification. 
  In order to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula and its 
reunification, he stated, the United States must discard its 
anachronistic policy of stifling the DPRK and approach the 
DPRK-USA talks with sincerity. 
  It must, above all, withdraw its nuclear and other mass 
destruction weapons and troops from South Korea and stop all the 
war games, he said, adding: 
  Korea must be reunified by founding the democratic 
confederal 
republic of Koryo according to the "10-point Programme of the 
Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the 
Country" advanced by the great leader His Excellency President 
Kim Il-song.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Anachronistic Way of </F>
Thinking Must be Disregarded"] 
  [Text] The U.S. imperialists are escalating their plots 
for a Northward invasion war. As has already been reported, 
they deployed some of their 30 ultramodern Apache attack 
helicopters -- which they promised to deploy to South Korea -- 
to South Korea on 10 April. The Apache helicopters, which have 
been deployed to South Korea as a part of strengthening the 
combatant capabilities of the U.S. Forces occupying South Korea, 
have arrived in the U.S. Army bases near the Military 
Demarcation Line. 
  From 10 to 11 April, the U.S. imperialists also mobilized 
and 
deployed various kinds of approximately 20 military planes to 
South Korea from their overseas bases. They have either 
mobilized or supplied a great number of troops and war equipment 
to operational areas by air transport from U.S. mainland bases 
and the Pacific region. 
  It has been reported that the first shipment of Patriot 
missiles -- which left Texas some time ago -- will arrive in 
South Korea soon. All these facts are an intentional plot to 
reinforce their arms to further lead the situation on the Korean 
peninsula to the brink of war. Therefore, it is a very 
dangerous military move. 
  As everyone knows, it is our consistent position to resolve 
the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula through dialogue or 
negotiations. However, the U.S. imperialists -- who have 
unilaterally broken up the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks by 
fully refusing the implementation of an DPRK-U.S. agreement 
signed in New York -- have disclosed their attempts to resume 
the Team Spirit joint military exercise under an unreasonable 
pretext and have more vigorously maneuvered to strengthen South 
Korea's military reinforcement by babbling about the so-called 
sanctions. This is an act like a thief turning on the victim 
with a club and clearly shows that the United States has no 
intention at all to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean 
peninsula through dialogue, but instead has plotted to crush 
[apsal] our Republic. 
  Such criminal attempts by the U.S. imperialists have been 
properly shown by the recent and bellicose remarks by U.S. 
ruling circles. In an interview with U.S. NBC Television on 12 
April, U.S. Secretary of State Christopher even set a deadline 
for us to accept nuclear inspections, talking about our 
so-called nuclear issue. Also, he made absurd remarks that if we 
fail to comply with their unilateral and unjust demands by then, 
diplomatic pressure will be turned into a more stern step and 
that he cannot rule out the possibility of conducting a military 
preemptive strike. 
  Prior to his remarks, even U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry 
has not hesitated to make bellicose remarks that he cannot rule 
out the possibility of a U.S. preemptive military strike against 
North Korea, and that he is willing to take the risk of waging a 
war. The U.S. imperialists' arms reinforcement plots -- which 
have been further accelerated under the situations in which the 
U.S. ruling circles have made such bellicose remarks that 
agitate war and in which the U.S. naval fleets are mobilized and 
deployed in waters off the Korean peninsula -- are never 
coincident. This shows that they have attempted to surely wage 
a new war on the Korean peninsula by strengthening the military 
threat or pressure against us. 
  Because of the U.S. imperialists' and South Korean puppets' 
reckless war plots, a very grave situation in which no one knows 
when war breaks out [onje chonjaengi tojilchi morunun] is now 
being created on the Korean peninsula. It is the U.S. 
imperialists who are the ringleaders of aggravating tensions, as 
well as the breakers of peace and security on the Korean 
peninsula. 
  While acting as if it is an international military police, 
the United states intends to bring our people to their knees 
with military forcible measures [kanggwon] and force. However, 
this is an anachronistic way of thinking. The times have passed 
in which forcible measures and force could be used. It is a 
foolish daydream if it believes that the method of force can be 
applied to us. 
  We have the might of single-hearted unity, which is much 
stronger than atomic or hydrogen bombs, as well as the matchless 
revolutionary Armed Forces capable of boldly destroying any 
enemies and of safeguarding the socialist fatherland based on 
the strong self-reliant national economy and the powerful 
national defensive capabilities. We are thoroughly prepared to 
cope with the U.S. imperialists' military pressure or offensive. 
  The persons who sets a fire are doomed to be burned to death 
by that fire. The U.S. imperialists should clearly see the 
reality and should not act recklessly.

song's news conference with foreign reporters at the Kumsusan 
Assembly Hall in Pyongyang on 16 April; Kim's remarks in Korean 
are translated from Japanese subtitles] 
  [Text] North Korean President Kim Il-song held a news 
conference today with a group of foreign reporters, including 
members of the NHK. In the news conference, President Kim 
Il-song commented on North Korean nuclear facilities, where the 
DPRK is suspected of developing nuclear weapons, and said that 
no country is making its military facilities open to the general 
public. In this way, he stressed again that the DPRK has no 
intention to accept inspections by the International Atomic 
Energy Agency. 
  The news conference was held at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall, 
where President Kim Il-song's presidential office is located, 
for nearly three hours starting at 1000 [0100 GMT] this morning. 
  [Begin Kim Il-song recording] We have nothing to hide at 
all. We have no secrets. However, we have military secrets. It 
is normal for every country to hide its military matters. We 
will make everything, except for the military matters, open to 
the general public. [end recording] 
  In this way, President Kim Il-song stressed again that the 
DPRK has no intention to accept inspections of the two 
facilities in Yongbyon, which are main targets of the nuclear 
suspicion. Moreover, President Kim Il-song said: We have been 
saying that we have neither the intention nor the capability of 
building nuclear weapons. It is unlikely that we will ever own 
nuclear weapons. 
  In this way, he denied the suspected nuclear weapons 
development. On the other hand, President Kim Il-song repeatedly 
said that he hopes to visit the United States someday. 
  [Begin Kim Il-song recording] Although I have never been to 
the United States, I think a day will come for me to go there. 
[ends recording] 
  This was the first time for President Kim Il-song to 
disclose 
his hope to visit the United States. 
  [Begin recording by an unidentified NHK reporter in 
Pyongyang] President Kim Il-song gave us very strong 
impressions. One of them is the fact that he looked very 
healthy. Although he is 82 years old, he energetically spoke 
for three hours and ate well. He did not look tired at all. In 
response to a question what he will do when he goes to the 
United States, the president said: I have nothing to learn from 
the United States because I am not young anymore. However, I 
would like to go fishing and hunting. It will be a fruitful 
visit in many respects. 
  International attention is focused on how President Kim 
Il-song will settle the difficult situation. [end recording]

  [Text] Brussels, April 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign 
Minister Han Sung-chu voiced optimism Sunday [17 April] on 
settling the North Korean nuclear dispute. 
  Talks between North Korea and the International Atomic 
Energy 
Agency (IAEA) are likely to go well, Han told reporters in 
Brussels, where he presided over an annual meeting of Korean 
envoys serving in Europe. 
  The North's reaction cannot but be limited, particularly 
since China is urging acceptance of nuclear inspections, he 
noted. 
  The foreign minister reiterated that Seoul will keep 
dialogue 
channels open with Pyongyang to prevent the nuclear issue from 
entering a critical phase. 
  He added that the inter-Korean envoy exchange was withdrawn 
as a precondition to further Pyongyang-Washington talks for that 
very reason. 
  In his opening address at the envoy meeting, Han said Seoul 
will draw up proper environmental, labor and economic policies 
to work within the World Trade Organization after the Uruguay 
Round's conclusion.

  [Text] U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale, who has 
been visiting Okinawa, held a news conference on 12 April at the 
U.S. Consulate in Urasoe City, Okinawa, and commented on the 
issue of the return of Yomitan auxiliary airfield. He indicated 
a bright outlook, saying: "I have the impression that progress 
will be made in bilateral negotiations. We should see some kind 
of results in the future." However, he failed to comment on 
such points as the specific period of return of the airfield and 
how the issue is being handled in bilateral talks. 
  About a recent U.S. military aircraft mishap, municipal 
government authorities from areas surrounding Kadena Air Base 
have demanded public disclosure of outcome of investigations 
into the cause of the accident. In this regard, Mondale kept 
his comments short, saying: "As the ambassador, I am hoping that 
a disclosure will be made." He thus indicated the matter would 
be left for further consideration by authorities concerned, 
including the military. The ambassador departed Okinawa after 
the news conference. 
  On the U.S. military base issues, Mondale told reporters: 
"Since this is my first visit to Okinawa, I cannot answer in 
detail." He then stressed: "The United States and Japan are 
continuing to make efforts toward improving the situation, 
including such problems as aircraft noise." 
  On the concentration of U.S. military bases on Okinawa, 
Mondale said: "The scale of military bases and activities here 
remain the sole responsibility of the United States." However, 
he added: "As a signatory of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the 
United States bears a serious responsibility to defend Japan and 
the surrounding area." He thus reiterated the traditional U.S. 
stance, stressing the importance of U.S. military presence to 
respond to possible tension in the Asian region and making other 
similar references. 
  Although the ambassador failed to make in-depth comments on 
the issue of the scaling down of U.S. military bases on Okinawa, 
he did comment on the issue of the return of Yomitan auxiliary 
airfield, which was discussed at last month's Japan-U.S. 
security talks. Mondale said: "Although it will require 
persistence, some kind of results should appear in the future." 
He thus gave a strong impression the airfield would be returned. 
  U.S. Consul General for Okinawa Richard Christenson, who was 
present at the news conference, said: "Negotiations are being 
continued between the United States and Japan, but it will take 
more time."

  [Text] Kadena -- On 13 April, U.S. military aircraft 
frequently took off from Kadena Air Base where military training 
was conducted for ORI (operational readiness inspection). Kadena 
Town was invariably beset by a deafening noise caused by the 
U.S. military aircraft in the early morning. Early that morning, 
the Base Affairs Division of Kadena Town began measuring the 
noise at a spot which was the nearest to the air base's runway. 
Town residents complained, "U.S. military planes are taking off 
from the air base in the early morning, and we are bothered by 
their noise. We cannot permit the what U.S. Forces are doing." 
  The noise caused by engines of the U.S. military aircraft 
reverberated from early morning 13 April. A noise measuring 
instrument set atop the Kadena Town building showed that more 
than 70 decibels was heard 33 times from 0124 to 0919 the 
morning of 13 April. The noise measuring instrument recorded 87 
decibels at 0143 in the middle of midnight. The instrument also 
recorded 99 decibels at 0713 and 96 decibels at 0748, each when 
one F-15 Eagle fighter after another took off from the air base. 
  The Base Affairs Division quickly responded to the deafening 
noise by letting an official equipped with a portable 
noise-measuring instrument gauge the noise in Yara, Kadena Town, 
which is nearest to the air base's runway. 
  A man, 49, who resides in Yara, said angrily: "U.S. military 
planes use a runway near our residential areas to take off, 
causing a deafening noise in our residential areas. We cannot 
tolerate this."

  [Text] Mitsuo Gima, speaker of the Okinawa Prefectural 
Assembly, and six other representatives of the ruling and 
opposition parties visited Consul General Richard Christenson at 
the U.S. Consulate General in Okinawa on 13 April to lodge their 
protest on the F-15 fighter and CH-46 helicopter crashes. The 
representatives demanded particularly the "prompt announcement 
of the causes of the accidents." 
  In response, the consul general showed a positive attitude, 
saying: "We will ask the U.S. military authorities to make such 
an announcement, and work toward making this announcement 
possible." 
  The prefectural assembly delegation lodged the protest in 
accordance with a resolution adopted at the emergency session of 
the assembly. 
  Christenson said during the meeting, "We take the 
prefectural 
assembly's protest seriously." Concerning the F-15 and 
helicopter accidents, he explained the U.S. base authorities' 
position, claiming "after the accidents, there was a ban on all 
flights. Flights were only resumed after all aircraft had been 
checked for safety." 
  The consul general also said, "I can understand the 
Okinawans' negative feelings. We will implement safety measures 
strictly." However, he reiterated that U.S. military training 
"is part of our duties under the security pact." 
  The prefectural assembly's delegation is also scheduled to 
petition the relevant government ministries and agencies later 
this month. The representatives reaffirmed on 13 April that 
"the approach of the Japanese Government is important in the 
solution of base issues. We give priority to our petition with 
the Foreign Ministry and other government offices."

  [Text] It was learned on 13 April that the U.S. 
authorities rejected the Japanese request that they share part 
of the compensation paid to residents around the Yokota Base 
under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement [SOFA]. This 
compensation arose from the verdict pronounced on the first and 
second Yokoto Base noise pollution litigations. The Japanese 
request was based on the SOFA stipulation that the United States 
shall pay three-fourths of compensation paid as a result of 
"illegal acts" on the part of U.S. Forces. 
  The U.S. authorities asserted that "the flight of aircraft 
does not constitute an illegal act." The application of this 
SOFA provision is expected to become a controversial issue in 
both countries. 
  In February 1993, the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict 
on 
the first and second Yokota litigations, ruling "the noise 
surpasses the limit of the residents' tolerance, and is 
illegal." The court ordered the government, the accused, to pay 
compensation totalling about 113 million yen to Yokota residents 
for past damage from noise pollution. This verdict has been 
confirmed. 
  Even before the Supreme Court verdict, the Defense 
Facilities 
Administration Agency [DFAA] had paid the compensation in full 
to the plaintiffs in accordance with an earlier verdict by an 
intermediate appellate court. After the final verdict was 
pronounced, the DFAA asked the United States to share in the 
payment of compensation under Article 18 of SOFA. 
  SOFA provides that Japan pay 25 percent, and the United 
States 75 percent for compensation to damages caused by "illegal 
acts" by U.S. military aircraft. The United States is being 
asked to pay around 85 million yen in the present case. 
However, the U.S. side served notice that it refuses to pay 
because "flight of aircraft at Yokota Base is in accordance with 
the Japan-U.S. Security Pact, and is not illegal." 
  While the DFAA is presently discussing with the Foreign 
Ministry about making the request again, it intends to argue 
with the United States along the line that "the court ruled that 
the noise was illegal, and that noise was produced by the flight 
of U.S. military aircraft." 
  In the verdict on the third Yokota litigation confirmed on 
13 
April, the government is again ordered to pay a total of 710 
million yen in compensation. The DFAA asserts that in this 
case, too, the U.S. Forces have the obligation to pay 530 
million yen. 
  However, while all past verdicts affirmed that noise "is 
beyond the limit of tolerance, and is illegal," they ruled that 
the flight of U.S. military aircraft per se is "beyond Japanese 
jurisdiction," and court cases seeking a ban to such flight have 
all been "rejected." It remains unclear whether noise from U.S. 
military aircraft constitutes an "illegal act" as stipulated in 
SOFA. 
  Even some DFAA officials are doubtful about this, saying 
"unlike in the case of accidents, will the United States agree 
to the application of the provision on compensation for noise?" 
Nevertheless, the Japanese financial authorities will probably 
refuse to pay the whole amount, and insist on a U.S. share in 
the payment.

  [Text] Jakarta, April 16 KYODO -- Arrests have increased 
to 40 after two days of labor-related riots in North Sumatra 
province, a labor activist said Saturday, though police denied 
the report. 
  Independent unionist Hasby Ansyori told KYODO NEWS SERVICE 
that some 40 people had been arrested by Friday night, following 
riots on Thursday and Friday in Medan, the provincial capital 
about 1,400 kilometers northwest of Jakarta. 
  Hasby is an executive of the Indonesian Prosperity Trade 
Union, an independent union which has challenged the 
government's policy of only allowing one trade union, the All 
Indonesian Workers Union. 
  Contacted by telephone in Medan, Hasby said the number of 
arrests may continue to increase. 
  The police have denied Hasby's claim, saying they have only 
arrested four demonstrators. 
  About 20,000 workers Marched Thursday, and 51,000 on Friday, 
demanding an official investigation into the death last month of 
one of their colleagues. 
  The workers were protesting the death of 22-year-old Rusli, 
a 
worker at a Medan-based company, after he took part in a labor 
strike which was crushed by government troops. Rusli's body was 
found floating in a river three days after the March 11 strike. 
  Police reports said that by Saturday morning about 165 shops 
and homes, mostly owned by residents of Chinese descent, were 
destroyed and looted. Dozens of cars were set ablaze. 
  A Chinese businessman of PT Sumatra Blue Company, identified 
as Yuli Kristanto, 53, was killeD in Friday's rioting when his 
car was pelted with stones by demonstrators.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazuichi Sekiguchi, industrial news department </F>
reporter, fifth and last in the series "Field Report on Market 
Opening": "Recognition Gap: There Are Differences in Basic 
Data"] 
  [Text] "The U.S. Government does not understand the actual 
situation concerning the Japanese market." On 1 April, Ken 
Suzuki, managing director of the Japan Electric Industry 
Development Association, a computer industry organization, 
expressed his grievance after reviewing details of the "1994 
National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers" 
announced by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). 
The Japanese Government's procurement of foreign computers is 
steadily increasing following the Japan-U.S. agreement reached 
in January 1992. However, the USTR report pointed out that "the 
share of foreign products on the Japanese market is decreasing." 
<H5>  "The United States Is Eager To Increase Items of Japan's </H5>
Trade Barriers" 
  The latest report claimed that barriers to trade in the 
Japanese market existed for 43 items, the most ever. There are 
44 pages pertaining to Japan, more than double the amount of 
pages the Bush administration devoted to Japan. Masakazu 
Toyoda, chief of the America-Oceania Division of the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry [MITI], pointed out: "The 
Clinton administration is eager to increase the number of items 
listed as Japan's trade barriers. Most of them have been 
settled under the Japan-U.S. agreements." He added: "Moreover, 
a problem is that the U.S. claim that the Japanese market is 
closed is based on groundless, unclear data." 
  As for government procurement of computers, a MITI survey 
shows that the share of foreign products at ministries and 
agencies increased from 4.1 percent in fiscal 1991 to 10.2 
percent in fiscal 1992. However, the USTR report points out 
that the share decreased from 4.0 percent in fiscal 1991 to 3.7 
percent in fiscal 1992. Mr. Toyoda stated that although there 
are differences in the means of arriving at the stated figures, 
it is exceedingly unusual that the results of the surveys were 
so different, especially in terms of the direction of change of 
procurement shares. 
  The Japanese Government procured 11 supercomputers using 
supplementary budget funds allocated for fiscal 1993. Of these, 
six units are U.S.-made products. However, the USTR report 
still listed the sector as encumbered by trade barriers, saying: 
"U.S. companies were only able to receive orders in biddings in 
which Japanese companies did not participate." 
  Originally, the Japanese industry had urged the government 
to 
place orders for the 11 supercomputers as a measure to stimulate 
the economy. Mr. Suzuki said: "We did not expect that U.S. 
firms would win the half of the orders. Conversely, this proves 
that the Japanese market is open enough." 
<H5>  The U.S. Government Depends on Results of Industries' Surveys </H5>
  Such differences in figures as well as in evaluations are 
noted everywhere in the USTR report. In many cases, the USTR 
office, which is comprised of a select few people of superior 
ability, depends on statistics presented by industries when it 
compiles data on market surveys. The U.S. industries are liable 
to present figures favorable to them. Seikei University 
Professor Mitsuo Matsushita said: "The U.S. Government's 
practice of coming to one- sided judgment causes mutual distrust 
between Japan and the United States." 
  Moreover, there are not a few cases where the U.S. 
Government 
easily reacts to requests made by industrial lobbyists." Many 
business managers maintain that Japanese and U.S. "private 
sectors are getting along with each other" in the semiconductor 
and automotive industries (as stated by Toshiba Corporation 
President Fumio Sato). There is a case noted in the 
construction sector that although private companies in the 
United States have no complaints against Japan, the U.S. 
Government itself is attacking Japan to eliminate the closed 
nature of the Japanese market. 
  The Japanese Government compiles a Japanese version of an 
"unfair trade report" every spring, with Professor Matsushita 
playing a leading role. The Japanese report analyzes issues 
concerning the U.S. legal system, including the antidumping law 
and the buy-American law, in the light of such agreements as 
GATT. On the other hand, a "problem with the U.S. report lies 
in the fact that the United States evaluates Japan's business 
practices such as keiretsu based on its own value system" (as 
stated by Professor Matsushita). 
  Such a gap in recognition between Japan and the United 
States 
is shown in their approach toward Japan-U.S. agreements. USTR 
Kantor and other U.S. officials stress: "Although 33 agreements 
now exist between Japan and the United States, Japan has failed 
to fulfill them faithfully." However, the Japanese Government 
refutes this, saying: "Somewhat more than 20 Japan-U.S. 
agreements exist. The U.S. way of counting them is obviously 
arbitrary" (according to the Foreign Ministry). 
<H5>  "The Government Arbitrarily...." </H5>
  Nihon University Professor Tadakuni Nogimura points out that 
"the fact is that Japan also has a problem concerning a lack of 
understanding." For example, the duties of MITI division chiefs 
change about every two years. While documents on past 
agreements are kept at offices, there are many cases in which 
concrete details of negotiations are not completely handed over 
from departing officials to their successors. Because officials 
in charge of negotiations try to reach agreements of any sort 
during their term of office, they sometimes conclude temporary 
agreements. 
  The 1992 Japan-U.S. agreement set a target for Japan's 
purchase of auto parts for fiscal 1994 of $19 billion. In this 
regard, many people in the automotive industry say: "The 
government, at its own discretion, compiled targets for efforts 
shown by the industry, and presented them to the United States." 
The aim of the Clinton administration is to have Japan fulfill 
all of the agreements reached in the past. 
  A problem also lies in a lack of understanding between the 
Japanese Government and industries. Recently, it has been 
revealed that, in a document on the Japan-U.S. mobile phone 
accord worked out by the Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications, there is an expression that could be 
interpreted as the government guaranteeing accords between the 
Japanese and U.S. private sectors. There is a famous case of a 
note attached to the 1986 Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement 
which stipulated that the share of foreign semiconductor 
products of the Japanese market should reach 20 percent. 
Professor Nogimura said: "The government seldom informs the 
private sector of unfavorable information." 
  Even if the private sector is making efforts to open markets 
at the government's request, it cannot be said from the latest 
USTR report that its efforts are highly evaluated by the United 
States. At a time when the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks 
are suspended, the computer industry is not the only industry 
that is indignant over the Japanese Government's negotiations 
with the United States.

  [Text] Medan, Indonesia, April 16 (AFP) -- Armoured 
vehicles and thousands of police and military officials were 
deployed Saturday in Medan, North Sumatra, one day after labour 
protests turned into ethnic violence against the Chinese 
minority, a military official said. 
  "Four batallions of police and military officials remain on 
alert here in anticipation of anti-ethnic-Chinese 
demonstrations," Medan Military District Commander Lieutenant 
Colonel Agus Ramadan told journalists. 
  This adds up to about 2,600 security personnel. 
  "The demonstrations might peak on Monday or Tuesday," 
Ramadan 
said. 
  Tens of thousands of workers staged demonstrations in Medan 
Thursday and Friday, demanding an investigation into the 
suspicious death of one of their colleagues last month. 
  The battered body of Rusli, a worker of Rubber industry PT 
Industri Karet Deli, was found in a local river one day after he 
had led a workers protest in March. But officials did not 
investigate his death. 
  Workers also asked for better conditions and higher wages, 
as 
well as the right to organize in independent labour trade 
unions. The government only recognizes the official All 
Indonesia Workers Union (SPSI). 
  Violence erupted on Friday when security forces tried to 
stop 
the demonstration, which was heading to downtown Medan. 
  Some angry demonstrators then pelted shops, factories and 
vehicles, witnesses said. The violence appeared aimed at ethnic 
Chinese, who are often the target of jealously because of their 
general economic success. 
  An estimated 40 to 50 shophouses and six cars were burnt, at 
least 150 shops and houses were destroyed, sources told AFP. 
  Ramadan confirmed one ethnic-Chinese businessman identified 
as Juli Kristanto, or known under the Chinese name Wok Joe Lip, 
53, was killed Friday, but declined to give details. 
  Ramadan said that 120 people were a.nested for their alleged 
involvement in vandalism, murder and arson. 
  On Saturday, an AFP correspondent saw nine armoured vehicles 
parking along the main residential areas inhabited by many 
ethnic Chinese. A journalist of Medan-based WASPADA daily said 
by telephone that dozens of other armoured vehicles were 
deployed on the suburban areas. 
  Most of the shops, private banks, private ethnic-Chinese 
schools were closed in that city of 1.5 million, whose ethnic 
Chinese community makes up one third of the population. 
  Lieutenant Colonel Ramadan said that the anti-ethnic-Chinese 
demonstration was prompted by workers' dissatisfaction over the 
annual bonus which was given before the Muslim celebration of 
Idul Fitri in March. There was also news of a 
430-million-dollar scam at a state bank involving ethnic Chinese 
businessman Eddy Tansil. 
  Demonstrators also protested against the involvement of the 
military in labour disputes, the chairman of the independent 
Jakarta-based Welfare Labour Union (SBSI), Mukhtar Pakpahan, 
told a press conference Saturday. 
  SBSI, insisting the strike should be the last option for 
workers, was behind the first strike on Thursday, Pakpahan said. 
But, he added, "other parties have made use of the situation 
the following day, creating chaos and violent demonstrations." 
  Pakpahan called on the government to stop using security 
measures as away of dealing with labour. 
  "SBSI urges the government not to use the security approach 
and [word indistinct] actions to handle strikes," Pakpahan said.

  [Text] The ASAHI SHIMBUN forum on the "Japanese-U.S. 
European Economic War" to discuss economic issues among Japan, 
the United States, and Europe opened at a hotel in 
Uchisaiwai-cho, Tokyo, on 13 April. Michel Albert, member of 
the French Banking and Financial Policy Commission; Professor 
Lester Sallow [name as published] of the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology; and former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, 
exchanged views on the capitalist society, Japan-U.S. trade 
frictions, and other issues before an audience of around 700. 
  On the stalled Japan-U.S. framework talks, Sallow strongly 
criticized the closedness of the Japanese market. He said: "It 
might be better to simply end the negotiations. The problem is 
quite clear: Japan does not import enough." He also stated, 
"If Japan does not increase its imports, other countries will 
have to stop their imports from Japan." Sallow strongly urged 
the expansion of domestic demand. 
  In response, Miyazawa said, "Many of our exports to the 
United States form an integral part of the U.S. economy. Japan 
should increase its imports rather than reduce its exports." 
  Albert pointed out that, "In Japan, the distribution 
industry 
has very low productivity. The consumers are paying for high 
production cost. Furthermore, formidable land prices are also a 
problem." He expressed the opinion that reform of the economic 
structure is necessary to promote the expansion of domestic 
demand through deregulation to lower commodity prices, and other 
measures.

should be taken against protesters involved in destruction 
because the acts of these irresponsible persons are detrimental

demonstration if it is within normal limits. If, however, the 
demonstration is exploited by irresponsible persons and leads to 
destruction, firm action will be taken against them.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Japan's merchandise trade 
surplus rose 4.2 percent in March from the same month a year 
earlier to 13,952 million dollars, the Finance Ministry said 
Monday [18 April]. That fourth straight month of gains brought 
the fiscal 1993 to a record 121,993 million dollars, the 
ministry said in a preliminary monthly report. 
  March exports rose 5.3 percent from a year earlier to 36,513 
million dollars, while imports rose 6.0 percent to 22,561 
million dollars, the ministry said. 
  The March rise in the customs-cleared trade surplus followed 
preliminary rises of 3.3 percent in February, 17.0 percent in 
January, 15.5 percent in December and a 2.2 percent fall in 
November that snapped 34 months of consecutive year-on-year 
growth. 
  Japan registered an unadjusted surplus of 4,961 million 
dollars in its trade with the United States.

  [Text] As of 12 April, the Japanese Government decided to 
support the idea of concluding a "multilateral accord on banning 
the production of enriched uranium and plutonium for military 
purposes" (the so-called cut-off pact on military-purpose 
nuclear materials) proposed by U.S. President Clinton last 
September and to allow countries that are not members of the 
nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to keep military-purpose 
nuclear materials such as high-enriched uranium and plutonium 
which they already possess if they join the cut-off pact. 
  Previously the government, while working on non-NPT member 
nations such as India, Pakistan, and Israel to join the NPT, 
said that it would not allow them to possess military-use 
nuclear materials. 
  However, the government has concluded that the cut-off pact 
will serve as "supplement" to the NPT (according to a Foreign 
Ministry source) and that in order to strengthen the 
international system to check nuclear proliferation, it is 
better to conclude the cut-off pact with non-NPT member nations 
than asking those nations to abandon nuclear materials which 
they currently possess. 
  This cut-off pact was proposed by President Clinton in his 
speech to the United Nations last September. 
  Outline of the proposal is: 1) a multilateral pact should be 
concluded to ban the production of such military-use nuclear 
materials as highly enriched uranium and plutonium; 2) the 
International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] should inspect member 
nations to check whether nuclear materials are used for military 
purposes; and 3) military-use nuclear materials which the member 
nations already possess are exempted from the IAEA inspections. 
  The possible conclusion of the cut-off pact will lead to the 
creation of the third nuclear control system composed of 
countries which possesses nuclear materials but not armed with 
nuclear weapons, in addition to the NPT, in which nuclear 
control group is divided into two: one composed of nations which 
possess nuclear weapons; the other composed of non-nuclear 
nations. Nuclear inspections will also be carried out of the 
third group. 
  The major controversial point of the proposal is that there 
is the possibility that nations which are suspected of storing 
military-purpose nuclear materials will be allowed to keep those 
nuclear materials. However, India recently indicated an 
interest in the proposal, and among the non-NPT member nations, 
there is a positive move toward concluding the cut-off pact. 
Therefore, it is likely that debates on merits and demerits of 
the proposal will be brisk on a world-wide scale.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- A fourth straight gain by 
Japan's trade surplus in March boosted the politically sensitive 
figure 10.0 percent for fiscal 1993 to a record 121.99 billion 
dollars, the Finance Ministry said Monday [18 April]. 
  The strong yen boosted the value of exports in closely 
watched dollar terms, widening the surplus even as the imbalance 
narrowed in terms of yen for the month and the fiscal year, a 
ministry official said in explaining the preliminary report. 
  For March, the merchandise trade surplus expanded 4.2 
percent 
on a customs-cleared basis from the same month a year before to 
13,952 million dollars. 
  The black ink with the United States swelled 21.1 percent in 
March to 4.96 billion dollars, after a decline in February from 
the year-earlier level. For the fiscal year ended March 31, the 
surplus rose for the third year in a row, up 11.8 percent to 
51.14 billion dollars. 
  But that regional surplus was exceeded for the first time by 
the fiscal year surplus with Asia, where booming regional 
economies sucked up a markedly bigger chunk of Japan's exports, 
the official said. 
  Overall, both imports and exports of semiconductors surged 
in 
the month. Exports of audio equipment declined and auto 
exports, although up sharply to the U.S., fell overall. 
  Imports of crude oil and petroleum products sank in dollar 
and yen terms as prices fell, even though volume edged higher. 
Imports of computers and other office equipment rose, however. 
  The Japanese currency was up 12.2 percent in March from a 
year before to an average 105.07 yen to the dollar and up 15.7 
percent for the fiscal year to 108.17 yen, the official said. 
  The higher yen continues to inflate Japan's surplus in 
dollar 
terms, although theoretically it eventually curbs the surplus by 
hiking Japanese export prices in foreign currencies while making 
imports cheaper in yen. 
  In yen terms, the trade surplus fell 7.0 percent in March 
from a year before to 1,467 billion yen and declined 4.7 percent 
for the fiscal year to 13,175 billion yen. 
  Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito noted that the yen-based 
surplus fell for a third straight fiscal year. 
  In volume terms, Japan's surplus "is clearly declining," he 
told a regular news conference after the report was issued. The 
rise in the dollar-denominated surplus was mainly caused by the 
"price factor" -- the effect of the high yen -- Saito said. 
  He indicated he sees no reason for new measures to boost 
Japan's domestic demand, a key request from Washington, 
expressing hope that the fiscal 1994 budget and recent fiscal 
stimulus packages will spur domestic demand. But he 
acknowledged that budget debate, hamstrung by political turmoil, 
has not begun. 
  Japan's March surplus with the U.S. rose as exports climbed 
12.6 percent in dollar terms from a year before, outstripping a 
6.1 percent rise in imports. 
  Exports of autos to the recovering U.S. economy were up 14 
percent while semiconductor exports jumped 34 percent, the 
report said. But exports of audio equipment sank 22 percent. 
  Japan's U.S. imports included a 65 percent jump for meat and 
a 33 percent rise in alcoholic beverages. Even among 
high-value-added products, imports of U.S. autos soared 43 
percent and those of semiconductors climbed 14 percent. 
  Such figures show "a significant change in the structure of 
trade" between the world's two biggest economies, said Mineko 
Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Japan Ltd. But 
the dollar-denominated surplus will remain high for some time, 
she said. 
  Japan's surplus with Asia rose 11.3 percent in March from a 
year before in the 23rd straight gain to 6.53 billion dollars. 
That helped send the fiscal year surplus up a thumping 25.1 
percent to 55.95 billion dollars to exceed the imbalance with 
the U.S. for the first time ever, the Finance Ministry's 
official told reporters. 
  The surplus to the region's newly industrializing economies 
has exceeded that with the U.S. since fiscal 1991, but rising 
exports to such other Asian nations as Pakistan and India sent 
the regional total markedly higher, he said. 
  Japan's trade gap with the European Union, however, slimmed 
21.0 percent in March to 2.27 billion dollars in the third 
straight monthly drop. For the fiscal year, the surplus slumped 
21.8 percent to 24.25 billion dollars.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yi Nam-chu, deputy director of the Institute </F>
of Korean Affairs affiliated with the General Association of 
Korean Residents in Japan, Chongnyon, by International News 
reporter Bungo Osawa; place and date not given; first paragraph 
is MAINICHI SHIMBUN introduction] 
  [Text] We asked Mr. Yi Nam-chu, deputy director of the 
Institute of Korean Affairs, a research institute affiliated 
with the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan 
(pro-DPRK or pro-North Korea), to talk about the DPRK's 
suspected development of nuclear arms from the North Korean 
point of view. Yi is a second generation North Korean immigrant 
residing in Japan. He specializes in contemporary Korean 
affairs. 
  [Osawa] How do you look at the present situation of the 
nuclear issue? 
  [Yi] Based on the agreement between North Korea and the 
United States, the DPRK accepted nuclear inspections adequate to 
"maintain the continuity of security measures," but not the 
regular and special inspections. The fact that the United 
States and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
disregarded this agreement, asked for full inspections, and 
submitted the issue to the UN Security Council is an act of 
betrayal. There is no basic disagreement between North Korea 
and the United States on the solution of the problem. The 
change in U.S. approach, and the confusion arising from this is 
probably due to an internal conflict within the U.S. Government. 
  [Osawa] How do you think the nuclear issue can be resolved 
in the end? 
  [Yi] The root cause of the nuclear issue is that the United 
States, which deploys nuclear weapons in South Korea, 
perpetuates a policy of nuclear blackmail and hostility against 
the DPRK. Therefore, there is no other way but to resolve the 
issue through dialogue and negotiations with the United States. 
The two countries have basically agreed on the solution, and 
solutions to issues between North and South Korea have been 
agreed upon during the meeting of the prime ministers of both 
sides. The framework is there. The reason for the failure to 
reach a solution is that there is mutual lack of trust. The 
only thing to do is for both sides to exert simultaneous efforts 
to solve the problems one by one. 
  [Osawa] Is there any possibility that North Korea may resort 
to military action on this issue? 
  [Yi] In principle, North Korea favors dialogue. It should 
be clear to anyone that the economic and military superiority of 
the United States, South Korea, and Japan is overwhelming. By 
common sense, it is impossible that North Korea will start an 
attack against such opponents. We hope the DPRK's peaceful 
stance, as evidenced in its 1987 proposal to the United States 
and South Korea to hold multilateral disarmament consultations 
(negotiations), would also be noted. 
  [Osawa] Secretary Kim Chong-il's succession is a hot issue 
at present. Do you think his taking over will affect the 
nuclear policy? 
  [Yi] The secretary assists the president in all affairs, and 
he exercises direct leadership over the party and the state. 
The two men are inseparable. Our nuclear policy is peace and 
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. We have remained 
consistent and stood firm on our approach to the nuclear issue. 
That is the way for a small nation to survive. The DPRK thinks 
that "if you make one concession to the United States, it will 
ask for two, and you end up being left with nothing." That is 
why it stands firm on its principles in the nuclear issue.

skirmish on Syia Kuala Road, Simpang Beuraweh, Banda Aceh. 
Infantry Colonel Rudy Supriatna, commander of the 012 Teuku 
Umar Military Resort Command, said the military personnel 
intercepted T. Yun, who had twice sent Aceh terrorists for 
training in Libya, thanks to information given by citizens who 
did not want to be terrorized by his group. T. Yun had used 
five pseudonyms. The shooting of the Aceh terrorist leader, 
which was preceded by a pursuit by the military personnel on 
Syia Kuala Road along the Krueng River, was witnessed by 
thousands of people.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Chinese Ambassador to 
Japan Xu Dunxin urged Japanese companies Monday [18 April] to 
invest not only in China's seaside areas but also in the inland, 
saying inland areas have a great potential for development. 
  "It's timely to advance into the inland now," said Xu, 
speaking to Japanese business executives at a KYODO NEWS 
SERVICE-sponsored lecture session at a Tokyo hotel. He said 
China's vast southwestern areas have rich natural resources and 
a low-cost labor force. 
  "The inland areas have weak points in transportation and 
infrastructure...but Japan is good at these fields and thus has 
a lot it can do there," Xu said. He said the Chinese Government 
has also increased its infrastructure investment in inland areas. 
  Xu also said China will continue efforts to bring a 
"peaceful 
and amicable" solution to problems related to North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons development, saying such efforts so 
far have helped. However, he asked international society not to 
expect too much of Beijing, adding China is not among the 
parties directly concerned with the matter.

Marrakech, Morocco. 
  In Marrakech, he attended a four-day ministerial meeting of 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) member nations 
to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round of multilateral 
trade talks. 
  Hata, a front-runner to succeed the outgoing prime minister, 
hinted at a possible tie-up with former Foreign Minister Michio 
Watanabe of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who has 
expressed his readiness to run for the upcoming Diet vote for 
the premiership. 
  Watanabe, head of the LDP's third largest faction, also has 
disclosed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito 
[Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the 
two key parties in the ruling coalition. 
  Hata told reporters at Haneda Airport, "I would like to 
respect his determination. He is fit to be a leader." 
  Hata said, "I have never said whether or not I strengthened 
my resolution," when asked by reporters about the possibility of 
his candidacy for the next premiership. He also opposed a 
speed-before-quality Diet election for the next premier, urging 
sufficient discussion and preparation.

  [Text] A government source disclosed on 12 April that, in 
connection with concluding the "Prevention of Accidental 
Incidents Treaty" with the ROK, the Japanese Government plans to 
make no reference to the airspace around Takeshima in the 
treaty. In response to suspected nuclear arms development in 
the DPRK (North Korea), both governments hope to reach an 
agreement on the treaty under which either nation will be 
required to give advance notice of flight plans by its military 
aircraft. Currently, there exists a territorial dispute between 
the two nations over Takeshima. 
  Japan and the ROK plan to conclude the treaty to prevent 
accidents that could occur between Japanese and ROK aircraft on 
missions in Tsushima airspace, where Japanese and ROK air 
defense identification zones (ADIZ) overlap. However, there 
remains a problem as to how the two nations plan to deal with 
Takeshima, over which there is a territorial dispute. So far, 
Japan has not dared to send off its military aircraft on 
missions around this island as it arouse the territorial issue. 
Thus, the area has been treated in the same manner as the 
northern territories, being set aside as a sort of gray zone in 
connection with defense-related matters. 
  In the process of concluding the agreement, the Japanese 
Government has decided to follow its past tradition, planning 
not to mention Takeshima in the treaty for the time being and to 
only ask for prior notification of planned flights over the 
Tsushima Straits, where both nation's military aircraft 
frequently fly over.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- The ruling coalition 
parties hope to hammer out an accord Monday [18 April] on 
fundamental policies for a new coalition government to succeed 
the one led by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, coalition 
officials said Saturday. 
  At a meeting of their executives, the ruling parties started 
efforts to synchronize policies on such key issues as political 
reform, Tokyo's stand to be taken toward North Korea's alleged 
nuclear arms program, its international contributions and tax 
reform, the officials said. 
  New party Sakigake, one of the coalition parties which 
declared Friday that it will not take a post in a new cabinet, 
did not send its representative to the meeting. 
  The senior coalition officials confirmed the ruling parties 
will stick with a policy accord reached before the startup of 
the Hosokawa administration last August, Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) secretary general Wataru Kubo told a news conference. 
  Kubo also said the parties should reach an agreement calling 
for early Diet approval of the already overdue fiscal 1994 
budget as the next government's "urgent and most important task." 
  If a broad agreement is reached on basic policies at the 
secretary general-level of coalition executives at their next 
meeting Monday afternoon, leaders of the coalition parties will 
hold a summit to give a stamp of approval, said Kubo of the SDP, 
the largest coalition contingent. 
  The policy discussions followed a week of political turmoil 
triggered by Hosokawa's abrupt decision to call it quits on 
April 8. Hosokawa, who shot to power last August, will remain on 
board until his successor is chosen. 
  On the stance Japan will take toward North Korea's suspected 
nuclear arms program, the SDP, which has traditionally 
maintained close ties with the (North) Korean Workers' Party, 
will not face difficulties in working out a common policy, Kubo 
said. 
  "We will honor a UN decision and strive to do all we can 
within the bounds of the constitution," he said, in a reference 
to the SDP's readiness to respect the possibility of UN 
sanctions against the communist country. 
  At Saturday's meeting, the ruling party representatives 
concurred on the need to solve the question of how to define the 
role of Japan-U.S. security arrangements, Kubo and other 
coalition officials said. 
  They also reaffirmed that the ruling parties will continue 
their talks on tax system reform, a topic on which the coalition 
parties' policies are way apart, the officials said. 
  After the coalition chiefs decide on the final shape of a 
policy agreement, the ruling parties will move to nominate 
Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. 
  Hata, concurrently serving as deputy prime minister, will 
return to Japan on Sunday from Marrakech, Morocco, where he 
represented Japan at a ministerial meeting of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to sign a new global trade pact. 
  Meanwhile, Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president Yohei 
Kono and veteran faction leader Michio Watanabe will hold a 
second round of talks on Monday to compare notes on who should 
be the main opposition's candidate in an upcoming Diet vote for 
the premiership, LDP officials said. 
  LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori and Masaaki Nakayama, 
secretary general of Watanabe's faction, the LDP's third largest 
power bloc, reached the agreement in a Saturday morning meeting, 
the officials said. 
  The accord came one day after Kono and Watanabe failed to 
reach a compromise on the LDP's candidate for premier. 
  During Friday's session, Kono asked Watanabe not to break 
with the LDP but to help maintain the unity of the once-dominant 
party. 
  Watanabe, however, expressed his willingness to form a new 
alliance with Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, the 
two key forces in the ruling coalition, in order to "surmount 
the crises now confronting this country." 
  The LDP, toppled from power last August after 38 years of 
unbroken rule, is currently Japan's largest opposition party and 
is still the single biggest party. It controls 214 members in 
the 511- member House of Representatives. 
  In a related move, Nakayama told reporters the Watanabe 
faction will retract its demand for an LDP endorsement of their 
chief as the prime ministerial candidate if the governing 
coalition decides to sweep Hata to the premiership.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with IAEA Director General Hans Blix </F>
by unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter in Hiroshima on 13 
April] 
  [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What did the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) find in its inspections of nuclear 
facilities in North Korea in March? 
  [Blix] What matters is that we failed to thoroughly check a 
radiochemical laboratory. Thus, we are not sure whether the 
laboratory has been used only for peaceful purposes. We need to 
know what North Koreans are doing in the laboratory. Although 
it is more important to check two undeclared nuclear facilities, 
the DPRK has rejected our request for special inspections. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The U.S. paper THE WASHINGTON POST 
reported that North Korea is constructing another nuclear 
reprocessing line. Is it true? 
  [Blix] Yes, it is. IAEA inspectors confirmed a glove box in 
the facility. They also knew from experience that the facility 
was a nuclear reprocessing line when they checked the shapes of 
other facilities. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How much plutonium will North Korea be 
able to produce in a year when this facility is completed? 
  [Blix] It could double the nation's current capacity. I 
cannot say the exact amount. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How much plutonium do you think the DPRK 
has extracted so far from the existing 5-megawatt reactor? 
  [Blix] North Korea asserted that it took out broken fuel 
rods from the reactor and declared the removal of a certain 
amount of material. However, our sampling analysis found that 
they took out more fuel rods than they declared. The worst part 
is that we do not know how many times North Korea engaged in 
nuclear reprocessing and how much plutonium they extracted. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The DPRK is also constructing a 
50-megawatt reactor. 
  [Blix] The 50-megawatt reactor will soon go into operation. 
They are also constructing a 200-megawatt reactor outside of 
Yongbyon. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the DPRK should increase the 
openness of its nuclear program, including its future plans for 
use of nuclear energy? 
  [Blix] Of course. Currently, their nuclear program is 
utterly unclear. 
  [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Japan has started the operation of the 
fast breeder reactor "Monju," thereby entering the era of 
plutonium use. What do you think of Japan's use of plutonium 
and its development of fast breeder reactors? 
  [Blix] From a long-term viewpoint, the development of fast 
breeder reactors is a sound investment. However, it is not 
economical, since uranium is now less expensive and safety 
devices for fast breeder reactors are relatively expensive. I 
hope that Japan, France, and Russia will actively promote 
research on fast breeder reactors. The research is also 
significant for the rest of the world.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- Following is a summary of 
a draft of the ruling coalition's fundamental policy accord 
proposed Saturday [16 April] by the Japan New Party of outgoing 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The ruling parties hope to 
agree Monday on their policy accord to be carried out under a 
new government led by Hosokawa's successor. 
  (Budget and Financial Reform) 
  Ruling parties will endeavor to speedily enact 1994 budget 
bills on which the Diet has not even begun deliberations. The 
ruling parties will endeavor to swiftly agree on drawing up of 
1995 budget bills that should be consumer-oriented. 
  (Political Reform) 
  The coalition will swiftly submit bills to the Diet on 
locations of 300 single-seat constituencies for House of 
Representatives elections, based on advice to be made in six 
months by a panel. 
  After enacting the bills, the coalition will carry out a 
lower house general election under a new electoral system under 
which 300 of the 500 lower house members will be elected from 
single-seat districts and the remaining 200 through proportional 
representation. 
  (Korean Peninsula and Japan's Security) 
  The situation on the Korean peninsula, including North 
Korea's suspected nuclear arms development, is a quite serious 
matter for Asian and Japanese security. The international 
community should cooperate to impede the development of nuclear 
arms on the Korean peninsula. 
  The coalition also thinks it important to resolve the issue 
through persistent negotiations, in cooperation with such 
countries as the United States, China and South Korea, not to 
make North Korea isolated in international society. 
  Japan will secure peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula 
and in Japan, abiding by the policy of the United Nations and 
preparing for emergencies. 
  The coalition recognizes that Japan's Constitution has an 
ultimate ideal based on the international collective security 
under the UN. In order to secure world peace and Japan's 
security, Japan will adhere to the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty 
and actively participate in UN peacekeeping activities. 
  (Japan-U.S. Relations and International Cooperation) 
  As a premise for solidifying friendly relationship between 
Japan and the U.S., Japan will endeavor to reduce its trade 
surplus step by step to an appropriate level. 
  Japan will swiftly enact international agreements and laws 
related to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade talks under 
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
  (Aging Society and Tax Reform) 
  The coalition will establish welfare policies to tackle the 
problems of the aging society. The coalition will promote 
constructing infrastructures for higher standards of living. 
  On condition that bureaucracy and finance will be reformed, 
the coalition will endeavor to secure a source of revenue to 
offset a tax reduction. Japan will carry out by the end of the 
year a drastic tax system reform which will center on reviewing 
the balance between direct and indirect taxes. 
  (Deregulation and Other Economic Reform) 
  The coalition will adopt thorough measures to make the 
recovery of the economy more certain. The coalition will change 
economic structures by promoting information and communications 
industries, new industries and small- and medium-sized 
enterprises. 
  The coalition will loosen regulations in order to foster 
international cooperation in the field of economic activities. 
  (Decentralization and Other Administrative Reform) 
  The coalition aims to simplify and streamline the 
administration and positively promote decentralization. 
  (Development of Rural Areas and Agricultural Reform) 
  The coalition will endeavor to promote agricultural, 
forestry 
and fisheries areas in order to raise Japan's self-sufficiency 
rates. The coalition will help introduce market methods for 
production, distribution and sales system of agricultural 
products and aid reform in agricultural cooperatives. 
  (Constructing Foundation of People's Lives) 
  The coalition considers education as the basis of the 
country 
and will endeavor to realize a society where men and women live 
harmoniously and equally and where people can lead a fulfilled 
life.

  [Text] Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA] spokesman 
Terusuke Terada issued a statement on 15 April supporting the 
South Korean policy which was announced by Yi Yong-tok, deputy 
prime minister and concurrently chief of the National 
Unification Board, on the same day in connection with North 
Korea's (DPRK's) suspected nuclear weapon development. In 
announcing the policy, Deputy Prime Minister Yi stated that 
South Korea would not seek the exchange of special envoys 
between South Korea and North Korea any more, and called for 
South-North dialogue to pave the way for implementing mutual 
inspections of their military facilities. 
  In his statement, spokesman Terada said: "We highly 
appreciate the policy because it aims at promoting dialogue 
between South and North and seeking a solution to the situation 
through such dialogue, in line with a presidential statement 
issued by the UN Security Council."

  [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata emerged as the favorite Saturday night [16 April] to 
succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as the ruling 
coalition reached basic agreement on key policies, coalition 
sources said. The sources said deputies of the ruling coalition 
parties will resume talks on Monday to finalize the accord and 
send it to the heads of the coalition parties, who will then 
decide to choose Hata, 58, as their candidate for premiership. 
  Parliamentary balloting for the next prime minister is 
likely 
to take place either April 19 or 20 and Hata, who is also deputy 
premier, will become the new Japanese leader. 
  Saturday's agreement was bad news for former Foreign 
Minister 
Michio Watanabe of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party, who sources said may decide not to run for prime minister 
because of a lack of support. 
  Hata left Marrakech, Morocco on Friday morning for Tokyo 
after attending high-level talks and signing a new global trade 
pact. 
  Watanabe will hold a second round of talks with LDP 
President 
Yohei Kono on Monday in which Kono will try to talk 70-year-old 
Watanabe into abandoning his plans to succeed Hosokawa, 56, LDP 
sources said. 
  Watanabe has toyed with an idea of quitting the LDP and 
seeking an alliance with Shinseito [Japan renewal Party], of 
which Hata is leader, and Komeito [Clean Government Party], in a 
bid to become the next prime minister. But sources close to the 
Watanabe faction inside the LDP predicted that Watanabe would 
drop plans to run for premiership. 
  During the meeting of the deputies, the ruling parties 
ironed 
out their differences over such key issues as political reform, 
Tokyo's policy toward North Korea's alleged nuclear arms 
program, its international contributions and tax reform, 
officials said. 
  New party Sakigake [Harbinger Party], one of the coalition 
parties which declared Friday that it will not take a post in a 
new cabinet, did not send its representative to the meeting. 
  The senior coalition officials confirmed the ruling parties 
will stick with a policy accord reached before the startup of 
the Hosokawa administration last August, Social Democratic Party 
(SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] Secretary 
General Wataru Kubo told a news conference. 
  Kubo also said the parties should reach an agreement calling 
for early Diet approval of the already overdue fiscal 1994 
budget as the next government's "urgent and most important task." 
  The policy discussions followed a week of political turmoil 
triggered by Hosokawa's abrupt decision to call it quits on 
April 8. 
  On the stance Japan will take toward North Korea's suspected 
nuclear arms program, the SDP, which has traditionally 
maintained close ties with the (North) Korean Workers' Party, 
will not face difficulties in working out a common policy, Kubo 
said. "We will honor a U.N. decision and strive to do all we 
can within the bounds of the Constitution," he said, in a 
reference to the SDP's readiness to respect the possibility of 
U.N. sanctions against the communist country. 
  At Saturday's meeting, the ruling party representatives 
concurred on the need to solve the question of how to define the 
role of Japan-U.S. security arrangements, Kubo and other 
coalition officials said.

  [Text] Japan's deregulation is likely to become the major 
trade topic between Japan and European Union (EU), as well as 
between Japan and the United States. With an aim to reduce 
trade deficits against Japan, EU has urged the Japanese 
Government to positively promote deregulation in various 
sectors, particularly in telecommunications, the distribution 
system, and three other sectors. It is believed that this issue 
will be taken up for discussion at a ministerial-level meeting 
of Japan and EU scheduled for this weekend. The Japanese 
Government may be asked to take EU's wishes into consideration 
when working out the additional package for easing regulations 
in late June. 
  The ministerial-level meeting between Japan and EU will be 
held in Tokyo on 22 and 23 April. However, depending on Japan's 
political situation, there is a possibility of postponement. 
  EU urged Japan through diplomatic channels to give priority 
to implementing measures for import expansion, promotion of 
investment in Japan, and liberalization of the market, as well 
as promotion of deregulation in the telecommunications market, 
and in the distribution system. 
  EU plans to indicate details of its request in the bilateral 
ministerial-level meeting. A government source said that with 
regard to the "telecommunications," EU asks for easing the 
regulation on the ratio of foreign companies' investment in 
Japanese telecommunications companies (the ratio should be less 
than one- third under the present regulation). EU further 
requests that business licenses should be issued more freely. 
  Concerning the "distribution system," EU demands that Large 
Retail Stores Law should be reviewed comprehensively so as to 
reduce regulations drastically, and that the Fair Trade 
Commission should investigate "distribution control" by the 
National Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives Associations 
(Zenno). 
  Regarding the "import expansion measures," EU urges adoption 
of EU's safety standards for electric appliances in the Japanese 
market so that companies of EU nations will not have to apply 
for approval based on the Japanese standards before selling 
their products in Japan. 
  The surplus of Japanese exports to EU nations over imports 
was about $26 billion in 1993. Although it dropped for the 
first time in three years, EU is still dissatisfied, saying the 
"surplus is still at a high level." Some EU officials said 
"Japan's trade policies are exclusively U.S.-oriented." 
  EU also shows a critical attitude toward U.S. trade policy. 
Some government officials said that if Japan succeeds in 
strengthening cooperative ties with EU nations, it will be 
advantageous to Japan for checking U.S. hardline attitude toward 
it.

  [Text] On 7 April, the International Trade and Industry 
Ministry Patent Office disclosed that Japan's official 
development assistance (ODA) program will be expanded and 
applied to a private training program on industrial property 
rights. The aim of private training programs using ODA funding 
has so far been to promote exchanges of technology. But 
additional ODA funds will now be used to support a training 
program on Japanese industrial property rights, which will be 
carried out from this fall by the Japan Institute of Invention 
and Innovation [JIII] (an auxiliary organization to the Patent 
Office). This is in response to the agreement on Trade Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) reached in the 
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which urges 
developing countries to establish an industrial property system. 
Tokyo plans to assist developing countries mainly in Asia in 
establishing the system, thereby exporting Japan's system of 
protecting property rights to those countries. 
  The training program will be carried out mainly by the 
Industrial Property Patents and International Cooperation 
Training Center, which was established by the JIII on 1 April. 
  The center will dispatch Japanese private sector patent 
specialists to foreign countries and also invite specialists 
from foreign companies so that Japan's patent application system 
for such products as computer circuits and semiconductors will 
take root overseas. 
  ASEAN will be a main participant in the project. The project 
will be funded by a portion of an ODA subsidy (which totals 9 
billion yen in fiscal 1993) provided to the Japan Overseas 
Development Council (JODC) and the Association for Overseas 
Technical Scholarship (AOTS). The subsidy will cover one-third 
to one-half of trainees' living expenses during their stay in 
Japan. 
  Developing countries have been trying to establish an 
industrial property system following the Uruguay Round 
agreement, which obligates them to establish one. The United 
States and the European Union have been working to export their 
own industrial property systems to developing countries in a bid 
to help private companies make inroads into those countries in 
the future. Similarly, Japan's training program is aimed at 
conforming an industrial property system in Asia to Japan's to 
back Japanese companies in making inroads into developing 
countries in Asia.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- A key ruling political 
player indicated Sunday [17 April] the governing coalition will 
not back former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the Liberal 
Democratic Party (LDP) as new prime minister. 
  Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa said in TV programs, "The coalition parties are making 
efforts to establish a sense of unity over policies within the 
current framework of the coalition. There will be no major 
changes under the current situation." 
  Watanabe has expressed his readiness to leave the LDP to 
challenge the premiership, but Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, 
head of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a core party in the 
seven- party coalition, is emerging as a front-runner to succeed 
outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Hata returned home earlier Sunday from Morocco, where he 
attended a ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade, to plunge himself into a race for prime 
ministership. 
  Speaking to reporters upon arrival at Tokyo's Haneda 
Airport, 
Hata, however, was evasive in answering a question whether he 
will enter into a race for premiership. "I have never said 
whether or not I strengthened my resolution," the foreign 
minister tersely said. 
  However, Ichikawa, one of the main strategists in the 
coalition, welcomed Watanabe's move, saying the possible 
secession of the head of one of the LDP's power blocs will 
facilitate a split of the LDP, in power for 38 years until last 
August when it was ousted by Hosokawa's coalition. 
  Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic 
Party 
(SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ], said in a TV program Sunday the SDP 
will not vote for Watanabe in the upcoming Diet premiership 
election. 
  The official of the largest power bloc in the coalition was 
responding to a question about the SDP's reaction if Watanabe 
were to run for the premiership vote. Kubo, when asked about a 
coalition candidate for the next prime minister, said the SDP 
will respect a coalition agreement. 
  Ichikawa showed his willingness for a would-be tie-up with 
an 
LDP splinter group headed by Michihiko Kano, a former state 
minister in charge of the Management and Coordination Agency. 
He said he has no reason to reject cooperation with Kano's 
group if Kano expresses his intention for a tie-up and if the 
coalition is able to reach an accord on major policies with his 
group. 
  Kano, who seceded from the LDP on Friday, indicated during a 
TV program Sunday that his five-member group may support Hata 
for the Diet premiership election, saying, "I have promoted 
political reforms together with Mr. Hata and I have an 
understanding of his political posture." 
  Hata, with his close associate Ichiro Ozawa, bolted the LDP 
last summer and inaugurated Shinseito in order to form a 
coalition with other non-LDP parties. 
  Kano said they will not vote for LDP President Yohei Kono as 
they have withdrawn from the conservative party. Kono plans to 
stand as a candidate for the nation's top administrative post.

    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in 
Japanese on 17 April broadcasts at 0000 GMT its "Sunday 
Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) political talk show. This episode 
is 120-minutes long, is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi 
Yamamoto, and carries separate live interviews with Masayoshi 
Takemura, representative of Sakigake (Harbinger); Wataru Kubo, 
general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Japan 
(SDPJ); Komeito secretary general Yuichi Ichikawa; Shinseito 
Acting Chief Secretary Kozo Watanabe; Michihiko Kano, one of 
five former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) members who recently 
left the LDP; Koji Kakizawa, member of the LDP's Watanabe 
faction; and Shigeru Kasuya, acting LDP secretary general. 
Freelance commentator Naoki Tanaka also joins the program as an 
interviewer. 
  At 0003 GMT, after a short video clip reviewing moves by the 
coalition toward forming the new government, and the split in 
the LDP, Yamamoto starts interviewing Sakigake head Takemura, 
who recently said that his party will not take any posts in the 
new cabinet but will support the new cabinet. He says his party 
will cooperate with the new government in tackling such 
immediate issues as enactment of the budget bill because his 
party has responsibility to carry out tasks assigned to the 
outgoing Hosokawa government in which Sakigake was one of the 
coalition partners. He stresses the next prime minister should 
be chosen at a meeting of heads of each ruling party. In 
connection with this, Takemura expresses doubts about Shinseito 
Secretary General Ozawa's political methods, questioning Ozawa's 
initiative in making decisions in the ruling coalition while 
citing specific examples such as debates on a consumption tax 
hike. 
  Asked if his party will stand against the new coalition 
government after carrying out such tasks as enactment of the 
budget bill, Takemura says: "No, we are not thinking of taking a 
stand against the coalition." He notes his party's position 
depends on what policies the new coalition will come up with. 
Asked whether his party will support Foreign Minister Hata as 
the new prime minister if other ruling parties agree to choose 
him as successor to Hosokawa, Takemura says: "Yes, we are 
determined to support him." Asked if there is any possibility 
that his party will support LDP Vice President Watanabe as 
candidate for the new premiership, he says: "Actually we have 
not discussed such a possibility yet." On the secession of five 
LDP members, including former Management and Coordination Agency 
Director General Kano from the party, Takemura says: "I strongly 
hope to join hands with them in the near future." The interview 
ends at 0026 GMT. 
  The second interviewee, SDPJ General Secretary Kubo, joins 
the program through a satellite hookup. Kubo first explains the 
differences in views between the current coalition group and 
Sakigake on how to form the new cabinet. Commentator Tanaka 
then notes he does not believe that in the new government, the 
SDPJ will not take ministerial posts of foreign affairs and 
finance as well as defense affairs because of the party's 
differing position from other parties on such issues as North 
Korea, and asks Kubo to comment. Kubo says: "Our party has not 
discussed the line-up of the new cabinet." Kubo goes on to say 
that there are no big differences between the SDPJ and other 
ruling parties over policies. On the issue concerning North 
Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons, he notes: "The 
SDPJ insists that North Korea should accept nuclear inspections 
and remain as a member of the NPT. There is no difference in 
policies on this matter between the ruling parties. If North 
Korea rejects inspections, our party will make efforts to settle 
the issue with emphasis on dialogue. I think an agreement will 
be reached among the ruling parties on this matter. If the 
situation should become worse, we have to respect the decisions 
of the United Nations." He adds: "While respecting decisions of 
the United Nations, Japan has to make all-out efforts to do what 
it has to do within the limits of the Constitution." Kubo then 
discusses the SDPJ's position on such issues as tax and 
administrative reform. 
  Asked whether the SDPJ will possibly support LDP's Watanabe 
as a candidate for the premiership, Kubo rules it out, saying: 
"One hundred percent, no." Kubo says he thinks Shinseito's Hata 
is also a qualified person for the premiership. Kubo notes the 
premiership election should be held as early as possible so the 
new cabinet will be formed soon. The interview ends at 0048 GMT. 
  The third interviewee is Komeito secretary general Ichikawa. 
Asked whether the framework of the ruling coalition is changing 
amid the current political turmoil, Ichikawa says he does not 
think so, but blames Takemura for the deterioration of the 
coalition's framework. Ichikawa denies allegations that he and 
Shinseito's Ozawa act high-handedly in the ruling coalition, 
noting the decision-making process of the coalition is 
transparent. He then discusses Komeito's position on such 
issues as tax reform. 
  Asked whether it is true that the present political 
confusion stems from conflict between Sakigake's Takemura and 
Ozawa of Shinseito, Ichikawa denies it. Asked what the ruling 
coalition will do if the LDP's Watanabe should leave, Ichikawa 
says: "If he, who is a leader of his own faction and has 
experience as deputy prime minister, leaves the LDP, regardless 
of the number of those who follow him, it will create a 
sensation." He adds: "We are watching Mr. Watanabe's moves and, 
in this sense, we will welcome him if he secedes from the LDP." 
He then notes it is possible to tie up with another former LDP 
group led by Mr. Kano, who recently seceded from the LDP. The 
interview concludes at 0110 GMT. 
  Following Ichikawa, Shinseito acting Secretary General Kozo 
Watanabe is interviewed. Watanabe first notes that an agreement 
is expected to be reached among the ruling parties on the basic 
policies of the new cabinet. He also says after reaching an 
official agreement on basic policies tomorrow, the ruling 
coalition will decide on who should be a candidate for the 
premiership. Asked if Shinseito actually hopes to reorganize 
the framework of the coalition in cooperation with would-be 
defectors from the LDP, while kicking the SDPJ out of the 
coalition, Watanabe says: "It will never happen." Asked how 
Shinseito will react if the LDP's Watanabe seeks Shinseito's 
support in the prime ministerial election, he says: "It is 
presumptuous to comment on this matter" because the ruling 
coalition is to meet on 18 April to decide on a candidate for 
the premiership. Watanabe says Shinseito welcomes the departure 
of former Management and Coordination Agency Director General 
Kano and his colleagues from the LDP. The interview ends at 
0125 GMT. 
  Michihiko Kano, who recently seceded from the LDP, is asked 
why he left the LDP. Kano says he felt it was difficult to 
achieve political reform under the current framework of the LDP. 
He also notes he left the LDP to work on regaining public trust 
in politics. He discusses the need for the LDP to dissolve the 
faction system and adopt the age-limit system. Kano stresses he 
plans to form a new party in the near future with other 
defectors. The interview ends at 0139 GMT. 
  Koji Kakizawa, a member of the LDP's Watanabe faction, and 
acting LDP secretary general Shigeru Kasuya are interviewed 
next. Asked why LDP Vice President Watanabe wants to become the 
next prime minister, Kakizawa explains that Watanabe is eager to 
tackle various domestic and foreign problems. Kasuya says it is 
hoped that Watanabe will stay in the LDP. Kasuya criticizes 
those who have left the LDP, or plan to leave the party. Asked 
about the possibility that the LDP will support Watanabe as a 
sole LDP candidate for prime minister, Kasuya rules out such a 
possibility. 
  The program concludes at 0200 GMT.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] will assist the six ASEAN nations in developing 
industrial technology. First, a plan for cooperation will be 
worked out to introduce the TQC [total quality control] system, 
which is a typical method of production management adopted by 
Japanese companies. Then, the system will be put into practice 
in April 1995 according to the plan. Moreover, joint studies on 
industrial technology will be promoted with Indonesia, Malaysia, 
and Thailand, respectively. By assisting the development of 
manufacturing industries in the ASEAN nations, the MITI will 
establish a complementary system for Japanese companies and 
companies of these nations. 
  A standardization and quality control committee composed of 
representatives from MITI and quality control agencies in the 
ASEAN nations will sign an agreement on this cooperative plan as 
early as this month. According to the agreement, the Japanese 
Government and the committee will work out a program to 
introduce Japan's TQC system to the ASEAN nations; the program 
will be implemented for five years from April 1995; seminars 
will be held by inviting company executives and production 
managers from those nations to Japan; and Japanese technical 
experts will be sent to those nations to give instruction on 
quality control. 
  As for bilateral cooperation in developing industrial 
technology, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have been 
initially selected as partners. MITI and these nations will 
exchange information on policies of technological development. 
Furthermore, joint studies will be promoted on selected 
subjects by Japan's national research institutes and institutes 
in these nations.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The ruling coalition was 
moving Monday [17 April] toward selecting Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata as the successor to outgoing Prime Minister 
Morihiro Hosokawa, political sources said. Representatives of 
the coalition will agree Monday afternoon on a policy platform 
for the formation of a new government and coalition chiefs are 
likely to sign the accord the same day, coalition sources said. 
  Veteran politician Michio Watanabe, 70, of the opposition 
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who expressed his intention 
Sunday to leave the party in a bid for the premiership, hoping 
to gain the backing of the ruling coalition, will make a final 
decision on the proposed move Monday, faction sources said. 
  LDP President Yohei Kono Will meet Watanabe again at 1:30 
P.M. [0430 GMT] Monday to attempt to dissuade him from leaving 
the party, LDP sources said. 
  Kono, who has himself vowed to run in the Diet election as 
his party's official candidate, urged Watanabe on Friday to drop 
his ambitions for the premiership in order to maintain party 
unity but met with no success. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party 
[of Japan], the largest party in the seven-party coalition, said 
Monday he opposes nominating Watanabe as the coalition's 
candidate for premiership, party officials said. He made the 
remark at a meeting with Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the Democratic 
Socialist Party, the officials said. 
  Murayama also expressed opposition to Watanabe being invited 
to join the next cabinet in a position such as deputy prime 
minister, they said. 
  A senior member of the Watanabe faction in the House of 
Councillors said Watanabe may not quit the party. 
  Watanabe said Sunday, "I have a conviction that a cabinet of 
national salvation should be formed to overcome the present 
difficult situation." 
  "I could not become (prime minister) only with LDP support. 
As I have to ask for the support of many people, I will 
naturally renounce my party membership," he said. 
  But so far, only some 20 LDP members are expected to quit 
the 
party to follow Watanabe if he decides to make the break. 
  Meanwhile, five LDP House of Representatives members who 
support Watanabe's bid for the premiership quit the party 
Monday. They are Seiichi Ota, Taku Yamamoto, Shizuo Sato, Koji 
Kakizawa and Shokei Arai. They are members of a suprafactional 
study group in the LDP called the "liberals." 
  Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, quit the party 
Monday. He said he will join Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], a 
key party in the coalition. 
  Five other LDP lower house members who quit the party 
Friday, 
led by Michihiko Kano, former director general of the Management 
and Coordination Agency, formed a new party Monday called New 
Party Mirai (Future). 
  Fumihiko Igarashi, a lower house member of Hosokawa's Japan 
New Party, told reporters he and two other members will quit the 
party and act as independents. 
  Kano hinted that the new five-legislator party may throw its 
parliamentary weight behind a prime ministerial candidate who is 
backed by the ruling coalition. 
  Kano expressed his party's willingness to take part in the 
ongoing policy-making discussions now under way among the seven 
coalition parties. The talks, which began last Saturday, are 
aimed at reconciling coalition members' differences in key areas 
of policy. 
  "If we and the ruling coalition could reach an agreement to 
share the same policies, then we could cast our ballots to 
nominate as the next prime minister a candidate recommended by 
the coalition side," he said. 
  Kano also called on other LDP legislators to join his new 
party. 
  "I call on people who once tried to accomplish political 
reform, together with us, to be courageous and take actions in 
order to bring about a realignment of the political community," 
he said. 
  Kano said he "has given high marks to both" Hata and 
Watanabe 
as able politicians. 
  He said, "although Mr. Watanabe expressed views different 
from ours regarding political reform, I commend him for his 
intention" to break with the LDP. 
  New Party Mirai will advocate as its tenets an emphasis on 
the wishes of the public, compliance with public promises, 
contributions to U.N.-led peace-building efforts, expansion of 
the social infrastructure and transfer of the central 
government's administrative authority to local governments, 
party officials said.

  [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI] has decided to abolish three export-related acts, 
including the export inspection act and the export goods design 
act which control quality and design of export goods produced by 
Japanese firms, by the end of 1997. The decision will be 
incorporated in a basic guideline for a deregulation promotion 
program, which will be compiled by the government in June. The 
government adopted a system of controlling export goods in the 
late 1950's in an effort to promote credibility of Japanese 
products. However, it has decided to withdraw such regulation 
because quality of Japanese products has been improved. The 
government also intends to demonstrate the shift of its trade 
policies both at home and abroad by abolishing these acts which 
have been regarded as a symbol of joint efforts by the 
government and the private sector to promote exports. 
  The three acts to be abolished are: the export inspection 
act; the export goods design act; and the unified trademark act 
on products of small export enterprises. Under the export 
inspection act, enterprises which export designated products are 
obligated to undergo inspection of quality of their products. 
The export goods design act requires registration of design and 
trademarks of export products. Under the unified trademark act 
on products of small export enterprises, the government 
formulates trademarks for products of small enterprises and 
guarantees quality of their goods. Firms which export designated 
products have to pay inspection and certification fees to 
inspection organs. 
  MITI plans to hold a meeting of the Export-Import 
Transaction 
Council on 15 April and a meeting of the Export Inspection and 
Design Council in May to obtain their consent for its decision 
to abolish these three acts. It will promote coordination on 
plans to gradually decrease items subject to the export 
inspection act and the design act beginning this fiscal year and 
to submit a bill on abolishing these acts to an ordinary Diet 
session in 1997. A bill on abolishing the unified trademark act 
on products of small export enterprises will be incorporated in 
a package bill on deregulation which is to be submitted to the 
current Diet session.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- The House of 
Representatives Steering Committee decided Monday to postpone to 
1 P.M. [0400 GMT] Tuesday a decision on the timing of a Diet 
plenary session to choose Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
successor. 
  Committee members decided on the postponement in order to 
monitor the views of the coalition parties and the leading 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party. 
  The postponement means a vote on a successor to Hosokawa 
will 
not take place until on or after Wednesday, parliamentary 
sources said. Hosokawa announced on April 8 that he would 
resign as prime minister.

<F P=106> [Article by Yasuhiro Murota, chief researcher of the Japan </F>
Economic Research Center: "On the Center's Forecast of Japan's 
Economic Structure in 2010: Make Reform To Prevent System 
Fatigue; Enterprises Should Also Attach Importance to Earnings 
and Face Up to the Work of Breaking Through Resource and 
Environment Restraints"] 
  [Text] 1. The Japanese economy will step into a 
period of maturity but it will still be able to achieve an 
average growth rate of 3.5 percent in the first 10 years of the 
21st century. However, this is premised on the realization of 
various system reforms such as financial reform, the opening of 
the market, and decentralization. 
  2. Under such circumstances, enterprises will be 
pressed to shift from conventional management that places 
emphasis only on sales to management that places emphasis on 
earnings from creating new markets. In addition, for future 
enterprise strategies, it is useful to fully utilize business 
econometrics that connects macro economics and individual 
enterprise's micro numerals (financial statements, etc.). 
  3. By the time 2010 arrives, the "wall of 2030," that 
is, global-scale resource and environment restraints will come 
in sight. Japan should tackle these tasks by making the most of 
its high economic power and technical capability. 
  The 21st century is close at hand as we are now about 
halfway 
through the 1990's. By the year 2000, what will become of 
Japan's economic structure? 
<H5>  3.5-Percent Growth Possible if Reform Implemented </H5>
  Japan will face the following two tasks in this period. 
First is what Japan, whose economy steps from adolescence to 
maturity should do to avoid contracting the so-called advanced 
nations disease (the high unemployment rate, twin deficits, 
etc.). The second is how Japan, which has now become a leading 
economic power in the world, should relate itself to the running 
of the future world economy. 
  The center has reached the conclusion that Japan will still 
be able to achieve 3.5-percent growth in the 2000's without 
contracting the advanced-nations disease, provided that 
necessary system reforms are implemented. 
  Japan will have to make the best use of this economic power 
to actively face up to the tasks of the world economy, including 
the reduction of gaps between the North and the South. In this 
case, the 1990's will serve as a period of reform for such tasks 
to be put on track. 
  By setting up a computing system suited for the long-term 
economic forecast, we have carried out various simulations. This 
system is a distributed-type simulator enabling a PC-based 
dialogue, and it is made up of three parts--the data base, the 
model computation (the econometric model, the inter-industry 
relations table, etc.) and the output unit (printing, AV 
[audiovisual], etc.). 
  At first, we sought upper and lower limits of the growth 
trajectory of the future Japanese economy. The upper limit 
represents the continuation of the same growth as has been made 
thus far (average growth rate of 4.6 percent by the year 2000 
as was recorded in 1975 through 1990), and the lower limit 
represents a case in which Japan lapses into the 
advanced-nations disease (the average growth rate of 1.5 
percent). As a result, we have learned that either case carries 
its problems. 
  First, in case of high growth, the Japanese economy cannot 
but continue its dependance on foreign demands, thereby becoming 
the sole winner in the world. Its current account surplus will 
reach as much as $300 billion by the year 2010. Even if part of 
the surplus is applied toward aid, international friction with 
various countries will intensify. 
  Moreover, concerning the environmental issue, carbon 
dioxides 
(CO[.sub]2[/]) emission will increase by 10 percent over 
1990, making it impossible to abide by Japan's international 
commitment to "stabilize the amount of emissions by the year 
2000." 
  On the other hand, in case of low growth, there will be a 
burst of economic issues such as the rising unemployment rate (a 
little under 5 percent by 2010), the hollowing out of the 
industrial structure, and twin deficits (fiscal and 
international payments deficits). 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  Then, would there be no way to avoid the advanced-nations 
disease and at the same time to coexist with other countries? 
We have conducted various simulations to search this 
feasibility, and as a result we found that system fatigue must 
be eliminated by carrying out the following reforms: 
  1) Establish healthy finances through restraints on spending 
and the innovations of the tax system and annuities. 2) Promote 
"decentralization" by shifting all activities from 
unipolarization in Tokyo to key cities (hereafter referred to as 
local "decentralization"). 3) Facilitate women's social 
participation by improving nurseries and increasing part-time 
jobs. 4) Open the market to foreign countries. 5) Revitalize 
industries and restore agriculture by means of multimedia as a 
driving force. 
  As a result of such system reforms, the Japanese economy, 
which is to achieve a growth rate of 3.5 percent by the year 
2000 will assume the following aspects. 
<H5>  Need for Enterprises To Cultivate Markets </H5>
  1. The Japanese economy will assume a domestic 
demand-oriented growth. This is attributed to: growth in durable 
consumer goods and leisure time-related consumption due to 
decentralization, annuity expansion, and the increase in leisure 
time; and purchasing houses will become much easier due to local 
decentralization (in key local cities, the price of a house 
will be about five to seven times annual earnings). 
  2. The leading industry will be that of information such as 
PC's, electronics, and communications devices in terms of both 
hardware and software. 
  The realization of multimedia is the key to the development 
of the information industry in the future. We explored the 
possibility in the information industry by introducing 
multimedia in this forecast system. 
  For example, reports on this project are distributed by 
means 
of video, and their details are outputted directly from the 
database and the computing system. 
  On the other hand, the automobile industry, the leading 
industry at present, will reach maturity. Domestic production 
will go down to about 9 million cars (of which, 4 million are to 
be exported) by 2010. In addition, as for agriculture, there is 
a need to actively restore agriculture in terms of food 
security, particularly when there is the possibility that the 
United States will decrease its export of agricultural products 
in the future. Rice production by the year 2010 is estimated to 
be 12 million tons. 
  3. Finances will go into the black through restraints on 
spending, and the innovations of the tax system and the annuity 
system. Meanwhile, the current account will also acquire a 
balance. 
  That is, the balance of trade will go into the red, and this 
deficit will be offset by invisible trade surplus. This means 
that products are imported and earnings are made through 
investment. The transfer payments will continue to be in the red 
to a large extent because of assistance to developing countries, 
etc. In our study, we set the change in business behavior as our 
central subject. All the enterprises had to do in the past was 
secure the growth of sales in step with the high growth of the 
Japanese economy. This linked to the assurance of their 
long-term profits. 
&lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt; 

  However, when the economy attains maturity, because of a 
rise 
in the cost of raw materials and personal expenses, enterprises 
will find it hard to secure sufficient profits by simply keeping 
step with the macro growth. 
  Accordingly, it becomes important for future enterprises to 
cultivate profitable markets by themselves. In short, importance 
should be shifted from sales to earnings. 
  Whenever one studies such an issue, it is important to build 
business behavioral models. Since the beginning of the 1980's, a 
field called business econometrics has developed in the United 
States, and econometric model-building on business structure is 
in progress. 
  However, such a move is sluggish in Japan. In this forecast, 
using business econometrics, we tried to obtain forecast 
numerical values based on macroeconomics and inter-industrial 
relations. We also sought to consolidate financial statements 
(P/L--the profit and loss statement and B/S--the balance sheet). 
  First, we built P/L and B/S models on an all-industry basis 
(corporate business statistics) and then models on each industry 
basis (electric machines, transport equipment, construction, 
retail, iron and steel). 
  In working out a long-range management plan, each enterprise 
has thus far separated the forecasting sector, which estimates 
sales, etc. on the basis of macroeconomic predictions, and the 
financial sector dealing with P/L and B/S. Therefore, it appears 
that the contacts between the two sectors have not always been 
smooth within an enterprise. 
  This is where the Japanese enterprises compare quite poorly 
with their U.S. counterparts. In order for Japanese enterprises 
to lead the world economy in the future, they require a 
philosophy regarding future management of the world economy and 
business strategies which indicate the philosophy in concrete 
and fixed quantities. The full utilization of business 
econometrics will be indispensable for putting this into 
practice. 
<H5>  Resources and Environment Are To Restrain Prosperity </H5>
  Our business analysis through this method revealed several 
mooted points with regard to a conventional break-even analysis 
largely adopted in conventional P/L analysis. That is, the 
linear hypothesis on the cost function and an arbitrary 
classification of fixed and variable costs, on which the current 
analysis is premised, have mooted points, and, in essence, the 
analysis is possible only by using the model we worked out 
herein. 
  For example, the break-even point of "all industries" is 85 
percent by 2010 under the conventional method, but it is 68 
percent according to our model. This smaller percentage for our 
model is because the gradual rise in the cost curve is clearly 
reflected and because fixed and variable parts are distinguished 
in all items. This alone indicates that the break-even analysis 
of the conventional type has many mooted points. 
  In this context, if necessary reforms in various fields are 
carried out, Japan will be able to attain considerable 
prosperity and fulfill its appropriate role in the management of 
the global economy by the year 2000. 
  Will Japan be able to continue its prosperity for long 
thereafter as well? We cannot necessarily have an optimistic 
view in this regard. This is because by the year 2010, "the 
wall of the year 2030" (the actualization of the resource and 
environment restraints on a global scale) will come in sight 
beyond the horizon. 
  First, with regard to resources, the exhaustion of oil will 
become a problem. According to our calculation, the RP ratio 
[given by dividing reserves by annual consumption) will be 31 by 
2010, but it will go down as low as 14 by 2030. 
  That is, the reserves will meet only 14 years of 
consumption. Reflecting this, the oil export dependence rate on 
the Middle East will reach as high as 65 percent, a critical 
level, by 2010. 
  Moreover, turning to the environment issue, there is a 
fairly 
high possibility that the atmospheric temperature will begin to 
rise around 2030 unless effective measures are taken to restrain 
CO[.sub]2[/] emissions. 
  The ozone layer destruction is a more impending problem. An 
agreement has already been made on the disuse of specific and 
alternative fluorocarbons among the Montreal Protocol 
signatories; the use of alternative fluorocarbons, however, will 
continue for refrigerators, etc., for some time. Some 
alternative fluorocarbons have large short-term ozone layer 
destruction effects, and the warming-up effects of the 
alternative fluorocarbons are several hundred and several 
thousand times as great as CO[.sub]2[/]. A campaign launched 
in some quarters to retrieve them is hardly expected to be a 
cure-all. 
  Accordingly, if the present situation continues, it is 
strongly possible that in the near future an ozone hole will be 
created in the northern hemisphere as well and that the 
intensity of ultraviolet rays on the Earth's surface will 
increase in Europe, the United States, Japan, and elsewhere in 
the northern hemisphere. 
  How could we best cope with these problems? This is the very 
task that Japan should tackle by taking advantage of its 
economic affluence, powerful production means, and technology by 
2010.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 16 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] At a cabinet meeting on 15 April, the government 
decided on an amendment to the Construction Business Law, and 
will submit it to the Diet for deliberation during its current 
session. The amendment aims at preventing a recurrence of 
financial scandals involving general contractors by extending 
the disqualification period from two to five years, during which 
licenses are not issued to construction firms whose licenses 
have been revoked for involvement in bid-riggings, and by 
strengthening punitive provisions in the law. 
  In response to a series of financial scandals involving 
general contractors who have been accused of rigging bids for 
public works projects, last December the Central Council on 
Construction Contracting Business (an advisory body for the 
construction minister) compiled an agenda of proposals calling 
for adoption of an open competitive tender system. The agenda 
also calls for the "exclusion of disqualified construction 
companies from participating in biddings under the new tender 
system" and the "strengthening of penalties." The government 
has decided to amend the Construction Business Law in line with 
the proposals. 
  The Construction Business Law stipulates that if 
representatives or local managers of construction companies are 
sentenced to more than one year in prison, the license of that 
construction company shall be revoked. If revised in accordance 
with the amendment, the Construction Business Law will stipulate 
that if representatives or local managers of construction 
companies are sentenced to imprisonment for any length of time, 
their licenses shall be revoked. Under the Construction 
Business Law to be revised in accordance with the amendment, the 
representatives or local managers of construction firms, if 
found to have falsely stated in their applications for licenses, 
will face less than six months of imprisonment and they will pay 
1-3 million yen in fines if they are found to have continued to 
do their businesses in violation of administrative measures that 
suspend their businesses. 
  The amendment makes it mandatory for construction firms to 
keep construction records of their subcontractors. The 
amendment also calls on construction firms to strengthen their 
guidance systems and to position supervisory engineers on 
construction sites in order for public works projects to be 
implemented properly and fairly. 
  In a bid to develop blue-chip construction companies, the 
amendment calls for extending the effective period of licenses 
from three to five years.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 17 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe told reporters Sunday he will leave the main 
opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Earlier last week 
Watanabe, leader of the third largest power bloc in the LDP, 
disclosed his readiness to run for a Diet premiership election 
to pick the successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
  Watanabe told reporters Sunday, "I will give up my party 
membership as a matter of course." 
  On Friday LDP President Yohei Kono met Watanabe in a bid to 
ask Watanabe not to leave the party. Watanabe, however, 
expressed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito 
and Komeito, the two key parties in the governing coalition, in 
order to "surmount the crises now confronting this country." 
  The second round of Kono-Watanabe talks was scheduled for 
Monday.

  [Text] All major semiconductor makers will increase their 
production of microcontrollers for home electric appliances 
because there is a sign that the slump in sales of home electric 
appliances in Japan has hit bottom. While Toshiba Corporation 
plans to increase its monthly production of microcontrollers -- 
especially 8-bit products for which demand is high in the home 
appliance industry -- by 20 percent by September, Mitsubishi 
Electric Corporation plans to increase monthly production by 14 
percent. The production of microcontrollers is a leading 
indicator for predicting shipments of home electric appliances 
three or six months ahead. Their plans to increase production 
are noteworthy because they indicate that semiconductor makers 
have concluded that business in the home appliance industry will 
be on the full-fledged track for recovery as early as this fall. 
  Toshiba is currently producing a total of 15 million units 
of 
4- bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit microcontrollers monthly at both its 
Oita Plant (located in Oita City) and its subsidiary Iwate 
Toshiba Electronics (located in Kitakami City, with Yasuhiro 
Sumitomo as its president). By September it plans to increase 
production by 3 million units to a total of 18 million units. 
Of the 3 million units, 2 million units are 8-bit 
microcontrollers. The company will shift some production lines 
for 4-bit microcontrollers at Oita Plant to Iwate company to 
increase production of 8-bit microcontrollers at the Oita Plant. 
  Most of the 8-bit microcontrollers will be exported to 
subsidiaries of Japanese home appliance makers in Southeast 
Asia. This is because the subsidiaries have increased their 
production "due to active demand for home electric appliances 
for export to the United States, as well as due to an increase 
in exports to Japan" (according to Toshiba). 
  Mitsubishi is producing a total of 22 million 
microcontrollers -- centering on 4-bit and 8-bit products -- 
monthly both at Kumamoto Corporation (located in 
Nishigoshi-machi, Kumamoto Prefecture) and its Saijo plant 
(located in Saijo City, Ehime Prefecture). It will increase 
production from the current 22 million units to 25 million 
units. Some production lines for memory products at the Saijo 
Plant will be diverted for microcontroller lines. 
  NEC Corporation also plans to increase its monthly 
production 
of microcontrollers by 10 percent by September from the present 
34 million units to 37.5 million units. While Hitachi Ltd. will 
increase production by 25 percent this summer from 16 million 
units to 20 million units, Fujitsu Ltd. will increase production 
by 11 percent by the end of this year from 9 million units to 10 
million units. 
  On the home electric appliance market, the domestic shipment 
of VTR's [video tape recorders] in February registered an 
increase over the same period of the previous year for the 
fourth month in a row. Moreover, there is a sharp increase in 
imports of television sets and VTR's from Southeast Asia in 
response to a growing demand among consumers for low price 
products.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Veteran politician Michio 
Watanabe of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) said 
Sunday he will leave the party, as early as Monday, in a bid for 
the premiership, hoping to gain the backing of the ruling 
coalition. Watanabe's statement came as the ruling coalition 
was moving toward backing Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], as its candidate for premier. 
  There is some support within Shinseito, however, for the 
nomination of Watanabe for the premiership and his latest move 
will complicate the selection process, political sources said. 
  The 70-year-old former foreign minister said he will seek 
ties with the coalition parties to achieve his goal of 
succeeding outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, 
commenting, "I have a conviction that a cabinet of national 
salvation should be formed to overcome the present difficult 
situation." 
  "I could not become (prime minister) only with LDP support. 
As I have to ask for the support of many people, I will 
naturally renounce my party membership," he said. 
  If the leader of the LDP's third-largest faction quits the 
party, some 30 other LDP members will follow suit, LDP sources 
said. 
  Regarding the possibility of his forming a new party, 
Watanabe concurred, saying, "Naturally I will not forget about 
(the matter)." He also suggested he will run in the premiership 
race as an independent. 
  Meanwhile, representatives of the coalition parties will 
resume consultations Monday afternoon on policy coordination for 
a new government and are expected to reach agreement on a policy 
platform. 
  After reaching agreement on basic policies, coalition party 
chiefs will hold talks on the selection of a successor to 
Hosokawa. 
  Watanabe will make a final decision Monday, concerning his 
possible departure from the LDP, after consulting with his 
fellow faction members to determine how many would support such 
a move, faction sources said. 
  After Watanabe leaves the party, he will propose a 
"coalition 
government for national salvation" and call for policy 
consultations with the coalition, the sources said. 
  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's 
chief strategist, who has close ties with Watanabe, said Sunday, 
"Aside from the issue of whether he can be the candidate for 
prime minister (from the coalition), I respect him as a man of 
great experience and wisdom." 
  Komeito [Clean Government Party] Secretary General Yuichi 
Ichikawa said in a statement, "Watanabe's departure (from the 
LDP) would have a great impact." 
  Executives of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of 
Japan--SDPJ], the largest party in the coalition, confirmed 
Sunday night that if Shinseito decides to nominate Watanabe as 
the coalition candidate for premier, the party will leave the 
coalition, party officials said. They also agreed that if the 
SDP quits the coalition, the party will not form a "grand 
coalition" with the LDP, the officials said. 
  New party Sakigake [Harbinger] plans not to support a 
cabinet 
which includes Watanabe, party sources said. Sakigake, a 
15-member coalition group led by Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura, declared Friday it will not seek a post in a 
new cabinet but will support a candidate agreed upon by its 
coalition partners. 
  Watanabe and LDP President Yohei Kono, who has himself vowed 
to run in the Diet election as his party's official candidate, 
had been scheduled to have a second round of talks on Monday. 
But it is unclear whether the talks will actually take place, 
sources said. 
  Kono urged Watanabe Friday to drop his ambitions for the 
premiership, in order to maintain party unity, but met with no 
success.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 13 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is closely watching 
moves within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] concerning the 
selection of a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa. This is because LDP President Yohei Kono has declared 
his candidacy for the premiership while some LDP members are 
prepared to leave the party. 
  Junior LDP members who advocate reform of the electoral 
system are "expected to leave the LDP." According to a senior 
official of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], they 
are divided into two groups--"one backing Shinseito and the 
other supporting Sakigake [Harbinger]." Shinseito feels that if 
it can lure them into the ruling coalition, this will serve as a 
restraining influence against Sakigake, which has hinted leaving 
the cabinet. Shinseito is also gradually leaning to the idea 
that it is necessary for the ruling parties to select the new 
prime minister while keeping the current ruling coalition 
framework in tact. However, because it is thought the LDP may 
split into three groups--one supporting Kono, one backing former 
LDP Vice President and Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, and the 
other advocating reform of the electoral system--Shinseito is 
carefully watching moves within the LDP. 
  Appearing on a Fuji TV program on 12 April, Shinseito Acting 
Chief Secretary Kozo Watanabe said: "The ruling parties worked 
together to compile the budget. While maintaining a cooperative 
framework, we should choose an appropriate person." He added: 
"We will not refuse to accept those who wish to join us." 
Thus, Watanabe expressed the hope that the ruling coalition 
would maintain the current framework and invite LDP members to 
join the coalition. 
  As its basic strategy, Shinseito aims for the splintering of 
the LDP. Thus, it will be desirable for the party if the LDP is 
thrown into confusion as a result of strife between Kono and 
Watanabe over the candidacy for the premiership, as well as the 
breakaway of a pro-electoral reform group. Senior Shinseito 
officials have continuously hinted the party may form an 
alliance with the LDP's Watanabe. Behind this move lies 
Shinseito's expectation that the alliance will work as an 
effective "trump card" to oust leftwing members of the SDPJ from 
the ruling coalition. SDPJ left-wingers are feared as a 
stumbling block to future political operations. 
  According to a senior Shinseito official, many Shinseito 
members still believe that even if Watanabe leaves the LDP, 
"only 30 or so LDP members will follow him, and this is not 
enough." A Shinseito Diet member who works as liaison between 
Watanabe and Shinseito Chief Secretary Ichiro Ozawa said on 12 
April that it was unlikely Watanabe would leave the LDP to form 
a large political party which can replace the SDPJ in the ruling 
coalition. 
  Nevertheless, if conditions are created under which it is 
possible to change the framework of the ruling coalition, this 
will make it easier for SDPJ members to agree to maintain the 
current framework. If the ruling coalition decides to choose 
the new prime minister under the current framework, Shinseito 
co-leader Tsutomu Hata (deputy prime minister and foreign 
minister) will be the most likely candidate because of his 
career. It seems Shinseito has intentionally hinted at forming 
an alliance with Watanabe to prepare for full-scale negotiations 
within the ruling coalition over the selection of a candidate.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Former Foreign Minister 
Michio Watanabe was apparently having second thoughts Monday [18 
April] about his plan to split from the Liberal Democratic Party 
now that his bid for the premiership seems unlikely to succeed, 
political sources said. Watanabe is backpedaling as the ruling 
coalition is seen more in favor of naming Foreign Minister 
Tsutomu Hata as successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the sources said. 
  In a meeting with LDP President Yohei Kono, Watanabe said, 
"I 
understand your feelings, so please give me a little bit more 
time to think this issue over," an LDP official said. 
  Watanabe, 70, also admitted to wavering over whether to 
split 
from the LDP, citing major differences with the ruling coalition 
over security issues. He heads the LDP's third largest faction. 
  He said, "I can tie up with the Japan New Party whose 
policies do not differ from ours. If I had the courage to leave 
and cooperate with such parties as Komeito, which took a big 
step forward in approving a policy to join UN peacekeeping 
forces, I would end up pursuing the same policies as the Liberal 
Democratic Party." 
  Kono appealed to Watanabe to stay in the LDP, saying, 
"Unless 
the coalition decides to revamp its combination of political 
forces and accept you, your defection will be of no use." 
  "Let us do our utmost to strip the coalition of its power by 
criticizing its policy contradictions and inconsistencies, while 
seeking public understanding of LDP policies," Kono said. Kono 
was apparently referring to coalition differences over a plan to 
hike the rate of consumption tax later this year and to map out 
the specifics of contingency plans to respond to UN Security 
Council resolutions to slap sanctions on North Korea over its 
alleged nuclear arms program, the sources said. 
  Coalition deputies banded together Monday afternoon to 
discuss their differences on these issues as a prerequisite to 
agreeing to launch a fresh coalition government to be led by 
Hata. 
  The deputies aimed to eliminate gaps over a proposed policy 
platform document whose adoption would mandate instituting a tax 
system with greater emphasis on indirect taxes and accepting 
possibly tough UN resolutions to penalize North Korea for its 
refusal to accept full checkups of its nuclear facilities. 
  Watanabe expressed his intention Sunday to quit the largest 
opposition party in a bid to seek the premiership with the 
backing of his own faction and some potential supporters in the 
coalition. 
  Kono, who has himself vowed to run in the Diet election to 
nominate the head of government as his party's official 
candidate, urged Watanabe on Friday to drop his ambitions for 
the premiership, but Watanabe turned down the request. 
  Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, 
the largest party in the seven-party coalition, said Monday he 
is opposed to nominating Watanabe as the coalition's candidate 
for the premiership, party officials said. Murayama also 
expressed opposition to Watanabe being invited even to join the 
next cabinet in a position such as deputy prime minister, they 
said. 
  So far, only about 20 LDP members are expected to quit and 
follow their boss if he decides to leave. 
  Meanwhile, five LDP House of Representatives members who 
voiced support for Watanabe's bid for the premiership left the 
party on Monday. These rebels -- Seiichi Ota, Taku Yamamoto, 
Shizuo Sato, Koji Kakizawa and Shokei Arai -- are the members of 
the former LDP policy study group, called the "Liberals." 
  They were followed by another LDP lower house member, Kenji 
Kosaka, who said he will join Shinseito, a key party in the 
coalition. 
  Another group of five LDP renegades -- led by Michihiko 
Kano, 
former director general of the Management and Coordination 
Agency -- on Monday formed a new party called the New Party 
Mirai (Future). Kano hinted at his readiness to vote for Hata in 
the Diet vote. 
  Fumihiko Igarashi and two other Japan New Party legislators 
told reporters they decided to quit the party and become 
independents.

  [Text] On 12 April, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa 
discussed with Muneaki Samejima, deputy chief secretary of the 
Japan New Party, the issue of expanding parliamentary group 
"Kaikaku [Reform]" to include other political forces. During 
the discussions at the prime minister's official residence, he 
said: "It is important for the ruling coalition to go back to 
the spirit in which they started out and maintain the current 
framework. On the other hand, it is also necessary to invite 
other political forces to the ruling coalition." In this way he 
indicated that, based on the current formation of seven 
political parties and one parliamentary group, the ruling 
coalition should establish a new framework by inviting some 
Liberal Democratic Party members.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Another five House of 
Representatives members quit the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) 
on Monday to launch a new parliamentary group aimed at 
reorganizing the political structure in Japan. 
  The defections bring to 11 the number of lower house members 
who have quit the LDP in four days. 
  Those who defected from the LDP on Monday are Koji Kakizawa, 
Seiichi Ota, Shokei Arai, Taku Yamamoto and Shizuo Sato. 
  The five told a news conference they plan to set up a new 
parliamentary group soon with two independent lower house 
members. 
  Riki Nakamura, an independent, dissolved a parliamentary 
affiliation with the LDP to join the group and another 
independent, Sanae Takaichi, is also planning to join them, they 
said. 
  "We decided to quit to accelerate the current development by 
our action," Kakizawa said at the press conference. Kakizawa 
and the other four who quit the LDP on Monday have backed former 
Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe as a replacement for outgoing 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced on April 8 he 
will resign over a financial scandal and a Diet stalemate. 
  Kakizawa said the seven will call on other LDP lawmakers to 
join their group so as to realize their policies together. 
  Five other LDP lower house members who quit the party 
Friday, 
formed a new party Monday called New Party Mirai (Future). 
  Another LDP lower house member, Kenji Kosaka, also left the 
party Monday, saying he will join Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party], a key party in the coalition.

<F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 April Morning Edition] </F>
  [Text] Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic 
Party of Japan [SDPJ], and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the 
Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], held a meeting at the First 
House of Representatives Members' Office Building on the evening 
of 14 April. They agreed that if Michio Watanabe, former deputy 
prime minister and foreign minister, leaves the Liberal 
Democratic Party and joins the new administration either as 
deputy prime minister or in some other capacity, then the SDPJ 
and DSP may have to leave the coalition. 
  According to senior DSP officials, Akira Yamagishi, chairman 
of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], also supports 
Murayama and Ouchi's position. 
  It is believed Murayama and Ouchi's coming out with such a 
position is timed to warn Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 
Komeito against cooperating with Watanabe, and to change the 
composition of the coalition by dropping Sakigake [Harbinger].

  [Text] Tokyo, April 18 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu 
Hata indirectly called on veteran conservative politician Michio 
Watanabe on Monday [18 April] to leave the Liberal Democratic 
Party (LDP) to break the political stalemate. Hata said at a 
press conference that it is up to Watanabe himself to decide on 
his actions but things will not "make progress if he is within 
the LDP." 
  Watanabe, a former foreign minister, said Sunday he will 
leave the LDP as early as Monday, hoping to run for the 
premiership following Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
announcement that he will resign. 
  However, Watanabe, in talks with LDP President Yohei Kono 
earlier in the day, said he still needs more time to decide 
whether he will leave the main opposition party. Hata said if 
Watanabe, 70, had decided on his actions earlier, he could have 
won "understanding from various people." 
  Hata was apparently referring to a number of LDP members who 
were thinking about following Watanabe in leaving the LDP, 
delivering a serious blow to the party. 
  Hata is considered the top candidate to become the next 
prime 
minister.

  [Text] A stagnation in the management of foreign affairs 
is becoming evident with the prolonged political vacuum 
resulting from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation, 
and the ensuing process to elect a successor. 
  Visits by Egyptian President Muhammad Mubarak and Thai Prime 
Minister Chuan Likphai have either been canceled or postponed, 
while discussions by the political authorities on how to deal 
with the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development remain 
suspended. The government has also been unable to make 
important decisions on improving relations with the United 
States, particularly on the Japan-U.S. framework talks. The 
Foreign Ministry is beginning to be irritated. 
  The Ministry is most distressed with the inadequacy of the 
crisis management system concerning the DPRK nuclear issue. 
While the Ministry has been holding regular working-level 
liaison meetings with the Defense Agency, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry, and other ministries and 
agencies concerned to gather information and to analyze the 
situation, ministerial level discussions, which would be 
necessary to deal with an emergency, remain insufficient due to 
the prolonged political turmoil. 
  The Foreign Ministry has done a simulation of probable 
developments in terms of: 1) rescue of Japanese abroad; 2) 
refugee relief; 3) restriction in personnel exchanges, 
remittances and trade; and 4) assistance to the United States, 
in the event the UN Security Council decides to impose economic 
sanctions on the DPRK. However, a senior Foreign Ministry 
official says, "No matter how much we discuss these issues, if 
the range of policy measures a political decision would allow 
remains unclear, what we can do is limited." 
  The Foreign Ministry is particularly concerned that a 
conflict may surface among the ruling parties in terms of the 
maintenance of secrecy, and assistance to the United States in 
the event of an emergency due to the presence of the Social 
Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in the coalition. 
  A top ministry official says, "In the event of the 
misfortune 
of a war breaking out, how far can Japan deal with the situation 
on its own? If we behave like we did during the Gulf war, 
Japan-U.S. relations will further deteriorate." 
  While the ruling coalition parties basically agreed on 16 
April on the policy of "abiding by the United Nations's 
decision," some Foreign Ministry officials point out that this 
is still "ambiguous because if, for instance, the Security 
Council fails to pass a resolution because of a Chinese veto, 
and a decision to impose sanctions in the form of multinational 
forces is made, our response remains unclear," (according to a 
senior Foreign Ministry official). 
  The cancellation of several visits by foreign VIP's also 
undermines Japan's image abroad. President Mubarak's visit (18 
to 21 April) is supposed to be an important diplomatic event in 
that it will demonstrate Japan's vital role in the 
reconstruction of the occupied territories after the historical 
reconciliation between Israel and the PLO. On the other hand, 
although Prime Minister Chuan's visit (22 to 27 April) has been 
postponed purportedly under a request from Thailand, this will 
create a bad precedent in diplomatic protocol because he has 
been invited as an official guest. 
  There has also been issues in official development 
assistance 
(ODA) that require a political decision. The United States has 
complained that yen loan to Iran, which was resumed in 1993, 
"may constitute official recognition of a nation exporting 
terrorism." Aid to Iran was resumed in May 1993, after an 
interval of 17 years, and a loan of 38 billion yen as the first 
phase of an aid program has already been agreed upon. Now, the 
second installment of the financial aid is being questioned. 
This problem has to do with a high-level political decision on 
the position of the Middle East, particularly Iran, in Japan's 
overall diplomatic strategy. The political vacuum has also had 
its adverse effects on this issue.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry 
started preparing Saturday [16 April] a revision draft of the 
stopgap budget, since passage of the fiscal 1994 budget in the 
lower house will be delayed by Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa's resignation, ministry officials said. Deliberations 
on the 1994 budget, worth 73.08 trillion yen, have been stalled 
amid wrangling between the ruling coalition and the opposition 
camp over Hosokawa's financial transactions. 
  With the domestic economy finally showing signs of recovery, 
the Finance Ministry wants to avoid the psychologically harmful 
effects which could result from a vacuum in the budget, 
officials said. 
  The ministry believes it is difficult for the full 1994 
budget bills to be passed within the 50-day period of the 
stopgap budget even if deliberations go smoothly, particularly 
since there is a string of national holidays in early May. 
  A record stopgap budget of 11.05 trillion yen covering the 
period from April 1 to May 20 was enacted April 1, when the 
stalled talks made it impossible for the 1994 budget to be 
implemented within fiscal 1993 that ended March 31. 
  If a revision of the stopgap budget is made, it will be the 
first such case since fiscal 1990. 
  The revised budget is expected to cover a period of nearly 
one month from May 21 to mid-June, since the budget for the full 
year could pass the lower house in mid-May following the 
national holidays, and will automatically be enacted within 30 
days after being sent to the upper house. 
  The scale of the stopgap budget is expected to amount to 2 
or 
3 trillion yen, covering the minimum funds needed for public 
servants.

<F P=106> [Article by Taiichiro Kobayashi, Michiko Kawamata, SANDE </F>
MAINICHI reporters: "300 Single-Seat Constituency, 200 
Proportional Representative Winners Predicted"] 
  [Text] Following enactment of the four political 
reform bills, the greatest concern of the Diet members is how 
they can each survive in the 300 small electoral districts 
nationwide. Can the coalition ruling parties cooperate in the 
elections, given the outburst of disharmony over the people's 
welfare tax proposal? Who are the potential newcomers in the 
vacant districts? The battle has already begun.

Note: The predicted numbers of seats for the various parties were calculated 
centering on "certain victory," "ahead," potential winners. "Others" within 
the ruling parties include those candidates of the "Reform Society" who are 
not currently members of the coalition, but who will become unified 
candidates of the coalition parties during elections. The "Others" of the 
opposition are LDP-related independents. 


<H5>  New Party Forces Lure LDP Dietmen Individually </H5>
  In a single-seat constituency electoral district, a party is 
officially permitted to field only one candidate. In the LDP's 
case, Dietmen who are based in the same district could be 
eliminated from designation as official candidates. For example, 
in Akita Prefecture which will have three electoral districts, 
there are currently five LDP Dietmen. Unless two of them move to 
proportional districts or switch to other parties, they will not 
survive. 
  Dietman Tadao Sato who seeks his fourth election in the 
Akita 
first district--a new electoral district--explains his position 
as follows: "At this stage, I will not consider leaving the 
party in advance. However, if I fail to receive official party 
endorsement, I will probably have to decide on forming a new 
party. If intraparty endorsement of the LDP fails to make 
progress, I may refuse official endorsement by the LDP." 
  The case of Dietman Koji Sakamoto who plans to run from the 
Fukushima fifth district is similar. "I will watch the 
allocation by party headquarters at this point. However, not 
only in Fukushima but elsewhere also, it is doubtful whether 
those who have fought bitterly against each other can adjust 
smoothly and cooperate. The split of the LDP is inevitable." 
  Both Dietmen deny any overtures from the other parties. 
However, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake 
[Harbinger] parties that seek expansion are secretly competing 
to recruit LDP Dietmen. One Shinseito affiliate boasts: "Just 
you watch. We will get 20 from the LDP."

<H5>  JNP Becomes Mowing Grounds? </H5>
  Meanwhile, the coalition parties must also narrow down their 
candidates in order to compete against the giant opposition 
party, the LDP. General Secretary Yuichi Ichikawa of Komeito 
made a speech at the Central Executive Committee meeting on 
party expansion on 9 February, and he promoted a concept of 
"formation by the coalition parties of a new-new party with a 
single party name." Certainly, if it is possible, it would be 
the best strategy vis-a-vis the LDP, but its realization is 
extremely difficult. In the large cities of Tokyo, Kanagawa, and 
Osaka where the new parties garnered massive victories in the 
previous election, the ruling party candidates will butt heads 
against each other here and there. Moreover, under the new 
electoral district system with the recognition of an overlapping 
among candidates, candidacy in the electoral district will be 
directly linked to the overlaying of proportional votes. 
Therefore, each party cannot simply yield ground. 
  This was compounded by the fracturing within the ruling 
parties that surfaced over the people's welfare tax proposal. 
The general election is likely to take place with a split right 
down the middle between the bloc that aggressively promotes the 
proposal--which includes Shinseito and Komeito, and the opposing 
bloc which includes Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and 
the cautious Sakigake party. Also, Japan New Party [JNP] headed 
by Prime Minister Hosokawa could become the "mowing ground" for 
the two blocs.

  This magazine (SANDE MAINICHI) predicted a new split of 
forces based on the current political map of 295 for the ruling 
coalition versus 193 for the LDP. However, in the actual 
election, there is a strong possibility of a tripolar structure 
consisting of the LDP, the Shinseito/Komeito, and the 
SDPJ/Sakigake. Of course, it is absolutely impossible to predict 
how the post-election composition of the administration will 
turn out. 
  Meanwhile, it is likely that many of the new candidates in 
the single-seat constituencies will be switch-overs by local 
government heads and members of the prefectural and municipal 
assemblies. In the case of Tokushima Prefecture, the name of 
former Governor Shinzo Miki is rumored as an LDP candidate from 
the third distict, and the name of former Tokushima City Mayor 
Toshiharu Miki has also emerged in the first district. In the 
Fukuoka third district, Mikito Kusuda, mayor of Chikushino City, 
is seen as a strong runner from Shinseito. Also, in Tokyo, 
Osaka, and Fukuoka where there are many blank districts for the 
LDP, multiple numbers of local assemblymen appear likely to run 
as candidates. "Under the single-seat constituencies electoral 
district system," the power of the branch organization will 
become stronger than the prefectural organization, and an 
election on a neighborhood-unit basis will become inevitable" 
(LDP Dietman Shunichi Yamaguchi). 
  In addition to seeking out such local politicians, each 
party 
is also scouting nationally known newscasters and star talent as 
proportional district candidates to win floating votes. Yoichi 
Masugoe, a political scientist, and newscaster Hatae are 
reportedly being induced to run from Shinseito and Japan New 
Party respectively. Highly popular Taro Kimura and Shigeru Roki 
reportedly have more than one party vying for them. 
  A general election could be held as early as next year. 
Aside 
from the question of whether the quality of the candidates will 
improve, a rise in the voting rate appear certain.

<F P=106> [Article by Kenichi Kawahito: "Ministry of Finance: The </F>
Surprising True Face of Vice Minister Saito; The Kind of Shrewd 
Person Who Comes Along Once in a Decade"] 
  [Text] The Japan-U.S. summit conference on economic 
consultation broke down. Hosokawa has a troubled look again. One 
difficulty arises after the other, but the Diet and the Prime 
Minister's Residence are not the only places where those in 
power have trouble. The same is also true of Kasumigaseki, where 
elite bureaucrats reign supreme. The uproar over the national 
health tax, which vanished with the dew. Such persons as 
Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito of the Ministry of 
Finance, who ended up being made the "heavy," seem like symbols 
of Kasumigaseki in a difficult time. 
  Vice Minister Saito's nickname within the Ministry of 
Finance 
is "Densuke." It is said to come from the fact that he says 
"den" when he wins at mahjong, but in the tax system reform this 
time, he was unable to make that sound. 
  Ever since Prime Minister Hosokawa set forth the idea of a 
national welfare tax at a predawn press conference on 3 
February, and it collapsed completely in the twinkling of an 
eye, Vice Minister Saito has been hounded at Ministry-of-Finance 
press conferences. At a press conference when there was much 
discord at meetings of representatives of the governing parties, 
it went like this: 
  [Question] The rate of support for the cabinet has dropped 
20 
percent, would you care to comment on that? 
  [Saito] I would like to reserve comment on that because it 
is 
not something said by the authorities concerned." 
  [Question] Is it not true that the biggest problem with 
Hosokawa's idea is the fact that there was little discussion? 
Ought not you, as the authority in charge of government finance, 
give an explanation? 
  [Saito] I shall accept that as advice for future. 
  [Question] Are you saying that you will not change the way 
you have been doing things up till now? 
  [Saito] We are now in the middle of a meeting of 
representatives (of the governing parties), so the position of 
the authorities concerned is to reserve comment. 
  Jiro Saito is 58 years old. Since joining the Ministry of 
Finance in 1959, in the Budget Bureau, which is in charge of 
compiling the budget, he smoothly ascended the ladder from 
assistant division chief to division chief, budget examiner, 
vice bureau chief, and bureau chief; and in June 1993, he 
assumed the post of vice minister, the ultimate post for a 
bureaucrat. 
<H5>  Cool Calculation Lurks Behind an Uncompromising Attitude </H5>
  "He is said to be the kind of great vice minister who comes 
along once in a decade. However, at press conferences and the 
like, his favorite statement is `That is why I said that 
earlier,' and his blunt responses are conspicuous. One almost 
suspects that he is making fools of people, thinking that such 
people as politicians and the media do not understand anyhow" 
(economic reporter). 
  Even at the press conference upon his assumption to the 
position of vice minister, when asked what he aspired to do, he 
said: "At present, it is as the former vice minister said, I 
have nothing to add." Such being the case, he is bound to appear 
haughty and arrogant. 
  Although he has awesome ability, or because of his awesome 
ability, in any case, he is unpopular. Speaking in terms of 
political circles, he is exactly like Ichiro Ozawa, secretary 
general of Shinseito, who along with him was considered a "war 
criminal" because of the welfare-tax idea this time. 
  He does not like dinner parties nor does he play golf. 
According to people, his attitude toward his subordinates is 
that "He is a person whose likes and dislikes are very clear; 
they are divided into those he treats with great fondness and 
those with whom he will have nothing to do." 
  "He is said to dislike dinner parties. But if he attends a 
dinner party after allowing people to say that, he can give 
people a strong sense of gratitude, thinking that Saito, who 
dislikes dinner parties, has been kind enough to come. People 
think that they heard that he is a disagreeable person, but he 
talks to them pleasantly with a smile, or some such. I also have 
a feeling that Saito is considering such things. 
  "Even Ichiro Ozawa has something about him that makes one 
end 
up yielding to him if one is spoken to kindly by him, does he 
not" (another reporter)? 
  He suggests that there may be surprisingly cool calculation 
behind the uncompromising attitude. 
<H5>  A Lone Struggle Over the "Gulf Tax Increase" </H5>
  These two, who are exactly alike, are considered to be the 
ones who designed the welfare tax idea this time. 
  The idea for reform of the tax system set forth by Prime 
Minister Hosokawa was put off, and the shortfall in revenue 
because of the tax reduction will be covered by the first 
deficit-covering bonds in five years. It turned out to be the 
result that Vice Minister Saito most detests. 
  One of Vice Minister Saito's subordinates when he was in the 
Budget Bureau says: 
  "His assessment within the ministry was that of a steady 
person. In any case, he was absolutely opposed to 
deficit-covering bonds. Even after breaking away in 1990 from 
the incontinent issuing of deficit-covering bonds, he has made 
that a symbol of legitimacy. In the Budget Bureau, there is a 
temperment that likes that kind of steadiness." 
  At a time when the balance of deficit-covering bonds exceeds 
200 trillion yen, it is natural for Finance Ministry bureaucrats 
to dislike such bonds; however, Saito's dislike is said to be 
utter and complete. A person related to the Ministry of Finance 
disclosed a certain "war experience." 
  "At the time of the Gulf war, you must remember that 
beginning in 1991 we made such gulf tax increases as a special 
corporation tax in order to fund Japan's contribution. At that 
time, the trend of opinion in the Ministry of Finance was 
deficit-covering bonds, not a tax increase. The one who worked 
hard, alone, for the tax-increase line was Saito." 
  When a meeting in the Ministry of Finance had begun to agree 
on deficit-covering bonds, Saito, who was deputy vice minister, 
stood up and addressed the meeting. The content of his speech is 
reported within the ministry to have been as follows: 
  "Deficit-covering bonds, what are you talking about? Even 
the 
Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is saying that a tax increase 
cannot be avoided. What a shame that the Ministry of Finance, 
which is in the position of protecting government finances, 
talks about deficit-covering bonds." 
  It is said that all those Finance Ministry executives 
present 
at the meeting were argued into silence by Secretariat Director 
Saito, who spoke eloquently, so the gulf-tax-increase became a 
reality. 
  "It was the deputy vice minister. It was not a vice minister 
nor was it chief of the Tax Bureau, the person in direct charge 
of the matter, nor was it chief of the Budget Bureau. The chief 
of the Tax Bureau at that time was former Vice Minister Mamoru 
Ozaki, and he, too, said that deficit-covering bonds were 
unavoidable. It is said that ill will developed between Saito 
and Ozaki after that. It seems that when Ozaki got drunk, he 
would say things like `That SOB Saito'" (the same Finance 
Ministry-related person). 
  The disposition in the Tax Bureau, which handles taxes, and 
in the Budget Bureau, which compiles the budget, is said to be 
somewhat different. LDP Diet Member Hakuo Yanagisawa is a former 
Finance Ministry bureaucrat. He is two years junior to Vice 
Minister Saito, but while admitting that Vice Minister Saito is 
"an able person," Yanagisawa, who has experience in the Tax 
Bureau, makes some harsh observations in relation to taxes: 
  "I think that the matter this time also is an uproar caused 
by someone who does not know about taxes meddling in them. He 
has worked only in the budget field, so he has no `sense of a 
reasonable level' concerning taxes. He has no fear of taxes. I 
cannot help but say that his career lacks balance." 
  Therefore, now Diet Member Yanagisawa also says of the 
atmosphere in the Tax Bureau: 
  "There appears to be no sense of a setback because they 
followed Saito grudgingly while being dissatisfied with his way 
of doing things. I suspect they are thinking: See, we told you 
so." 
  This Vice Minister Saito also has a slight "historical" 
connection with Prime Minister Hosokawa. 
<H5>  What Ought To Have Been the Strongest Team Came Out the Loser </H5>
  It was a half century ago that Prime Minister Hosokawa's 
grandfather, Fumimaro Konoe, served as prime minister, and a 
persen who was commissioned to do work for the Konoe cabinet as 
an advisor was the (Hozumi) Ozaki of the Sorge spy affair. In 
1939 Ozaki was commissioned to do work for the Manchurian 
Railway Inspection Department and went to China. One of his 
subordinates was Saito's father. 
  Saito became a bureaucrat on his father's advice. Then he 
happened to cross paths with Prime Minister Hosokawa in this 
time of upheaval. 
  According to a certain person who keeps tabs on 
Kasumigaseki, 
  "Because of the birth of the coalition government, the 
Ministry of Finance is trying to seize the initiative. The 
situation is such that there is almost the term `Finance 
Ministry government.' The Ministry of Finance has shaken up the 
Hosokawa government by holding the budget and stimulus measures 
hostage. In the Ministry of International Trade and Industry 
[MITI], which has lost the support of zoku Diet members, Vice 
Minister (Hideaki) Kumano has been completely won over to 
Saito's way of doing things, so it is called "the second 
Ministry of Finance." The underlying cause of that MITI bureau 
chief resignation uproar is also found there." 
  At such a time, Ozawa, who heretofore had no contacts in the 
Finance Ministry, and Vice Minister Saito form a team. The two 
are said to have found themselves kindred spirits when Ozawa 
talked up the concept of an international contribution tax two 
years ago. The LDP Research Commission on the Tax System was 
angered, saying, "it ignores the discussions of the Research 
Commission on the Tax System." It was defeated, but the 
previously mentioned person related to the Ministry of Finance 
says: 
  "At that time, the only one who supported Ozawa's idea was 
Saito, who was chief of the Budget Bureau. Their relationship 
has existed since then. When an uproar occurred over whether 
Ozawa would or would not form a new party, he suddenly made 
himself vanish from before the media. There is talk that Ozawa 
met with Saito for two hours during that time." 
  This means that the Ozawa-Saito team has now failed for the 
second time, but this related person goes on to say: 
  "In spite of Ozawa's objective being good, he is weak on the 
process. Since the Ministry of Finance is the government office 
which is most skillful at process, if Ozawa and the Ministry of 
Finance team up, there will be nothing as strong. Unfortunately, 
Saito is an official whose process is high-handed. Because of 
that, they came out on the losing side--both times." 
  A bureaucrat, who is supposed to be an inconspicuous 
stagehand, was taken up by a photo magazine and was even 
photographed by television while walking a dog. When 
inconspicuous stagehands stand out, it is not a very good time.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomohiko Hayashi, SHUKAN ASAHI reporter: "SP: </F>
Removal of Former Prime Ministers From List of Those Guarded Has 
Begun; `VIP's Increase Because of Political Realignment, Finally 
Kaifu, Too...."] 
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]The realignment of the 
political map is also making itself felt in unexpected places. 
Information has come from a police-related source that because 
of the increase in new parties, the shortage of SP (security 
police) has been aggravated, and as result SP who had been 
assigned to former prime ministers have been removed. One of 
them is former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu. What is different 
about him when there are persons who are assigned guards even 
now? [passage omitted]

  [Text][passage omitted] 
  [Text]The prime minister, speaker of the House of 
Representatives, 
president of the House of Councilors, and chief justice of the 
Supreme Court, who are the heads of the three branches of 
government, 20 cabinet ministers, and the key figures of 
political parties are listed in National Police Agency materials 
as persons to be guarded by security police. 
  Institute Director Noboru Suzuki of Nippon Secret Service, a 
private-sector personal-security company, explains the 
arrangement in that area: 
  A former member of the Metropolitan Police Department, 
Suzuki 
devoted himself to guarding for about 20 years, from the time 
when SP were still called "bodyguards" and retired from 
government service in 1986. At Nippon Secret Service, he is 
called "the very spirit of guarding" and is the kind of person 
who embodies the history of the security police, so to speak. 
  He says, "The National Police Agency in the guarding of 
VIP's, and the Metropolitan Police Department in regard to 
successive prime ministers, consider by their own judgment such 
things as political influence, and assign security police to 
those persons for whom they think it necessary from the 
standpoint of safety." 
  In the case of Nakasone and Takeshita, it is probably judged 
that they are persons for whom there is fear of their being 
harmed. [passage omitted]

centimeters or 
taller, have attained the third rank or higher in either judo or 
kendo, and are famous as men of valor even for the Metropolitan 
Police Department. The hard part of the job is that it is not 
enough to just be on guard; one must constantly strain one's 
nerves. Words of advice like this are said to have been handed 
down among them in the past. "Never fall down even if you are 
hit by five bullets," "Be devoted to your partners," and "Don't 
look at your watch." 
  "It means that security police must be prepared to lay down 
their lives by becoming a bullet shield for the person they are 
guarding, should the occasion arise. Furthermore, they must 
anticipate the course along which the person they are guarding 
will travel and confirm beforehand that it will be safe; 
therefore, they must have good communication with their 
partners. In addition, never relax your guard" (Suzuki). 
  I don't believe that all those guarded by the SP appreciate 
this kind of arduous work....

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 13 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The United 
Party for Mongolian Traditions has issued a statement addressing 
the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party (MPRP), the National 
Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party. The statement 
draws their attention to the necessity for extracting lessons 
from the past reminding that frequently the struggle between the 
state officials for power and privileges was serving to the 
interests of alien conquerors. On behalf of its membership the 
United Party for Supporting the Mongolian Traditions has called 
upon the members of the Great State Hural to cease the political 
argues and disputes and unify their efforts in order to justify 
their voters' confidence in the common interests of Mongolia.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 13 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Ten 
activists of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) have 
gone on a political hunger strike at the central square of the 
capital. 
  The MDA who was the first to appear on the political scene 
has resorted to the experienced method of pressing the 
authorities after nearly a one-month demands to the government 
for its resignation. Four years ago the MDA by means of hunger 
strike forced the then political leadership of the country the 
Political Bureau of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party 
(MPRP) to resign. 
  Prior to going on the hunger strike a rally of supporters of 
the MDA has been held at the square during which the demands for 
resignation of the government headed by the Premier P. Jasray 
were reiterated. About 8 thousand people participated in the 
rally in spite of the fact that the city authorities have not 
permitted to hold an action on the main square of the country. 
  The democratic forces believe that the present government 
has 
failed to cope with the major social and economic problems of 
the country apart from this there has broke out a scandal the 
essence of which lies in that the former chief of the 
counterintelligence service has accused the leaders of the 
parliament and government of corruption and made public some 
compromising facts. Four month later P. Jasray had to refer to 
the court so that to succeed in getting "his dignity and honour 
violated to be restored".

to the public opinion poll conducted by the Movement for 
Renewing the Union of Mongolian Students (UMS) with embracing 
some 650 students from six largest universities and colleges of

over-politicization regarding its activities which does not 
correspond to its rules. The UMS is actively participating in 
the political struggle supporting the MDA [Mongolian Democratic 
Association] and other oppositional parties who is blaming the 
government for corruption and incompetence and stands for its 
resignation. The political situation in the country is becoming 
heated and lasting for three daylong is the hunger strike of a 
group of representatives of the opposition at the main square of 
the capital. The most of respondents are in favour of 
renovation of activities, structure and composition of the UMS 
considering the leadership of the organization fails to express 
and protect the fundamental interests of the student youth.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
resignation of the government might lead to a slowing down of 
the economic reforming pace. This was said over the national 
television by the chairman of the National Development 
Department under the Prime Minister C. Ulaan. He goes on to say 
that the political hunger strike is quite an ordinary event in a 
democratic society. But the demands referring to resignation of 
the government at the present time when the country is entering 
the decisive year of economic reforms and the government is 
doing its best in order to implement the programme of action for 
1994 approved by the parliament is fraught with adverse 
aftermaths. 
  Especially at the given moment when there is becoming 
transparent a tendency toward a stabilizing of macroeconomic 
showings, it is ackowledged by the international financial and 
economic establishments the government's fulfilling of its 
obligations undertaken, are being developed the joint programmes 
in the fuel and power industry and for developing the 
infrastructure. The transition process in Mongolia is being 
considered as an example of reforming a society. 
  In today's conditions a forming of a new government and 
adopting of its new programme would turn out to be a useless 
waste of time. The political unstableness might cause to a loss 
of confidence in our country on the part of the world community.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 13 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDYN ERH" informs that the spring session of the 
Great State Hural (GSH) has completed the consideration in first 
reading of the draft law on pensions. The draft was submitted 
for consideration to the session by the Minister of 
Demographical Policies and Labour E. Gombojab. It is provided 
for that for getting pensions the citizens should provide 
insurance allocations within not less than 20 years. The 
pensions are supposed to be provided for men over 60 and women 
above 55 while for mothers with many children at the age of 50 
years. The draft law is provided that the size of pensions 
would constitute some 45 per cent of the average salary for a 
five year period. The members of the Hural basically agreed 
with the proposals made and charged to the working group to work 
out the draft law for further consideration. The session has 
set to a consideration in first reading of the draft law on 
insurance of people injured due to labour traumatism. 
  Answering the questions of the newspaper correspondent,

country said that in the event of a complete implementation of 
the measures being taken by the government, the rate of 
inflation is not to be increased in the current year which is 
associated with the growth in commodities supply and the 
decreasing purchasing power of the population. 
  Writing in the newspaper the Vice Premier L. Enebish notes 
that there have been privatized about 40 per cent of the 
state-run property as against the year 1990. The privatization 
carried out for vouchers is being completed chiefly. According 
to him, in the case of approving proper law, since the second 
half of the current year the auction sales of enterprises would 
start to be provided. 
  The newspaper informs that some members of the Great State 
Hural representing the opposition have applied to the prime 
minister with an inquiry concerning the dragging on by the 
government an introduction of the Mongolian script to the 
official business and other documentary keeping in spite of the 
decision approved earlier. Another point of view was expressed 
by a group of scholars in an article published in the newspaper. 
They consider that the issue on the introduction of the 
Mongolian script to the official documentary keeping was 
approved too hastily and might be telling on the literacy of the 
population. The scholars are suggesting to continue to teach 
school children on a new script (Cyrillic) parallel with 
teaching the Mongolian script for elder form pupils. 
  The governmental "DZASGIYN GADZRYN MEDEE" publishes an 
interview of its correspondent with the First Vice President of 
the Mongolbank O. Chuluunbat. He noted that due to the rigid 
monetary policy carried out by the central bank in 1993 by the 
end of the year the rate of inflation has reduced to 2.5-5 per 
cent instead of the 17-20 per cent as was recorded at the 
beginning of the previous year. At the same time he pointed out 
that the decreasing cash amount in circulation has evoked some 
negative aftermaths in the financial and economic life in 
particular, is telling on the volume of production and mutual 
arrears of the organizations. Touching upon the policy toward 
the capital investment, S. Chuluunbat noted that the country has 
to [word indistinct] nearly all her revenues for consumption. 
Owing to which he emphasized special significance of providing 
the most favourable conditions for foreign investment. 
  The newspaper publishes a resolution of the government on 
measures taken in order to develop the cinematography, rendering 
assistance to the economic entities in providing by them 
mediatory services in reference to agriculture and other 
decisions of the governmental bodies. 
  The newspaper carries the list of state-prize winners first 
of which was the people's writer Academician T. Damdinsuren who 
was awarded the state prize in 1946. The newspaper also gives 
the list of the Mongolian sportsmen gaining Olympic medals and 
winning the title of world champion.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 16 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- The 
newspaper "ARDIYN ERH" informs about the arrival in Ulaanbaatar 
yesterday of the Governor General of Australia B. Hayden with 
his spouse on an official visit at the invitation of the 
president of Mongolia P. Ochirbat. On his arrival Bill Hayden 
has met with the President P. Ochirbat. It is reported also 
that the President P. Ochirbat gave a dinner in honour of the 
Governor General of Australia B. Hayden. 
  The newspaper informs that the President P. Ochirbat has 
discussed with the chairman of the Great State Hural N. 
Bagabandi and the Prime Minister P. Jasray the political 
situation shaped down due to the hunger strike by the 
representatives of the Mongolian Democratic Association (MDA) 
demanding the resignation of the government. The President P. 
Ochirbat met with the leaders of the parties having seats at the 
parliament and exchanged opinions in connection with the 
above-mentioned circumstances. 
  The newspaper reports that the spring session of the Great 
State Hural has set to the consideration of the draft of the 
supplementary law due to be effective under the period of 
transition from the social insurance system being in force prior 
until the new ones being discussed by the parliament right now 
to be put into effect. [sentence as received] At the session 
took the floor by consent of the prime minister Vice Premier L. 
Enebish to answer the inquiry of some members of the parliament 
concerning the introduction of the Mongolian traditional script 
into the official business and documentary keeping In 
particular he notes that the government has worked out the 
information relating to the preparations for using the Mongolian 
script provided during the years 1991-1993 and the tasks and 
objectives due to be submitted for consideration to the Great 
State Hural within a week. A number of members of the Great 
State Hural have applied to the prime minister with a request to 
report about existence of the information available in the 
Central Intelligence Board concerning the statement by an 
observer of the newspaper "IL TOBCHU" referring to the 
preparation in 1991 for a coup-d'etat to be provided by 
anticonstitutional methods. 
  The Prime Minister P. Jasray said that to bear 
responsibility 
for the actions of the Central Intelligence Board does not mean 
that he is interfering with its operational work. 
  In this respect he noted that he did not mind answering by 
the head of the board D. Samdag a number of inquiries made by 
members of the parliament. Speaking at the session D. Samdag 
said that in the line of the organizations he heads there are 
not any documents corroborating the preparations for such a 
coup-d'etat. The session regards as being expedient to consider 
the answers by the prime minister and the head of the 
intelligence board on a closed sitting. At the session also 
spoke a member of the parliament T. Elbegdorj with a request 
that the chairman of the parliament N. Bagabandi and the Prime 
Minister P. Jasray would express their opinions meeting with the 
participants of the hunger strike announced by a group of 
representatives of the MDA who demands the resignation of the 
government. 
  The chairman of the Great State Hural said in this 
connection 
that the issue must be settled by the Hural. 
  According to the newspaper, at the last regular sitting of 
the government there has been discussed and adopted the draft of 
the law on securities. At the sitting were also discussed the 
outcome of the inspection of the activities of the Ministry of 
Food and Agriculture and a decision has been taken on carrying 
out a revaluation of the basic funds. The government has 
charged the Ministry of Trade and Industry to draw up proper 
decision on the enforcement of the recommendations of the Board 
on National Security in terms of issues of improving the control 
over the quality of exports and imports. 
  The newspaper "UNEN" issued by the ruling Mongolian People's 
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) informs that the steering council of 
the MPRP has discussed the progress of implementation of the 
pre-election programme of the MPRP in aymags and cities. The 
council has drawn attention of the aymags and city party 
committees and heads of the local administrations to the 
necessity for the development of cattle breeding with due regard 
to the local peculiarities, the enforcement of the law on 
preserving the genofund [as received] of the cattle, the 
undertaking measures necessary for backing small and medium 
businesses for increase in the production of food stuffs. Taken 
were also proper recommendations referring to the solution of 
social problems of the population. 
  The newspaper publishes some letters by its readers 
concerning the improvement of the supply with food and consumer 
goods of the population. 
  It noted particularly that excepting the enterprise being 
set 
up currently under the auspices of Finland for processing 
horse's meat it is difficult to name another enterprise where a 
new technology is being introduced else. [sentence as received] 
Some readers stressed that an increase by the company "Altan 
Taria" in the prices for homemade flour last autumn has led to 
the overstocking of warehouses and opened before the profiteers 
some possibilities to bring into the country from abroad and 
resell here bad quality flour. 
  The newspaper also carries the information regarding the 
cooperative company dealing with the processing and exporting of 
industrial wastes. The company has organized the production and 
sale in the country of knitwear and leather goods attaining a 
high proficiency of its activities. In the last year the 
company was awarded a golden cup of the reliable partner of the 
International Centre for Management of Production Quality. The 
newspaper notes that for the last February month the supply of 
copper molibdenum concentrates and melting spar accounted for 
more than 90 percent of the export of the country. The 
newspaper stresses the need for processing mineral raw materials 
for producing finished products which would be promoting the 
efficiency of the export.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 15 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- According 
to the sociological poll conducted by the Statistical Department 
of the Chancellory of the Arhangay Aymag which covers some 50 
city and rural families totaling 254 people, the monthly income 
of a family in the city is 22.9 thousand tugrik while in the 
countryside 29.8 thousand tugrik. For the first time the income 
of the countryfolk has increased that of the city residents 
which is due to the privatization of cattle carried out in the 
countryside. The standard level is higher in the countryside 
but the structure of the foodstuffs does not meet to 
physiological normatives. For example the consumption of meat, 
rice, porridges, sweets, vegetables and butter and vegetable oil 
per one rural person is lower the required standards by from 30 
per cent to 2 fold. But the consumption of flour and bakeries 
is higher and as for milk and dairy produce is quite near the 
standards.

  [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 13 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Mongolia is 
the fifth Asian country joined the convention on the rights of 
children, said today the head of the National Children's Centre 
N. Bolormaa at the press conference. Speaking with Mongolian 
and foreign newsmen she said about the measures supposed to be 
done within the framework of the national programme for 
development of children in Mongolia up to 2000. The national 
programme was endorsed by the Government of Mongolia on May last 
year. 
  According to Bolormaa, are being improved the conditions for 
getting education by children, developing their gifts. Although 
the children's problem remains to be actual one for today. 
[sentence as received] 
  The right of children for education is being exercised 
insufficiently. From year to year the number of children 
quitting their lessons for financial or other reasons is 
growing. In accordance with the 1993's data, more than 100 
thousand children of school age are out of school. A high 
mortality rate for newborns and small children yet remains to be 
recorded. On the scale of the country there are some 924.8 
thousand children orphans. The number of homeless children is 
ever growing. 
  There appeared quite a new notion of street children which 
up 
to recently was not available in the lexicology of Mongolians. 
All this, according to Bolormaa, dictates the necessity for 
unifying efforts of people for settling down the key children's 
problem under the conditions of the transition to a market 
economy.

  [Text] Hanoi, April 16 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec today started his three-day official visit to 
Vietnam during which he will meet his Vietnamese counterpart 
Nguyen Manh Cam, Premier Vo Van Kiet and Chairman of the 
National Assembly (parliament) Nong Duc Manh. 
  Zieleniec, who is accompanied by more than twenty Czech 
entrepreneurs and businessmen, will also attend economic 
seminars in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. The seminars are meant 
to acquaint Vietnamese partners with the economic changes and 
business conditions in the Czech Republic. 
  "I consider Vietnam the main goal of my Asia tour," 
Zieleniec, who is also to visit Malaysia and Australia, told 
journalists. 
  He said that Vietnam had been coming through an important 
stage in its development and besides, it has been ever more 
actively participating in the developments of the Asian region 
which is intensively developing. Vietnam cannot be regarded in 
isolation but as the region of operation of the Association of 
South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) which has a future, Zieleniec 
said. 
  He said that for a centrally managed economy, as the 
Vietnamese one, it is important to establish contacts on the 
government, official level, adding that it could be proceeded 
from the traditional economic relations between Vietnam and the 
Czech Republic. For Vietnam the Czech Republic represents a 
sort of transfer to Western technoloogy. 
  The changes which have occured in the Czech Republic since 
the November 1989 revolution were the reason why countries with 
a centrally planned economy made the Czech economic situation 
difficult to understand, Zieleniec said, adding that it was 
important that his presence demonstrate to Hanoi the Czech 
Republic's interest in cooperation. 
  Asked about the Czech government pro-export policy and of 
how 
the government sought to facilitate Czech firms' entrance into 
foreign markets, Zieleniec said that the Czech Republic did not 
have a tradition of managing all the economy by the state. 
Nevertheless the Czech government supported exports with such 
measures as, for example, his current visit, Zieleniec added. 
  On the problem of unsettled Czech claims in Vietnam 
Zieleniec 
said that they would be discussed but stressed the need for 
"balance." 
  He said that unsettled debts sometimes prevented further 
cooperation the profit from which would have been bigger than 
the very debts.

  [Text] Hanoi, April 16 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec today continued his official visit to Vietnam 
with separate meetings with his Vietnamese counterpart Ngyuen 
Manh Cam, Premier Vo Van Kiet and Chairman of the National 
Assembly (parliament) Nong Duc Manh. 
  At talks with the Vietnamese foreign minister Zieleniec 
raised the question of human rights. He informed Cam on 
receiving an open letter from the Czech section of the 
Vietnamese Renewal Party shortly before leaving Prague for 
Vietnam which contained a list of almost 150 people imprisoned 
in Vietnam for their religious convictions or for expressing 
disagreement with the Vietnamese Government. 
  Zieleniec pointed to world discussion on the topic of the 
universal nature of human rights and rights arising from 
historical and practical life conditions. 
  Zieleniec told journalists that he pointed to his Vietnamese 
colleague how important it was for the former Czechoslovakia 
that Western countries were concerned that human rights there 
were observed. He added, however, that the question of human 
rights did not hamper the Czech-Vietnamese talks as a whole and 
had adequate proportions. 
  He said that Vietnamese leadership rejects the criticism in 
this respect using the arguments which had once been used by the 
Czechoslovak communist leadership. 
  The essential part of the talks was dedicated to the 
possibilities for economic cooperation. The preparation of a 
trade agreement and an agreement on the employment of citizens 
of the other country were discussed. As soon as these two 
agreements are signed the preparation of an agreement on 
investment protection and the prevention of double taxation 
would start, Zieleniec said.

  [Text] It was learned on 13 April that Japan will not sign 
the accord on establishment of the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) at the ministerial talks of the multilateral trade 
negotiations (the Uruguay Round) which are being held in 
Marrakech, Morocco. 
  The government has decided that Japan will sign the final 
agreement document of the Uruguay Round, but will not sign the 
accord on the creation of the WTO out of consideration for the 
ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] which is still 
opposed to the opening up of the Japanese rice market and out of 
the need for Japan to avoid signing the accord before the Diet 
begins deliberating it for approval. The decision shows how 
fragile the coalition government is. 
  In the case of an ordinary treaty, the government signs the 
treaty and each signatory to the treaty ratifies it after 
obtaining approval from the parliament. The WTO accord, made up 
of 18 agreements, which is high on the agenda of the Marrakech 
ministerial talks, is to follow that procedure. 
  The final agreement document, which Japan will sign, is 
merely a piece of paper. It confirms that "the accord on the 
creation of the WTO is a sum of the results of negotiations at 
the Uruguay Round" and makes it mandatory for each signatory to 
submit the accord to its parliament and the accord will take 
effect on 1 January 1995. Therefore, Japan's refusal to sign the 
accord will have no specific impact on it unless the Diet 
refuses to approve it in its autumn session. Japan has attached 
importance to multilateral treaties and its refusal to sign the 
accord is "regrettable," (says a government source). 
  Like Japan, the United States will sign the final agreement 
document, but will not sign the accord because the U.S. 
administration has yet to obtain approval from Congress on 
individual agreements including an agreement on lowering 
tariffs. The European Union (EU) will sign the accord. However, 
the EU member nations are feuding over which side should have 
the authority to sign the accord -- the European Commission or 
member nations. Their dispute is still pending in the European 
Court. 
  Japan, the United States, and Europe have been at a loss 
over 
how to deal with the accord and this confusion shows that 
agreements hammered out at the Uruguay Round are the outcome of 
domestic compromises of each negotiating nation.

  [Text] The United States has informally asked Japan to 
suspend the yen-based loans to Iran Japan resumed last year. 
The U.S. Government has taken the position that "it is 
undesirable to provide economic aid to Iran that has been 
supporting terrorism and has been uncooperative in the Middle 
East peace process." In response, the Japanese Government is 
refuting the U.S. request, asserting: "The yen-based loans are 
to be used for projects unrelated to Iran's military buildup and 
there is no problem with Japan's resumption of the yen-based 
loans to that country." But the Japanese Government has yet to 
make the U.S. Government fully understand. 
  According to a concerned official, the U.S. request was made 
in late March by American officials with the U.S. Department of 
State and the National Security Council (NSC) to the Foreign 
Ministry. 
  The Japanese Government decided last May to resume the 
yen-based loans to Iran for the first time in 17 years after 
concluding that "Iran has a great influence in the Middle East 
and that Japan's economic aid to the country will bring 
political and economic stability to the region." The loans are 
expected to amount to 150 billion yen and are to be used for the 
construction of a dam on the Karun River in southeastern Iran. 
  The yen-based loans are to be provided in three installments 
because of the large amount. Japan was committed last year to 
approximately 38 billion yen in the first installment. A 
Foreign Ministry source says: "At the time, the Clinton 
administration did not have its Middle East policy team in place 
and the administration did not raise any objection to Japan's 
commitment." The Clinton administration has made clear its 
critical attitude toward Iran as it has shaped its policy toward 
the Middle East. The U.S. Government is said to have asked the 
Japanese Government to defer providing the second and third 
installments of the loans on which Japan is to decide this year. 
  The Japanese Government stresses: "It is not desirable to 
halt the yen-based loans to Iran halfway." The U.S. Government 
is said to be unhappy with the Japanese Government, claiming: 
"Japan is the only nation among the G-7 industrialized nations 
that is trying to use the Official Development Assistance (ODA) 
to provide massive economic aid to Iran." Anthony Lake, 
assistant to the president for national security affairs, has 
just written an article entitled "The Containment of Iran" in 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS, an influential foreign affairs journal in the 
United States. There is a possibility that the "Iran issue" 
will become a focal point at the talks of industrialized nations 
(the Naples summit) to be held this July.

  [Text] The U.S. Department of State has asked Japan to 
suspend yen-based loans to Iran. Commenting on the request, a 
Foreign Ministry source made it clear on 14 April that the 
Japanese Government has no intention of suspending yen-based 
loans and official development assistance (ODA) to Iran, at 
least for the time being, adding that the "Japanese Government 
has no hard evidence showing Iran as terrorist-supporting 
nation." The same Foreign Ministry source also disclosed that 
the Japanese Government sent Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi 
Fukuda to Washington on 10 April to explain its position 
regarding yen-based loans to Iran. 
  The Japanese Government decided last May to extend a total 
of 
150 billion yen in loans to finance Iran's construction of the 
Godal Raldal [name as published] hydroelectric power plant; the 
loans will be extended to Iran in three installments. A 
contract has already been concluded between the two countries on 
the first installment, totaling 38.6 billion yen. According to 
a senior Foreign Ministry official: "A contract for the first 
installment has already been concluded between Japan and Iran. 
Japan cannot suspend yen-based loans to Iran halfway through a 
contract. The second contract on turbine procurement is to be 
concluded within this year." 
  The government decided to resume yen-based loans to Iran for 
the first time in 17 years after concluding it is indispensable 
to assist the Iranian Government's efforts to promote economic 
reforms in order to bring peace and stability to the Gulf region 
and stabilize relations between Iran and its neighboring nations. 
  However, the U.S. Department of State and the National 
Security Council (NSC) have continued to put Iran under close 
surveillance, claiming Iran has supported terrorist activities 
on the basis of Islamic fundamentalism. Hence, the U.S. 
Government will certainly continue to ask Japan to halt 
yen-based loans to Iran.

  [Text] In the negotiations on lowering tariffs at the 
multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round) that were 
finally concluded in late March, the Japanese decided to abolish 
Japan's duties on a major imported American product produced in 
Arkansas as a "gift" to President Clinton. This was disclosed 
on 6 April. The view is surfacing that in an effort to patch up 
Japan-U.S. relations strained by the rupture of the recent 
Japan-U.S. summit, the Japanese made the decision as a "present" 
to the President. 
  At the final phase of the negotiations, the Japanese 
proposed 
that Japan abolish its duties on imported bromine compound, 
which is used to manufacture plastics and fire-resistant fibers. 
In the United States, Arkansas, where President Clinton was 
born, is a major producing state of the bromine compound. Japan 
imports most of its bromine compound and American bromine 
compound makes up two-thirds of Japan's imports. 
  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor is believed to have 
asked Japan to abolish the duties on imported bromine compound 
in tune with the President's hopes. The Japanese, fully aware 
of the U.S. political situation, made the decision as a "gift" 
to both the President and Mr. Kantor with the aim of using the 
gift as a last trump card to wring trade concessions from the 
United States. 
  The United States has dropped its demand for lowering 
Japan's 
duties on imported electronic products after the conclusion of 
the Uruguay Round. The United States made another trade 
concession to Japan in late March. The United States is 
believed to have made those trade concessions to Japan out of 
full consideration to the trade concession made by the Japanese 
at the Uruguay Round. However, the United States is said to have 
dropped only one-third of its trade demands on Japan it 
expressed a willingness to drop and it is still unclear as to 
what extent the gift will generate the effect of making the 
United States drop its trade demands on Japan.

<F P=106> [Article by Industrial News Department reporter Hideki </F>
Hirano; first in the series "Field Report on Market Opening"; 
this installment entitled "Auto Dealers: Dealers Welcoming U.S. 
Cars But `Keiretsu' Still Form Barriers"] 
  [Text] In the "National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign 
Trade Barriers," the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has blamed 
Japan for setting trade barriers against 43 items. Is Japan's 
market really closed, or are the trade frictions caused by the 
lack of U.S. efforts? We have assessed how the Japanese market 
is open in sectors criticized by the United States -- 
automobiles, plate glass, semiconductors, and medical and 
telecommunications equipment. 
<H5>  Imported Cars Become Popular </H5>
  Speaking to a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Japan, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale said 
as follows on 30 March: "There is virtually no progress.... 
Above all, I was disappointed with Japan's achievement in auto 
imports." The United States did not accept Japanese automakers' 
"voluntary action plan for purchasing U.S.-made products." 
  In the trade barriers report, the U.S. Government focused on 
Japanese "auto dealers." The United States is scheduled to 
review its trade barrier list in September, and Japan's auto 
dealers may be listed as one of the unfair industrial sectors. 
However, our field research showed that actual market trends 
are somewhat different from the harsh tone of intergovernment 
negotiations. 
  President Toshiro Nakada of the Honda Crio Tokyo Company 
said: "We have excellent responses from our customers. Of 
course, the Cherokee brings us a handsome profit." Honda Crio 
dealers began to sell Chrysler four-wheel-drive models in 1990. 
At that time, they really became sick of frequent customer 
claims of mechanical troubles and an inadequate supply of spare 
parts. However, changes took place in last 12 months. 
  The Autorama Seijo Company (president: Tomotoshi Ono, with 
its office in Setagaya, Tokyo) is also doing well in its sales 
of Ford models. This Ford dealership had been a burden on the 
company until six months ago, but the Taurus suddenly became 
popular among customers in the thirties and forties age group. 
At present, imported cars make up 60 percent of total sales, 
and they are improving the company's business performance. 
  While Japanese automakers are suffering from a prolonged 
sales slump, U.S. automakers have succeeded in improving the 
quality of their products. Japanese auto dealers are well aware 
of such market trends, and they want to "deal in profitable 
cars, no matter where they are from." In this connection, the 
Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales Company has recently decided to sell 
Ford cars because the company has too many employees and 
dealerships to sell only domestic cars. 
  Statistics released by the Fair Trade Commission state that 
2,010 domestic auto dealers (55.6 percent of the auto dealers in 
Japan) deal in foreign-made automobile. However, most of them 
are doing so because of business ties-up concluded between their 
parent companies and foreign automakers. Japan is the only 
nation where foreign automakers have to sell their own cars 
through local automakers. In this sense, Japanese automakers 
and dealers still form a great "keiretsu" barrier against 
foreign automakers. 
  A senior official of a European automaker in Japan said: "It 
is true that the Japanese market is exclusionary. But the Big 
Three have to try harder." European automakers have been 
building their sales network in Japan since the 1980's. In most 
cases, however, their achievements have been business carried 
out by dealer networks of Japanese automakers. Direct franchise 
contracts between European automakers and Japanese dealers do 
not exceed 40 cases. 
<H5>  Strong Financial Dependence on Automakers </H5>
  Japanese auto dealers have been taking a passive attitude 
toward dealing with foreign-made automobiles. This was partly 
because the competitive appeal of Japanese-made cars was still 
strong, but the primary reason was strong ties between Japanese 
automakers and subsidiary dealers. 
  When an auto dealer thinks about dealing in imported cars, 
it 
has to take into account the reaction of its parent company. 
Honda dealers began to deal in Chrysler models because the 
Honda Motor Company had started to take part in the supply of 
spare parts. Because the Toyota Motor Company has sales ties-up 
with Volkswagen and General Motors (GM), Toyota dealers cannot 
take a positive attitude toward dealing in Ford cars. 
  The Japanese auto market is unique in that a few dealers 
cover large areas. In the U.S. and European markets, 
"responsible coverage areas" are assigned to each shop, but 
Toyota and Nissan usually have only one dealer in each 
prefecture, and each prefectural dealer runs many branch shops. 
Dealers have to open many branch shops because automakers 
assign targets for regional market share. The financial needs 
for business expansion tend to create dealers' excessive 
dependence on automakers. 
  The Japanese auto parts market is closed to foreign 
companies, and this is also caused by the fact that the Japanese 
auto market is controlled by a small number of dealers. Japan's 
"parts makers companies" are usually established by automakers 
and local dealers, and this makes automaker-dealer ties even 
stronger. 
<H5>  U.S. Wants Direct Contracts With Dealers </H5>
  As seen in the trade barriers report, the United States is 
seeking direct franchise contracts with dealers without the 
intervention of Japanese automakers. The U.S. report defines a 
"fair market" as being where dealers can make their own 
decisions. 
  Under the present circumstances, the United States would not 
be convinced by Japan's claim that "U.S. automakers have free 
access to the Japanese market." From the standpoint of the 
United States, the "fairness" of Japan's manufacturer-led market 
would look suspicious. 
  A major Toyota dealer in the metropolitan area said: "We 
want a free hand from the parent company. We wish the 
manufacturer would make no complaint about our imported car 
business." Japanese automakers had better just introduce local 
dealers to U.S. automakers and let them freely discuss their own 
business affairs. This may appear to be a conservative method, 
but the United States may trust it better than the automakers' 
action plan, which was designed as a set of figures.

  [Text] Kunihiko Saito, administrative vice minister of 
foreign affairs, gave a lecture in Chiba City on 13 April and 
commented on the meeting between Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata 
and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor scheduled in 
Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April. He said: "We have absolutely 
no way of knowing whether an agreement can be reached there on a 
resumption of the (Japan-U.S.) framework trade talks. The issue 
may not be settled so easily, particularly because of the 
current political situation in Japan." He thus indicated it 
could be difficult to break the ice in resuming the deadlocked 
framework trade talks. 
  Saito then added: "In the past, mutual interests (between 
Japan and the United States) on security matters have covered up 
bilateral trade friction, but it is unlikely that such a 
situation would continue (in the future). Unless Japan tries 
harder, bilateral relations will worsen, contrary to what has 
happened in the past." He thus stressed the need for Japan to 
actively work toward breaking the deadlock.

  [Text] Tokyo -- On 12 April, a delegation led by Ginowan 
Mayor Seiken Tobaru called at the Foreign Ministry and the 
Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] to meet Tsutomu 
Hata, the foreign minister, and Eisuke Tsuruta, DFAA Chief 
Facilities Coordination Officer. 
  In reaction to a recent helicopter crash on Futenma Marine 
Corps Air Station [MCAS], the mayor strongly urged the 
disclosure of the investigation reports and an early reversion 
of Futenma MCAS, stressing "accidents happen repeatedly because 
U.S. bases are there." In reply, Foreign Minister Hata said: 
"We really understand Okinawan people's feelings. To ease the 
people's uneasy feelings, we would like to continue our efforts 
to meet their demands." 
  In addition to the mayor, the Ginowan delegation included 
municipal assembly Speaker Shunshin Nakamura, Chairman Seiei 
Chinen, and Vice Chairman Shinsho Chibana of the municipal 
assembly special committee on U.S. base problems. Delegation 
members strongly protested the accident, saying: "U.S. Forces 
are continuing military exercises as if they pay no regard to 
Okinawan people's anger at repeated accidents. The Japanese 
Government must bend constant efforts to reversion of U.S. 
bases." They then petitioned for the disclosure of 
investigation reports, an immediate halt to flight training in 
residential areas, and the early reversion of Futenma MCAS.

  [Text] VNA April 16 -- Foreign Minister [F.M.] Nguyen Manh 
Cam held talks here this afternoon with Foreign Minister Josef 
Zieleniec of the Republic of Czech, now on an official visit to 
Vietnam. 
  Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec and his wife arrived in 
Hanoi this morning, beginning an official friendship visit to 
Vietnam as guest of Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. 
  During the talks, Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam highly 
appreciated Mr. Zieleniec's first visit to Vietnam as a new step 
of development in the two countries' friendship and cooperation. 
He reaffirmed Vietnam's desire to develop its friendship and 
mutually beneficial cooperation with all countries in the world 
community, thus positively contributing to common efforts for 
peace, cooperation and development. 
  On the Vietnam-Czech relationship, F.M. Cam stressed that 
Vietnam had abided by the traditional friendship and cooperation 
between the two countries. He said that on the basis of making 
the most use of the existing strong points, and reasonably and 
flexibly applying the current conditions in each country, 
Vietnam and Czech could promote their bilateral cooperation of 
mutual benefits in various fields. He thanked the Czechoslovak 
Government and people in the past and the Czech Government and 
people at present for their precious assistance and support to 
the Vietnamese people in national defence and construction

  [Text] Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt and Prime 
Minister Paul Keating of Australia visited Vietnam in the first 
fortnight of April. Here is our review of these visits: 
  The two prime ministers came to Vietnam with a view to 
broaden cooperation with Vietnam. The Swedish prime minister 
inaugurated an Ericsson mobile communication system in Vietnam. 
The Ericsson Group of Sweden is a well known manufacturer of 
electronic and telecom equipments. The visit to Vietnam by 
Australian prime minister came after the two countries reached 
an agreement on the construction of My Thuan Bridge crossing the 
Tien River in southern Vietnam. This makes Australia rank the 
first among investors in construction in Vietnam as well as of 
all Indochina. 
  From either side of the Earth, Sweden and Australia have one 
thing in common, that is to contribute to the construction of 
Vietnam infrastructure, one of the most essential needs of 
Vietnam at the present moment. 
  The Australian prime minister also announced $140 million of 
aid to Hanoi to help the latter continue its renovation process. 
Sweden has also so far [word indistinct] granted aid to 
Vietnam. With the visit to Vietnam by Prime Minister Carl 
Bildt, Sweden plans to boost the economic ties with Vietnam. It 
is a new decision taken by Sweden. 
  Both Australian and Swedish leaders acknowledged the 
positive 
results of the ongoing renovation process in Vietnam. The truth 
created by Vietnam itself has urged more countries to invest in 
the country.

<F P=106> [From the 'Talk of the Week' feature] </F>
  [Text] Public attention is being paid to relations between 
Vietnam and the Vatican, relations relating to Vietnamese 
Catholics, the [words indistinct] relations. Mr. Vu Quang, 
director of the government committee for religious affairs, in a 
recent interview with the Vietnamese weekly DAI DOAN KET (Great 
Solidarity) provided an outline on these issues. 
  Mr. Vu Quang said that in the middle of last month, the 
Vatican sent a representative delegation headed by Deputy 
Foreign Minister Claudio Celli to Vietnam for a week to work on 
issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics and issues of mutual 
concern. That follows the 1990 visit of Cardinal (?Wilsur 
Heshgaray) to Vietnam. The cardinal and the Vietnamese 
Government agreed that the Vatican would inform the Vietnamese 
Government of all issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics, and 
only make a decision upon agreement reached with the Vietnamese 
Government. These issues include Vatican policy, the 
consecration of cardinals, bishops, and issues of mutual 
concern. When there are contradictory opinions, the two sides 
will meet for discussion. Up to now, the Vatican has sent four 
delegations to Vietnam, and Vietnam has also sent delegations to 
the Vatican. Eighteen bishops have been consecrated out of the 
approval of the Vietnamese Government upon office from the 
Vatican. During the last month visit to Vietnam, the Vatican 
reaffirmed the 1990 agreement. The Vatican delegation 
acknowledged that it was illogical to have a number of dioceses 
without bishops, as the Vatican delayed making a decision on 
personnel that the Vatican has proposed in the first place in 
which the Vietnamese Government has already approved. This 
time, both sides agreed to find a solution to the issue soon. 
The Vietnamese Government has agreed on the personnel proposed 
by the Vatican and to the bishops of Hanoi and Hue dioceses. 
  As for the cases of Khanh Hoa and Thanh Hoa provinces, the 
Vietnamese Government will consider an answer to Vatican in the 
shortest period of time. In Ho Chi Minh City, both sides agreed 
to keep up Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh in his position with full 
responsibility and power. The Vietnamese Government will 
discuss with the Vatican the successor to the archbishop in the 
Ho Chi Minh City Diocese. 
  Vietnam makes clear that the Vatican by asking Vietnamese 
Catholic priests not to join the Committee of United Vietnamese 
Catholics with the reason that the priests should not carry out 
political activities, the Vatican has [word indistinct] 
Vietnamese law, citizen rights, and human rights for the priests 
who have the rights to participate in social and patriotic 
activities. Vietnam makes clear that while the Vatican 
prevented Vietnamese Catholic priests from joining the Committee 
of United Vietnamese Catholics and other social organizations it 
lets some overseas Vietnamese Catholic priests carry out 
political activities, and the Vatican itself, slandering the 
situation of Vietnamese Catholics, and against the Vietnamese 
Government. It is a lack of goodwill attitude towards Vietnam, 
causing obstacles to normal relations between the Vatican and 
Vietnam. 
  The head of the Vatican delegation will report to the 
responsible priesthood in the Vatican on discussion in Vietnam, 
to remove all obstacles to normalize relations between the 
Vatican and the Vietnamese Government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>
  [Text] Japan's trade surplus with its trading partners in 
Asia has grown because Japanese enterprises have advanced into 
Asian countries and the economy of the Asian region has grown 
far faster than of other regions in the world. This trend shows 
a change in the business strategies of Japanese enterprises. 
Japanese enterprises have concluded that they should look to the 
Asian market for their exports which voices relatively little 
discontent with Japan and is expected to grow in the future 
rather than increase their exports to the United States that may 
trigger fresh bilateral trade friction. 
  Japan's trade surplus with Asian nations accounted for only 
30 percent of its trade surplus with the United States by the 
mid-1980's. Its surplus in trade with Asian nations, however, 
has jumped about 30 percent every year since 1990 when Japanese 
enterprises, beset by the appreciated yen, began to move their 
production operations to Asian nations and as a result, Japan's 
trade surplus with Asian nations has grown faster than that with 
the United States which has grown less than 10 percent every 
year. 
  There is a view that once Japanese enterprises slow down the 
movement of their production operations to Asian nations, 
exports from Asian nations to Japan will increase and Japan's 
trade surplus with those nations will decrease. Yet this view 
is held only by a small number of Japanese businessmen. They 
believe that "most of the goods produced by locally incorporated 
companies of Japanese firms in Asian nations are geared for 
exports to the United States." The goods produced by those 
locally affiliated companies are likely to become a factor in 
increasing Asia's trade surplus with the United States, not in 
decreasing Japan's trade surplus with Asian nations. With Japan 
expected to boost its exports to Asian nations in anticipation 
that their per capita incomes and economies will grow rapidly, 
Japan's trade surplus with Asian countries is highly likely to 
continue to grow. If these trends continue, Asian nations will 
certainly ask Japan to boost its imports from them. There is a 
possibility that the United States will intensify its criticism 
of Japan, claiming "Japanese enterprises are moving their 
production operations of goods exported to the United Sates to 
Asian countries to avoid trade friction with the United States."

  [Text] The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries 
[MAFF] announced that it will lift the ban on imports of apples 
from the United States currently in force under the Plant 
Quarantine Law. The reason is that all technical issues have 
been resolved through pest control and disinfectant inspections. 
After public hearings are held with the concerned parties, the 
import ban may be lifted as early as this autumn. 
  After the ban is lifted, tens of thousand tons of apples, 
which are cheaper than Japanese-produced ones, may enter the 
market each year, and Japanese farmers will be forced to compete. 
  In connection with apple imports, the United States is 
strongly critical of the closed nature of the Japanese market. 
This issue was included in the list of foreign trade barriers 
published in late March and has been a political issue between 
Japan and the United States. 
  In view of the continuous Japanese refusal to allow the 
import of U.S. apples, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
and Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy last year sent several 
letters to the Japanese Government asking for an early lifting 
of the import ban. Certain quarters in the United States have 
even demanded the imposition of sanctions under Section 301 of 
the Omnibus Trade Act (on sanctions against unfair trade 
practices). In response to the U.S. demand, Japan has asserted: 
"The possibility of new pests being brought into Japan exists. 
We cannot permit the ban on imports to be lifted without 
quarantine procedures being enacted." 
  With regard to the remaining problem of fire blight, 
coddling 
moths, and other pests and diseases found on U.S. apples, the 
United States provided all the required extermination data last 
year. The MAFF has concluded that "we found no problems with 
the data." It has sent inspectors to the United States for 
on-the-spot inspections and is now in the process of a final 
verification. 
  The inspection involves a check on the pest-control 
procedures in the United States. A senior MAFF official says 
that "unless we find something really serious, there seems to be 
no reason to deny imports." The MAFF is scheduled to finish all 
public hearings for local apple farmers, academicians, and other 
concerned parties by the summer. After this, the formal 
decision on lifting the ban will be made. The ministry plans to 
finish all the required domestic procedures before the harvest 
season starts in the United States in September.

  [Text] In an interview with a NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 
reporter on 13 April, Yelmakov, chief of the Reactor Bureau of 
Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry, who was attending the annual 
conference on atomic power in Hiroshima City, made it clear that 
Russia will seek Japan's cooperation in developing a new-type 
reactor to burn plutonium extracted from the dismantling of 
nuclear weapons. According to the Russian official, Russia will 
formally ask Japan in the near future to cooperate with it in 
developing the new-type reactor in accordance with the 
Japan-Russia Atomic Power Agreement. 
  The new-type reactor, for the development of which Russia 
plans to seek Japan's cooperation, is a fast-breeder reactor 
(BN-800) capable of generating 800,000 kilowatts. At present, 
the building of the new-type reactor remains suspended. Russia 
plans to replace the current reactor core capable of breeding 
fuel with a new reactor core capable of burning plutonium 
extracted from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and ultra 
uranium element to process them into fuel. 
  In the interview, Yelmakov also said that Russia intends to 
promote the development of the new-type reactor as "an 
international project like the International Thermonuclear 
Fusion Research Project."

  [Text] Fielding Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime minister and 
foreign minister, as a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, while maintaining the current framework of the 
coalition government is the profile of the next administration 
that business leaders want to see, according to a NIHON KEIZAI 
SHIMBUN survey. On 12 April, the paper questioned senior 
officials at the four major Japanese economic organizations, 
including Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic 
Organizations], and top executives of major corporations on the 
issue of Hosokawa's successor. The results indicate that 
business leaders are turning away from the Liberal Democratic 
Party [LDP], as well as that they "hope the next administration 
will be one that will not move back the tide of political, 
administrative, and economic reforms" (as stated by Masaru 
Hayami, chairman of Japan Association of Corporate Executives), 
which Prime Minister Hosokawa has undertaken. However, there 
still are some business leaders who strongly call for fielding 
former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe for the prime 
ministership on the condition that the LDP split again. 
  In the survey, 20 business leaders responded to questions. 
Asked "who should be the next prime minister," 10, or nearly 
half, of 22 votes cast (respondents were allowed to list more 
than one favorite choice) went to Hata. As to why they endorsed 
him, some business leaders said "he seems stable and clean," 
while others said "he will ride the current of reform started by 
the Hosokawa administration and definitely continue to promote 
reform efforts." 
  If the current framework of the coalition government were to 
be maintained, there is strong inclination toward fielding Hata, 
who currently holds the no. 2 post in the Hosokawa 
administration, for the prime ministership, as this is 
considered the most appropriate choice. One top corporate 
executive explained: "To field Mr. Hata is tantamount to 
fielding Mr. Ozawa. The survey results prove there are now more 
business leaders who hold expectations for Ozawa as a man of 
action." 
  Watanabe ranked second to Hata, collecting a quarter of the 
votes. Some of his supporters said they chose him because "he 
is a strong leader," while others did so because "he can be 
expected to promptly settle budget-related issues, including tax 
system reform, since he is an economics expert." However, some 
business leaders say "I cannot stand Mitchie [Watanabe's 
nickname]," as they are concerned about his style of economic 
management, which is said to be inflationary. 
  Some business leaders supported Chief Cabinet Secretary 
Masayoshi Takemura (chairman of Sakigake [Harbinger Party]), who 
distances himself from the Shinseito [Japan Renewal 
Party]-Komeito-Japan New Party bloc. He has been praised by 
some business leaders who say "his abilities had much to do with 
deregulation and other economic reform efforts undertaken by the 
Hosokawa administration." This indicates Takemura enjoys the 
support of some business leaders who are cautious about 
Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's high-handed political 
style. 
  One business leader endorsed Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of 
the Social Democratic Party of Japan, but he said: "It would be 
only on the condition that he lead a tentative administration 
that would merely take care of the fiscal year 1994 budget and 
trade relations with the United States, which are impending 
issues."

  [Text] Answering correspondents' questions at the Diet 
building on 14 April, Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of 
Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] stated: "The moment of decision 
is fast approaching." He indicated that if Chief Cabinet 
Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, head of Sakigake [Harbinger], 
insists on deciding on the new prime minister at a meeting of 
leaders of the coalition parties, he would ask the coalition 
representatives meeting to enter substantial discussions on the 
succession issue without Sakigake. 
  At the end of the representatives meeting on the morning of 
14 April, Ozawa expressed displeasure at the conflict in the 
ruling coalition parties over the venue of discussions to select 
the new prime minister. He stated: "There has been no progress 
at all. We cannot afford to be dilly-dallying forever." 
Concerning the suggestion that the issue be taken up at a joint 
meeting of party leaders and representatives, Ozawa explained: 
"I am not the one opposed to this. Takemura is the problem." 
He criticized Takemura in strong terms, saying "(he) says we 
have to start everything from scratch, including the coalition." 
  With regard to the Social Democratic Party of Japan and the 
Democratic Socialist Party, Ozawa wanted them to take an 
explicit position on whether they want to undertake discussions 
at the party leaders' meeting or at the representatives' 
meeting. He said: "They should talk within their own parties 
whether they want to do things the Sakigake way."

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] is worried on account 
of the handling of a supplementary budget to make up for the 
fiscal year 1994 provisional budget. It is having difficulty 
deciding on the period to be covered by the supplementary budget 
because of prolonged political confusion over the choice of a 
successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, although 
it is certain that a fiscal year 1994 budget bill will not be 
enacted before the stopgap budget runs out on 20 May. Also, 
because it cannot work on the budget during the consecutive 
holidays starting at the end of April, the ministry eagerly 
hopes that "the owner of the official residence (prime minister) 
will be decided as soon as possible." 
  The government submitted the fiscal year 1994 budget bill to 
the Diet on 4 March. However, because the Diet failed to open 
deliberations on the budget, the government compiled a stopgap 
budget with only necessary and minimum expenses. The stopgap 
budget, which is currently being implemented, covers a period of 
50 days starting from 1 April. Continuing arguments over who 
should succeed Hosokawa are even preventing the government from 
delivering its reasons for its proposing the fiscal year 1994 
budget bill to the Diet. It is now certain that the government 
has to compile a supplementary budget to compensate for the 
fiscal year 1994 provisional budget. 
  The government can have a supplementary budget covering a 
period of 40 days at the longest, until 29 June, when the 
current Diet session ends. With the supplementary budget, the 
government can avoid the situation in which it again has to 
compile another stopgap budget, even if deliberations on the 
fiscal year 1994 budget are further delayed. 
  But the MOF's Budget Bureau is worried that "If the 
government, which is calling for an early enactment of the 
budget bill, submits a bill on a supplementary budget that 
covers a period until the end of the current Diet session, some 
people may think that the government assumes the fiscal year 
1994 budget bill will not be enacted before the end of the 
current Diet session." 
  It will be convenient for the government if it can discuss 
the timetable for budget deliberations with opposition parties 
upon the election of the next prime minister and compile a 
supplementary budget based on the timetable agreed upon. The 
MOF, however, said the problem is that "we have no one to 
consult with about this plan at present because it is still 
uncertain who will be the next prime minister."

  [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] has tentatively decided to 
adopt helicopters built by American Sikorsky Company as a model 
to build next-generation multipurpose helicopters (UH-X) for use 
by the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF], and Mitsubishi Heavy 
Industries will build the helicopters after obtaining a license 
from the American helicopter builder. The DA, which has 
informally notified the American helicopter builder of its 
tentative decision, plans to include expenditures for the 
procurement of several helicopters in its preliminary budget 
request for fiscal 1995. Eurocopter, a French and German 
joint-venture helicopter-manufacturing company, has negotiated 
with the DA, but it has decided to seek the license for the 
production of advanced helicopters from Sikorsky Company which 
has granted Japanese defense contractors licenses to build 
helicopters for use by the Air Self-Defense Force and the 
Maritime Self-Defense Force. The advanced helicopters cost 
approximately 4 billion yen each and the DA is expected to 
procure about 50 of them in the long run. 
  The UH-X is a successor to the current UH-H helicopter which 
is used by the GSDF for transport of troops and rescue 
operations. The DA has classified the successor into two types 
-- the advanced model and the conventional model. The UH-X 
belongs to the advanced one whereas the UH-H belongs to the 
conventional one. The DA has begun to procure UH-J helicopter, 
a new version of the UH-H, which Fuji Heavy Industries has built 
under the license granted by American Bell Company. 
  The DA has worked on choosing a model of large helicopter 
that exceeds the UH-J helicopter in flying range and transport 
capability. Although Eurocopter has negotiated with the DA, it 
has tentatively decided to adopt UH-60J built by Sikorsky 
Company as a model to build the UH-X helicopters. No decision 
has been made on the next plan for defense buildup which begins 
from 1996. Details of the DA's plans to purchase the advanced 
helicopters are unknown, but it is expected to procure about 50 
advanced helicopters.

  [Text] A NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN survey found that half of 10 
major economists questioned said they believe the recession had 
already hit bottom by March and that the current recession is 
not the longest one since World War II. They noted that 
individual consumption is picking up and that industrial output 
increased in the two-month period starting in January 1994. On 
the other hand, most of them termed the recent confusion on the 
political scene and the appreciation of the yen as negative 
factors for an economic recovery, adding that the economic 
situation may become even worse after April if the enactment of 
the fiscal year 1994 budget is drastically delayed. 
  NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN sent questionnaires to 10 
private-sector 
economists working with major research institutes and obtained 
responses by 11 April. 
  The recession started in May 1991. If the Japanese economy 
is still turned downward this April, the length of this 
recession would rank with the nation's longest recession 
following the second oil shock (36 months from March 1980 to 
February 1983). However, 50 percent of the surveyed economists 
said they disagree with the view that "the economy hit bottom 
after April, and the recession will break the record of the 1980 
recession." 
<H5>  Optimists Pay Attention to Expanding Consumption </H5>
  Among the five economists who answered that economic growth 
has already begun, Yuji Shimanaka, Sanwa Research Institute 
chief analyst, demonstrated the most optimistic view, saying 
that the economic upturn started in October 1993. He noted that 
some important economic indices, such as industrial output and 
factory capacity rates, "reached turning points in October." 
The other four economists who also said that the recession had 
ended by March noted: 1) Positive moves are seen in individual 
consumption; 2) public works spending and investment in housing 
are at adequate levels; and 3) the private sector is promoting 
business restructuring. 
  However, they said that upward movement of the economy is 
still very weak and that the business sector's investment in 
equipment will remain low until the end of this year. They 
added that "economic recovery is unlikely to be evident in 
business statistics in the first half of this year" (as noted by 
Masao Yokomizo, Nikko Research Center deputy director general). 
<H5>  Pessimists Focus on Yen Rate Hike, Overemployment </H5>
  On the other hand, all five economists who said that the 
recession is still continuing termed the appreciation of the yen 
as the main reason for the delay in Japan's economic recovery. 
Market trends have again been pushing up the yen rate since the 
end of March, when the United States expressed dissatisfaction 
with the Japanese Government's economic reform package. Masaru 
Takagi, Fuji Research Institute chief analyst, said that "the 
yen will strengthen if the political turmoil is prolonged and 
Japan fails to work out tangible measures for expanding the 
domestic market by the time of the Group of Seven summit." He 
said in that case, favorable trends in some export industries 
would not result in a full-fledged economic recovery. 
  Director Yoshikazu Takao of the Nomura Research Institute 
Economic Research Department noted that "the business sector is 
still troubled by overemployment, and this will delay an upturn 
in business profits." As for the recent recovery in individual 
consumption, Koichi Masugata, Nissei Research Institute deputy 
chief analyst, said that "a consumer-led economic recovery is 
unlikely because an increase in income has not yet been observed 
among consumers." 
<H5>  Impact of Political Turmoil </H5>
  Most respondents, including those who answered that the 
recession had already hit bottom, said that political turmoil 
since Prime Minister Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation 
is a "negative factor for an economic recovery." Yukio Yamaya, 
managing director of the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Research 
Institute, stated that he "may have to revise his view that the 
bottom of the recession occurred in the last quarter of 1993" if 
the enactment of the fiscal year 1994 budget is drastically 
delayed by confusion in selection of Hosokawa's successor. A 
political vacuum cools down the economic actions of the business 
sector and individual consumers, and the delay in budget 
deliberations may temporarily stop the enactment of public work 
projects. 
  However, the Sanwa Research Institute's Shimanaka said that 
"upward movement is being observed in economic trends, and 
confusion on the political scene will not fully affect the 
economy."

  [Text] Pressure for Higher Yen Intensifies--Factors 
Include Political Turmoil, Deadlocked Japan-U.S. Negotiations 
and Foreign Exchange Futures Transactions Related to Exports 
  Foreign exchange markets reflect intensifying pressure for a 
higher yen. The reason is that the perception is spreading that 
Japanese political turmoil will preclude any progress in the 
expansion of domestic demand, decontrol of markets and 
correction of the Japan-U.S. trade imbalance. The perception of 
dollar surpluses associated with the need for large-scale 
purchases of yen and sales of dollars by export industries has 
also accelerated a high yen-cheap dollar situation. The view 
prevails that for the time being the yen will hover in the high 
range of 101-105 yen to the dollar. 
  In response to the widening chasm associated with the 
selection of a successor prime minister by the coalition 
parties, the perspective is strengthening that "further delays 
will take place in the reopening of the suspended Japan-U.S. 
comprehensive economic talks." Prospects are that Foreign 
Minister Hata will attend the cabinet minister-level meetings of 
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT) in Morocco to seek an agreement for resumption of the 
comprehensive talks, but the view prevails that "talks of a 
serious nature cannot be resumed until the appointment of a new 
government," and it appears that expectations of a high yen for 
the future will persist in the face of the political vacuum. 
  The U.S. Government is expected to wait for the decision to 
be made on the next prime minister and to allow for additional 
time in the disposition of pending problems such as the 
comprehensive talks. However, repeated statements by C. Fred 
Bergsten, chief of the U.S. International Economic Research 
Center, currently visiting Japan, relative to tolerating a high 
yen have prompted market sources to comment that "They encourage 
speculative buying of the yen." 
  A look at the supply and demand situation for the dollar in 
currency markets indicates that export-import firms have begun 
to establish this fiscal year's intra-company exchange rate at 
105 yen for the dollar for accounting purposes. Accordingly, 
they show signs of steadily entering into currency futures 
contracts to sell the dollar whenever the yen falls in value to 
above 105 yen to the dollar. In reality, last weekend when news 
of Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation hit the markets, the 
yen dropped temporarily, but prompt selling of dollars by 
export-import firms prevented any persistent fall in the yen. 
Sources at Sumitomo Corporation interpret the situation in the 
currency markets as "Substantiating the perception of a surplus 
in dollars." 
  Sources at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank point to frequent mention 
that structurally, "It will be difficult for a while to alter 
conditions which cause a monthly trade surplus of $10 billion." 
In view of this situation, unless institutional investors 
actively purchase foreign debentures, the excess dollar supply 
will continue and incremental selling of dollars will occur. 
Currency market sources state, "Although we will see near-term 
demand for purchase of dollars in connection with Brazilian bond 
purchases by Japanese banks, the basic trend reflecting a high 
yen-cheap dollar relationship will not change."

  [Excerpts] Editorial Urges Policy Coordination To 
Prevent Repeated U.S. Interest Hikes 
  Hikes in U.S. interest rates have adversely impacted upon 
world currency and capital markets. The modification of 
financial policy on the part of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board 
(FRB) was a logical measure to prevent an overheating of the 
economy and to correct the bubble phenomenon, but, as financial 
markets become globalized and increasingly affected by 
computerization, the aftereffects are of an unexpected 
magnitude. Since the world economy as a whole is just nearing 
signs of a recovery, the advanced nations face the need to seek 
policy coordination to prevent a chain of hikes in U.S. interest 
rates. 
  In response to the combined 0.5-percent hike in the federal 
funds (FF)--which influence short-term market rates--in two 
stages by the FRB, 30-year government bonds, which serve as an 
index for long-term U.S. interest rates, temporarily rose to 7.4 
percent. The hike in U.S. interest rates has caused New York 
Stock Exchange indices to drop 10 percent from their recent 
peaks. Turmoil in U.S. securities markets has adversely impacted 
not only markets of advanced nations such as Japan and Europe, 
but newly emerging markets found in Asia, Central and South 
America, the former East European nations and Africa to which 
large sums of U.S. capital were flowing. [passage omitted] 
  The fact that changes in policy in the United States had a 
worldwide ripple effect attests to the fact that national 
barriers no longer exist in terms of the flow of capital. 
Moreover, the computer dependence of markets has had a tendency 
to amplify fluctuations. Such circumstances make it almost 
impossible for monetary authorities of the various nations to 
intervene and shield their markets from the effects of rising 
U.S. interest rates. 
  The problem is that the effects of those policy changes have 
impacted on the Japanese and German economies which hold the key 
to future worldwide economic recovery. Now that there is the 
fear that foreign capital once flowing into Germany will flow 
out of that country, there is the possibility that the German 
Federal Bank will hesitate to continue with its policy of easing 
restrictions on the money markets. The situation in Germany 
could very well serve to shackle monetary easing policies of the 
other European continental nations. Rising long-term interest 
rates are a headache for Japan, too, where it appears that the 
economy is ready to bounce off from the bottom of the cycle. 
  The seven advanced nations (G-7) have no choice but to 
reconstitute their efforts at policy coordination. Lurking under 
the surface relative to the current monetary turmoil is the huge 
recurring U.S. international balance of payments deficit. 
Reducing the international balance of payments deficit will 
require the Clinton administration to cut federal government 
deficit spending and encourage a reversal in the savings rates 
which has fallen to 4 percent of earnings. 
  Japan must clearly enunciate tax reform primarily 
encompassing an income tax cut and a future hike in consumption 
tax. If government deficits should rise in an uncontrolled 
manner, the pressure on long-term interest rates will rise. We 
must also launch a market-opening plan of substance as a means 
to overcome Japan-U.S. economic friction which can become the 
cause for securities market turmoil. 
  Unfavorable news impacting on securities markets such as 
President and Mrs. Clintons' Whitewater scandal, Prime Minister 
Hosokawa's resignation and tension in the Korean peninsula are 
intensifying. Political factors coming into play just as world 
economic tides are about to change make securities markets more 
susceptible to chain reactions. This is the very reason why 
there is a need for renewed coordination by monetary authorities 
at the G-7 Finance Ministers Meeting scheduled for the end of 
June.

  [Text] Editorial Criticizes Lax Structure Which Led 
to Huge Foreign Exchange Speculative Losses 
  Oil refining company Kajima Petroleum incurred foreign 
exchange losses approximating eight times its capitalization of 
20 billion yen and officials of the company are in the process 
of disposing of company assets to offset the losses. Last year, 
at about this time, another petroleum firm known as Showa Shell 
Sekiyu had suffered foreign exchange losses reaching 160 billion 
yen. Foreign exchange speculative losses have decreased among 
financial institutions and trading firms in recent times, but 
such problems have now shifted to the petroleum industry. Rigid 
reviews must be performed to determine whether internal 
structures of petroleum firms are the cause for the occurrence 
of the huge foreign exchange losses. 
  First, we need to examine why such huge foreign exchange 
loss 
accumulations were recorded. 
  During a session of the Foreign Exchange Council in June 
1993 
a rule was approved which banned, as a matter of principle, any 
postponement in the settlement of foreign exchange futures 
contracts. When the market rate reflects a higher yen valuation 
than the contracted futures rate at the settlement date, a 
larger amount of yen must be paid to settle the transaction than 
in the case where a conversion takes place on a cash basis. 
Businesses often fear the occurrence of such losses in currency 
fluctuations and delay settlement to a future date and wait for 
the market rate to move to a lower yen valuation. 
  The reason why petroleum firms suffer huge foreign exchange 
losses is that they conclude currency contracts in amounts 
exceeding crude oil import costs and undergo repeated delays in 
settlement of payments for crude oil transactions of huge 
monetary values. You might say that they had involved themselves 
in currency speculation. However, the rule change implemented by 
the Foreign Exchange Council has put a stop to the delays in 
settlement dates, forcing the petroleum firms to reveal their 
foreign exchange losses. 
  The question is, why were the petroleum firms able to delay 
their settlement dates over a period of several years? There was 
a time when financial institutions engaged themselves in a loan 
war targeting petroleum firms which had a need for huge sums of 
dollars. As the petroleum firms avoided the surfacing of their 
foreign exchange losses and intensified their pace of delays in 
settlement dates, their currency losses ballooned. 
  The normal approach used by Japanese firms is to engage in 
currency futures contracts within amounts which equal real costs 
of importing raw materials and finished products. Compliance 
with such intracompany financial discipline is a matter that 
requires both internal and external audit. It appears that 
petroleum firms maintained a very lax system which made it 
difficult for such audit capabilities to function properly. 
  Financial institutions of our nation rode the wave created 
by 
the myth that land values will rise forever, were mesmerized by 
the bubble economy and found themselves in a predicament. 
However, they were saved by generous industry protective 
measures designed under the "noble cause" of protecting 
depositors. 
  Similarly, it appears that the petroleum industry has 
suffered from a diminishing sense of responsibility amidst 
conservative government and industry systems which call for 
protection of industry interests under the "noble cause" of 
ensuring a stable supply of energy. 
  Prices of petroleum products such as gasoline in Japan which 
are higher than those of other nations as well as inflexible 
prices are caused by rigid industry structures which have 
rejected the decontrol of exports and imports and condoned costs 
and margins which are higher when compared on an international 
basis. Too much emphasis has been placed on stable supplies, 
while neglecting actions to cut costs and increase competition 
through the free market entry and departure process. 
  The deficiencies in management structure which permitted 
foreign exchange speculation and the need to pursue measures to 
compensate for speculative losses at Kajima Petroleum are not 
completely unrelated to conditions in the petroleum industry 
nurtured by protective government regulations. There is an 
urgent need to convert government and industry so that genuine 
use can be made of domestic and international competitive 
principles.

  [Text] Financial Industry Adopts New Program for 
Resale of Loans Without Consent of Borrower 
  The financial industry has developed a "loan participation 
program" as a means to dispose of and create liquidity for loans 
and reduce bank assets. The program includes conditions such as 
1) sale of right to principal and interest to investors; 2) 
absence of right by investors to demand repayment; and 3) 
assumption by investors of any risk associated with failure of 
borrower to repay loan. The program differs from past programs 
to attain liquidity of such assets in that the liquidity can be 
established without the consent of the borrower because the 
investors will not possess the right to seek direct repayment of 
the loan. Private-sector financial institutions exercise a 
strong desire to reduce assets for the purpose of enhancing net 
worth and reduce risks associated with fluctuating interest 
rates and it appears that they will begin in earnest to attain 
greater liquidity through the new program by the end of the 
current fiscal year. 
  Under the new program, banks will sell the right to receive 
principle and interest on loans to investors, but assume 
responsibility to collect principle and interest from borrowers 
and make payments to investors. Banks will charge a fee for the 
collection services. 
  The contracts to be concluded between banks and investors 
will provide that the investor assumes the risk in the event a 
borrower defaults on a loan and that the investor will forfeit 
the right to demand repayment from the debtor. The contract will 
also provide that when the borrower defaults because of 
bankruptcy, banks will endeavor to recover principal to the 
degree feasible. City banks played a central role in preparing a 
report which covers the details of the new program. 
  The new program, in contrast to the former "loan transfer 
program" wherein loans were resold to attain liquidity of such 
assets, carries the major difference of not granting investors 
the right to seek repayment in the event of a default. However, 
fees payable by investors will be set at lower levels. 
  Since investors will not have the right to demand repayment, 
borrowers are not faced with the risk of being asked by 
purchasers of the loans for repayment. This means that banks 
will not be required to obtain the consent of borrowers for 
resale of the loans. In Japan, it was difficult to obtain the 
consent of borrowers for the transfer of loans, but the new 
program provides for immediate liquidity of loan instruments. 
  Under the new program, banks transfer default risks to 
investors and loan principal and interest payments become the 
property of investors.

  [Text] As of Fiscal Yearend 1993, First Decline in 
Loans and First Increase in Deposits in Three Years Recorded by 
City Banks 
  According to the flash report of deposits and loans issued 
by 
the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan on the 11th, 
the total loans of the 11 city banks outstanding as of the end 
of fiscal year 1993 (end of March 1994) was 221.9725 trillion 
yen, reflecting a drop of 0.6 percent from the prior year. This 
was the first decline since the survey was started in 1954. 
These figures clearly indicate that demand for funds have 
remained in the doldrums both on the corporate and private 
individual level owing to a decline in capital investments and 
consumption because of the recession. Some quarters also point 
to the reluctance of banks to issue new loans. 
  Aside from city banks, the seven trust and banking 
companies' 
loans outstanding stood at 25.4258 trillion yen, an increase of 
4.1 percent over the prior year. The three long-term credit 
banks' loans outstanding stood at 47.4462 trillion yen, a drop 
of 0.2 percent from the prior year. Even the combined loans 
outstanding for city banks, trust and banking companies and 
long-term credit banks showed a 0.1-percent drop from the prior 
year, the first such decline since initiation of the survey. 
  On the other hand, deposits at the 11 city banks as of the 
end of fiscal year 1993 stood at 196.168 trillion yen, 
reflecting a 2.0-percent increase from the prior year, the first 
increase in three years. Time deposits centered around large 
accounts declined, but corporate deposits and individual demand 
deposits increased. 
  Preliminary estimates of outstanding debentures issued as of 
the end of fiscal year 1993 by long-term credit banks reflected 
a balance of 51.3323 trillion yen, a 0.9-percent decline from 
the prior year. Trust and banking company deposits outstanding 
stood at 10.919 trillion yen, an increase of 4.9 percent from 
the prior year.

  [Text] IDC To Double Systems Engineering Staff in 
Information Systems Division by Fiscal Yearend by Hiring Mostly 
Experienced Applicants 
  International Digital Communications (IDC) a new telegraph 
and telephone company engaged in international communications, 
headquartered in Daito ward, Tokyo and headed by Kento Orihata, 
will double its systems engineering staff in its Information 
Systems Division during fiscal year 1994. Additionally, this 
development will evolve into the active assignment of the 
division to projects designed to develop new types of services. 
The company will beef up its services development capabilities 
as a way to better compete with rival Kokusai Denshin Denwa 
(KDD). 
  As of 1 March, IDC had a total of 530 employees, of which 38 
were assigned to the Information Systems Division. That number 
will be increased to about 70 in fiscal year 1994. Recruiting 
will focus primarily on experienced applicants, but will also 
include some newly graduated applicants. 
  IDC formerly assigned most of its new services development 
projects to two activities known as "Services Development 
Promotion Section" and "Business Promotion Division." The 
"Information System Division" specialized in projects in the 
administrative area such as the design and operation of billing 
systems and late-payment follow-up systems. However, now that 
communications services have become sophisticated and 
complicated and billing formats will change drastically, IDC 
seeks to enhance developmental efficiency by involving the 
Information Services Division from the early stages of services 
development work.

  [Text] KDD-Developed Multiplexer Increases Digital 
Circuit Capacity 8.5 Times 
  Kokusai Denshin Denwa (KDD) has developed a multiplexer used 
to efficiently transmit signals over a single dedicated digital 
circuit. The device is designed for use by small-scale 
businesses which have a limited number of dedicated circuits and 
is capable of priority transmission of compressed voice signals, 
while using blank spaces among voice signals to transmit image 
data via facsimile. Compared with pulse code modulation (PCM) 
methods of communication, it is said that channel volume can be 
increased 8.5-fold. 
  The newly developed multiplexer will be installed on the 
output side of private branch exchanges (PBX) and digital 
signals will be transmitted through the device over dedicated 
circuits. 
  Since only about 40 percent of the time consumed for voice 
communications is used for actual transmission of voice signals, 
a separate set of call signals will be transmitted using the 
blank spaces. Additionally, voice signals will be compressed to 
a maximum of one-fifth of their original volume. This procedure 
resulted in a modest drop in the quality of the voice 
communication, but enabled an 8.5-fold increase in channel 
volume. 
  Image signals are handled so that they are first accumulated 
in the multiplexer and transmitted in small increments in packet 
format when circuits are not congested with voice 
communications. The system provides for consolidated output via 
PBX, when a complete package of image data reaches the receiving 
multiplexer. 
  Further, at the time the sending multiplexer receives an 
input signal for image data, a signal is sent to the receiving 
number to confirm the availability of a facsimile machine. Image 
data is accumulated only when a confirmation is received and a 
data receipt message is sent to the facsimile machine handling 
the data input. 
  Whenever the multiplexer is not used, blank spaces between 
signals do not occur during image data transmission and circuits 
are subject to exclusive use. This being the case, businesses 
with a limited number of dedicated circuits would at times be 
unable to engage in voice communications during transmission of 
images. 
  Experimental devices made by KDD have been confirmed to have 
the capability to simultaneously transmit 17 types of voice 
communications on one dedicated circuit assuming the capacity to 
transmit at the rate of 128 kilobits per second. In the future, 
KDD hopes to increase the number of terminals that can be 
serviced and commercialize the device for use in international 
communications directed at businesses with a limited number of 
dedicated circuits.

  [Text] Fujitsu Develops System for Parallel 
Transmission of 20 Types of Data Via Six Optical Fiber Cables 
  Fujitsu Research Center, located in Kawasaki city and headed 
by President Mikio Otsuki, has developed a device for parallel 
transmission of 20 different kinds of data via six optical fiber 
cables. Phase shifts (subtle differences in arrival times) occur 
at the receiving terminal when multiple types of data are 
transmitted via differing sets of optical fiber cables, but a 
feature of the new device is that it automatically corrects such 
conditions. Fujitsu claims the new device can be used on basic 
transmission modules of large-scale computers and in animated 
image transmission devices for multimedia systems. 
  The newly developed device converts 20 different types of 
data from electrical to optial signals and transmits the data at 
speeds of 156 megabits (1 megabit equals 1 million bits) per 
second via optical fiber cable. Maximum capacity of the device 
is the combined processing of large volumes of data at the rate 
of 3.12 gigabits (1 giga equals 1 billion bits) per second. 
Further, the receiving terminal can convert all signals to 
electrical signals that are uniformly timed. 
  One optical fiber cable will be fed with clock signals 
reflecting the timing for each piece of data and the remaining 
five optical fiber cables will be used to transmit 20 types of 
data including 19 different types of data and a standard signal 
to be used for synchronization. Each optical fiber cable will be 
used to transmit four types of data in the form of a packet 
(data sorted into a fixed unit) and a standard signal will be 
inserted between packets. All signals can be synchronized by 
applying the standard signal at the receiving terminal. 
  Further, the system was set up so that optical signal lasers 
were efficiently input into the optical fiber cables and a test 
was performed which demonstrated the capability to transmit the 
data for 400 meters without in-transmit amplification. 
Reportedly, the system is capable of transmitting a distance of 
one kilometer. Past methods using coaxial cables and electrical 
signals resulted in disintegration of wave shapes and signal 
erosion rendering transmission beyond 100 meters impossible. 
  Transmission speeds of 156 megabits per second equal 
animated 
image transmission capacities of broad-band integrated digital 
transmission networks (B-ISDN). Fujitsu intends to commercialize 
the new device for use in data transmission between large-scale 
computers and image transmission systems for cable television 
stations.

  [Text] NTT Develops Signal Compensator IC for Optical 
Communications Receivers 
  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) has developed an 
integrated circuit (IC) with signal compensator capabilities for 
use in optical communications receivers. Wave shapes of signals 
transmitted via optical fiber cables tend to disintegrate and 
the timing of signals becomes delicately upset, but these new 
IC's have the capability to correct such problems. They also 
have been improved so that the corrective function is more 
precise than with circuits developed in the past and will serve 
to enhance the reliability of and to miniaturize optical 
transmission systems. 
  The newly developed IC is a circuit used for required 
processing following conversion of the optical signals, received 
via optical fiber cables, to electrical signals. It compensates 
data signals weakened or contaminated by static while passing 
through optical fiber cables. Additionally, when computer 
processing is involved, the new IC augments signals with clock 
signals and automatically synchronizes them with timing 
reflected in data signals. The new IC, as a single unit, will 
handle processing previously involving several ICs and delicate 
manual adjustments. 
  First, clock signals are allowed to emanate automatically at 
an appropriate frequency and as the compensated data signals 
change from a "0 to 1" or "1 to 0" range, the starting point of 
the clock signals and compensated data signals are synchronized. 
Next, the point in time for the change in the data signal is 
captured, deviations in the two signals are checked and the 
frequency of the clock signal is subjected to minute adjustment. 
Repetition of this process leads to the final synchronization of 
the two signals. 
  Under previous methods, with data signals unchanged, as long 
as a "0" or "1" signal was repeated more than seven times, the 
data was sent to the central processing unit (CPU) without 
detection of deviations. Thus, reliability could be assured only 
by controlling deviations via a dedicated circuit. 
  The newly developed IC has the capability to memorize data 
up 
to the point where a change in data signal occurs and to make 23 
consecutive timing corrections. In reality, the probability of 
the same data repeating itself more than 23 times is very small 
and such a capacity provides for sufficient commercialization of 
the IC. The new IC will provide for miniaturization of 
high-capacity receiving systems capable of handling multiple 
signals and a reduction in electrical consumption.

  [Text] Teleway Japan Considers 1 Billion Yen Purchase 
of ATM Switching Systems Within Fiscal Year 
  New telegraph and telephone long-distance carrier Japan 
Teleway, headquartered in Daito ward, Tokyo, and headed by 
President Higashi, has initiated a detailed study to procure 
asynchronous transmission mode (ATM) switching systems by the 
end of the fiscal year. ATM switching systems represent core 
equipment for high-speed communications digital networks such as 
broad-band integrated services digital networks and enable the 
offering of diversified services such as voice, character and 
image transmissions and frame relay for high-speed transmission 
of data. Japan Teleway will seek sophistication of 
communications networks for responsiveness to multimedia needs 
in connection with the completion of the nationwide 
communications network in fiscal year 1994. 
  ATM switching systems to be purchased will comprise several 
units and will represent an investment of about 1 billion yen. 
ATM switching systems are made by domestic manufacturers, such 
as Fujitsu, and have been jointly developed with Nippon 
Telegraph and Telephone Company (NTT). Executives of Japan 
Teleway have said, "Our study will consider procurement from 
overseas communications equipment manufacturers," because NTT is 
a competitor of Japan Teleway in the high-speed communications 
arena. Leading sources for such purchases include AT&amp;T of the 
United States and Northern Telecom of Canada. 
  ATM switching systems are designed to meet multimedia 
requirements such as the processing of voice, images, and 
characters on an integrated basis. NTT initiated development 
work on the systems in 1991, started test operations in 1992, 
and plans to launch high-speed communications services based on 
the system in selected areas in 1997. 
  Japan Teleway is the first of the three new telegraph and 
telephone companies to initiate purchases of ATM switching 
systems. President Higashi of Japan Teleway assumes, "The future 
will render operations impractical without ATM switching systems 
capable of processing images and characters. 
  Even those new telegraph and telephone companies which were 
behind schedule in installing nationwide communications networks 
plan to have such systems installed in the two remaining regions 
of Hokkaido and Shikoku by the end of the fiscal year. Moreover, 
increased interest in multimedia communications services has 
been demonstrated by industry which is expected to purchase ATM 
switching systems. It appears that other new telegraph and 
telephone companies will also initiate procurement of ATM 
switching systems.

  [Text] MOF Circular Lifts Ban on Issuance of CP by 
Life and Casualty Insurers--Goal Is Strengthening Insurer 
Operations 
  The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has issued a circular 
notifying 
casualty and life insurance companies that the ban applicable to 
them on the issuance of CP as a method for raising short-term 
capital will be lifted by the 11th. In the report concerning a 
review of the insurance industry, dated June 1992, the Insurance 
Council, an advisory organ of the minister of finance, 
recommended relaxation of capital procurement measures, leading 
to the issuance of the recent circular implementing the pending 
change. Issuance of commercial paper [CP] will provide life and 
casualty insurers with flexibility in raising capital and the 
industry views the change as enhancing their operating status. 
The first batch of CP will be issued as early as next month. 
  In the past, the MOF has restricted the means by which life 
and casualty insurers could raise capital based on the reason 
that there was a need to preserve soundness in their financial 
status. However, since cases where operating conditions could 
decay because of the need to make concentrated payments to cover 
claims in the event of an unforeseen disaster are conceivable, 
the industry had stepped up its campaign for the lifting of 
restrictions against issuance of CP as a means for raising 
capital. 
  The Insurance Council had addressed the need to study 
methods 
of raising short-term capital through such means as the issuance 
of CP under the condition that care should be exercised in 
maintaining the financial soundness of the insurance industry.

  [Text] NEC Corporation has started the work of choosing 
foreign parts manufacturers from which it will import after 
concluding that the purchase of parts from abroad is a 
centerpiece of its measures to cut production costs. The major 
Japanese commercial electronics maker intends to import a 
variety of parts used in manufacturing personal computers, 
printers, and POS (point of sale system). The Japanese firm, 
which aims to reduce production costs by half by the end of 
1995, has concluded that with the appreciated yen, the purchase 
of parts from abroad is the most effective way to cut production 
costs rather than innovation in production lines and design 
changes which take a long time. The Japanese firm plans to 
develop NEC Technology Hong Kong, its subsidiary in Hong Kong, 
into an overseas supplier of parts for it. One staff person from 
the Japanese firm is presently stationed in NEC Technology Hong 
Kong, but the Japanese firm plans to increase greatly the number 
of staff and its subsidiary's technological capability in a bid 
to secure the quality of parts that it imports. 
  NEC's subsidiary in Hong Kong manufactures personal 
computers, printers, and hard disk drives (HDD). A NEC 
Corporation factory in Japan has already decided to import 
substrate for use in manufacturing personal computers from the 
subsidiary in Hong Kong beginning this autumn, and the factory 
is expected to diversify the kind of parts to import both in 
1994 and 1995. 
  NEC Corporation has yet to decide how high it should raise 
the ratio of overseas purchase of parts to the domestic purchase 
of parts, but each division of the company will map out a set of 
measures to expand the overseas purchase of parts that are 
expected to reduce the production costs. The personal computer 
division has begun to purchase substrate from Taiwanese makers. 
NEC Corporation is thinking of widely purchasing parts from 
foreign makers, including NEC-affiliated foreign makers.

  [Text] The Ministry of Finance will open the underwriting 
of nonlife insurance for artificial satellites to foreign 
insurance companies not holding a Japanese license as early as 
before the end of 1994. The opening of satellite insurance to 
foreign companies has been announced in light of an agreement at 
the GATT Uruguay Round, and will be implemented as soon as the 
Uruguay Round accord is ratified. As to insurance for 
oceangoing vessels and aircraft, the ban on foreign 
participation will be lifted in fiscal 1995, together with the 
reform of the insurance industry, because this requires 
amendments in the relevant laws. 
  The underwriting of insurance by foreign insurers is known 
as 
a "cross-border transaction." This has not been allowed for 
insurance companies not holding a license to operate in Japan, 
except for international cargo and a limited number of other 
items. Due to strong demands to open the market from Western 
nations, the opening of insurance for oceangoing vessels and 
aircraft has been included in the "outline of external economic 
policy reform" announced on 29 March, apart from the Uruguay 
Round agreement. Implementation of this policy in artificial 
satellites is being frontloaded because this does not require 
any legal amendment. 
  Insurance fees for artificial satellites sometimes cost 
several billion yen due to the high risk of failure in launching 
satellites. In Japan, when the National Space Development Agency 
launches its satellites, Japanese nonlife insurers usually 
underwrite insurance jointly, and reinsure with foreign 
insurers. By opening the market to foreign companies, foreign 
reinsurers can now underwrite insurance directly. 
  With regard to ships and aircraft, the selling of insurance 
policies is prohibited for foreign insurers not holding a 
Japanese license under the "Foreign Insurance Companies Law."

<F P=106> [Interview with Akira Suetsugu, director general of Social </F>
Insurance Agency by KANKAI on 20 December 1993; place is not 
given: "Rosy Picture of Future Social Insurance"] 
  [Text] Primary Goals in the 21st Century 
  [KANKAI] I believe that, with the coming of the aging 
society, the work of both welfare administration and the Social 
Insurance Agency [SIA] has entered a difficult phase. First, we 
would like to have you discuss the content of the SIA's basic 
duties and its posture in grappling with them. 
  [Suetsugu] The SIA was established in 1962. Its initial 
purpose was with the national insurance and national pension 
systems in place, to separate planning and implementation as the 
nucleus of social insurance -- i.e., the management of health 
insurance, seamen's insurance, welfare pension insurance, and 
national pension under government supervision -- and to clarify 
its responsibility for implementation. Therefore, its goal 
regarding its administrative duties is to accurately execute 
management of the four systems. 
  When the SIA was inaugurated, the motto of the then director 
general and my predecessors was the three S's (`shinsetsu' 
[kindness], `jinsoku' [rapidity], and 'seikaku' [accuracy]), and 
I believe that the SIA has endeavored to implement the motto in 
its operations. 
  [KANKAI] I believe that the social circumstances and the 
environment today have changed considerably compared to 1962 
when the SIA made its debut. What are your primary goals for the 
21st century? 
  [Suetsugu] At the outset, the national pension system in 
terms of public pensions had just been established and the 
welfare pension was just beginning its payments. I believe that 
the SIA's role at the time was miniscule compared to the nation 
as a whole. To give several current indicators and in terms of 
the welfare pension and the national pension, the insured 
persons total about 6.3 million which covers about 90 percent of 
the public pension system. In terms of the payment of insurance 
premiums, the total premiums for the government-supervised 
health insurance, the welfare pension, and the national pension 
amount to about 21 trillion yen, which is about one-third of the 
national taxes. The number of pensioners totals about 23 
million, and it is rising at a rate of one million annually. The 
amount of pensions paid out was about 16 trillion yen at the end 
of FY91. It is growing rapidly, and I believe that it will 
continue to grow. 
  Therefore, regarding the goal for the immediate future in 
terms of our future duties, in view of the coming of a 
super-aging society, the value concepts will become diversified 
and the people's needs will also become diversified. The 
environment for social insurance is changing in various ways, 
and I believe that it will continue to change rapidly in the 
future. 
  Consequently, we believe that it will become difficult to 
accurately conduct the business managment relegated to us by the 
people if we adhere to the timeworn methods of the past, and we 
feel that we must search for a basic direction for the business 
in the future. We therefore drafted a future concept for the 
social insurance business in July last year. It contains 
visionary ideas as well as realistic tasks. With a blend of such 
ideas, we have been looking for a future direction. We hope to 
push forward our management in line with the future concept of 
social insurance operations. 
  [KANKAI] The coming fiscal year is the year of pension 
reform 
and the coalition parties' proposal has been prepared. However, 
I believe there are portions which are better than what the 
Ministry of Health and Welfare and the SIA had in mind at the 
beginning. What is your evaluation in that regard? 
  [Suetsugu] Speaking from our standpoint, first of all, we 
must establish a stable pension system. It must be a pension 
system that can be trusted by the people. At the same time, it 
must be seen by the people as a convenient system with complete 
services. First, in the sense of stable management, we believe 
that the recent revised bill is significant. We of the SIA as 
the implementing agency are conducting studies to cooperate with 
the Pension Bureau at an early stage to enable the revised 
contents to be realized smoothly and simultaneously. We believe 
that we must further accelerate our efforts to implement them. 
  [KANKAI] The Ministry of Health and Welfare's timetable 
calls 
for a three-year postponement from the initial 1998 to 2001. 
Will that have a considerable impact? Or can we understand it to 
be a move within a somewhat stable system? 
  [Suetsugu] This is a systemic theory, and in terms of 
operations implementation based on our position of actually 
putting a system into action, we believe that there is no 
special problem. 
<H5>  How To Cope With the Problem of Delinquent Payment of </H5>
Insurance Premiums 
  [KANKAI] Speaking of pensions, numerous families are in 
arrears in the payment of premiums for the national pension. 
Another problem is the imbalance between systems, and it is said 
that they should be unified. What is your thinking regarding 
these two points? 
  [Suetsugu] The national pension system requires voluntary 
filing and payment of premiums by the insured. In that sense, 
management may not be simple. In the case of each pension 
system, such an arrangement probably is not practical unless the 
administering agency is well equipped and the people's awareness 
is at a high level. 
  The fact that such management has been possible under such 
conditions is, I believe, the result of the high awareness among 
the people and the efforts by the administering agencies 
including the cities, towns, and villages. However, as long as 
it is a public pension, we cannot be complacent about the 
present situation, but must aim for 100-percent efficiency. 
  From such a standpoint, we instituted a meeting to promote 
the national pension system in 1992 to review failures to file 
for national pensions and delinquent payment of insurance 
premiums. In October [1993], we received a report in which 
various items of advice and proposals for action were included. 
  First, to seek further understanding among the people, 
particularly among the younger generation. Second, to utilize 
the various data and material available in the cities, towns, 
and villages. For example, the system of national health 
insurance is simultaneously in operation in the cities, towns, 
and villages, so their resources should be utilized. There is 
also a variety of other resources, so the pertinent material 
should be used. Third, to further promote the transfer of 
accounts. 
  Such proposeals are being received. However, we believe that 
perhaps the most conclusive is the basic pension number. In 
order to fundamentally eradicate failures of filing or 
notification, we believe that the important point is to 
accurately and efficiently implement exchange of information 
among the various systems. Therefore, we would like to speedily 
introduce a basic pension-numbering system in the form of a 
common lifetime numbering key, and we are going ahead with 
preparations. 
  We feel that this is not only a problem of the national 
pension, but will also help to improve services for the overall 
public pension system, such as the speedup of judgments 
concerning the right to receive pension payments, the response 
to pension consultation, an early confirmation of the 
qualification of the insured at a specific age, and prior 
notification of the time and amount of payment before judgment 
is made under the pension system. 
<H5>  Realization of the Future Concept of Social Insurance </H5>
  [KANKAI] What is your position on a unified pension system? 
  [Suetsugu] I believe that deliberations will be carried out 
in various places and forums on unification. Our task is to be 
prepared to respond, no matter what conclusion is reached. 
  [KANKAI] I see that five management directions are included 
in the future concept on social insurance. 
  [Suetsugu] First, social insurance that grows with the 
people. Second, insuring the rights of the people to receive 
insurance. Third, a flexible response to changes. Fourth, kind, 
speedy, and accurate accommodation. Fifth, the promotion of 
insurance and welfare facilities. 
  [KANKAI] Do frequent payment delinquencies and failures of 
notification mean that there are some lack of services and PR 
[public relations] to the people? 
  [Suetsugu] Payment delinquencies occur most frequently in 
the 
urben areas. It is partly due to the constant shifts in 
population. Another factor is the large number of youths. Trends 
of population shifts are particular noticeable in the large 
cities. To solve this, we have established a national pension 
countermeasure office within the SIA and are providing 
individualized guidance, beginning with the large cities. Both 
we and the executives would like to appeal to the municipal 
directors on this point. We are visiting the cities individually 
and are meeting the mayors directly to seek their understanding. 
  As I mentioned before, we are also hoping to cope accurately 
with the shifts in civilian population through the use of basic 
pension identification numbers and to appeal to them regarding 
entry and payment of insurance premiums. 
  Another problem pertains to students. In other words, there 
is a lack of understanding about pensions among the youths. They 
think that the pension system is a problem concerning the 
distant future, and they lack understanding and awareness 
concerning pensions. Therefore, we have proclaimed a pension 
week every year for the past two years and are conducting public 
relations with particular emphasis on urban and rural youths. In 
every prefecture, we are in a stage of targeting the youth and 
making efforts in public relations by focusing on various ideas. 
We are also working on supplementary textbooks on public 
pensions to be taken up in school education. 
  [KANKAI] What projects are you planning for the super-aging 
society? 
  [Suetsugu] The pension system itself is one of the projects. 
At the same time, we are implementing the so-called welfare 
facilities project through pensions or medical-care insurance. 
One example is the home-care support program which has been 
newly implemented since 1992 as part of medical-care insurance. 
This is a project that supplements the rental fees for machines 
and instruments used by persons recuperating or receiving care 
at home, who are beneficiaries of government-supervised health 
insurance, apart from the previous medical checkup programs or 
workplace healthcare. It has been implemented since October 
1993. Our posture has been to team up with the networks of 
cities, towns, and villages that actually know best who should 
be the beneficiaries, in order to let them know that there are 
such ways to help them and to expand its use. We are gratified 
that it has been quite widely appreciated by the users. 
<H5>  The Future of Public Pensions Without Anxiety </H5>
  [KANKAI] The best thing for the people is to have a stable 
public pension system that will enable them to spend their life 
of retirement without worry. According to what we have heard 
from you thus far, is it safe to assume that the pension system 
will never go bankrupt? 
  [Suetsugu] That it correct. 
  [KANKAI] What about medical-care insurance? 
  [Suetsugu] Medical care has been switched to midterm fiscal 
operations which is a term of about five years. We are gratified 
that so far we have been able to operate it on a stable basis. 
However, due partly to the business stalemate last year, 
although medical-care payments have been generally as expected, 
revenues have been lower. However, this is considered as a 
midterm fiscal operation, and because there are reserve funds, 
we believe we can operate it without problems from the 
standpoint of the overall system. 
  Also, I talked earlier about support for home care within 
the 
insurance welfare facilities system. In addition, the problem of 
mental health was taken up in the past, particularly by the 
large companies, and has been studied by the respective 
companies. A similar problem existed among the small and medium 
companies concerning the beneficiaries of government-supervised 
health insurance, and there were points that were indicated and 
desires expressed. Therefore, with the hope of grappling with 
the target goals of mental health, we have begun to conduct 
studies. We hope to find ways to cope and to implement them as 
soon as possible. 
  [KANKAI] If the care system under study by the Ministry of 
Health and Welfare is feasible, will the implementing agency be 
the SIA, or will it be a completely different arrangement? 
  [Suetsugu] We have not yet heard that the proposal has been 
finalized, so we do not know how it will turn out. Assuming that 
it will be us (the SIA), we hope to cope with it fully. 
  [KANKAI] If it is feasible, would it be the only option? 
  [Suetsugu] The crux is what arrangement to use. On the basis 
of the first-time insured persons, and within the framework of 
the national pension and the welfare pension, 90 percent of the 
people are covered, while the rest is covered by mutual-aid 
insurance. The medical-care field is divided into three 
categories of the health insurance associations, 
government-supervised health insurance, and national insurance, 
aside from mutual-aid insurance. Of the three categories, we are 
in charge of government-supervised health insurance and, 
depending on which arrangement is adopted, the ratio of coverage 
will change. If we are the administering agency, we have the 
confidence to implement it. However, I believe that the kind of 
arrangement that is adopted will be decided in the future.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive interview" with DPRK President Kim </F>
Il-song by special correspondent Pedro Margolles Villanueva at 
the Government Palace in Pyongyang on 18 April] 
  [Text] Pyongyang, 18 Apr (PL) -- We have no intentions, nor 
are we capable of producing nuclear weapons. It would make no 
sense. The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through 
pressure and coercion it can bring us to our knees. 
  The above was said by DPRK President Kim Il-song in an 
exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA at the Government Palace. 
  In a lengthy two-hour interview, Kim talked about the tense 
situation currently experienced in the DPRK, its relations with 
China and other countries, foreign investments, and the 
perspectives for the reunification of the country. Kim also 
spoke fondly of the DPRK's relations with Cuba and President 
Fidel Castro. 
  In Pyongyang, one can sense calm. The tall and modern 
buildings and the wide avenues welcome a sunny spring. 
  Taking care of the flowers, the April Festival, and the 
celebrations to mark the 82d birthday of the "great leader," as 
the Koreans call Kim Il-song, mark the spirit of these days in 
Pyongyang. 
  In the countryside, one does not sense a warlike atmosphere. 
The peasants work the land, grow rice, and the industries 
continue operating. 
  An energetic and calm speaker, the president greets us in 
the 
august dignity of the Great Hall of the Government Palace. Kim 
Il-song answers our questions openly and very lucidly. 
  "We have no intentions, nor are we capable of producing 
nuclear weapons. We do not need to produce them, and even if we 
did produce one or two, that would make no sense [eso no tendria 
ningun sentido]. Our government invariably makes efforts to 
ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," Kim said. 
  Kim explained that this problem began with the introduction 
of nuclear weapons in South Korea by the United States. The 
United States deployed a large number of these weapons to 
maintain the southern part of the country under its control, to 
confront our country, and to implement its aggressive strategy 
in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  Kim Il-song believes the nuclear problem on the Korean 
peninsula began with the United States' hostile policy toward 
his country, and, therefore, it must be resolved in bilateral 
negotiations. 
  The president said there is no justification for Washington 
to maintain its nuclear weapons on the peninsula because the 
Cold War has ended worldwide, and because nonaggression 
agreements and the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of 
the Peninsula have been signed by North and South Korea. 
  The veteran Korean leader led the anti-Japanese struggle in 
the 1930's, which culminated with the antifascist victory after 
the monumental battles of 1945. 
  Years later, from 1950 to 1953, he confronted the invasion 
of 
Korean territory by the United States and its allies. Fierce 
battles were waged and the country was left virtually destroyed. 
  The 38th parallel and Panmunjom were established in the name 
of humanity, and the North Americans portrayed themselves as 
defenders of noble ideals by way of their persistent 
anticommunist propaganda. 
  Later, the reconstruction of the country began under the 
leadership of Kim Il-song. Cities were rebuilt, including 
Pyongyang which had been razed. Industry was constructed and 
agriculture was reestablished. 
  Today Korea is a country of 23 million inhabitants which has 
eradicated poverty. 
  That same man explains that "in order not to lose the 
control 
they now have over South Korea and to crush our republic, the 
North Americans are seeking another pretext and spreading 
groundless nuclear insinuations to intentionally worsen the 
situation." 
  According to him, the South Korean authorities have joined 
this campaign and are acting hysterically to provoke a new war. 
  The United States has distorted what was agreed with us, he 
said. It provoked the break in the talks and, by mobilizing 
international organizations to exert pressure on Korea, it 
worsened the situation to the extreme, he added. 
  Kim Il-song firmly stated that pressure can never be the 
method to resolve problems. 
  "The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through 
pressure and coercion it can bring our people to their knees, 
because they value independence as they value their own lives," 
he said. 
  He added that if Washington becomes obstinate and persists 
in 
pressuring the DPKR, the nation will be forced to adopt 
self-defense measures to safeguard its dignity and sovereignty. 
  In the interview with PRENSA LATINA, the paramount Korean 
leader reiterated that the unwavering position of Democratic 
Korea is to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue. 
Whether it can be resolved through peaceful means depends 
entirely on the United States, which must cease its clumsy 
international pressure against our Republic and adopt a 
trustworthy position, he added. 
  International organizations should not support the unjust 
demands of this world power, and they should endorse solutions 
the problem, Kim Il-song stressed.

  [Text] Kyoto, April 13 KYODO -- The International Energy 
Agency (IEA) decided Wednesday [13 April] to draw up a program 
by around June to help Russia with energy conservation 
technology, agency sources said. The decision was made at the 
agency's governing board meeting held in Kyoto with 
representatives from 22 countries of the 24 member nations of 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
attending. 
  Russia has asked for IEA assistance in the field of energy 
since last year. 
  Meeting participants agreed that the agency should draw up a 
concrete program together with Russia in the form of a document, 
although the paper will have no legal binding force. 
  The assistance will include providing energy conservation 
technology, research and statistics methods regarding energy 
supply and demand, and technology for developing alternative 
energy sources, the sources said. 
  In addition, the participants discussed how IEA member 
nations will share the financial burden of helping Russia with 
nuclear power plant operations, which Russia has also requested, 
the sources said. 
  They also agreed that the IEA and the OECD will continue to 
cooperate in the area of technology development for global 
environmental protection. 
  The IEA meeting is the first in 16 years Japan has hosted. 
On Thursday, the Japanese Government and IEA will hold a 
seminar to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the IEA's 
inauguration. 
  Robert Hawke, former Australian prime minister, and Brent 
Scowcroft, former U.S. presidential assistant, will take part 
in the seminar which focuses on the IEA's long-term strategy.

  [Text] Hiroshima, April 15 KYODO -- The Japan Atomic 
Industrial Forum ended Friday [15 April] a three-day conference 
in Hiroshima, the world's first atom-bombed city, with a 
declaration affirming its opposition to nuclear weapons. 
  On the final day, delegates debated the development of 
nuclear energy in the Asian region and the effects of 
radioactivity. 
  A declaration issued at the closing affirmed the delegates' 
opposition to nuclear weapons. It also called for continued 
efforts by countries involved in dismantling nuclear weapons and 
the development of research into technology aimed at making the 
peaceful use of nuclear energy safer. 
  At a news conference after the conference, Takashi Mukaibo, 
chairman of the forum that promotes peaceful use of atomic 
energy, said the group came to Hiroshima "to learn." About 
1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad took part 
in the 27th annual conference. 
  Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA), told delegates the IAEA will hold a 
special meeting on April 21 and 22 in Vienna to discuss the 
Chernobyl nuclear reactors in Ukraine. Chernobyl was the scene 
of one of the world's most serious nuclear accidents in 1986. 
  Antinuclear activists protested the gathering around the 
conference hall in central Hiroshima. 
  Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing 
during the closing days of World War II.

<F P=106> [By Peter Chen] </F>
  [Text] Brisbane, April 18 (CNA) -- The Republic of China 
[ROC] is striving to play a stronger role in the Asia Pacific as 
its economy becomes more closely enmeshed with the region's 
economy, the ROC's top economic planner said today. 
  Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Insight 1994 meeting in Sydney 
on Monday [18 April], Hsiao Wan-chang, chairman of the Council 
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said Taiwan is 
well positioned to expand its already significant role as a 
contributor to regional economic cooperation and development, 
especially as a supporter of Asia's developing economies. 
  "We can serve as an effective gateway for overseas investors 
who wish to enter Asia's fast-growing markets," he said. 
  He said Taiwan has four key assets in shaping its future 
economic role in the Asia-Pacific region -- its geographic 
location, its rapid economic development and highly skilled 
labor pool, its manufacturing and engineering resources, and its 
historical and cultural links with its neighbors. 
  Attending the meeting were business leaders and senior 
officials from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South 
Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Indonesia, the 
Philippines, Vietnam, and Papua New Guinea. 
  Among them were Singapore's former Prime Minister Li Kuan 
Yew 
and Australia's Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. 
  Hsiao said Taiwan's trade with the Asia-Pacific region 
totaled US$120 billion in 1993, accounting for 75 percent of its 
overall trade. About 35 percent of Taiwan's total trade is with 
South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and Mainland China, he said. 
  The ROC has become the largest investor in Vietnam, the 
second largest in both Malaysia and Mainland China, the third 
largest in Indonesia, [words indistinct] Thailand and the fifth 
largest in the Philippines, he said.

  [Text] Senior officials of ASEAN will meet in Phatthaya a 
week tomorrow to discuss remaining matters concerning the 
forthcoming first ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in Bangkok. 
  The senior officials are expected to agree during the 
three-day meeting on the structure and formalities concerning 
the Forum as well as agendas for discussion. 
  They will also discuss preparations for the 27th ASEAN 
Ministerial Meetings (AMM) to be held for two days immediately 
prior to the Regional Forum, which is scheduled for July 25. 
  Should all matters not be decided on during the meeting in 
Phatthaya, the officials will meet again next month prior to the 
preparatory meeting set for May 23 and 25 for the ASEAN Post 
Ministerial Conference (PMC), according to a senior ASEAN 
official. 
  The annual PMC meeting, which includes ASEAN states and 
their 
seven dialogue countries, will be held on July 26 and 27 
following the ARF. At a previous round of ASEAN senior 
officials' preparatory meetings in March, three issues were 
proposed for discussion at the Forum. 
  They were: Asia-Pacific security now and in the future, 
confidence building measures and preventive diplomacy. 
  According to the official, Indonesian officials will be 
asked 
during the meeting in Phatthaya to elaborate on how to frame the 
discussion on preventive diplomacy. 
  There was also a proposal that a group of "eminent persons" 
or a committee could be set up to follow up on issues being 
discussed so they could be proposed at the next ARF. 
  The official added that there could be new proposals 
concerning how to make the ARF more meaningful. He did not 
elaborate. 
  Senior officials at the Phatthaya meeting will also have a 
working lunch with ASEAN-based Institute of Strategic and 
International Studies (ISIS) to discuss new ARF input from the 
academic institution. The first ASEAN-ISIS meeting was held in 
Singapore last year. 
  The senior officials however already agreed that the ARF 
Forum will be attended by foreign ministers from 18 countries 
comprising the six ASEAN states, seven ASEAN dialogue countries, 
Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea as ASEAN observers and China 
and Russia as ASEAN guests. The ministers could each be 
accompanied in the meeting by either one senior officer or one 
interpreter. 
  They also agreed that the Forum should aim first at 
promoting 
confidence building and that the topic of discussion should 
neither be too broad nor too restrictive and the discussion 
neither too academic nor too light. 
  The Forum, they agreed, should rather make all participants 
comfortable enough to speak out. Such an atmosphere in itself 
will encourage candid discussions that will lead to the 
realization of the meeting's aspiration for confidence building. 
  They also agreed in principle to the concept of a UN Arms 
Register in response to the Philippines' proposal on setting up 
a Regional Arms Registry as a means to promote confidence. 
  The Phatthaya meeting is unlikely to further elaborate on 
such a proposal, however, the same official said. 
  Concerning the AMM meeting, Burma will be attending as the 
guest of the host, Thailand, and Foreign Minister Prasong 
Sunsiri, as current chairman of the ASEAN Standing Committee, 
will convey this message when he visits Rangoon on Tuesday and 
Wednesday. 
  A Thai source yesterday said discussion among ASEAN members 
about Burma's participation could be open-ended depending on 
developments inside Burma, despite the initial ASEAN consensus 
on Rangoon's participation. 
  Cambodia will be attending the AMM meeting as ASEAN's 
special 
guest. 
  Thailand might call for an ASEAN approach to the current 
situation in Cambodia, the source said without elaborating.

  [Text] Malaysia is a gateway to ASEAN with the 350 million 
people in its dynamic region. The country is also a gateway to 
the whole of the East Asia region. The minister of 
international trade and industry, Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz said in 
view of this there should be a greater network between the 
private sectors of both Malaysia and Czech. She noted that 
Malaysia is very interested to receive foreign direct 
investments in a broad range of activities. She said this at a 
meeting with the Foreign Minister of Czech Josef Zieleniec and 
his 35-member trade delegation at her ministry in Kuala Lumpur 
today. 
  Datuk Sri Rafidah said bilateral trade of the two countries 
was only U.S.$20 million last year. She pointed out that the 
volume is very small and there is potential to expand it. 
  Mr. Josef Zieleniec and the delegation are on a two-day 
visit 
to Malaysia. He called on the minister of foreign affairs, 
Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, at the Foreign Ministry in Kuala 
Lumpur this afternoon.

  [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 19 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia 
will not withdraw its troops serving with the United Nations 
Protection Force (Unprofor) in Bosnia-Herzegovina despite the 
government's apprehension over the situation there, Prime 
Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed said Tuesday. The government 
cannot recall its troops because the move will be similar to the 
measures of the United Nations which we criticise, he said when 
asked to comment on the latest situation in Bosnia. 
  The government is aware of the dangers faced by our soldiers 
but we cannot allow the Bosnians to be killed just like that by 
the Serbs, he told a news conference after presenting excellence 
service awards to Home Ministry staff at the Prime Minister's 
Department, here. 
  The prime minister said the government was concerned over 
the 
Malaysian soldiers because they were not equipped with adequate 
weapons as their duty was only peacekeeping. 
  He also said that if the Malaysian soldiers were entrapped, 
he feared that the other UN soldiers might not go to their 
assistance as was the case when the Bosnians needed help. 
  Dr Mahathir said that even so, the government would not 
withdraw the 1,500 Malaysian soldiers, most of them from the 
23rd Battalion Royal Malay Regiment stationed in several Bosnian 
towns including Sarajevo, because the government did not only 
speak of justice but also practised it. 
  Earlier, he criticised the [words indistinct] and the 
Security Council for not doing anything to help the Muslims in 
Goradze. 
  He said that they were actually not interested to help and 
purposely allow the Serbs to kill the Bosnians and occupy the 
town. 
  When the Serbs advanced, they did not put a stop to it and 
now they are merely saving the UN troops and leaving the Muslims 
without any help, he said.

  [Text] The Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur should 
explain to its people the real situation relating to the 
rounding up of more than 1,000 Philippine workers at St. John 
Cathedral in the federal capital on March the 27th. Deputy Home 
Minister Datuk Megat Junid Megat Ayub said the Philippines 
should understand Malaysia's position and the problems it faced 
following influx of illegal workers. 
  Speaking to reporters at parliament house, he said if the 
embassy wants the issue to be settled amicably, then they should 
tell the Philippine people that the operation was carried out in 
accordance with the law. He said Malaysians, too, (?were 
arrested) overseas for overstaying, but the government did not 
protest. Datuk Megat Junid said Malaysia was facing not only 
the problem of illegal workers from the Philippines, but from 
other countries like Indonesia, Bangladesh, Thailand, and 
Myanmar [Burma] as well.

was detained by the Fisheries Department Marine Division. 
  All the 13 crew members of the boat were fined a total of 
[Malaysian ringgit] RM850000 (US$1=RM2.70) or 54 months' jail on

  [Text] Phnom Penh 19 Apr (AKP) -- The first meeting of the 
Kingdom of Cambodia's Red Cross Federation was organized last 
Monday at the Chaktomuk hall under the chairmanship of Samdech 
Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly. 
  The meeting decided to appoint Princess Norodom Marie 
Ranariddh, chairman of the Central Committee and Her Majesty 
Norodom Monineat Sihanouk, honorary chairman of the Cambodian 
Red Cross Federation. 
  On behalf of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, Samdech Chea Sim 
stressed that this meeting's objective is to set up the Red 
Cross Federation by grouping the country's three Red Cross 
organizations: the Red Cross of the State of Cambodia, that of 
the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, 
and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), and that of the Khmer 
People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF). 
  The Cambodian Red Cross Federation was recognized on 24 
March 
1994 among member countries of the Red Cross and of the Red 
Crescent. 
  The federation has seven basic principles, taken from the 
ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross), including 
humanitarian action, justice, neutrality, and independence. 
  The National Assembly Chairman expects that the executive 
committee of the federation would forge good relations with 
international circles in order to respond to the Cambodian 
people's needs.

  [Text] According to the revelation by six soldiers of the 
two- headed government captured on 13 and 14 April, the 
government used foreign financial aid for national 
reconstruction to hire 500 (Dac Cong) commando troops, selected 
from the communist Vietnamese's 7th, 9th, 330th, and 309th 
Divisions, to attack Pailin. The soldiers were paid $100 daily. 
  These Vietnamese soldiers were used to fight in Cambodia 
before and some of them even used to be posted in Pailin. They 
can say some Cambodian words and have dressed up as Khmer Royal 
Armed Forces troops. They are front line forces. Somehow, in 
their onslaught on Pailin, 300 of them were killed or wounded in 
just a few days. Now, the remaining 200 soldiers are stationed 
at Kaong Kang Monastery and Phnum Yat adjoining Pailin town. 
  Although the Vietnamese soldiers are front line intervention 
forces, the Pailin battlefield situation has so far caused them 
to prepare for hasty retreat. 
  These actions are evidence that the two-headed government, 
communist Vietnamese, and the alliance have used national 
coffers to wage war. And they have gone so far as to hire the 
communist Vietnamese troops to destroy the Cambodian nation and 
people mercilessly. The nation and people are resolved to 
oppose the two-headed government, which has sold the nation out 
and destroyed the nation and people, and its masters until 
genuine peace is restored to Cambodia.

  [Text] The following is a report on the Pailin battlefield 
situation between 14 and 15 April 1994: 
  1. On 14 April, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea 
attacked the two-headed government troops at Toek S'am adjoining 
Pailin. In the fighting from 0700 to 1800, we destroyed a T-54 
tank and a military truck and we killed 17 enemy soldiers and 
wounded many others. The remaining troops were forced to 
retreat for their lives to Stoeng Kanh. 
  2. On 15 April, we intercepted a group of transport forces 
on the road linking [word indistinct] and Pailin, killing 15 
enemy soldiers and wounding 12 others. The remaining troops 
were forced to retreat behind their lines. 
  3. Those in the Pailin town now are complaining about the 
shortage of rice, [word indistinct], and medicine. Wounded or 
killed soldiers are found everywhere. And roads are blocked 
[words indistinct]. The situation so far is that the invading 
forces have been routed extensively. 
  4. Puppet leaders, like Fifth Military Region Commander Hul 
Savoan and Battambang Province Commander Manh Sophat, have 
already run away from their troops, leaving their subordinates 
to die in Pailin. As for the remaining 200 (Dac Cong) 
Vietnamese soldiers at Phnum Yat, they are also prepared to beat 
a hasty retreat. Since Pailin has completely been surrounded, 
they can only run away through the bamboo-covered jungles. 
Nevertheless, they will be killed by stepping on land mines or 
lose their way and become foxes' or lizards' prey.

  [Text] Phnom Penh, April 19 (AFP) -- The ultra-left Khmer 
Rouge [KR] said they had recaptured on Tuesday their former 
headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia, ousting government 
troops which had seized the strategic town only a month earlier. 
  "We took our base back at 12:45 P.M., captured eight 
government tanks in good condition and destroyed seven," the 
Khmer Rouge's spokesman in Phnom Penh said, adding that casualty 
figures had not yet been confirmed. 
  The spokesman said 3,000 guerrillas attacked and forced back 
some 7,000 government troops. 
  "I am very excited to hear we can get back our houses," he 
said. 
  Co-Defence Minister Tie Banh admitted that the Khmer Rouge 
had recaptured part of Pailin. 
  "But remember Pailin is a very big place," he said. 
  "Some of our troops are countering the attack and there is 
fighting going on there," he added. 
  Tie Banh said the government had only six tanks in operation 
at Pailin and questioned how the guerrillas could talk about 15 
tanks. 
  Other military officials said the situation in Pailin was 
not 
yet clear. 
  "We should wait until tomorrow," one general said. 
  " The nature of military operations is like that, there is 
pushing up and down," he said. 
  The Cambodian Army seized Pailin on March 19, claiming a 
body 
blow to the guerrillas' opposition to the government that 
emerged from the UN-organised elections in Cambodia last May. 
  Pailin is a town near the Thai border that has been in the 
guerrillas' zone of influence for years. Its ruby mines and 
rich forests of teak have provided the Khmer Rouge with a huge 
source of income. 
  Experts agreed that the government's seizure of Pailin was 
of 
symbolic weight, but questioned whether the Phnom Penh forces 
would be able to -- or even should -- hold on to the strategic 
site. 
  The Khmer Rouge's classic tactic in such setbacks is to fall 
back into the jungle, harass the government's supply lines and 
then suddenly regroup, launching an offensive to recapture lost 
terrain.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and U.S. 
negotiators agreed Tuesday that North Korea should act as soon 
as possible in allowing additional nuclear inspections to meet 
an early-May deadline. 
  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, at a working luncheon with 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, stressed that 
the immediate task is getting Pyongyang to agree to further 
checks by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
  The two sides agreed that the ball is in Pyongyang's court, 
predicting that a reaction will come soon since the celebrations 
for supreme leader Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday have just ended. 
  IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is due to report to the U.N. 
Security Council on North Korea's nuclear program in early May, 
and officials here say that unlike previous monitoring 
activities, this deadline doesn't allow for much leeway. 
  "A couple of weeks is the most we can give North Korea next 
month," said one official on condition of anonymity. "Either 
Pyongyang accepts the IAEA team by then or faces U.N. action." 
  "There isn't much time," he emphasized. 
  Han and Gallucci stressed the importance of inter-Korean 
dialogue in defusing the nuclear crisis and promised to work 
together for successful talks between the two Koreas, the 
officials said.

    [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 19 April 
react to the talks on the North Korean nuclear issue between 
Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, and ROK 
officials, including Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun, held in 
Seoul on 18 April. 
  The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries a 1,000-word article by 
reporter Pak Tu-sik on page 3 which welcomes the "simple and 
clear" demand for North Korea's allowance of additional nuclear 
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
made in the recent Seoul talks between the ROK and the United 
States. The article reports: "It seems that, for the time 
being, the United States and the ROK will concentrate their 
efforts on creating an atmosphere for North Korea to allow 
additional inspections by the IAEA." 
  The article reports that "the United States will strongly 
demand that South and North Korea hold a dialogue on 
implementing the declaration on denuclearization of the Korean 
peninsula" and conduct bilateral nuclear inspection after the 
third round of U.S.-North Korea talks, "which will likely be 
held in Geneva in May as soon as the IAEA inspection team enters 
North Korea if North Korea meets the IAEA demand." 
  The article also expects that "the South-North Joint Nuclear 
Control Committee will be held if the North Korea-IAEA and North 
Korea-U.S. dialogue is successfully held" and that "this will 
make progress in resolving the nuclear issue." 
  The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries a 400-word article by Chong 
Pyong-chin on page 1 which reports that in the 18 April talks, 
the ROK "asked the United States to propose a contact with North 
Korea first" and that the United States said it "will consider 
proposing to North Korea to hold a contact before the end of 
this week." The article concludes by noting that "it is highly 
possible for North Korea and the United States to hold a contact 
in New York sometime this week." 
  The left-leaning HANGYORE SINMUN carries a 900-word article 
by Pak Chong-mun on page 2 on the result of the talks between 
Robert Gallucci and ROK Government officials. While reporting 
that the ROK and the United States "failed to make any clear 
decision" on the nuclear issue, the South-North dialogue, and 
the U.S.-North Korea talks, the article notes as a "tangible 
result" of the talks that the ROK and U.S. authorities "have 
shared the view that the U.S.-North Korea talks and South-North 
dialogue should be promoted in a harmonious way of complementary 
cooperation." Pointing out the "inevitability of sharing a view 
on South-North dialogue between the ROK and the United States" 
because of the linkage between South-North dialogue and the U.S. 
interests, the article stresses additional agreements on 
South-North dialogue must be reached between the ROK and the 
United States if North Korea allows additional nuclear 
inspections. 
  The article expects no tangible result for resolving the 
nuclear issue from U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry's 
upcoming visit to the ROK, noting the "flexible situation" 
regarding this issue. 
  The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO also carries reporter Kang 
Yong-chin's 1,000-word article expecting that a working-level 
contact will be held between the United States and North Korea 
before the end of this week. Citing an unidentified government 
official's remarks, the article reports that the United States 
will no longer allow North Korea to "attempt to stall for time" 
since, through repeated negotiations with North Korea, the 
United States is now able to easily grasp North Korea's intent.

  [Text] The ROK Defense Ministry stated on 16 April that it 
would consider discontinuing the Team Spirit exercise if North 
Korea accepts [suyong] additional inspections from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and if progress is made in 
resolving the nuclear issue. The Defense Ministry reportedly 
mapped out this plan because the government abandoned the plan 
on the exchange of special envoys.

  [Text] Seoul, April 17 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the 
United States have decided to agree on suspending their joint 
military exercise "Team Spirit '94" and holding a third round of 
U.S.-North Korean high-level talks if Pyongyang lets additional 
IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections of its 
nuclear facilities be successfully concluded, YONHAP learned on 
Sunday [17 April]. 
  "The April 1 statement by the U.N. Security Council 
president 
on the North Korean nuclear problem reaffirmed that the 
U.S.-North Korean agreement reached on Feb. 25 in New York was 
still effective," a high-ranking government official said. "In 
view of this development, Seoul and Washington share the 
position that further U.S.-North Korean talks and suspension of 
the annual military drill are linked to more inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency." 
  Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of State for 
political and military affairs, and Kim Sam-hun, ambassador for 
nuclear issue, are expected to reiterate their position when 
they hold a meeting here Monday [18 April]. 
  Regarding Team Spirit in particular, U.S. Defense Secretary 
William Perry, who will soon to visit South Korea, and his South 
Korean counterpart are expected to agree that the military 
maneuver will be suspended only after they get hard evidence 
that North Korea did not divert nuclear materials to making 
weapons. 
  "Dropping the demand for inter-Korean special envoy exchange 
is part of the preconditions set in the New York agreement," the 
official said. "The remaining conditions still hold good."

  [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam, 
accusing North Korea of taking every opportunity to own nuclear 
weapons Saturday, stressed close South Korea-U.S. cooperation 
and international coordination in resolving the problem. 
  Meeting former U.S. President George Bush on a visit here, 
Kim said the U.N. Security Council has to act if transparency 
is not guaranteed on North Korea's nuclear program, spokesman 
Chu Ton-Sik said. 
  Bush came to Seoul to attend the 43rd annual conference of 
the Pacific-Asia Travel Association (PATA). 
  Bush agreed that the two countries must maintain firm 
alliance in dealing with the North Korean situation. He warned 
they should not be fooled by North Korea's attempt to break the 
two countries apart during North Korea-U.S. dialogue, Chu said. 
  Bush commented that he saw the tension on the Korean 
peninsula was not as tense as he had thought when he was in the 
United States. 
  Kim accused "irresponsible" people of exaggerating the 
situation, Chu said.

  [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- Nearly 30 members of 
Chongukyonhap, an alliance of dissident activists for "democracy 
and national unification," demonstrated in front of the U.S. 
Embassy in central Seoul Tuesday morning to protest U.S. Defense 
Secretary William Perry's visit. 
  They delivered to the American Embassy a letter addressed to 
Perry, accusing Washington of "intentionally aggravating" 
tension on the Korean peninsula to benefit the U.S. defense 
industry and to sustain its world hegemony as the sole military 
power even though the Cold War is over. 
  They also called on Perry to drop his earlier remark warning 
of a war against North Korea, to withdraw immediately all 
Patriot missiles from South Korea and to suspend the "Team 
Spirit" military exercise permanently. 
  Meanwhile, Secretary Perry is slated to arrive here late 
Tuesday night, the Defense Ministry said.
