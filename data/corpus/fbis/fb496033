  [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- Regarding 
electoral coalitions, the situation in Slovakia is still vague, 
the independent SME says today. 
  Meciar's "national bloc" is facing the most problems because 
the Christian Social Union (KSU) has decided to enter the 
elections independently, the radical Slovak National Party (SNS) 
is not the most suitable partner for the HZDS (Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia), and the Green Party has definitively 
turned to the left, the daily states. 
  There is, in fact, a social democratic bloc, comprising the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), the Slovak Social Democratic Party 
(SDSS), and the Farmers' Movement. Contrary to initial 
assumptions, the leftist bloc is missing the Slovak Workers' 
Association (ZRS) which, encouraged by the polls, wants to enter 
the elections separately. However, their loss is compensated 
for by the Greens, the paper reports. 
  Despite the agreement of the ethnic Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement (MKDH) and the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS) 
to form a great Hungarian coalition, the Egyutteles is still 
hesitating and thus can prevent a joint list of candidates from 
appearing, the paper notes. 
  The situation in the center is the least clear. A merger of 
the "Knazko-ites" from the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD SR) 
with Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism (APR) into the 
liberal Slovak Democratic Union is anticipated, but the 
rationale of the alleged impossibility of uniting with 
conservative Cernak's National Democratic Party seems to be 
absurd, the paper states. The incompatibility of liberalism 
with conservatism is just an excuse, not a reason for lack of 
unity of the center, it adds. 
  On the right side of the political spectrum, the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH) is hesitating to form a coalition as 
well, the paper states. The Democratic Party has given notice 
of the creation of a joint bloc with the Party of Entrepreneurs 
and Tradesmen. In theory, it is still possible either that a 
coalition of the right and center will be formed or that the 
crushing defeat of the right in the last elections, caused by 
its incompetence and unwillingness to cooperate, will repeat 
itself, the paper concludes.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 14 (CTK) -- Jozef Olej was named 
chairman of the Supreme Inspection Office (NKU) on Wednesday [13 
April] at special session of Parliament. 
  Milan Hudan was elected vice chairman. 
  In 1990-92 Olej was a deputy of the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) in Czechoslovakia's Federal Assembly (parliament), but 
today he holds no elective office. He last served as president 
of the Law School at Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice, 
east Slovakia. 
  The former chairman and vice chairman were dismissed by 
Parliament on March 24 after Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) 
Chairman Jan Carnogursky presented a report disclosing 
fundamental flaws in the NKU's work.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- North Atlantic 
Assembly (NAA) Chairman Loic Bouvard told journalists today that 
the West considered Slovakia a fully-qualified part of a 
democratic Europe and saw no reason to prevent Slovakia from 
joining NATO. 
  Bouvard and NAA Secretary-General Peter Corterier who 
arrived 
in Bratislava today at the invitation of Slovak Parliament 
Chairman Ivan Gasparovic met with Slovak President Michal Kovac 
and Premier Jozef Moravcik to discuss the security situation in 
Europe. 
  Bouvard said that the Partnership for Peace initiative was 
not a universal solution but a practical and pragmatic model 
which provides Central and East European countries with the 
possibility of joining NATO in the long-term. 
  Cortier said that World War Two had showed that a security 
vacuum in Central Europe was a weak link in European security. 
  Bouvard said that Russia's relationship towards NATO should 
be special given its position in Europe. It was not, however, 
acceptable for the entry of individual countries into NATO be 
decided in Moscow, he added. 
  Tomorrow NAA representatives will take part in a seminar on 
security in Central Europe in Tatranska Lomnica, east Slovakia. 
Gasparovic and Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis are to 
deliver speeches at the seminar.

  [Text] Skopje, April 14 (BTA) -- The two-day official visit 
of Bulgarian Minister of Science and Education Marko Todorov to 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
was broken off yesterday. 
  Having conferred with his Macedonian counterparts Selmani 
and 
Bajaldziev on April 12, at the end of his visit Todorov was to 
sign a protocol on cooperation between the similar ministries of 
the two countries. The document, coordinated in advance with 
Macedonian experts in Sofia, said that the protocol was to be 
signed in the official languages in Bulgaria and Macedonia. 
  Yesterday the Macedonian side demanded that this established 
wording in bilateral practice and documentation be substituted 
for [as received] "the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages." The 
Bulgarian side refused to sign the document which marked the end 
of the visit which also envisaged a meeting with Macedonian 
Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski.

<F P=106> [Report by Gezim Qinami] </F>
  [Text] This morning Public Order Minister Agron Musaraj 
and Deputy Foreign Minister Arian Starova summoned the military 
attaches and diplomats of foreign embassies in our country to 
inform them about the criminal act of the Greek special commando. 
  Describing the circumstances of the criminal act on the 
basis 
of the evidence and presenting those present with the facts and 
indisputable evidence, Musaraj cited arguments to show that this 
act was committed by a Greek commando unit. He stressed that 
proceeding from the way the crime was committed, the number of 
the participants, the automatic weapons used, which resulted in 
the killing of two militaries, the wounding of three others, and 
much material damage, it is clear that we have to do with a 
terrorist act organized and committed by Greek special forces. 
  Starova informed the military attaches and diplomats about 
special aspects of the Albanian Government's position on 
Greece's serious act of infringing Albania's sovereignty and 
territorial integrity. He stressed that the Albanian Government 
has not yet received an official response from the Greek 
Government. 
  Regarding the statements of Greek Government spokesman 
Venizelos, Starova said that these cannot be considered a 
response. He pointed out, however, that in his second statement 
Venizelos finally remembered to console the families of the dead. 
  He added that we are expecting an official response from the 
Greek Government on this criminal act committed by the Greek 
special forces. Without this, it is difficult to conduct a 
dialogue between the Albanian and Greek sides. Starova also 
stressed that the only answer from the Greek side has been the 
expulsion of the first secretary of the Albanian Embassy in 
Athens, a vengeful and very unfair action. 
  Musaraj and Starova answered many questions. At the end, the 
military attaches and the diplomats of the embassies expressed 
their condolences to the dead and wounded in this criminal act 
committed by the Greek special forces.

  [Text] Representatives of the Public Order Ministry gave a 
news conference this afternoon on the results of the 
investigation into the murders by the Greek commando. 
  [Balla] This afternoon, in one of the halls of the Palace of 
Congresses, Colonel Agim Shehu, director of the order police, 
and Colonel Vexhi Mucmataj, director of the investigative 
police, gave a news conference on the murders by the Greek 
commando on the Greek border. 
  After describing the event again on the basis of the facts 
and the evidence, Shehu said that the evidence regarding the 
objective, participation, way of committing the action, etc. 
shows that we are dealing with forces that are constituent parts 
of the Greek Army. 
  Reporters asked a number of questions about the expertise, 
armament, level of responsibility and authorship of the crime, 
and about the measures taken by the Public Order Ministry. 
  Colonel Vexhi Mucmataj said that three employees in the 
Public Order Ministry have been arrested: the inspector of 
border police in Gjirokaster, the supervisor of the border post, 
and the training chief. We will forward their documents to the 
Investigation Office. 
  Regarding a report carried by several news agencies on a 
Greek request for a joint investigation commission, Shehu said 
that no such request had been received.

ambassador in Tirana, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry and 
was handed a note saying that owing to the lack of an agreement 
on the necessary personnel of the diplomatic staff of the 
Republic of Albania in Athens and the Republic of Greece in 
Tirana, the Albanian side considers that these staffs should 
each be reduced to six diplomats. 
  The Embassy of the Greek Republic in Tirana should take the 
necessary measures to send home, within 10 days, all diplomatic

<F P=106> ["p.re." report: "`We Carried Out the Massacre'"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana -- Those responsible for the serious 
terrorist attack last Sunday morning [10 April] in the village 
of Peshkepi near the Albanian-Greek border have now become 
known. An ultranationalist Greek group, the self-styled "MAVI" 
(Northern Epirus Liberation Front), has claimed responsibility 
for the victims -- two dead and three wounded -- at the Albanian 
military barracks. The motives behind the massacre are explained 
in a communique sent last Sunday evening by the previously 
entirely unknown MAVI to the Athens newspaper ELEFTEROTHYPIA, 
well-known as the leading mouthpiece of Greek nationalist 
circles. 
  The link between the slogans shouted by the members of the 
terrorist group and the motives behind this serious incident 
have also become entirely clear. According to the 
ultranationalist group, the attack was a response to "the 
criminal indifference of the Greek state," which, according to 
them, "has failed to act properly to prevent the expulsion of 
Greeks from Albanian territory, thus helping Tirana in its 
ultimate objective of eliminating the Greek element from 
Albania. Our action was intended to change the disastrous 
attitude of the Greek Government toward Vorioepiros [Northern 
Epirus]," the communique concludes. 
  The news of the serious border incident prompted a wave of 
protest from the Albanian authorities and political forces. In 
a statement addressed to the international community, an 
Albanian Foreign Ministry spokesman held the Greek Government 
responsible for the attack: "It is beyond all doubt that the 
attack was prepared by special Greek forces." President Berisha 
and Prime Minister Meksi also responded with indignation. 
Meanwhile, the Albanian ambassador in Athens was urgently 
recalled to Tirana on Monday for consultations. Kastriot Robo, 
first secretary of the Albanian Embassy, confirmed this news, 
calling the incident "very serious and unprecedented." 
  For their part, the Greek authorities have disclaimed all 
responsibility for Sunday's attack. Athens spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos called the charges in the Albanian Foreign Ministry's 
protest note groundless. "Greece will not accept any 
provocation or charge without documentary evidence. Greece is 
against any kind of act of violence." Just a week earlier, the 
Greek Government had addressed a warning to Tirana, reminding 
the Albanian capital of the "inviolable nature" of the rights of 
the Greek minority, who are "indissolubly" tied to Greece. 
  The Greek press has to some extent left Sunday's news in the 
shade. Some newspapers, such as the progovernment Athens daily 
TA NEA, have even put forward a theory that this was an action 
by "the Albanian mafia." Only LAIKO VRIMA, the newspaper of the 
Greek minority in Albania, has come out against the attack. A 
letter sent urgently by its editorial board to President Sali 
Berisha expresses sorrow over the victims of the tragedy. 
  Greek nationalism and the problem of Northern Epirus have in 
the past led to a deterioration in relations between the two 
countries, but the incident last Sunday was the most serious 
since the fighting on the border in August 1949. Greek 
nationalist groups have for a long time been agitating for the 
union of "Vorioepiros" with Greece. Greek political figures, 
including former ministers such as Sotiris Kouvelas, have called 
this area "unliberated territory." Sebastianos, the Orthodox 
bishop of Konitsa, has had a radio station with five repeaters 
installed at the border; these send nationalist messages to the 
Greek minority in Albania. All this activity has not led to the 
slightest response from the Greek authorities, which are on the 
contrary always ready to make a fuss about the "irredentist 
propaganda" of neighboring countries such as Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Turkey, and 
Albania.

<F P=106> [Report by Arben Karapici] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] Radio Tirana has today received a 
press communique from the Greek Embassy. Regarding this, our 
reporter Arben Karapici has prepared the following report: 
  [Karapici] Three days after a hostile incursion of Greek 
military forces into the barracks in the village of Peshkepi, 
which resulted in two Albanian officers being shot dead and 
three wounded, the Greek Government has tried to convey only 
regret for the victims. This is expressed in a press release 
distributed today by the Greek Embassy in Tirana. 
  In a totally unacceptable way, the document rejects the full 
responsibility that the Greek Government bears with regard to 
this act of anti-Albanian state terror. The Greek press release 
pretends that the executive power in Athens has only Albanian 
protest notes, which it claims are insufficient to verify the 
facts and reach a conclusion. 
  Formulating the only official stance issued so far, the 
document distributed by the Greek diplomatic representation adds 
that its government is not prepared to accept any accusations 
and considers them as baseless. The communique is silent about 
the fact that it is now accepted in Athens that there exists a 
terrorist organization acting under the name of the Northern 
Epirus Liberation Front that carried out the anti-Albanian 
terrorist attack last Sunday. This was made known by 
ELEVTHEROTIPIA itself, one of the largest and most widely read 
newspapers in Athens. 
  Anyway, the criminal hand of the Greek state's terrorist 
acts 
against Albania and the Albanian people should be cut off, and 
only the government of Andreas Papandreou can do this. 
  The members of the terrorist group who violated Albanian 
territory and shed Albanian blood were wearing Greek Army 
uniforms. In the same uniform there are a commander, a chief of 
staff, and a defense minister. Together with and alongside them 
stands the clergy of (Fanar) and Hellenistic (Asfavi) [not 
further specified], because, according to the Constitution of 
the Republic of Greece, the church and the state are one and 
indivisible.

<F P=106> [Telephone report by Kalina Stancheva from the Council of </F>
Ministers building in Sofia -- live] 
  [Excerpts] At the start of today's cabinet meeting, Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov telephoned from the Lozenets Hospital to 
order a glass of cognac for the cabinet members to mark the 
success of the Bulgarian delegation in Paris. The cabinet 
members broke into applause and the news of the result achieved 
by their colleague Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov. 
  The first member of the government to comment on the news in 
an interview for national radio was Deputy Finance Minister 
Svetoslav Gavriyski. He interpreted what he called this logical 
result by saying: From now on the ball is in our court; it is 
our job to implement the remaining elements presented in the 
government program so as to get the money. According to Deputy 
Minister Gavriyski, after the expected foreign financing is 
received and added to our foreign currency reserves, the country 
will have about 2 billion dollars at his disposal, which will be 
sufficient to service the deal with the London Club and to 
stabilize the country's balance of payments. We may expect 
Bulgaria to be treated more favorably within the frameworks of 
the bilateral treaties with the member countries of the Paris 
Club, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov added as his own 
comment on the news. From the upcoming visit this evening of 
his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel he expects to find solutions 
to the topical problems recently under discussion, such as the 
balance of the former GDR [German Democratic Republic]. Minister 
Daskalov also expects that during this visit Germany will 
demonstrate a greater commitment to encouraging investments in 
Bulgaria and to opening up the European markets for Bulgaria. 
[passage omitted on other matters discussed at cabinet meeting] 
  The team of consultants treating Prime Minister Berov is 
expected to meet at 1300 today. After examining the results of 
the laboratory analysis, the consultants are expected to make a 
final diagnosis on the Prime Minister Berov's state of health. 
Everything else is whistling in the wind, Health Minister Tancho 
Gugalov said regarding the various stories being circulated by 
certain media. In the health minister's words, this morning's 
information indicates that the clinical picture is returning to 
normal extremely rapidly and that the patient has no typical 
symptoms of hepatitis. We expect that the health minister and 
chief doctor will give a news briefing this afternoon.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Plamen Enchev: "Military Games"] </F>
  [Text] "A la guerre comme a la guerre," (in war as in war) 
Prime Minister Berov said one year ago, and until today he 
remains loyal to his slogan. 
  God and history could testify that the Professor was not the 
one who started the war. Unlike his predecessor, Lyuben Berov 
was also the target of the other institutions. However, a real 
war has been conducted in the last week only on one front -- the 
presidential front. 
  Bulgarian, and probably many non-Bulgarian, factors claim a 
part in the big game. 
  The reconnaissance view of the battlefield produces the 
following picture: On one side there is the cabinet, which 
relies on insecure and even conditional parliamentary support. 
On the other there is the figure of the supreme commander in 
chief -- a rather lonely figure, unless one also notes his 
advisers and controversial military office. Only conventional 
means are used -- the one gives interviews, the other responds 
through statements. Behind-the- scenes maneuvers are not 
revealed to the public at large. 
  The presidential salvo began with the conclusion that 
Berov's 
cabinet must go because it threatens civic peace. Despite his 
four by-passes the prime minister countered in a direct manner 
-- he accused Dr. Zhelev of violating his constitutional 
prerogatives and interfering in places he has no business. The 
Presidency did not react to this blow. It lowered its profile 
and apparently awaits support from outside. 
  The outcome of the games that are taking place, is 
unpredictable, especially when one realizes that one side is 
motivated by interest, the other -- by honor.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Colonel (Res.) Purvan Tonev: "Defense </F>
Minister's `Bayonet Charge' Against Cabinet"] 
  [Text] Mr. Aleksandrov has now been in office for 15 
months. Therefore it was impossible not to admit that he 
contributed to the absurd inflating of the payrolls of the 
Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. Supposedly, it is 
only now that the defense minister has understood that dozens of 
colonels with or without trouser stripes, were carrying files 
from one room to another and did not know what to do all day. 
For a whole year DEMOKRATSIYA has been writing about the 
arbitrary rule of the Defense Ministry leaders and the lack of 
prospects for the honest Bulgarian officers. Although somewhat 
late, the gentleman who filled our ears with talk about cardinal 
and fundamental changes comparable to those in the most modern 
armies finally understood this. 
  The balance is more than sad: dilapidated equipment, 
obsolete structures, a paralyzed General Staff, insecure 
military personnel, unprecedented corruption, lack of realistic 
reform ideas, and infighting within a group of Aleksandrov's 
friends and neighbors, called, God knows why, "the leadership of 
the Defense Ministry." 
  It is not a secret that the minister failed in his attempt 
to 
assemble a team capable of proposing ideas and advancing the 
changes. He also failed to give a personal example with his 
morals. On the contrary, he introduced threats and penalties, 
endless talk to a selected group of journalists, demagogy, and 
theatrical effects. Is the dismissal of the 87 office colonels 
not a cheap gesture? It is obvious even to the colonels 
themselves, that the Army does not need them, but where were the 
minister and the chief of General Staff until now? Is it only 
87 colonels in the two Defense Ministry buildings that are 
expendable? 
  The recent statements of the defense minister about early 
elections indicate not only his tactic of turning to the 
direction in which the wind blows, but also prove the well-known 
thesis that this cabinet is becoming dangerous for the country's 
security.

<F P=106> [Report by Colonel Vladi Vladkov: "Reform in Cadre Policy </F>
-- On the Basis of the Law"] 
  [Text] At the beginning the defense minister called the 
meeting a conversation rather than a news conference, about 
certain things which are happening in the army, and others which 
will happen soon, and which were broadly reflected in the press 
before they even took place. 
  It is natural that the topic of the officer corps occupies 
an 
important place in the newspapers. According to Minister 
Aleksandrov he had seldom encountered such unanimity in the 
criticism of him as on this issue. 
  At the last meeting of the Consultative Council on National 
Security at the Supreme Command the defense minister reported on 
the cadre situation in the army. 
  He told journalists that since December 1991 there had been 
no cuts at the Ministry of Defense and stressed that no cuts are 
being made now or in the future. Military personnel are simply 
being retired. One must distinguish between cuts that are made 
on the basis of a certain criterion, and applying the existing 
law. 
  Minister Aleksandrov said that the cadre issue is a basic 
issue in the army. The first civilian team that entered the 
Ministry of Defense more than two years ago found that there a 
serious anomaly. Many jobs in many structures of the ministry 
were being done by people with various qualifications. In other 
words, many officers were involved in inappropriate activities. 
In addition, during the tenure of Minister Aleksandrov a study 
has been implemented, which has shown that "our family" had 
increased by 1,500 members since the beginning of the reform. 
Naturally, this took place at the expense of new structures, 
which did not exist before, but without whom work under the new 
conditions in anything related to the legal and social aspects 
and certain units of the Ministry of Defense would have been 
aggravated. 
  After many academic talks and discussions the situation with 
the cadres has been analyzed and one factor unfortunately 
inherited from an incorrect cadre policy has become obvious. 
This prompted the decision to restore the pyramid in the 
command structure. It is well known that most officers in the 
army must be junior officers -- lieutenants and captains. The 
pyramid becomes narrower at the higher echelons, and at the top 
there are a few generals. Minister Aleksandrov pointed out that 
at present we have an accumulation of senior officers in the 
leadership of the Ministry of Defense and in all the 
administrative structures and commands. At the same time there 
is a serious shortage of combat officers in the units. At 
present 55 percent of the officers have the rank of major and 
above. Obviously, the model has been turned upside down. 
  Afterward, the minister informed journalists about the 
results of several very important sociological studies. The 
basic dissatisfaction of the officer corps relates to the low 
wages and social status. However, nothing more could be done 
under existing conditions. The second cause of officers' 
dissatisfaction relates to the lack of prospects regarding a 
career as commanders. This is the results of two factors: 
Either the cadre selection is incorrect, or senior officers 
have "plugged up" the central leading units. 
  Personnel not related to combat units can be reduced. As an 
example Minister Aleksandrov pointed out the decrease in the 
personnel of the Ministry of Defense General Chancellery, which 
was brought down from 33 to 11. On 6 April Army General Lyuben 
Petrov, chief of the Bulgarian Army General Staff, signed a 
decree that all colonels from the Ministry of Defense and the 
Military-Economic Bloc over 50 years old who have been on active 
service for 20 years must retire according to the requirements 
of Article 71 of the current law. This applies to 87 people and 
does not affect colonels performing generals' duties. 
  Decreasing the personnel of the General Staff will be a 
gradual process, Minister Aleksandrov said. This is a result of 
the simple fact that the members of the General Staff have great 
responsibilities. It is there that operational plans are worked 
out, strategic deployments decided, and their responsibility is 
for anything related to the troops' combat readiness. The 
officers of the General Staff are highly qualified and not mere 
clerks. 
  This only is the beginning of the process. The transition 
toward the corps-brigade organization will reduce in the future 
the personnel of many staffs. We planned this for 1995-97, the 
minister said, but the aggravated economic situation and the 
iron framework of the budget compelled us to hurry. The 
Bulgarian Army General Staff fully supports this position. The 
necessary retirements and changes in the officer, sergeant, and 
enlisted men corps will be effected by the summer, in accordance 
with the existing law, the code on the military service of the 
officers and sergeants, and the Labor Code. By 30 April the 
structures of the administrative units General Staff, and the 
commands of the troops and the detachments will be optimized. 
We will not allow the combat command personnel to be painfully 
affected by the reforms, the minister said. In May the changes 
and optimization will be discussed by the Military Council of 
the General Staff and submitted to the minister of defense. 
Afterward, the payrolls of the approves structural changes will 
be worked out. Thus the cadre issues will finally be resolved, 
Defense Minister Aleksandrov said. 
  The goal is to complete the cadre reform by July and August. 
By about 1 September, when the graduates of the military 
schools receive their posts and the others climb one stage 
higher in accordance with the approved structures and payrolls, 
one will be able to determine the number of people who have not 
received and will not receive a new post and will be released 
from the army. However, all this will only be done according to 
the law in anything related to the post, age, years of service, 
and rank. The sergeants, military employees, and other 
civilians without a post after the structural changes, will be 
released after 1 June in accordance with the law and the Labor 
Code. Minister Aleksandrov pointed out that there are 2,886 
officers who do not correspond to the requirements of Article 71 
of the law. Those people will have to leave the army during 
this period. The issue will be resolved in an easier manner 
concerning sergeants. About 1,500 of them do not have a high 
school education. 
  Minister Aleksandrov announced his decision that military 
doctors-colonels and graduate military personnel of military- 
scientific units could serve until the age of 60, because they 
are first rank experts and the army needs them. 
  The minister of defense also answered many questions from 
the 
journalists.

<F P=106> [Article by Miladin Khadzhikonstantinov: "How Our Border </F>
Became Diplomats' Favorite Place"] 
  [Text] If silence was golden, the Foreign Ministry's safes 
would look like the Bulgarian National Bank vaults. 
  A strange bustle of foreign diplomats has been evident along 
our southern border in the last months. They like the Arda 
River bed and the location near Ivaylovgrad most of all. 
  At various times and for various reasons this beautiful 
Bulgarian corner was visited in only one year by former U.S. 
Ambassador Hugh Kenneth Hill, British Ambassador Sir Richard 
Thomas, several French diplomats, and Erduan Odabash [name as 
transliterated], Turkish consul in Plovdiv. 
  The record holder is perhaps Funda Tezok [name as 
transliterated], Turkey's general consul, who knows all the 
mayors in the area. 
  Sometimes, the diplomats travel with the necessary permits 
from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Internal Affairs. 
However, sometimes it appears that they have never heard about 
such documents. 
  The problem, as all problems, has several aspects. First, 
one must note the habits of the foreign diplomats who undertake 
the shuttle along the border, especially those of the 12 EC 
states, who are not used to border bureaucracy. The word border 
is alien to them. It does not appear in their modern 
dictionaries, and they cannot imagine the concept of a border. 
Sometimes they err precisely because of their habits. 
  Perhaps such was the case with the French military attache 
in 
Sofia and two companions, who were accidentally stopped by a 
police patrol prior to entering Ivaylovgrad. 
  The French are certainly fans of the excellent Ivaylovgrad 
wine. Perhaps, they were also enchanted by the wonderful 
landscape and headed off for a weekend without the necessary 
permits. This is normal, and the fact that the French citizen 
in question was a military attache could be accepted as 
accidental. 
  However, is it normal that our Foreign Ministry did not say 
a 
single word about the unexpected visit to Ivaylovgrad? This was 
more than two weeks ago. 
  According to the 1961 Vienna Convention, foreign diplomats 
who want to visit restricted border areas must have special 
permits from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Internal 
Affairs. 
  Greek Military Attache Stelos Kastrandos [name as 
transliterated] obtained such permits prior to his visit to the 
Momchilgrad border unit. However, precisely when the Greek 
diplomats was talking with the unit commander, Colonel Angel 
Krivorov, the French culture attache, Jean-Jean Paysan, was 
roving near Benkovski village. He was there for a normal and 
logical reason -- the Muslims celebrated their Ramadan-Bayram. 
  This is fine, but why were the authorities not informed 
about 
the distinguished guest's visit? Neither Mayor Menderes nor the 
police knew about Mr. Paysan's visit. 
  Since there are relevant international agreements and the 
visits of foreign diplomats are subjected to certain 
regulations, it is logical to ask whether a law has been 
violated. 
  If there is no violation, the Foreign Ministry must calm 
everyone and officially announce that the diplomatic visits to 
the border regions are normal goodwill visits that do not 
threaten the country's security. 
  However, if this is an inadmissible interference in the 
country's internal affairs, why is the Foreign Ministry keeping 
silent? The normal interpretation of this should be that if the 
Foreign Ministry is keeping silent it means that nothing unusual 
or irregular has happened. Simply, the Vienna Convention has 
become an obsolete and expendable bureaucratic remnant of the 
Cold War. 
  In addition, if there is nothing irregular, then why did 
Khaskovo Oblast Administrator Tenyu Delchev request the 
Presidency and the government to announce that every visit of a 
foreign diplomat along the border must be accompanied by a 
representative of the local administration? 
  The request has been supported by the oblast administrators 
of Plovdiv, Ruse, and Lovech. 
  The silence, called diplomatic tact at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs, has often caused us troubles. Let us recall 
the silence that facilitated the tearing down of the 100-year 
old Bulgarian school in Istanbul. And let us not mention the 
Euro-observers along our western border, who were accused by our 
border guards of "collecting illegal information regarding the 
protection of our border." In other words, the Euro-observers, 
frankly, were spying. The Foreign Ministry kept silent for a 
while, and then conveyed a protest note to the Euro-observers. 
  If we could rely on the tradition, we must admit that when 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs keeps silent a blunder is behind 
this silence.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dimitur Ludzhev, "leader of the New Policy </F>
Center," by Milko Nedyalkov; place and date not given; "The One 
Who Lies Is Capable of Organizing a Putsch"] 
  [Text] [Nedyalkov] Mr. Ludzhev, are you disturbed by the 
article in a Sofia weekly, according to which you serve foreign 
national interests? 
  [Ludzhev] The article is a total fabrication and it is a 
part of the election campaign aimed against the New Policy 
Center and myself. I do not want to insult the press, but it 
appears that Petyo Bluskov is everyone's servant. Willingly or 
unwillingly, he has now joined a game Andrey Lukanov and his 
friends are waging against President Zhelev and other political 
figures who do not obey the staffs of Positano Street 
[headquarters of the Bulgarian Socialist Party-BSP] and Rakovski 
Street [headquarters of the Union of Democratic Forces-SDS]. 
Everything in the article is fabricated. For example, it is 
claimed that the pictures were made on 15 September 1991. This 
is impossible, because Mr. Montgomery and his family left 
Bulgaria in May of the same year, and in September he was not in 
Sofia at all, thus no pictures could have been made. Most 
probably, the pictures were made before Dr. Zhelev's visit to 
the United States in 1990, when as his adviser I coordinated 
with the U.S. Embassy the text of the future joint documents. 
  [Nedyalkov] The same weekly compares you to Zhirinovskiy and 
identifies you as a supporter of Zhelev's thesis on the 
transition to democracy through a dictatorship. 
  [Ludzhev] Bulgaria needs a strong government; however, one 
could not speak about a dictatorship under the existing 
conditions. We developed activity throughout the country, effect 
relations between our clubs and the center, support the 
introduction of a new election system and holding early 
elections, and submitted a new elections law to the parliament. 
Those are democratic actions which have nothing to do with a 
dictatorship. It is rather the person who lies who could 
organize a putsch and establish a dictatorship. 
  [Nedyalkov] How do you view the statements of the president 
on restoring the old parliamentary majority? Do you see a place 
for yourself in that majority? 
  [Ludzhev] During our meeting with the president we expressed 
the categorical opinion that there is no place for the old 
majority in this parliament. We even view his position on this 
matter as his contribution to preserving the bipolar model in 
our political scene. Furthermore, the same persons whose 
presence in the state structures we eliminated with great 
difficulties in 1992, still rule the SDS. On the other hand it 
is a total illusion to think that the New Policy Center could 
form a new cabinet. 
  [Nedyalkov] If we head toward new elections would you accept 
the old proposal of the president to head a caretaker cabinet? 
  [Ludzhev] I will not accept the proposal to head a caretaker 
cabinet. Indeed, there is no such offer on the part of the 
president. In the past a statement of his by which he wanted to 
support me was interpreted as a proposal to form a caretaker 
cabinet. In fact this was a doubtful service under the 
conditions that existed at that time in the SDS parliamentary 
faction. 
  [Nedyalkov] Will the deputies of the center support an 
eventual no-confidence vote in the cabinet proposed by the SDS? 
  [Ludzhev] First, I doubt very much that the SDS 
parliamentary faction will propose a no-confidence vote. 
Second, our center expressed its clear position already one 
month ago, namely, that this cabinet has exhausted its 
possibilities and should resign. Afterward, the script is clear: 
Adopting a new elections bill and early elections. If the SDS 
proposes a no-confidence vote we will not support the cabinet, 
but will also not support the SDS. The reshuffling of the 
cabinet, about which people talk now, can be approved in the 
parliament only through the votes of the BSP and the SDS. It is 
my opinion that the two political forces are not interested in 
new elections, and especially not in the adoption of a new 
elections bill which guarantees the participation of clear 
professionals in the future management of the country. Changing 
our system now means replacing the deputies, including myself.

<F P=106> [Article by Bela Kadar, Hungarian minister for international </F>
economic relations: "A Few More Obstacles Have To be Overcome 
Along The Long Road Toward The European Union"] 
  [Text] Hungary, situated between the East and the West, 
has had an economic, political, and cultural relationship with 
Western Europe for centuries. After World War II, the Yalta 
accord determined the country's economic direction -- two thirds 
of Hungarian trade went to the CEMA [Council for Mutual Economic 
Assistance] countries. No impulses for economic development 
were to be expected from these countries. The turnabout came in 
1989. Hungary's opening toward the world economy, to be seen as 
a shift in the fulcrum of its foreign trade, was, together with 
the change in political regime and economic system, one of the 
cornerstones of a comprehensive systemic transformation. 
  One illustration of the success of this transformation is 
the 
fact that between 1989 and 1993, Hungarian exports to the 
countries of the European Union [EU] rose from 24 to 47 percent. 
At the same time, the involvement of Austria and the 
Scandinavian countries in Hungarian foreign trade rose from 6 to 
12 percent. In 1995, about 60 percent of Hungary's exports will 
go to the European Union. 
  Forty-three percent of the $7 billion that has been invested 
in Hungary comes for the European Union. EFTA countries that 
are waiting for EU membership have invested 14 percent. These 
countries provide more than 70 percent of Hungary's tourist 
income and 90 percent of the income we earn from other services, 
and they permit us to finance over 50 percent of our debt 
repayments. These figures show that Hungary is already closely 
integrated with Europe. 
  It was not easy to leave behind the restrictions of CEMA and 
join the rest of Europe. It was a difficult road. The most 
important milestones along this road were: The establishment of 
diplomatic relations between Hungary and the European Union in 
1988; the first comprehensive accord on trade and economic 
cooperation, otherwise known as PHARE [Economic Reconstruction 
Aid for Poland and Hungary], designed to promote the economic 
restructuring of Poland and Hungary and concluded in Brussels on 
16 December 1991; and the treaty on associate member status with 
the European Union that came into force on 1 February 1994. 
  Following a resolution by the Hungarian parliament, Hungary 
submitted its application for full EU membership on 1 April 
1994. In accordance with an already-established schedule of 
Hungary's European strategy, there will be a government-level 
conference in 1996 in order to decide on the European Union's 
future geographic expansion. Only after this decision has been 
reached can negotiations on Hungary's full EU membership 
commence in 1997. 
  Hungary's road of re-integration with Europe can be divided 
into clear stages. The period between the end of 1989 and the 
end of 1993 marked the most difficult stage of transforming the 
economy. Over 90 percent of prices and imports were released 
from control, the number of private enterprises quadrupled, the 
private sector's involvement in Hungary's GNP rose to over 50 
percent, and the forint achieved partial convertibility. All 
these are clear signs of the Hungarian economy's world market 
maturity and its openness in this direction. 
  Between 1994 and 1996, Hungary's European strategy will 
release the country from the last shackles of the 
state-controlled system and prepare it for the EU negotiations. 
Between 1997 and 1999, the prerequisites for EU membership will 
be created. The democratic rights that are enshrined in the 
Hungarian Constitution and the implementation of these rights 
already conform to the political conditions of the European 
Treaty and the 1993 Copenhagen Resolution. 
  Hungary is now faced with the difficult task of adapting its 
legislation and its rules governing finance, environmental 
protection, health protection, and technology to EU norms. A 
particularly difficult task will be the subsequent fulfillment 
of the macroeconomic conditions of the Maastricht treaty 
regarding inflation, budget equilibrium, and the national debt. 
These objectives can be attained if the economy picks up in 
1996 and economic growth exceeds the EU average. Thus, our 
country will be ready for the EU talks by 1997, and ready to 
become a member by 2000. 
  The inevitable difficulties and sacrifices caused by this 
process can be alleviated by new forms of cooperation that will 
arise during the period preceding full EU membership. These 
forms of cooperate could contribute to an acceleration of 
Hungary's economic growth, recovery, and adaptation. But 
Hungary's membership of the European Union represents no burden 
and sacrifice on the part of existing members; instead, it 
represents a dowry. In economics, politics, and security, 
European interests, even international interests, involve the 
need to show that the path of comprehensive systemic change is 
justifiable. 
  Hungary has a good chance of presenting the first successful 
transformation for everyone to see. This is also a major 
impulse for the remaining countries in the region. Full EU 
membership permits EU enterprises to avail themselves of 
Hungary's historic role of mediator in Eastern and Central 
Europe in order to develop relations even further. The 20,000 
foreign enterprises in Hungary and 1,500 Hungarian joint 
ventures in the neighboring countries also encourage closer 
links with Western Europe in this region. 
  Over the past four years, Hungary has become an 
extraordinarily extensive market for Western European goods, a 
market that is still expanding. The capital investments that 
have been made so far clearly show that Hungary has become a 
very attractive industrial location in the new European Economic 
Area on account of the progress in free trade, its qualified and 
cheap manpower, and the motivation of its work forces.

  [Text] The coexistence of Hungarians and Serbs in Vojvodina 
is growing more difficult, since nationalism has further 
increased. This is what Andras Agoston, chairman of the 
Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, told Hungarian 
Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn. Andras Agoston expressed 
hope that in the future a clear and verifiable system will be 
established in the mother country to support the organizations 
of Hungarians beyond the borders. 
  Gyula Horn considered it important that the Hungarian 
political forces, independent of their party political 
affiliation and ideology, should be united in support of the 
Vojvodina Hungarians.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Reserve Storage for Nuclear Fuel </F>
at Paks"] 
  [Text] Officials in Paks hope that, in accordance with the 
signed agreement, Russia will take the spent fuel from the 
nuclear power station in Paks. At the same time, due to the 
uncertain domestic situation in Russia, officials in Paks began 
preparations for the construction of a temporary storage 
facility, to make sure that there will be no need to stop the 
power station in case of obstacles in the transportation of 
spent fuel. 
  Although environmental protection experts in Moscow argue 
about the agreement to transport the spent fuel rods to Russia, 
Paks officials hope that the Russian side would abide by the 
agreement after all. At the same time, Balazs Kovacs, head of 
the information office of the nuclear power station in Paks, 
told us that, due to the uncertain situation, they are already 
prepared for the construction of a temporary storage facility. 
The fuel rods must be placed to lie dormant for five years in 
Paks prior to transportation to Russia. If they only keep 
adding spent fuel to the storage facility, it will become full 
by 1995, and if there are no other possibilities of storage, the 
nuclear power station will have to be shut down, a power station 
which supplies almost half of Hungary's need for electric power. 
It is not expedient to take such a risk and, therefore, 
preparations are under way in Paks to build a temporary storage 
facility. 
  As is well known, the joint English-French consortium 
Alsthom, a firm that has gained considerable experience in the 
construction of such facilities, won the right to construct the 
storage. The necessary environmental study has been done, and 
its evaluation is currently under way. Power station experts 
expect an answer in about one month. The technical plans are 
also being drawn now, but construction has not yet been started 
because there is no authorization yet. Only the land is being 
prepared for construction. 
  The experts are also conducting information activity among 
the people living in 12 settlements around the facility. 
Several people oppose the storage, and a civil movement against 
the storage has been formed. However, officials in Paks hope 
that they will succeed in convincing the opponents of the 
project that the facility is not dangerous. The hearing of the 
population is still pending, something required by law; no power 
station in Hungary can be built without this.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Laszlo Csucs, vice-president of </F>
Hungarian Radio, by Zsolt Mester; place and date not given: 
"Change of Regime at the Hungarian Radio"] 
  [Text] [Mester] The government approved a request for 
special assistance in providing lump-sum settlements in 
connection with downsizing; thus, the last obstacle was removed 
before the planned measure can be carried out. The people 
concerned in the case were given notice. Who are you dismissing 
in the end? 
  [Csucs] I will not publicize a list, because it could be 
regarded as branding the people in question, and it could injure 
their personality rights. 
  [Mester] However, I have seen a list which included, among 
other people, Akos Mester, Istvan Bolcs, Henrik Havas, Sandor 
Szenasi.... 
  [Csucs] I will not play guessing games. 
  [Mester] ....that is to say, star reporters, professionally 
recognized radio personalities with great experience. 
  [Csucs] This is a matter of opinion. It is one thing how 
well 
one knows the ins and outs of the profession, and quite another 
what he does with his expertise and talent. If he carries out 
his job in a way which is ethically reprehensible, he is not 
suitable to hold a public service position. 
  [Mester] On 3 March, two demonstrations took place in front 
of the radio station. In one group, the radio employees 
gathered, and in the other, the followers of Istvan Csurka who 
were cheering for you. The radio employees saw a perfect proof 
in this that you are supported by the extreme right. Csurka's 
group had also announced earlier that in the district in which 
you run for parliament, they will not have a candidate. 
  [Csucs] If any segment of society supports such initiatives 
in such a critical situation, which is at the same time a nearly 
historical moment, I will gratefully acknowledge it, and have no 
intention of refusing it. It would be absurd to pick and choose 
whose sympathy I am counting on, and whose I am not. Concerning 
my running for parliament, it is true that in Baranya county, in 
district five, in Mohacs and environs, several voters and 
parties solicited me to become a candidate. In the beginning I 
was inclined to do so, because I have ties to this region; I 
know the problems of the people who live there, and I know that 
I could effectively contribute to solving them. Unfortunately, 
my present task, just like that of a parliamentary 
representative, requires my complete attention. I decided that 
as long as the powers that be do not prevent me, I will try to 
carry out the task I undertook at the Radio with the greatest 
devotion and honesty. Thus, to my great regret, I cannot 
undertake to run for parliament. 
  [Mester] With what kind of a program, on which platform, 
would you have run? 
  [Csucs] On the one hand, I consider the concord of national 
forces important, because in our past, in our history, the 
reason for defeat could always be pinpointed in discord. I 
wanted to work for concord, on the basis of Christian values, 
which for me do not mean only a kind of religious commitment, 
but also honoring the natural and social laws formulated in the 
Ten Commandments. On this basis, I wanted to implement my 
primarily economic program, which includes budget reform, a 
complete refurbishing of the budget, the overhaul of the system 
of taxation, the examination of the acute problems of 
agriculture, and so on. I think this program could be made 
credible by my professional career and my past, rather than by 
unsubstantiated promises. 
  [Mester] Let us return to the Radio. Earlier you said that 
when it comes to dismissals one must think of the group of 
people who refuse to support the transformation of the radio. 
How did this resistance manifest itself? 
  [Csucs] When Csaba Gombar left and it was incumbent on me to 
carry out the tasks of president, I initiated the transformation 
of the Radio so that it would function as a national 
institution, and would fully carry out its public service task, 
especially in the area of objective, all-round information. My 
task was made considerably more difficult by the fact that in 
1990 there was no change of regime at the Radio, and thus the 
people devoted to the previous regime were strengthened. It is 
not a well-known fact how we probed behind the scenes, how we 
tried to find points of contact with decisive forces in the 
Radio, including the star reporters, in order to get along. I am 
not interested in their past--which is, incidentally, 
universally known; I am not interested where they are coming 
from, only where they are going. If they leave their political 
affiliation outside the gate, they can continue working; they 
cannot be harassed, moreover, we can fully utilize their 
expertise. A very long series of experiments were conducted, in 
which I was able to make use of the past of chief editor Jozsef 
P. Szabo, who used to be a diplomat, and who is not only an 
extremely talented and experienced radio personality, but also, 
on account of his human capabilities and attitude, was a perfect 
mediator, should direct contact with the decisive elements fail. 
My only request was to discuss without screaming how we could 
make the Radio even better. Unfortunately, the people in 
question did not think that this was possible. At the same time, 
they expressed their aversion at every turn, also in their 
programs. No self-respecting management can tolerate such 
behavior. I tolerated it for more than a year. Now the cup is 
full. The change of regime must take place. 
  [Mester] Many people consider your measure to be an act of 
the government. Are the remaining radio employees supportive of 
the government? 
  [Csucs] One can hardly find journalists who are supportive 
of 
the government, especially not in the political programs on the 
Kossuth station which can be regarded as decisive. And anyway, 
it is no criterion whether someone is supportive of the 
government. The ethical code is still in force, and I hope the 
remaining employees will keep to the norms. 
  [Mester] If it is a change of regime that is taking place in 
the Radio, as you formulated it, is it not too late for that? 
Was it worth embarking on it before the election? Some people 
think that if the government falls, the dismissed employees will 
return. 
  [Csucs] It is too late for a change of regime, because it 
should have been done four years ago. But not to take steps on 
the pretext that it is too late would not only be a crime 
against the listeners, but also, we are simply not in the 
financial position to maintain the current situation. I find it 
despicable that the budget does not finance the public service 
tasks, but rather we must rely on subscriptions which are an 
uncertain source of income. Namely, this forces us to increase 
our commercial activities, while the rules and regulations 
stipulated by the government oblige us to carry out public 
service tasks. But they don't give us any money. What can I do 
in such a situation? Should I decrease the power of the Kossuth 
station, so the Hungarians beyond the border could not hear it? 
Should I cancel the Bartok station, which broadcasts the brunt 
of cultural and artistic programming? Or the foreign language 
programs from abroad? Downsizing is the only possible solution, 
and the State Accounting Office pointed this out to me as early 
as 1992. And as far as the return of the dismissed is concerned, 
it is hardly likely that there would be a radio president who 
would re-hire them in this financial situation, especially the 
ones who did not keep to the ethical norm. 
  [Mester] Are you not afraid that the dismissed Radio 
employees will become martyrs? 
  [Csucs] I am certain they will. They will make sure that 
they 
will get a monument. But it will be a monument carved in ice, 
and the first spring rays of sunshine will melt them.

<F P=106> [Article by S.A.: "Radio, TV, MTI: Special Legal Provisions"] </F>
  [Text] The government has promulgated three decrees 
regarding the implementation of the public employee law. As 
published in MAGYAR KOZLONY, the decrees contain special 
provisions to be applied at the Hungarian Radio, the Hungarian 
Television, and the Hungarian Telegraphic Agency [MTI]. 
  With respect to public employees of Hungarian Radio, the 
decree states among other things that fixed-term employment 
relationships established for the purpose of substitution may 
exceed the five-year period. At the same time, appointments to 
higher-level management positions and assignments involving 
leadership positions may be made for a period up to five years. 
  Insofar as rules of work performance are concerned, the 
decrees state that additional legal relationships for the 
performance of work are inconsistent with the legal relationship 
of public employees if such legal relationship violates or 
threatens the objectivity and impartiality of information 
broadcast by Hungarian Radio. (According to experts questioned 
in this regard, this provision rules out the possibility of, for 
example, an employee of the Radio acting as the spokesman for 
one or another political party -- editor.) A public employee of 
the radio must not establish additional legal relationships for 
the performance of work with other employers except if such 
relationship does not violate or endanger the appropriate 
business interests of the Hungarian Radio. 
  The government decrees take effect on 30 March.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The TV May Begin Enterprising; Has </F>
the Issue of the Third Channel Been Decided?"] 
  [Text] NEPSZABADSAG has been informed that as part of a 
so-called "3000 series decree" (not published in MAGYAR KOZLONY) 
the government has concurred with the idea that the Hungarian 
Television establish a business organization for the operation 
of the planned third television channel. 
  We have already reported earlier of a plan to make available 
to Hungarian Television the vacated Channel 58, (which in 
earlier days carried the programs of Moscow Television). 
According to information leaked, this frequency would be used by 
the MTV [Hungarian Television] to broadcast educational programs 
in the morning hours, and commercial television programs in the 
afternoons. A corporation--with MTV holding a large proportion 
of shares--would be established to operate the commercial 
television, and the cabinet has granted the needed permit at its 
3 March session. Some professional and financial investors would 
also become involved in the corporation, and these would 
include, for example, Gabor Koltay and Levente Szorenyi. 
  The financial concerns of the television and the radio will 
once again be discussed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Three 
weeks ago, at their 3 March meeting, the ministers have already 
dealt with this subject, but the proposal was rejected at the 
time. This subject was supposed to be discussed again at their 
meeting last week, but this did not take place, supposedly 
because of the trip abroad by its proponent, Gyorgy Schamschula. 
Media executives cannot count on much money, of course, even 
though the MTV has asserted a claim for about 7 billion forints 
in subsidies (based on expenditures to be incurred as a result 
of the mandatory transition to the SECAM broadcasting system). 
NEPSZABADSAG was informed that the MTV may hope for a grant of 1 
billion forints at most, and those funds should also be used to 
settle the MTV's 500-million-forint indebtedness to the state.

<F P=106> [Andreas Schwarz report: "Romanian Declaration for NATO; </F>
Vienna Is Eastern Europe's `Ally' in European Union"] 
  [Text] Vienna -- Romania is preparing for membership of 
NATO, albeit in the distant future. Romanian Foreign Minister 
Teodor Melescanu, who paid a 24-hour visit to Vienna and met 
with the foreign minister and the chancellor, said in an 
interview with DIE PRESSE: "In a transitional period, the 
so-called `Partnership for Peace' is important for states that 
want to become NATO members, this is quite certain. One cannot 
go to bed as a Warsaw Pact member and wake up as a NATO partner." 
  "Moreover, we know exactly that a larger NATO would be 
regarded as a threat in certain Russian circles and an important 
part of the military establishment." This will not be the case 
with Partnership for Peace, to which Russia has also been 
invited, Melescanu said. He explicitly stressed that Russia does 
not have any right whatsoever to veto entries into NATO. 
  Regarding nationalism in Russia, Melescanu is not dismayed 
at 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy -- "he is only a person" -- but at the 
support for this course. This has to be counteracted by 
strengthening the democratic elements. 
  Romania itself is striving for entry into the European Union 
[EU], the foreign minister announced. However, it will only 
apply when the association agreement with Romania has been 
ratified by all the EU states, seven of which have not yet done 
this. "I only tackle things that have reasonably realistic 
chances of success," Melescanu said. After the present round of 
accession, the enlargement of the EU will probably be postponed 
for some time. However, when Austria is in the EU, the Eastern 
European states will have an "ally in Brussels." 
  "Violence cannot solve a conflict, it can only influence it 
in one or another direction. Only negotiations can solve it." 
In this way, Melescanu commented on the NATO air strikes 
against Serbian positions in Gorazde. If detente, the 
abandonment of fighting in favor of negotiations are a 
consequence, the action can also be regarded as a success, he 
said. 
  NATO's threats finally also led to something like a 
cease-fire in Sarajevo. "Any pressure is important and has to 
be welcomed, one only has to calculate the consequences." 
  Have the international community of states made mistakes in 
dealing with the Yugoslav conflict over the past two years? It 
is easy to judge afterward, but it was altogether a "period of 
missed opportunities," the Romanian foreign minister said. He 
mentioned as an example the proposal that Slovenia and Croatia 
made to Serbia to form a loose federation, which was rejected by 
Serbia. Europe tried to do its best, but it always lagged 
behind developments. Europe's mistake was that it was not quick 
and determined enough. 
  Melescanu does not want to say whether an early threat of 
force would have prevented some developments. It might have 
also had negative consequences. However, pressure in all forms 
that are permitted and agreed upon in the UN Charter is one of 
the most important things to solve a conflict. 
  At present, he is "moderately optimistic" regarding the 
Yugoslav conflict"; at any rate, a positive development can be 
noticed: for example, the Croats' agreement with the Muslims, 
the negotiations of the Krajina Serbs with Croatia; now it is 
important "also to involve the Serbs again." 
  Why did Romania receive Slobodan Milosevic, head of state of 
an internationally outlawed country, with all honors and in a 
remarkably cordial way last week? "Let us say: We received him 
because it is important to talk to everyone," the Romanian 
minister said to tone this down. However, Franjo Tudjman has 
been received before -- "with all honors," as Melescanu stressed 
now -- and a friendship treaty was concluded with Croatia. 
Bosnia's Izetbegovic will come next week. 
  Why is a friendship agreement with the rest of Yugoslavia, 
which is outlawed by the UN, being developed? "It is being 
prepared," but it will only come into force after the ending of 
the UN sanctions, he said.

  [Text] Marcel Dinu, secretary of the Romanian Foreign 
Affairs Ministry, returned to Bucharest today together with the 
four Romanian citizens who had been pardoned and freed from 
prison in Iraq following a request by Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu. 
  Talking to our correspondent at Otopeni International 
Airport, Dinu said that on that occasion he also held talks with 
Iraqi authorities regarding the payment of the debts owed by 
Iraq to Romania, which amount to $1.8 to 1.9 billion. The Iraqi 
party asserted that after the lifting of the [UN] embargo it 
will look for possible ways to pay its debts. 
  Talks were also held to establish contacts between Romanian 
and Iraqi economic companies, while observing the UN Security 
Council resolutions. 
  Dinu mentioned to our reporter that there are three other 
Romanian citizens held in Iraqi prisons, who were arrested for 
stealing. Diplomatic steps are being made to obtain the 
reduction of their prison terms, Dinu said, as Iraqi laws do not 
allow for the annulling of their punishment.

<F P=106> [Article by Tlie Stefan: "A Catastrophic Year is Expected </F>
for Romanian 
Agriculture"] 
  [Text] Recent data from the National Statistics Commission 
on the development of the Romanian economy during the month of 
February and during the first two months of the year are 
extremely somber on the current situation in agriculture. The 
year 1994 is expected to be the most dismal year for Romanian 
agriculture which continues to suffer a real tragedy. 
  The situation is alarming in the vegetable sector. According 
to statistical data, as of 21 March, 469,000 hectares still had 
to be plowed--remember, this is plowing for spring planting!. 
Only 415,000 hectares had been sown -- only 7 percent of the 
planned area. The situation of the sugarbeets is the most 
serious one: Only 16,000 hectares, 6 percent of the planned 
area, have been sown. 
  Of course, some plowing and sowing has been done since 21 
March so the present figure is 10 percent. But the situation in 
agriculture gets worse with each passing day. This is all the 
more serious since no one, neither the government nor the 
Ministry of Agriculture, wants to take this year's special 
weather conditions into consideration. We are referring, in 
particular, to the drought which has persisted for more than 100 
days throughout the country, which has reduced the water 
reserves in the soil to zero. It is a very unusual situation 
which required immediate measures to ensure that the irrigation 
system would begin operating a month earlier than in previous 
years. According to our information, if it does not rain more 
regularly, in the plains, for at least two weeks, the grains, 
the wheat and the barley will be completely lost and will be 
dried up. 
  Last year 2 million hectares of crops were lost because of 
lack of water. This year, if there is no intervention at the 
twelfth hour to provide irrigation, it will be even worse. Faced 
with this state of affairs, the ministers of agriculture plead 
lack of money but, as spokesmen of the government, they continue 
to promise that they will provide the necessary funds for 
irrigation. When? No one knows, as long as the 1994 budget has 
not been approved yet. At present, only 10 billion lei have been 
allocated of the 25 billion lei which are absolutely necessary 
for putting into operation the irrigation systems promised for 
the first quarter. In television broadcasts, the ministers of 
agriculture say that this year's drought took them by surprise. 
However, we do not know the official viewpoint of the government 
or its intentions. It would be normal, at least, for the 
government to openly admit: "We do not have any money for 
irrigation, we are hiring rainmakers." 
  Meanwhile, it is highly likely that Romania will import not 
only wheat and sugar this year, like it has been doing up to 
now, but also the entire range of agricultural products, imports 
which will fatten up the ticks which are on the backs of the 
governing officials and ruin Romanian agriculture.

<F P=106> [Article by Ion Marin: "What the Grain Mafia is Pursuing"] </F>
  [Text] Immediately after the revolution, a strange 
phenomenon occurred in Romanian agriculture. Wishing to lend 
credence to the idea that the figures of the Ceausescu era were 
inflated not one or two times but 10 times, the 
postrevolutionary government, with its spearhead, the Ministry 
of Agriculture, began to systematically reduce the areas sown to 
crops and to resort to massive imports through specialized firms 
-- that is, by means of a network of a few magnates with an 
influence on some parties in power. The result is well-known. 
The individuals concerned became rich in defiance of the people, 
who were subjected to a slow but certain process of starvation. 
  In 1992, the grain yield was only 10.5 million tons. The 
technique perfected by the importers is simple: the reduction of 
the sown area from more than three million hectares to less than 
two million hectares, under conditions in which sowing was 
executed only after the best period. At the same time, the 
merry-go-round of imports was accelerated by an average of $1 
billion a year! Wheat was imported -- from one West European 
country, in particular -- at $155-160 a ton. When there was no 
need for wheat -- in 1990, for example -- the magnates contented 
themselves with importing fodder, for which $800 million were 
paid. This is how they arrived at the incredible amount of $3 
billion, which was paid by the Romanian state for wheat and 
fodder in 1990, 1991, and 1992 alone, a sum which represents 80 
percent of the total accumulated foreign debt. This debt paid by 
the Romanians was for commissions of about 5-10 percent, which 
went into the bottomless pockets of the big importers and their 
accomplices who governed the country in the respective years. 
Instead of being held responsible for this pillage and for the 
deliberate destruction of agriculture, these people still occupy 
important positions or comfortable seats in Parliament where 
they continue to boycott agriculture. 
  A bank director who was recently removed from his position 
has begun to make statements in various newspapers about the 
pressure exerted on him to initiate letters of credit for the 
import of millions of tons of grain, which were not needed, as 
he maintains now and as was well-known then. However, it seems 
that no one from the General Parquet or from the government or 
the Parliament paid any attention to such statements. Instead, 
there has been a lot of talk about some more or less obvious 
abuses occurring in some hamlet or some former agricultural 
production cooperative for which the current leadership of the 
Ministry of Agriculture is blamed! The fault of the minister is 
indeed great in the eyes of those who make such claims since the 
current minister of agriculture, with the support of the prime 
minister, has categorically refused to take into account the 
blackmail, exercised by all economic and political means, for 
continuing the import of grain and further indebting the 
country's treasury. In addition, he has undertaken to increase 
the areas sown by more than a million hectares, resulting in 
grain yields of more than 15.5 million tons in 1993, over 5 
million tons more than in the year, which was most profitable 
for the mafia of importers. In this situation, which was so 
disastrous for it, the importers' union, which has as its 
eminence grise the father-in-law of an influential politician 
who is highly regarded by the voters, was fully mobilized by 
some trade union organizations and by the lobby in Cotroceni 
Palace [presidential office] and Victory Palace [headquarters of 
the government], with a great chance of success. Last year, this 
trade union of the grain mafia, presenting data collected by 
American satellites, called upon the Government of Romania to 
import 1.5 million tons of wheat, but when it realized that it 
could not force the hand of the government it brought tractors 
into Victory Square and unleashed a wave of protests by means of 
a "peasant" trade union composed of city-dwellers. The current 
mobilization of the grain mafia has been prompted by the 
obstinacy of the government officials who have decided to double 
the area sown to sugarbeets, making it impossible to import 
sugar, which has brought so many millions of dollars of profit 
to these greedy racketeers. These gentlemen also received 
support, intentionally or not, for the destruction of the 
country's agriculture, from the banks, which loaned money, in 
dribs and drabs, at an exorbitantly high rate of interest. As a 
result, interest fees represent 60 percent of the cost of a ton 
of agricultural product and the animal husbandry sector has been 
destroyed. 
  What is under discussion now is not the exchange of one team 
for another but the return to the rudder of agriculture of those 
who have shown that they have no other interest besides driving 
agriculture to the ground. In future issues of the newspaper we 
will provide documents and name the people involved.

<F P=106> [Article by Nicolae Militaru and Petre Popa: "Hashish Ring </F>
in the Iza Valley"] 
  [Text] In the middle of last week, antidrug brigades in 
France, Belgium, and the Netherlands arrested 79 persons during 
a raid carried out on the border between the three countries. 
They were carrying large quantities of drugs. The nationality of 
the traffickers is not known yet but it is known that some 500 
vehicles and 1,500 persons were searched and 50 traffickers will 
be appearing before a Rotterdam court this week. 
  Seemingly without any connection to the above, some 315 kg 
of 
hashish was found concealed in the house of 39 year-old loan 
Covaci in Salistea de Sus, Maramures County, in the Iza valley. 
Placed in several hundred packages wrapped in tin foil, labeled 
in Italian, put in packages and then in cloth bags, it was 
buried in the ground in burlap and polyethylene sacks. A large 
quantity of empty burlap sacks were ready for use in packing. 
  In another Maramures locality, Dragomiresti, also in the Iza 
valley, a machine, made in the Netherlands, for packaging drugs, 
in bulk form, by vacuum method, was found under the kitchen 
floor of a countrywoman, M.M. In the same hiding place, a 
number of plastic and polyethylene bags were found, along with 
boxes with various foreign inscriptions. 
  The criminal investigators discovered a whole network of 
drug 
traffickers. As of now, it has been established that four more 
Maramures citizens -- from Salistea de Sus, Bogdan Voda, and 
Baia Mare -- are involved in the operation of processing and 
clandestinely transporting large quantities of hashish which 
were shipped to the port of Constanta from Lebanon. After a 
short stop at the Dutch packaging machine in Dragomiresti, the 
drugs were sent to the Netherlands. They crossed the border in 
trucks, nestled among crates of apples and bottles of wine. It 
is believed that about 5,000 kg of hashish was delivered to the 
Netherlands alone, in three trailer trucks. 
  The activity of breaking up the ring of traffickers 
continues, with the arrest of some of the persons implicated. 
  In the meantime, we have learned that 18.5 kg of heroin was 
discovered at the Giurgiu customs inspection point on 25 March. 
It was hidden in the doors and on the floor of a "Scania" 
38-HT-657 truck belonging to the Tekin Uluslarasi company from 
Turkey, which was transporting packages of cot ton thread. The 
driver, 31 year-old Yesil Erdojan, and his assistant said that 
they were delivering the "goods" to a citizen in Innsbruck, 
Austria. Both are being interrogated by the police and the 
procurator.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Yugoslav Foreign Minister </F>
Vladislav Jovanovic by Frank Westerman in Belgrade on 12 April: 
"United Nations Must Ban NATO Air Strikes"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- Following in the footsteps of the 
nonrecognized Srpska republic in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro 
are now also severing their ties with the United Nations. 
Belgrade is demanding that the United Nations impose an 
immediate ban on NATO air strikes. This was reported on Tuesday 
by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic in an interview 
with DE VOLKSKRANT. "I do not see how we can continue to 
cooperate with the United Nations in the same way," he said. 
  Until Sunday evening, when at the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] request, NATO fighter jets brought the Serbian offensive 
on the eastern Bosnian town of Gorazde to a standstill, Belgrade 
had cooperated closely with the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees "on the execution of its noble task of helping people," 
Jovanovic claimed. 
  However, in the wake of "this unforgivable outrage 
perpetrated by the United Nations," as he described the action, 
"it is difficult to imagine that our attitude would not change." 
  Four out of six sites designated as "safe areas" by the 
United Nations, including the Muslim enclaves of Srebrenica, 
Zepa, and Gorazde, are provided with supplies from Belgrade. 
  The minister listed a number of requirements which the 
United 
Nations must fulfil. Only then, according to the minister, can 
the peace talks be resumed. "First of all, UN envoy to the 
former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi must state that no further NATO 
air strikes will take place." 
  The UN secretary general's special envoy has just threatened 
to call for more air strikes if the besieging Serbian forces 
continue to threaten the densely populated city of Gorazde, 
whose population numbers 65,000 or so, and the aid workers who 
remain there. 
  Step two will involve launching a study that Jovanovic 
believes should result in "self-criticism" by the UN forces. 
"The United Nations must admit, even if it is too late, that it 
has made a terrible mistake," the minister dictated. 
  Because NATO had bombed targets just 20 km from the border, 
Jovanovic warned of the "possible dangers" of combat aircraft 
dropping bombs on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro by 
mistake or violating the country's airspace. 
  According to him and Western observers, the latter would 
happen on a regular basis, simply because Gorazde is too close 
to the border for aircraft to swoop down without leaving Bosnian 
airspace. Minister Jovanovic suggested that such violations 
could unleash a response by the Air Force of Serbia and 
Montenegro. "We have already had to restrain ourselves several 
times," he said. 
  Although Jovanovic is lending his full support to the 
Bosnian 
Serbs, who are continuing to refuse to speak with UN Commander 
in Bosnia Michael Rose, he does not believe that the prospects 
of peace have been lost for good. "However, at this moment in 
time, the war option has the upper hand. The consequence of the 
NATO action is that the Muslims and Croats now believe that they 
can win the war on the battlefield." 
  Meanwhile, he does not trust the proposal submitted by 
Russian negotiator Vitaliy Churkin, to station 800 Ukrainian UN 
troops, who are already on hand, in the enclave as soon as the 
Serbs have withdrawn. "The Russians have good ideas, but no 
power," he said. According to him, the presence of Russian UN 
troops in Sarajevo and Tuzla had not managed to restore the 
"impartiality" of the United Nations. 
  The minister, who was a career diplomat who wrote poetry in 
the evenings, believes that the United Nations has played itself 
out. "Long before the air strikes, it had abandoned its 
impartiality by taking the side of the Muslims," he said. 
  He pointed out that Gorazde never was a "safe area," because 
the United Nations has not yet started disarming those people 
who are defending the enclave. "Worse still, under the knowing 
gaze of UN observers, Bosnian Government troops have used the 
hills around Gorazde to prepare for a spring offensive," he 
continued. 
  The push by Muslim troops, which should have started three 
weeks ago, was met with a counterattack by the Bosnian Serbs. 
"Just when they seemed about to overrun their enemy, the United 
Nations once again suddenly started shouting murder," the 
minister said. Jovanovic, who describes himself as a humanist, 
democrat, and socialist, believes that there is a conspiracy. 
  It has been claimed that only two mortar bombs have landed 
in 
Gorazde over the past few days, not the "eight per minute" 
reported by UN observers. Apparently, UNPROFOR Commander Rose, 
who initially dismissed the reports by his staff as "emotional" 
and "exaggerated," later received an order from Washington to 
clear the way for a NATO air strike. 
  According to him, the use of combat aircraft had just one 
objective: "To guard the Muslims against defeat." Mr. 
Jovanovic believes that Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, his envoy 
Akashi, and Lieutenant General Rose have gone over the head of 
the UN Security Council, "thereby losing the United Nations any 
prestige it might have had."

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] New York, April 13 (TANJUG)--Yugoslav Ambassador to 
the United Nations Dragomir Djokic on Tuesday accused the United 
Nations and NATO of getting involved in civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems when they bombed 
Bosnian Serb positions at Gorazde on Sunday and Monday. 
  Speaking at a press conference at U.N. headquarters, 
Ambassador Djokic read out a statement by the Yugoslav 
Government about the NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
positions around the Moslem enclave. The Yugoslav stands were 
communicated also to Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The Yugoslav Government strongly condemns the decision of 
the 
United Nations to engage the NATO air force, which represents 
their direct involvement in the civil war in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems, the statement 
said. 
  Djokic told reporters that Bosnian Serbs had not tried to 
seize Gorazde and that U.N. officials on the ground had 
confirmed that the Moslems had provoked the fight. It is only 
to be expected that those attacked should defend themselves, 
there is not an army in the world that would react differently, 
said Djokic. 
  He explained the Yugoslav position that there was absolutely 
no reason to use force in this case and that, instead, the 
Moslems should have been warned to stop their provocations. 
However, now a very dangerous situation has been created, where 
it is not clear who will take the next step and what it will be, 
he said. 
  The air strikes have only encouraged the Moslems, who have 
been trying to provoke a foreign intervention from the start. 
The Serbs are committed to peace, but if the Moslems continue 
to attack, the Serbs will be forced to respond, as they will 
also in the case of possible new NATO air raids, said Djokic. 
  He added that Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) as well as the 
Bosnian Serbs had from the start insisted that a solution should 
be sought in peace talks, and not in the battlefield. However, 
somebody came up with the idea that Bosnian Serbs should be 
excluded from the talks, and they were not invited to 
Moslem-Croat federation consultations in Washington in 
mid-March, nor have they been told specifically what is expected 
of them, stressed Djokic. 
  The Serbs cannot accept a solution agreed in their absence 
by 
the Moslems and Croats. If anybody should try to force it on 
them, there is no doubt they will be repulsed. Serbs want 
peaceful talks as equal partners, said Djokic.

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- At this evening's 
session, presided over by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, the 
federal government considered current questions of cooperation 
with the UN peacekeeping forces and decided that prior 
permission of the Yugoslav Government is necessary for the entry 
and movement of UN Protection Forces' [UNPROFOR] vehicles on the 
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. Visas 
from the competent Yugoslav authorities will also be necessary, 
from 20 April, for the entry and residence of every member of 
the "Blue Helmets" in the FRY, the Federal Information Ministry 
has announced. 
  The federal government assessed that the UN peacekeeping 
forces, with their invitation to NATO to bomb Serb positions 
around Gorazde, have completely sided with the Muslim side in 
the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and ignored the 
vital fact that it was precisely the Muslim forces, exploiting 
the safe zone, which attacked Serb positions first. 
  The federal government stated these facts with regret and 
once again condemned in the sharpest terms this behavior by 
UNPROFOR and the armed action of NATO. In the assessment of the 
federal government, these acts directly threaten the peace 
process and could lead to the escalation of the conflict, not 
only in this area but in a broader region. 
  In its cooperation with UNPROFOR hitherto, the Yugoslav 
Govenment was guided by its interest in the cessation of combat 
operations as soon as possible and in the reaching of a just 
solution through negotiations. It worked to the best of its 
ability and within its limited capabilities, to make it easier 
for UNPROFOR to perform its functions. The federal government 
did this, it was concluded, with huge sacrifices and efforts 
under the conditions of the unjustly imposed UN Security Council 
sanctions against the FRY, which contravene the UN Charter. 
  The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been tasked with 
informing the UNPROFOR main headquarters about the conclusions 
of the federal government, a statement by the Federal Ministry 
of Information says in conclusion.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, April 13 (AFP) -- The Yugoslav 
government officially withdrew press accreditations from AFP 
correspondents here Wednesday [13 April], accusing them of 
waging a "media war" against Belgrade. 
  The information ministry withdrew accreditations from bureau 
chief Nicolas Miletitch and three other journalists to cover 
events in Serbia and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], but not for Serb-held areas of Croatia and 
Bosnia. 
  On Tuesday the ministry accused AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE and 
Cable News Network (CNN) of "waging a merciless media war 
against Yugoslavia, from its territory." [passage omitted] 
  The AFP journalists whose accreditation was withdrawn can 
continue to coordinate coverage of events in Macedonia and 
Albania.

  [Text] Belgrade, 12 Apr -- The Federal Yugoslav Information 
Ministry said in a statement this evening that accreditations 
would be withdrawn from the French AFP news agency correspondent 
and the correspondent of the American CNN TV network. 
  The statement reads: 
  ``Federal Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic has 
decided to take legal measures against the correspondents who 
have been waging a fierce media war against Yugoslavia, and this 
on the territory of Yugoslavia. This practically means that 
accreditations will be withdrawn from the AFP and CNN 
correspondents and they will not be permitted to do any further 
work from tomorrow, 13 April. 
  "Acreditations will also be withdrawn in the next few days 
from other foreign media correspondents who have been demonizing 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serb people for 
months, and some of them for years," the statement says.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, April 12 (AFP) -- The Yugoslav 
information ministry said Tuesday [12 April] it was withdrawing 
press accreditation from AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE [AFP] and Cable 
News Network (CNN), accusing them of waging a "media war" 
against Belgrade. 
  The exact reason for the move was not immediately clear. 
  AFP management strongly protested the measure, calling for 
the decision to be reversed. [passage omitted] 
  An AFP management statement said: "AFP has followed the 
ethical rules of the profession rigidly and in all areas, over 
the several decades it has been in Yugoslavia." 
  The cause of the Yugoslav action was not immediately clear. 
It came after NATO air raids on Bosnian Serb forces besieging 
the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  CNN does not have a permanent bureau in Belgrade.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jovan Lakicevic from the "An Argument More" </F>
program] 
  [Text] After the cowardly, repeated attack by U.S. 
aircraft from NATO formations on medical vehicles and civilian 
targets of the Bosnian Serbs, many things remain unclear and 
puzzling, especially regarding the real, undeclared aims of the 
inspirers of the aforementioned pirate action. It is, 
therefore, too early to draw any conclusions on the political 
and military effects of this act, which can be considered 
criminal in every respect. In other words, it is too early to 
judge what was gained and what was lost lost by different sides. 
  Nevertheless, one could say that all those who believed in a 
peaceful and quick settlement of the Bosnian conflict are the 
losers. Moreover, all those who thought that the U.S. 
involvement in the forced creation of some kind of Muslim-Croat 
federation serves the peace process are also disappointed. Even 
the last skeptics must now be clear that this was a simple 
camouflage for a quick renewal of an anti-Serbian coalition so 
the Serbs could be militarily pressed and forced, with NATO's 
help, to accept the dictate of the Western alliance. 
  Those who believed in the impartial and peaceful role of the 
United Nations also feel deceived. What can be said about those 
who thought for at least one moment that the belligerent and 
anti- Serbian hawks in NATO would play peace pigeons here under 
the trade mark of the United Nations? In other words, that they 
would keep aside of the interethnic war in Bosnia. 
  The Russians could also be considered political losers. With 
these unilateral actions by the Americans, they -- to put it 
mildly -- lost a step on the way back to the Balkan region. 
Subsequent, unconvincing anger by Russian leaders -- because 
they were allegedly not informed about NATO's intentions -- was 
directed more toward, as the U.S. President said, the public at 
home rather than Washington and Brussels. 
  The only winner appears to be NATO, which, without major 
upheavals in the international public and, so far, without 
Serbian revanchism, won a chance to go a step further in its 
offensive on neutral territory. 
  For the first time in its history, NATO attacked ground 
targets (?in Europe) from the air. The fact that this was done 
with a limited, relatively small number of aircraft indicates 
that this was a trail balloon and yet another forced precedent. 
This is paving the way for similar actions by NATO in the 
future in this and some other regions. 
  It would not be superfluous to recall that it was precisely 
in Bosnia's case that NATO, with the decisive role of the United 
States, first succeeded in becoming something of an extended 
hand of the United Nations in the peacetime military operations, 
then in becoming a protector of the United Nations Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] from the air, and finally in bombing targets 
on the ground. The right to make decisions on air strikes, 
which was first given to Butrus-Ghali, then to Yasushi Akashi, 
ended with the one who Washington and NATO headquarters in 
Brussels wanted to have it right from the very beginning -- with 
one of NATO military commanders. Since all these variations 
were peformed almost without any criticism, let alone resistance 
by the instrumentilized and deceived international public, and 
without any reaction by the corrupted and immature politicians, 
one can rightly expect NATO's next move to be according to the 
U.S. dictate. This would be the landing and intervention by 
ground forces that will carry out not only the UN tasks but the 
orders of the military organization of the Atlantic Alliance. 
  It is not impossible at all that this precedent-variation 
will be tested and endorsed by the public in Bosnia. Regarding 
this, the report that the landing of planes with weapons and 
NATO forces for rapid intervention on Bihac airport is 
indicative. If this report turns out to be correct, then this 
would undoubtedly be the beginning of the last, the hitherto 
untested, but the most dangerous variation of NATO formations' 
involvement. 
  The Serbs have suspected for a long time, and have now 
finally seen, that their opponents in the Bosnian war are not 
only the Croats and the Muslims, but also, to the same extent, 
NATO and the United States for their own reasons. They finally 
revealed themselves in the true light of friends of the Serbian 
enemies. Of course this fact is not easy to take, but it must 
be faced. 
  If the rest of the world does not realize in time that NATO 
military involvement in Bosnia is not only a matter or a problem 
that exists between the Bosnian Serbs and NATO formations, but 
playing out of all types of possible interventions by NATO for 
some future actions and some new territories, so much the worse 
for the rest of the indifferent world. The world will very soon 
face a military monster that will be a merciless punishing whip 
for the unsuitable and disobedient peoples in the hands of the 
protagonists of the new world order. 
  Therefore, the U.S. bombs that were dropped on Serbian 
targets in Bosnia not only represent an act of aggression and 
crime toward the Serbian people, but have a much more dangerous 
and foreboding meaning.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 13 April (TANJUG) -- Vitaliy Churkin, 
the Russian president's special envoy, arrived from Pale in 
Belgrade late this afternoon, where he was received by Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  Their strictly confidential talks were held behind closed 
doors but there is no doubt that the main reason for Churkin's 
surprise visit to Belgrade is the newly created situation in 
Bosnia following NATO air strikes on Serb positions around 
Gorazde. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic this evening again received Vitaliy Churkin, 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin's special envoy, who arrived in 
Belgrade following talks in Sarajevo and Pale. 
  As the Serbian president's office has announced, the talks 
focused on the current situation, while particular attention was 
paid to the initiative for reaching a general agreement on the 
cessation of all hostilities on the territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Serbian president stressed in talks that abandoning the 
practice of discriminating between the warring sides in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina represents an unavoidable precondition for 
reaching a final peace.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG)--U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) chief for the former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said 
on Wednesday that he had agreed with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic that "the current crisis in Gorazde should be used as 
a chance to secure a lasting peace and ceasefire in the entire 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Asked about his current contacts with the Bosnian Serb 
leadership, who suspended all links with UNPROFOR after the NATO 
air attacks on Serb positions near Gorazde (Moslem enclave in 
southeast Bosnia), Akashi said he had received assurances from 
Milosevic that he can continue the talks with the Bosnian Serb 
leaders. 
  "I intend to fly to Sarajevo to resume the talks regarding 
the ceasefire and peace, not only in connection to Gorazde but 
also linked to all other situations and I am very satisfied by 
such prospects," Akashi said. 
  He described the hour-and-a-half meeting with the Serbian 
president, held on Wednesday morning, as "very useful and 
productive." 
  "I appreciate his understanding of the complexity and 
urgency 
of these issues," Akashi said. 
  Commenting on the possibility of additional air strikes 
against the Bosnian Serbs, Akashi underscored his hope that the 
situation would not deteriorate to such an extent to force 
UNPROFOR to defend itself and the staff of humanitarian 
organizations with the minimum of weapons. 
  U.S. NATO jets on April 10-11 bombed Bosnian Serb positions 
near Gorazde, a U.N.-designated safe area which should have been 
demilitarized. It served as the starting point for a 
10,000-strong Moslem offensive in late March on Serb 
territories. After a strong Serb counter attack, which 
threatened to defeat the Moslems, the United Nations called for 
NATO air strikes on Serb positions allegedly to protect U.N. 
observers in Gorazde. 
  At last Saturday's negotiations with the Moslems, the 
Bosnian 
Serbs proposed a ceasefire in the entire Bosnian territory, but 
the Moslems rejected this suggesting a partial ceasefire and 
focusing only on the issue of Gorazde.

<F P=106> [Article by Milan Milosevic and Dragoslav Grujic of the </F>
Documentation Center: "The Dunces' Corner"] 
  [Text] Vuk Draskovic: "I like Professor Avramovic, he 
drafted a rather interesting economic and monetary program, but 
the minister of police represents continuity and is the pivot in 
the country of Serbia. That is what the prime minister-designate 
has told us!" 
  Our public, tired of this performance, will perhaps discover 
that last week's session of the Assembly brought the Serbian 
parliament closer to the role which every parliament has: to 
suspect, abuse, and criticize the ministers. This suits the 
Serbian deputies better than the declamations we have heard up 
to now. 
  Dr. Miroslav Neskovic took as his point of departure that in 
selection of the government "there have been cases in which we 
have ministers and people in high-ranking posts with a 
pedestrian psychology and knowledge to match, people of doubtful 
morality, people whose behavior smacks of corruption and 
black-marketeering, avaricious people without scruples, people 
who have brought with them only scandal, investigation, and 
ridicule": "The consequences of installing ministers, chiefs, 
and coordinators like this are disastrous. An inefficient, 
undefined, and chaotized state of affairs in all areas: monetary 
policy, trade policy, tax policy, business policy, and health 
care policy." 
  Prime Minister-designate Marjanovic listened to those 
challenging salvos with a sour smile, refreshing himself from 
time to time with lemonade at the bar near the entrance or 
coolly chatting with the journalists in the corridor (which is 
unusual for prime ministers, who usually slip away into the 
elevator). Some of the ministers would put an arm around his 
waist as a sign of support (as Radulovic did when the VREME 
reporter was in the vicinity). 
<H5>  Public Vices </H5>
  Judging by the assessment it pronounced of him, the 
opposition would like to give him a term considerably longer 
than four years, in Mitrovica, not in Belgrade. Someone said 
from the speaker's stand in the parliament that Progres, of 
which he is the director, is a "typical state enterprise which 
has a state monopoly over imports of natural gas, immense state 
privileges, and secret funds," that "Marjanovic finally entered 
the administration and became president of the Partizan Society, 
which brings together the military elite, the business elite, 
the party elite, and the UDBA [State Security Administration] 
elite, by the same principle, which is that of being associated 
with UDBA" (Vesna Pesic)..., that the territory of the former 
Soviet Union, where Progres did its business, is not a market 
anyway, but a "speculative kind of realm." The deputies were 
amazingly well-prepared in asserting that people very close to 
the prime minister-designate are co-owners of a domestic 
quasi-private firm Progres Gas Trading, representing business 
taken away from the Serbian Petroleum Industry, that a villa is 
being built for him on Dedinje, that he has property estimated 
at 40 million dinars, that he financed the campaign of the SPS 
[Socialist Party of Serbia] and the rebellion against Yeltsin in 
order to return the Communists to the Kremlin (Aleksandar 
Cotric), that he based his campaign largely on discrediting the 
SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] and accusations lodged against 
the humanitarian organization Spona [Link] (Aleksandra 
Jankovic); that the representative office of Progres in New 
York, which is called Interprogres, reregistered as a private 
firm under the same name at the expense of Progres and that this 
is the property of Mirko Marjanovic; and even that Mr. 
Marjanovic's secretary, Adrijana Jankovic, is employed in the 
Progres representative office in Frankfurt, although there are 
better-trained people for that job, that he sent the incompetent 
retired director of Trepca to Moscow. 
  A question was put as to the prime minister-designate's 
state 
of health, because he said that for reasons of health he 
traveled exclusively by Concorde planes between Paris and New 
York; he is reproached for having done business with Agrokomerc, 
for having done business with Senad Arslanagic of Progres 
Sarajevo, who had shady business dealings with the Swiss firm 
Tuson, that he did risky business by investing in the Zenica 
Foundry and Steel Mill just before the war, perhaps because of 
the prime minister's closeness to Branko Mikulic (Zoran 
Subotic), that he had deceived the knitwear mill in Batocina 
concerning goods exported to Russia (Slavoljub Filipovic). 
  Up to the point when this article went to press (Thursday 
afternoon), the Socialists had not taken the trouble to deny 
these assertions, perhaps because some of them were happy that 
the opposition "remembered" these figures. One exception was the 
intervention of Dusan Matkovic, who in reference to the 
"insinuations about the firm Progres" called for "light to be 
shed on the other side as well": "Let it be stated that in the 
last year and a half, in the worst time for supplying Serbia 
with gas, Progres worked to employ plant capacity in Serbia and 
to export Serbian goods to those markets from which the gas 
comes!" 
<H5>  Kidnappings, Copper, and Poaching </H5>
  The man who represents continuity, Police Minister 
Sokolovic, 
fared worse than Prime Minister-Designate Marjanovic. They 
called him Zoran (Jerotije) Sokolovic, they recommend that he 
not resign out of revenge because he resembles Nusic's heroes, 
and they remind the public that Police Minister Sokolovic's 
apartment has been broken into and robbed no less than three 
times, and the thieves have not been discovered. 
  The prime minister-designate praised him briefly, giving him 
credit for having guaranteed "a stable security situation under 
the extremely complicated conditions of being surrounded by war" 
and for what he had done to modernize the service. 
  The response he got was assertions that Mr. Sokolovic is a 
minister in whose police a number of abuses of official position 
have been committed, including one case in Jagodina where the 
police killed a retarded young Gypsy lad. Borivoje Borojevic 
said that the police had arrested 15 people because of a murder 
in Budva, that all of them "were bestially tortured, beaten, and 
sent to Montenegro, criminal proceedings were conducted against 
five, and they were all acquitted." 
  "He had the honor of celebrating when his subordinates in 
Belgrade beat a retired actress in the bread line...," Miodrag 
Brankov recalled. A few speakers put on his scoreboard the 
events of 1 June last year, when the police beat the opposition 
leader Vuk Draskovic and his wife Danica and a sizable number of 
other individuals. 
  It was stressed that our country has been utterly 
criminalized, as indicated by the statistics which the MUP 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the police have themselves 
been reporting, that there is more and more crime, that in 
Belgrade alone there are 54 unsolved murders at the moment. 
  "I expected the minister in charge to have submitted his 
resignation on his own a long time ago..., what he is 
responsible for seems to be getting worse and worse. I do not 
precisely understand the logic--why this continuity is 
continuing.... I might cite the kidnapping in Strpci..., a 
number of things have happened," Dr. Zarko Korac said. 
  Milisav Petkovic asserted that 20 people were kidnapped from 
Zvornik alone and that he has information indicating that our 
police even took part in all of that. A man who was registered 
in the Military Department for 10 years, who is a citizen of the 
Republic of Serbia, was kidnapped and abducted, some information 
suggests that he is in a school in Derventa, where training was 
conducted for seven days. Then they made them sign statements 
that they are volunteers, Petkovic asserted, seeking aid from 
Marjanovic so that someone would not one day kidnap him as a man 
born in Knin. 
  The assertion was made several times that the police have 
been protecting criminals. One deputy said that no fewer than 
two-thirds of the firms have been giving bribes, that 
Sokolovic's son has been selling precious metals and that the 
father has a duty to say whether he is influencing the business 
of his son; that Jezda got away from him and that Dafina is 
laughing at him because he cannot do anything to her. 
  The Radicals supplied the information that the smuggling of 
a 
sizable quantity of weapons was discovered on 3 March on the 
highway between Nis and Pirot in a traffic accident, but the 
affair was covered up because it allegedly involved a former 
relative of the deputy minister of internal affairs. Assertions 
were made that police chiefs, Sokolovic's people, are the main 
poachers in the Morava Valley. Slavoljub Filipovic called 
attention to the datum that an arms cache had been found in 
Topola, but the police have been silent, that the "chief" in 
Jagodina had been selling stolen automobiles from Vukovar, that 
weapons permits are being distributed through connections.... On 
the assertion of Aleksandar Cotric, 34 Golf cars stolen from a 
factory near Sarajevo were sold on the territory of Loznica 
Opstina, driven to Serbia, where the top leadership in the 
opstina government and their friends bought the cars for the 
trifling price of about 5,000 marks. The opstina has four times 
requested information on this from the MUP and Mr. Sokolovic (on 
22 October, 5 November, 22 November, and 9 December 1993). It 
has not received a response to this day. 
<H5>  UDBA and the Merchants </H5>
  If vague epithets are neglected to the effect that this is 
not a government of ethnic unity, but a "government of mafioso 
unity," the other ministers fared somewhat better, and the 
government was described the way import-export firms were once 
described--"UDBA and the Merchants." Dusan Vlatkovic, candidate 
for finance minister who was previously governor of the National 
Bank, was called upon to provide an explanation to all the 
savings depositors who were deceived (Slobodan Vuksanovic). 
  The ministers coming from the Associated Left were welcomed 
with rejoicing--Who is composing the government, the president 
of the republic or his wife? One deputy even said of Dr. 
Leposava Milicevic that she had become a minister "only because 
she had taken Mrs. Mirjana Markovic's blood pressure." 
  "Mr. Andrija, the famous Andra, known as Eva Milosavljevic 
of 
Zagubice, former president of Zagubice Opstina, was the main 
organizer of the spree at the source of the Mlava in Zagubice 
(Zivorad Jeremic)." 
  It was said of Mr. Radovan Pankov that he helped to falsify 
the election in Krajina and was rewarded for that with a 
ministerial post; that he is well-known in Krajina not for 
having bound the Serbian people together, but for having bound 
the top leadership of the SPS and the State Security Service of 
Serbia with the Krajina State Security Service. ("I apologize 
for having been redundant when I said the top leadership of the 
SPS and the State Security Service of Serbia!" said Aleksandar 
Vucic). As for binding the people together, he is not a favorite 
at all.... 
  Several deputies reproached the future ministers and even 
the 
prime minister himself for their intention to remain the 
managers of their firms, which is prohibited in parliamentary 
systems in the West: "Half of the government consists of 
managers who have no intention of leaving their positions 
(Velimir Simonovic)." 
  "It is obvious that the post of director of the Belgrade 
import-export firm Progres is stronger than the post of prime 
minister of Serbia. Or, the post of director of the Belgrade 
commercial firm Centromarket, held up to now by Mr. Slobodan 
Radulovic, is stronger than the post of deputy prime minister of 
Serbia (Milovan Konstantinovic)." 
  "There are people in the government who are not men of 
principle--not only were they recommended earlier as members of 
the government, but they could not wait for their parties to 
take a position, and when they saw that their parties would take 
a position they did not like, they became members of the 
government. I simply do not trust such people (Miodrag Brankov)." 
  The reference was to two officials of the Democratic Party 
[DS] (Radulovic and Djukic), who became part of the government 
against the will of their party. Radulovic, it seems, is 
refusing to give up his mandate and is complicating relations 
with the Democratic Party and announcing an appeal of the 
expulsion decision. Djindjic has let it be known that he is 
still hesitating on whether the Democrats will vote for the 
government or against it, although a majority in his caucus were 
against voting "for" (the top leadership of the party was mostly 
in favor of supporting the government). Djindjic has met with 
Milosevic, but that new meeting did not yield a result. The 
president of the Democratic Party observed during the debate 
that a government of national unity had not come about, but that 
it would one day. That unity, according to him, cannot occur 
just by the Socialists taking a few ministers from some party 
(they could have taken several more, we have plenty of them!), 
but that the condition is discontinuation of what has been the 
policy up to now, on which there has to be an agreement in 
principle among the parties. 
<H5>  The Program </H5>
  Marjanovic's program, which is more a letter of intent, 
takes 
for granted a return to the sound dinar, balancing budget 
revenues and expenditures, and financial discipline. Many 
Socialists have been cheerfully repeating this as a general 
phrase, but they have not gone into the meaning of it. 
  Marjanovic says frankly that the foreign exchange reserves 
are larger than was assumed and are "sufficient if the program 
is carried out consistently," which means that he does not hide 
his intention to commit them somehow. 
  His government has the intention of extending the tax system 
over the gray economy. His message to the large firms is that 
they not wait for government subsidies. 
  He announced that the government would insist on the export 
orientation of the economy and on "resolute and wise opening up 
to the world." 
  He announced optimization and reduction of public 
expenditure, removal of social welfare policy from the business 
firm so that expenditures do not have to be made to maintain 
production in unprofitable firms. Although he stressed that at 
this point "it is not a question of laying off the unutilized 
and redundant workers," but of "respecting the fact that some of 
those who are not employed have their own capital, land," the 
Serbian Radicals and Kostunica's Democrats, and in a 
considerable number of discussions the deputies of the SPO as 
well, openly expressed doubts about the government's intentions, 
lodging the charge that it wants to lay off more than a million 
workers, but it is not going to chase managers who have private 
firms. 
  "This government is a government whose task is to squeeze 
that last drop from the organism of Serbia's state and people, 
which is already as dry as a bone," Vuk Draskovic said. 
  They described the program as "the system of the leech, only 
slightly updated, with the same purpose as the loan, Dafina and 
the like" (Mihajlo Svilar). 
  The Socialists did not answer this criticism of the 
government, whose point of departure was social demagogy, 
sensing that they themselves might soon be attacking Avramovic's 
"penzos." It turned out that they nevertheless have a hard time 
thinking about a radical break with wartime policy and the 
wartime economy. 
  When Vesna Pesic asked how the prime minister-designate 
intends to cover the deficit of $1.5 billion when we "have had 
occasion to hear President Milosevic say that Serbia should be 
militarily the most powerful state in the Balkans," there was 
the usual uproar and mention of Zimmermann and the U.S. 
Congress.... Paying no attention to that uproar, she continued: 
"I ask the question Why? What kind of plan is there for us to be 
the most powerful state in the Balkans, how many tanks and 
artillery guns (above Sarajevo) will we continue to pay for them 
so that they can sit there and fire on the civilian population!" 
"With what will the Serb defend himself, gentlemen, if not with 
a cannon?" was the response she received the next day from 
Belic, a deputy of the SPS, a farmer of whom Kostunica said in 
the last convocation that even that could be a deputy. Raka 
Radovic and Prof. Ratko Markovic, author of the constitution and 
a new minister, were "dying with laughter" all the while. 
  The day before the session the Socialists had a tumultuous 
"all-evening" and "all-morning" meeting of the caucus during 
which the prime minister- designate's list underwent essential 
changes. This indicates not only the "nervousness about 
personnel," but also, per usual, as we have seen in all previous 
attempts at reform, the main resistance to reform comes from the 
government apparatus itself. 
  "The atmosphere in Serbia in which this program is being 
carried out is unfortunately such that it cannot succeed. I 
believe that it will not be long before even the Socialists 
renounce both Avramovic and that program; I am afraid that the 
opposition will again stand behind their [the Socialists'] 
candidate, just as was the case with Cosic, just as was the case 
with Panic" (Borivoje Radic). 
  Not knowing exactly what to do with a program which is 
basically acceptable to it, the opposition took a fierce grasp 
of what was so obviously within its reach--it disputed the 
credibility of the people in power. In Serbia, that is not an 
issue without importance.

<F P=106> [Article by Mate Basic: "Serb `Kolos' Supercannon, With </F>
Range of 60 Kilometers, Threatens Zagreb and Sarajevo!"] 
  [Text] Based on the plans drawn up by Canadian 
engineer Gerald Bull, the designer of the Iraqi supercannon who 
was assassinated in Brussels by Mossad, the Serbian military 
industry has developed a giant 203-mm cannon with a barrel 
measuring 12 meters in length, with which Zagreb can be hit from 
Petrinje and Sarajevo can be shelled without violating the NATO 
ultimatum. 
  Mate Basic uncovers one of the most strictly guarded 
Yugoslav secrets. Illustrations by Zdenko Svircic. 
  The withdrawal of Serb artillery to a distance of 20 km 
around Sarajevo will not prevent the destruction of the capital 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina! 
  The majority of the Serb artillery can launch destructive 
projectiles at two or even three times the distance established 
in the ultimatum on the withdrawal of Serb heavy arms. But the 
greatest danger is a hitherto unknown weapon, guarded as one of 
the biggest state secrets--a Serb 203-mm howitzer! This weapon 
was developed under the code name KOLOS! 
  The investment program to develop a Serb 203-mm supercannon 
ended back in 1985, but the medium-term plan for the period from 
1985 to 1990 included a program for additional production of 
90,000 155-mm and 203-mm shells, a completely new type with a 
significantly greater range! 
  The financing plan for the all-Yugoslav "Kolos" project was 
concluded in 1987: Investments were approved for the Slovene 
steel works in Store and Ravne na Koroskem (new furnaces and new 
presses for forging barrels), for the "Bratstvo" factory in Novi 
Travnik (forging and deep drilling of barrels), for the factory 
in Vogosca, near Sarajevo (forging and machining of 120-kg 
shells), for the "Ivo Lola Ribar" factory in Zeleznik, near 
Belgrade (computer control systems for processing gun breeches 
and for robots).... Besides these major plants, more than 500 
factories all over the former Yugoslavia were involved in the 
overall project. "Kolos" was only the main beneficiary of the 
investment, since the machines were also used to produce other 
weapons or parts of them. The total value of the investment at 
the time was more than $2 billion! 
  Reliable information indicates that even after 1987 the 
Serbs 
were working on realizing the "Kolos" project! In early 1993, 
"14 October" in Krusevac presented a finished transporter tank 
whose chassis was intended as a carrier for the Serb 
supercannon! Then, at the newly opened weapons testing range 
across the border from Prevlaka on the Montenegrin coast, tests 
were conducted in the fall of 1993 on a long-range system to 
record on radar screens the movements of ships from the Western 
European Union (WEU) and NATO that were enforcing the blockade 
on Montenegrin harbors! Thus, the threats previously expressed 
by General Zivota Panic, the former chief of the General Staff 
of the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia, and chetnik duke Vojislav 
Seselj concerning attacks against targets in Europe with 
long-range missiles must in fact be regarded as extremely 
dangerous. Specifically, these threats were expressed only as 
sheer disinformation, because the attention of the world public 
was supposed to be directed toward the development of Serb 
missile systems (which they cannot do, just as they cannot start 
up production of the "Orkan"), while in reality intensive work 
was being done on developing a long-range artillery gun! 
<H5>  Shells for Only $800 </H5>
  Qualified missile experts who are well-acquainted with the 
technological scope of the Serb military industry responsibly 
assert that the "Orkan" missile with a range of 50 km 
constitutes their maximum capability in developing 
surface-to-surface missile projectiles. Any increase in the 
range of missile projectiles requires the development of 
completely new, high-energy rocket fuels (which they do not 
have!) as well as the development of projectile-guidance systems 
if they want to achieve firing accuracy. Serbia lacks both the 
material and the personnel for such essentially new 
technological ranges, especially under sanction conditions. 
  Moreover, the cost of firing missile projectiles is much 
greater than the cost of firing artillery shells. 
  Specifically, according to the price list of the Commission 
for JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] Property Succession, one 
launcher-vehicle for a 262-mm M-87 "Orkan" multibarrel rocket 
launcher costs $540,000 and one launcher-vehicle for a FROG-7 
"Luna" also costs $540,000, while one launcher-vehicle for a 
128-mm M-77 "Oganj" multibarrel rocket launcher costs $360,000. 
Right now, a 130-mm M-46 cannon costs $228,000, while a 152-mm 
M-84 "Nora" howitzer costs $280,000. 
  There are also large differences in the price (which Serb 
military-equipment experts too are certainly keeping in mind) of 
missile projectiles and artillery shells: While the price of one 
missile is $2,600 for the "Oganj," $6,000 for the "Orkan," and 
$15,500 for the "Luna," a shell for the 130-mm cannon costs 
(only) $180, with $260 for the "Nora," while it would cost only 
around $800 for the long-range 203-mm cannon ("Kolos")! 
  The final argument on behalf of the development of a Serb 
supercannon is the complete technological independence from 
foreign partners! With the production capacity and machinery of 
special-purpose industry at its disposal, the former Yugoslavia 
was able to produce all the elements necessary for the 
production of artillery guns and ammunition of calibers 130 to 
203 mm. 
  After the disintegration of Yugoslavia, some parts of 
special-purpose industry also disintegrated, and the Serbs lost 
control over certain important factories. For example, the 
"Bratstvo" heavy artillery factory in Novi Travnik, which had an 
annual capacity of around 300 heavy artillery guns. 
  But although they lost this factory, the Serbs retained 
enough capacity to regenerate almost the entire previous 
production of artillery guns: At the "Prva Petoletka" factory in 
Trstenik, there is machinery for deep drilling of barrels and 
for superfinishing (honing) them to a depth of 16 meters and a 
diameter of 400 mm; at the "Cer" factory in Cacak furnaces are 
produced for heat treatment of barrels; and several other large 
and small Serbian or Montenegrin factories can also be included 
in the overall system ("I.L. Ribar" in Zeleznik, "Zeljezara" and 
"Aluminijski Kombinat" in Niksic, and so forth). Steel to 
produce Serb supercannons can be easily procured on the market. 
This commercial type of steel is called "maraging" (an 
abbreviation for "martensite generation"), and its only drawback 
is that it is expensive. Specifically, one kilogram costs $100! 
Moreover, all the equipment for producing ammunition has 
remained in Serb hands. 
  This equipment was previously tested at the firing range in 
Prevlaka, one of the most modern ranges in the world: It is 
known that the Germans have conducted target practice there 
while testing the 30-mm "Gepard" antiair gun. Today, a similar 
firing range has been set up on the Montenegrin part of the 
coast, across the border from Prevlaka. There is also a testing 
range in Syrmia, near Nikinci. It was created by seizing 
farmland from Croats and expelling them after World War II, and 
is also exceptionally well-equipped. This is confirmed by the 
fact that the Swedes used it to test their antitank missiles.... 
<H5>  Secret Cooperation With Iraq </H5>
  The crucial role in launching the "Kolos" project was played 
by Dr. Gerald Bull, a Canadian known throughout the world as the 
designer of Saddam Husayn's never-completed "Babylon cannon" 
(the powder for which was produced in Vitez), with barrels 
measuring one meter in diameter and 52 meters in length. The 
range of this gun was supposed to be around 600 km. Bull began 
official cooperation with the Military Technology Institute 
(VTI) in Belgrade in 1984, by way of the Federal Directorate for 
Trade and Commodity Reserves (SDPR) and SRC (Space Research 
Corporation) in Brussels, of which he was the founder and owner. 
At the same time, Bull was cooperating with Iraq (which was a 
scrupulously guarded secret), but also with South Africa, 
Canada, and even China. He was engrossed with the idea of 
creating a cannon that could shoot down satellites, and he 
called the project HARP (High Altitude Research Program). 
  After he was assassinated in Brussels by Mossad, the Israeli 
intelligence service, his associates published a book entitled 
From the Paris Cannon to HARP, in which they 
described exhaustively the genesis and development of the new 
cannon project. Specifically, Bull began by studying the 210-mm 
"Paris cannon," with a range of 130 km, with which the Germans 
shelled Paris in 1918. He then proposed an improved version to 
the Americans, and after they turned him down the Canadians sent 
him a million dollars for his annual expenses, as part of the 
long-range "Barbados cannon" project. When that contract 
expired, he became an honored guest of VTI in Belgrade, but also 
of other institutions and factories involved in the production 
of artillery. With his team of experts, he offered everything 
that he had--his know-how--but in return he gained the 
opportunity to use one of the world's most modern artillery 
testing ranges, the one in Prevlaka. Still, his work in Iraq 
continued to be classified top secret, although people knew 
about the 210-mm "Iraqi cannon" (the same caliber as the "Paris 
cannon" with barrels of 52 caliber (210 mm x 52), and thus a 
length of 10 meters. This was only the transitional phase 
preceding the construction of the planned "Babylon cannon".... 
  Besides gaining use of modern testing equipment for all 
calibers between 130 and 203 mm, Gerald Bull, through the SDPR, 
also sold his highly modern shells, produced according to his 
plans. Thus, the government of the former Yugoslavia, through 
the SDPR, was one of the biggest suppliers of Bull's products. 
For each sold shell produced under his license, the military 
industries who used his services paid Bull 10 percent of the 
value. Logically, part of the debt-servicing costs were settled 
through barter transactions.... 
  What did Bull work on in Yugoslavia? Yugoslav military 
researchers managed, independently of Bull's license, to 
increase the range of the "Nora," using the TF152 projectile, 
from 23,932.9 meters to 28,893.1 meters, and through later, 
additional testing they increased the range of that gun to a 
total of 39.5. Bull also participated in the startup of 
production of the ERFE-BB long-range projectile, with calibers 
of 130 mm, 155 mm, and 203 mm. Besides increasing the range of 
the projectile, Bull also helped solve certain design problems 
in the cannon itself. Based on his ideas, conversion of the 
famous 130-mm Russian M-46 cannon was carried out. A completely 
new 155-mm barrel was placed on the old pedestal, which made the 
shells significantly more deadly, and their range was increased 
to 39 km. The cannon bears a new name: M-46/84. But a special 
shell with a greater range was also developed for the old 
caliber (130), so that now it launches projectiles at a distance 
of 38,000 meters instead of 27,490 meters. The development of 
the M-87 "Nora" (an abbreviation of New Artillery Weapon) 
project lasted two years, until the advent of Bull and his 
associates. It was only after their expert intervention that the 
project was completed under the name M-84.... 
  Gerald Bull's main associate, to whom he passed on his 
knowledge, was a full professor at the School of Engineering in 
Belgrade with the rank of general, Dr. Anastas Paligoric, the 
director of the artillery section at the VTI, and also the 
designer of the 152-mm howitzer, better known as the "Nora." 
Based on the knowledge transferred from SRC, the entire team of 
military scientists conducted further research into increasing 
the range and improving the design of artillery ammunition, and 
on the design of the gun itself, with a barrel length of 52 
caliber. 
  Zorica Subotic and Slobodan Jarmaz published work on the 
Projection of Gas Generators to Increase Artillery 
Range, Milojko Ignjac and Slobodan Jarmaz analyzed 
The Selection of Fuel Characteristics for Gas Generators 
to Increase the Range of Artillery Projectiles, and 
Dragoslav Negoicic and Toni Arsic published the results of the 
study Gas Generator Lighter to Increase the Range of the 
TH 152-mm NORA Artillery Projectile. 
  What is remarkable about the Bull projects? This ingenious 
designer devised a way to enormously increase the range of 
artillery pieces by reducing the resistance of the artillery 
projectile. 
  Indeed, the biggest problem was how to reduce the resistance 
created by the projectile itself, as a result of the turbulent 
air current caused by the motion of the projectile itself 
(so-called background resistance, which accounted for nearly 50 
percent of the total resistance). This problem was solved 
through the revolutionary introduction of the "Base Bleed" 
natural gas generator. The innovation here is that during the 
flight of the projectile the gas generator released gas at the 
rear of the projectile, the volume of which filled the vacuum 
behind the projectile, thus almost completely eliminating the 
biggest share of resistance. 
  Just as the introduction of the jet engine revolutionized 
aviation, the introduction of the gas generator revolutionized 
artillery. Indeed, it involves an extremely complicated chemical 
process, which Serbia was unable to achieve alone. That is why 
the Croatian chemicals industry was involved, especially 
research teams at Ina [Petroleum Refining and Sales Enterprise]. 
This was the biggest military secret at that enterprise. The 
technology for producing high-level polymer materials was 
studied--hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). Today, based 
on the results of that research, Serbs at "Miloje Zakic" in 
Krusevac can product HTPB, the key raw material for the gas 
generator. 
  By applying additional improvements (higher-quality steel 
for 
the barrels, use of better powder, greater barrel length), the 
range of artillery weapons was increased almost twice over. 
  In this way, the Serbs have produced much cheaper and more 
deadly artillery pieces, with much greater accuracy! According 
to some data, this product would pay for itself if 18 units were 
sold abroad.... 
<H5>  Menacing Shell Weighing 100 Kg </H5>
  According to the final plans, the "Kolos" itself was 
supposed 
to be a self-propelled 203-mm howitzer modeled after a similar 
Russian weapon known as the "Piton." Two variants were 
developed: the towed version with the option of independent 
movement on the battlefield, and the self-propelled version on 
the chassis of the known tracked vehicle. Initial testing was 
conducted on a sample of the U.S. "M 110" howitzer, but the 
concrete results are not known. All that is known is that in the 
joint project between SRC, Yugoslavia, and Iraq, Saddam Husayn's 
howitzer achieved a range of 57 km with its caliber of 210 mm! 
At that range, the cannon known as "Al Fao" launched a 
projectile weighing 109.4 kg, the kind produced at the factory 
in Vogosca.... 
  What is bewildering, however, is the fact that top officials 
at NATO are uninformed of the real possibilities of the Serb 
cannon's range. Or is this once again a game of compromise with 
the Serbs, whereby Sarajevo is removed from mortar range but 
left within range of heavy artillery? For now, we can expect 
that shells weighing 100 kg will be arriving from a distance of 
60 km away from Sarajevo, or from any other target in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or Croatia. However, if the production of 
artillery pieces with a range greater than 100 km (like the 
"Babylon") is allowed, territory outside the former Yugoslavia 
will also come under Serb attack! For now, it is known reliably 
that the Serbs have the original powder for producing a 
supercannon like the "Babylon"--made for that purpose in 
Vitez--together with enough know-how to begin implementing a new 
and deadly project.

<F P=106> [Article by Jamil Rufa'il: "Albanian Leader of Kosovo </F>
Province Tells AL-HAYAH: Our Goal, Independence; We Call on 
Americans to Intervene to Resolve Our Issue"] 
  [Text] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, the leader of Kosovo Province's 
Albanians, who are striving for independence from the Serbian 
Republic, declared that he rejects any solution to the Kosovo 
problem that takes into consideration the plan being followed in 
the Krajina region, with its Serbian majority, which is aimed at 
keeping it within a federation with Croatia. Rugova called on 
the Americans to intervene in Kosovo, "because that would be a 
natural thing to do, after the biased Russian intervention." 
  Rugova talked with AL-HAYAH by telephone from the 
headquarters of the Albanian Democratic Alliance [Democratic 
Alliance of Kosovo], which he heads in Pristina. In his capacity 
as president of the Kosovo republic, elected by the Albanian 
majority in accordance with a popular plebiscite held in the 
region two years ago, Rugova said: "Kosovo is an independent 
neutral country. I cannot bow to pressures and agree to 
self-government within the Serbian Republic, even if it were to 
a maximum extent." 
  Albanians, who constitute 90 percent of Kosovo's population, 
consider Rugova president of the republic, which they 
unilaterally proclaimed. Rugova went on to say that 
"independence is the best solution for our problem. We shall not 
retreat from this position, after the experience we have had 
with the Serbs for more than 80 years, during which they 
practiced every form of arbitrary behavior, persecution, and 
ethnic cleansing against us." 
  The Albanian leader considers the situation in Kosovo as 
different from Krajina during the previous Yugoslav regime, 
"because Krajina was a autonomous unit within the Yugoslav 
Federal Union, which gave it the right to self-determination, 
just like parts of the other federation." 
  Rugova would not object to studying general ties within the 
scope of the Balkan region, "on condition that this were to come 
about after Kosovo is freed from direct Serbian domination and 
can determine its own fate." 
<H5>  Violence and Terror </H5>
  Rugova described the current conditions in Kosovo as 
distressing. "There is no open warfare, but there is violence 
and terrorism toward Albanian citizens. This makes it necessary 
to prevent a tragic catastrophe as occurred in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially since we lack any internal or 
external protection, including even the presence of 
international observers, after the Serbian Republic demanded 
their withdrawal at the end of last year." 
  Rugova considers the heavy Serbian military presence in 
Kosovo, especially the internal security force that implements 
the state of emergency, as most dangerous, an ominous indicator 
that an eruption or outbreak of real war could happen at any 
moment, "despite the fact that we are still trying not to react 
to provocations and violence, in order to avoid conflict or even 
worse consequences." 
  Rugova revealed a plan he had submitted to the United States 
and several European Community nations to resolve this very 
sensitive issue in stages, "beginning with temporarily placing 
Kosovo under international protection. We would prefer U.S. 
forces under UN supervision. During this period, Kosovo's future 
can be studied with the parties involved in this issue." 
  He stressed that during his meetings with American and 
European officials, he called for "linking the present 
international embargo against Yugoslavia (Republics of Serbia 
and Montenegro) with a settlement of the issue of Albanians in 
Kosovo." 
<H5>  Partition of Kosovo </H5>
  Rugova has rejected all plans aimed at partitioning Kosovo 
into Serbian and Albanian states, especially since this idea was 
first presented by the Serbian opposition. It was then endorsed 
by the previous Yugoslav (Republics of Serbia and Montenegro) 
president, Dobrica Cosic, and repeated by many others at other 
times. "However, it is unacceptable, because there is no clear 
ethnic Serbian part of Kosovo, with the exception of certain 
villages. The other parts are Albanian. One should note that 
Serbian plans are to gain mastery over those areas that are rich 
in resources." He added that partition would not solve the 
problem, "because a million Albanians would remain in Serbian 
areas, which would result in a continuation of the present 
situation and the absence of a permanent solution." 
  Regarding negotiations with authorities in the Serbian 
Republic, Rugova emphasized that they stopped when contacts 
failed a year ago concerning studies in Albanian schools. "We 
want to resume them and continue the dialogue, but the Serbs 
present crippling conditions that have previously been 
submitted, in order to get us to relinquish our goal of 
independence and recognize Serbian authority over Kosovo in all 
political areas in the region." 
<H5>  Russians Are Biased </H5>
  Rugova criticized Russia's totally biased position vis-a-vis 
the Serbs. He considered the Russian delegations' visits to 
Kosovo as a kind of direct provocation against the Albanians, 
since the Russian parliamentary (Duma) delegation, which came to 
Kosovo last week, showed outright extremism, to such a degree 
that it tried to spread fear and panic among the Albanians. 
"However, we made it clear to them that we no longer feared 
anyone, after we dhqna al-amrin [words as 
transliterated] from the Serbs." 
  Rugova explained that American intervention in the Albanian 
issue in Kosovo would be natural after the Russian activities. 
"We made our position clear to both sides. We call for direct 
American intervention in this issue." He indicated that the 
Kosovo Albanians would welcome any agreement in the Balkans that 
would contribute to relieving the tension in the region. "At 
this point, we salute the federation between Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats."

  [Text] Istanbul, April -- Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, prime 
minister of the republic of Kosova, spoke at the Balkan 
Conference held in Istanbul on 7-10 April. We publish here the 
closing section of his speech at this meeting that was attended 
by many statesmen from the Balkan countries and at which the 
main topics were Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosova. 
  ``... What do the Kosovars want? Nothing more and nothing 
less than to be allowed to freely exercise their will as a 
people. The Kosovars ask to realize their aspirations in a 
peaceful way. A peaceful movement of this kind is something new 
in the Balkans and, if it brings results, can only increase the 
hopes of the Balkan peoples for a brighter future. It will be a 
clear and fair sign that conflicts even in the Balkans can be 
solved in a civilized manner before resorting to force. 
  "Many people suggest that the Kosovars should accept 
autonomy, similar to that created in 1974. Those who support 
this idea seem to forget that such a thing was tried in the 
past. It did not work. The Serbian regime succeeded in revoking 
Kosova's autonomy even at a time when Yugoslavia possessed a 
complex structure that all the constitutive people might have 
hoped would protect them. Autonomy would now be entirely in the 
hands of Serbia." 
<H5>  To Ask For Autonomy for the Kosovars Is To Ask Them To </H5>
Remain Under Greater Serbia 
  ``To suggest autonomy for Kosova is as if to ask Slovenia to 
return to what used to be called Yugoslavia, to ask Croatia to 
forget the war visited upon it by the Serbian aggressor, its 
cities turned to dust and ashes like Vukovar, the bombardment of 
Dubrovnik, and the forced migrations, and to return to 
Yugoslavia. To ask Kosova to accept autonomy is as if to ask 
Bosnia to forget its 200,000 dead, its thousands upon thousands 
of women raped, and the millions of people ethnically cleansed, 
and to return to Yugoslavia. Those who suggest autonomy for 
Kosova must realize clearly that this is the same as asking the 
Kosovars to remain under Greater Serbia, under Serbian 
dictatorship, always oppressed, persecuted, harassed in every 
possible way, and treated as a colony. Those who suggest 
autonomy only show that they are not ready to grapple with the 
regime of a dictator. 
  ``The people of Kosova are not asking for independence just 
like that. Their case is not simply one of secessionism. The 
state of which they are once a part has disintegrated and no 
other state that may subsequently arise can incorporate them 
within its borders against their will. When the problems in 
Yugoslavia started, Kosova asked simply for equality. All that 
Kosova asks now is to enter as an equal partner into 
negotiations and for a satisfactory solution to be found. What 
is wrong with equality? The Serbs should never be frightened of 
equality. The demands of the Albanians of Kosova are in no way 
directed against the Serbs, and are not directed against Serbian 
cultural monuments, or against Serbian civilization, in spite of 
the fact that it has been these same Serbs who, in the last two 
or three years, have mercilessly destroyed the civilization of 
non-Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, and elsewhere. 
  ``The Albanians of Kosova do not possess the argument of 
force. They cannot compel the international community to take 
sufficient measures against Serbia. Nevertheless, we insist on 
certain steps that the international community should urgently 
take. 
  ``One step that must be taken immediately, in our view, is 
to 
tighten the international sanctions against Serbia and 
Montenegro, and to make the eventual lifting of these sanctions 
conditional upon achieving a satisfactory solution for all the 
problems of the Yugoslav crisis, including Kosova. This is in 
the spirit of the decisions of the London Conference on the 
Former Yugoslavia. It must be underlined that Kosova is 
suffering the effect of these sanctions for no fault of its own. 
  "The people of Kosova are nevertheless ready to continue to 
endure these sanctions, although they are an additional 
difficulty, in the hope that these sanctions, however inadequate 
they may be, may have some effect in halting Serbia." 
<H5>  Kosova Is a Regional Problem </H5>
  ``Kosova must then be demilitarized and its democratic 
institutions restored. A form of international protectorate 
must be established in Kosova. Because Kosova is a regional 
problem and not Serbia's internal affair, the neighboring Balkan 
countries must play a more constructive role, because peace is 
endangered in these countries, too. The worst thing that can 
happan is for Balkan countries to take the side of the aggressor. 
  ``The presence of observers and the maintenance of sanctions 
can only normalize the situation and reinforce the people's 
constant belief that their situation can be alleviated only by 
peaceful means. This is the only way in which the necessary 
conditions can be created to enable us to take part as equals 
and without preconditions in negotiations on Kosova. Otherwise, 
the future will be unsure and unpredictable. Let me underline 
once again, on behalf of the government of Kosova, that we have 
a mandate to act upon the will of the people, and we will 
continue to do this. Self- determination is not an exclusive 
right of the Serbs, but a principle applied throughout the 
world. In this context and in this spirit, we appeal to the 
United Nations Security Council, the CSCE, the United States, 
and Russia, and all democratic governments, to help Kosova to 
avert conflict and to achieve a normal life for its people. 
  "We invite all democratic government to recognize the will 
of 
the people of Kosova for a free and self-determined existence. 
Only justice can be eternal," Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, prime minister 
of the republic of Kosova, said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by Josef </F>
Horsky; place and date not given: "Reality Is More Difficult 
Than I Thought"] 
  [Text] The head of Slovak diplomacy, Eduard Kukan, is an 
experienced diplomat and has been employed by the foreign 
service for almost 30 years. It would certainly be interesting 
to talk with him about a wide range of problems in our foreign 
policy, but, during our short meeting, we limited ourselves to 
the most topical problems connected with his assuming the office 
of foreign minister. 
  The new government, as you said, is considering dealing with 
our relations with our main neighbors, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. The government believes it is our main task. 
  [Kukan] Of course, our relations with the Czech Republic are 
being built now. To normalize them--in which we are interested, 
as is the Czech side, I believe--we have to sort our problems 
that have remained open. When we start again with a clean 
sheet, so to speak, our situation will be easier. I am not 
going to speak about details, but you know that the problem of 
gold and other issues is involved, as is quite well known. We 
are conducting complicated and difficult negotiations, and it is 
our concern not to damage Slovakia's interests. We will not be 
able to sort out many of the problems within six months, but we 
do not want to wait. We must devote our full time to them. 
  Both successor countries to the former CSFR must learn how 
to 
live in the new situation and adjust to it because there are 
historical links and interests, in my opinion. The real 
situation will force us to cooperate in the future. But then, 
our cooperation will have a new quality, based on the decisions 
of both countries. 
  [Horsky] As regards our relations with Hungary, the chief of 
Slovak diplomacy confirmed that he wants to create a peaceful 
atmosphere without emotion, which is needed to keep the dialogue 
running. 
  [Kukan] We would be happy if there were a similar reaction 
in Hungary. We expect no miracles because our relations are 
complicated and burdened by the past, but there are things we 
can solve within six months. They are contained in the 
government policy statement. The most important thing is that 
we do not want to lose communications with Hungary. 
  [Horsky] When asked whether there is a real possibility for 
a treaty on good-neighborly relations being concluded with 
Hungary, or at least its principles, Kukan provided a diplomatic 
response. 
  [Kukan] I do not see it as unrealistic. I do not mean the 
treaty itself. Regarding these principles, there is such a 
possibility. 
  [Horsky] The second problem of our foreign policy is that we 
want to integrate into Western political and economic 
structures. In this connection, we are interested in what you 
are going to discuss tomorrow with [U.S.] Deputy Secretary of 
State for Eastern Europe Talbott. 
  [Kukan] As you know, Mr. Talbott is very close to President 
Clinton. They studied together and have personal contacts. 
This is not the only reason we believe his visit is so 
extremely important. His visit is a certain signal in the 
situation that has arisen in Slovakia. According to our 
information, he wants to explain to us thoroughly and 
analytically the current position of the United States toward 
the countries of Central and East Europe because it has recently 
changed slightly after being criticized. On the other hand, he 
will certainly listen to our opinions on our integration into 
Western structures. Apart from this, he will be interested in 
the development of the economic situation in Slovakia and in 
conditions for the arrival of entrepreneurs from the United 
States and the influx of U.S. capital. These two issues are his 
priorities. 
  [Horsky] But the United States is only one of the NATO 
pillars, albeit the stronger one. What will the situation look 
like with respect to the European Union [EU] and its military 
component, the Western European Union [WEU]? 
  [Kukan] In the political sphere, we are interested in EU 
membership. Our association treaty has been ratified by two 
countries, and our task is to have the other EU countries do the 
same so that we might do the same thing that Hungary and Poland 
did on Friday [8 April]--submit an application for EU membership. 
  [Horsky] As regards security matters, Minister Kukan said: 
Our signature on the Partnership for Peace plan is a step toward 
full membership in NATO. Only reality will show us how this 
mechanism will function. As far as the WEU is concerned, we are 
interested in permanent observer status.

    [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers have recently carried 
several items dealing with the possibility of another group of 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) deputies leaving the 
formerly ruling movement, thereby securing for the current 
government coalition 90 votes needed to pass constitutional laws. 
  Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 9 April on pages 1 and 3 
carries a 1,100-word interview with Vladimir Bajan, former 
deputy chairman of the HZDS Club of Deputies in the Slovak 
Parliament and now a leader of Prime Minister Moravcik's 
"Alternative of Political Realism," by Martin Krno entitled 
"Blow Below the Belt." In the interview, the place and date of 
which are not given, Bajan denounces the "StB [communist-era 
secret service] methods" practiced in the HZDS Club of Deputies 
and indicates that another nine deputies are to defect from the 
HZDS parliamentary group. 
  In the PRAVDA interview, Bajan reacts to the "publication in 
the press" of "sworn statements" signed by HZDS deputies at a 
meeting of the HZDS leadership at Horne Plachtince in November 
1993, in which they pledged that they would relinquish their 
mandates as deputies if they ever leave the HZDS. Bajan 
confirms that he signed such a statement "under threats" last 
November but denies that he had violated it by retaining his 
seat in parliament: "I kept it [the sworn statement] because I 
did not leave the HZDS. I was expelled from it." Speaking about 
the circumstances of the Horne Plachtince pledge, Bajan says: 
"All day long we were clarifying the position of confidence, 
and, in the evening, they presented a statement they had brought 
finished from Bratislava in the morning. We considered this a 
blow below the belt. First, 21 persons, including Ivan 
Gasparovic, chairman of the parliament, refused to sign. We 
considered this quite normal. Gasparovic is a lawyer and knew 
that this is outrageous. Then Meciar said he would resign along 
with the whole government. He said he would call upon his people 
to take to the streets and oppose the deputies." After the 
"prime minister's threats," Bajan continues, Gasparovic asked 
the deputies "not to be foolish because the declaration has no 
legal validity, and if it calms the situation in the HZDS, it is 
necessary to sign it." According to Bajan, the statements were 
then entrusted to Gasparovic in a sealed envelope. Because they 
have now appeared in the press, Bajan says, "I would like to ask 
Gasparovic whether someone has broken into his office." Bajan 
views the publication of the statements, which include the home 
addresses and phone numbers of the signatories, as "illegal" and 
a "dangerous precedent" and announces that he will ask the 
General Prosecutor's Office to investigate the leak: "All day 
long scores of people are calling, threatening the deputies' 
wives and children. If the HZDS wanted to achieve this through 
these StB methods, it really succeeded," Bajan says. 
  In one part of the interview, Bajan confirms that HZDS ranks 
might be left by social democratically oriented deputies. The 
passage reads: "[Krno] We have learned from various sources 
that eight more deputies might leave the HZDS Club of Deputies 
and establish a Social Democratic Club and that one deputy is 
planning to reinforce Cernak's National Democratic Club of 
Deputies. Can you confirm these rumors? 
  "[Bajan] It is difficult to accurately estimate their 
number. But I do not rule out that your figures might be close 
to the reality. The Social Democratic current has so far 
remained in the HZDS parliamentary club. It is only a question 
of time when these deputies will publicly confirm their 
disagreement with the policy of the present leadership of the 
movement. This is connected with the crystallization of the 
political scene.... Our former HZDS colleagues have one last 
chance to join parties with a future." 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 9 April on page 2 carries a 
100-word interview with Ivan Laluha, a parliamentary deputy for 
the HZDS who is considered to be the leader of the "Social 
Democratic" current, about the possibility of more defections 
from the HZDS parliamentary group. The interview, the place and 
date of which are not given, reads: "[SME] Before the HZDS 
Assembly in Presov [held on 26-27 March], it was expected that 
you would establish there a Social Democratic Platform within 
the HZDS or that you would leave the movement. Why did these 
expectations from behind the scenes not come true, all the more 
because it was rumored that you would contest the elections 
jointly with the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia? How 
likely is your departure from the HZDS? 
  "[Laluha] If you allow me, I will make a statement on this 
at a later date." 
  Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 12 April on pages 1 and 3 
carries an 800-word interview with Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of 
the parliament, by Martin Krno entitled "No One Has Broken Into 
My Office." In the interview, which was conducted on 11 April, 
Gasparovic responds to the interview with Vladimir Bajan in 
Bratislava PRAVDA on 9 April. He describes how the "sworn 
statement" of November 1993 came about, stressing that "it is 
binding morally rather than legally." He also explains the 
circumstances under which the signed statements became public: 
"After several deputies left our Club of Deputies and formed the 
Alternative of Political Realism, Mr. Cabaj, chairman of the 
HZDS Club of Deputies, came to see me. I handed him the 
envelope at his request. I did so because it was property of 
the HZDS and did not concern the National Council. Therefore, 
no one has broken into my office and, I hope, never will." 
Asked about the expected departures from the HZDS Club of 
Deputies, Gasparovic says: "There exist certain indications of 
that. But even if some more deputies leave, this need not be 
considered a tragedy. We have clearly stated that only those 
should remain in our club who trust the HZDS program and want to 
implement it to the last degree. It would make no sense for 
people to remain among us who disagree with this program."

<F P=106> [Article by "is": "The Development of the Economy Is Worse </F>
Than Expected"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Provided that the talks with the 
International Monetary Fund are successful, the first 
approximately $110-million installment of the standby credit 
from the IMF should be released before the end of the year. The 
drawing of the standby credit should be followed by the drawing 
of the second installment of the STF [strategic transformation 
facility] loan of approximately $90 million that Slovakia 
obtained last year. The second installment of the standby 
credit would then represent the sum of $60-$70 million. This 
was stated by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova in 
connection with the current 10-day visit by an IMF mission. 
  According to Schmognerova, her talks with the mission's 
representatives did not concern the creation of the social fund 
or the introduction of wage regulation. Wage regulation should 
be introduced only in the event of a marked widening of the gap 
between the growth of wages and the decline in labor 
productivity. As for the social fund, she said that it will be 
created; the only question is how. "It will most probably be 
created only at the beginning of 1995." The government is also 
considering increasing the number of products that will be 
subject to the higher value-added tax rate. Brigita Schmognerova 
voiced the assurance, however, that the increase would not 
concern products of everyday use. Measures to retain budget 
balance should not affect the level of transfer payments, 
according to her words. "Our endeavor is to distribute social 
burdens evenly so that the weakest social groups are not 
affected," the deputy prime minister added. 
  As she went on to say, the development of the economy this 
year is worse than originally expected. The government 
therefore has some crisis measures in reserve. "We would like 
society to realize that we need support and that the 
implementation of the set targets will establish better 
prerequisites for the future. We have opted for measures that 
will not concern the budget alone and that will lay the 
foundations for positive developments and will have the least 
social impact," Schmognerova stressed. According to her, the IMF 
mission appreciated the fact that a new government was formed in 
a very short time and that this government was able to prepare 
its economic program quickly. The mission also appreciated the 
government's endeavor to accelerate privatization and make it 
more transparent and the [planned] launching of the second wave 
of coupon privatization. Referring to the suspension of talks 
between the former government and the IMF, the deputy prime 
minister said that the former government had implemented 
virtually nothing of its commitments toward the IMF, though 
these have been known since December 1993, which makes the 
starting position of the present government all the more 
complicated. 
  [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 6 April on pages 1 
and 2 carries a 600-word Igor Zvach article on Deputy Prime 
Minister Schmognerova's comments on her talks with the IMF 
mission. The report includes the following passage: "Asked 
whether the talks concerned devaluation or the measures adopted 
by the previous government to limit some imports, Schmognerova 
said that they did not. The Slovak Republic's foreign exchange 
reserves are developing so that devaluation is not necessary. 
The import surcharge had been introduced temporarily and 
following consultations with GATT, and it is therefore pointless 
to talk about it. Asked by NARODNA OBRODA whether some tough 
IMF demands were discussed, such as measures in the sphere of 
taxation and prices or cuts in the social sphere, the deputy 
prime minister admitted that some IMF recommendations are 
heading in this direction. The issue will be how to minimize 
their impact on the population. No general tax or price 
increases or drastic cuts in the social sphere are in the 
offing. It is possible, however, that it will be necessary to 
reconsider the tax burden with respect to certain groups of 
merchandise. However, this will not concern articles of 
everyday use."]

<F P=106> [Article by Beata Pavlovova, of the Center for Empirical </F>
Research (STEM): "Slovakia Through Eyes of Czech Public"] 
  [Excerpt] According to a public opinion survey carried out 
by the Center for Empirical Research (STEM) under the title 
"Trends," more than one-half (54 percent) of the Czech public 
expressed regret at the beginning of this year over the breakup 
of Czechoslovakia. The proportion of Czech citizens who 
expressed regret in May 1993 was 62 percent. 
  Those who do not regret, in hindsight, the division of the 
common state mostly subscribe to two views. First, they are 
convinced that the independent Czech Republic can achieve 
economic prosperity sooner. This is borne out by the 69 percent 
of respondents who said last May that economic reform would 
progress faster in the independent Czech Republic. The second 
group of those who do not regret or no longer regret the 
division of the common state is convinced that the Slovak nation 
had to undergo the process of self-realization that culminated 
in the assertion of independent statehood. A total of 35 
percent of respondents in the Czech Republic wish for the 
reunification of the two republics. 
  Other questions in the STEM survey, which was carried out in 
February of this year, concerned assessment of the Czech 
Republic's relations with other states, including Slovakia [SR]. 
The respondents were asked to try to grade their personal 
attitude toward individual states by means of school marks [on a 
one to five scale used in Czech schools]. With regard to the 
SR, most respondents, a third, gave their own attitude toward 
the SR a two. About a quarter gave it a three, and one fifth a 
one. 
  The public's assessment of the dynamism of the evolution of 
the Czech state's attitude toward the SR was the aim of STEM's 
question in the February 1994 survey on whether the Czech 
Republic's relations with the SR have improved in the course of 
the last year, have remained the same, or have deteriorated. 
Some 56 percent of citizens believe that these relations have 
deteriorated, 37 percent assume they have remained the same, and 
5 percent are convinced that they have improved. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with General Staff Commander Jiri Nekvasil by </F>
Petr Bakovsky; place and date not given: "Our Army Has Never 
Developed Bacteriological Weapons"] 
  [Text] In connection with the Army, various affairs, small 
or great, have been discussed recently. General Major Jiri 
Nekvasil, General Staff commander, answered our questions about 
topical issues regarding the Army. 
  [Bakovsky] Has our Army ever developed bacteriological 
weapons? 
  [Nekvasil] Our Army has never developed bacteriological 
weapons. Our Army has never had carriers of bacteriological 
weapons, and I do not understand the hysteria that has been 
launched regarding this matter in certain mass media. In 1992, 
we declared in the United Nations that we were not violating any 
treaties on bacteriological weapons. Foreign specialists who 
conducted control checks here were informed about everything, 
and they even appreciated the order we have here. It is 
difficult to understand because we had viruses here for several 
years, and we wanted to normalize the situation. We knew that 
we were not violating any international conventions. We did not 
need them for diagnostic and preventive reasons, so we wanted to 
get rid of them. After the check was made in all military 
hospitals, we do not have anything anywhere. 
  [Bakovsky] How does the professionalization of our Army 
proceed? 
  [Nekvasil] Professionalization does not mean counting the 
ratio of officers to conscripts. I believe the main goal of 
professionalization is to install professionals in positions for 
which it does not pay off to train soldiers who are serving for 
only 12 months. They are mainly troop commanders, specialists 
in the artillery troops, and tank commanders. In this way, a 
new category of soldiers should be established. We want to 
start with this system in the Fast Deployment Brigade, where we 
want to have only professionals in the future. 
  [Bakovsky] What is the current progress in establishing the 
Fast Deployment Brigade? 
  [Nekvasil] This establishment should be completed on 30 June 
1994. The situation progressed last year, when we trained our 
people, commanders mostly. Our principle is to accept the 
people who want to join the brigade and apply to do so. The 
main slogan of the brigade--"Our place is where others cannot 
keep up"--makes service in this unit more attractive. It should 
be an elite unit that will fulfill tasks on our territory, as 
well as peacekeeping tasks outside of our territory. 
  We want to transfer the experience we gained during the 
training of the brigade to another two brigades--that is, the 
brigade in Kromeriz, which is now being transformed, and the 
mechanized brigade in Susice. When we compared our training 
methods, which we plan to use in the Rapid Deployment Brigade, 
with the training of Dutch soldiers, it became obvious that we 
were going in the right direction and that, after six months in 
service, our soldiers proved to be comparable with those 
professionals. 
  [Bakovsky] What will be the situation in the Air Force after 
the MiG-23 planes are put out of service? Will the Army have 
enough planes to bridge the period until the purchase of new 
ones? 
  [Nekvasil] We have 28 SU-22 planes that are almost new, and 
their type is not that old. We will try to keep them. They 
have a long life span and are relatively modern. They have 
laser-controlled aiming devices. We also have SU-25 planes that 
are expected to last beyond 2005. They are interceptor-bombers 
and combat planes. As far as interceptors are concerned, for 
the time being we will have to stick to recent modifications of 
the MiG-23 ML planes as long as possible. We have enough MiG-21 
MF planes. At present, we do not need supersonic planes. The 
guidance system and weapon systems are the most important things. 
  It is a difficult thing to reduce the Air Force. Our Air 
Force must become a good-quality Air Force, above all. We 
cannot let the pilots fly only 50 hours. This was enough in 
1991 and 1992, when the Army was in a difficult period. If we 
want to have a well-trained Army, our pilots must fly 90, 100, 
or even more hours. 
  I do not support the idea that our Air Force should only be 
able to fly. Our Air Force must also be able to fulfill any 
defensive tasks that are given to it. 
  If we have such an Air Force, we need fewer planes, but well 
equipped with good guiding systems and weapon systems. With the 
current ammunition, you need four planes to fulfill a task that 
could be fulfilled by one plane equipped with such a system. 
This became evident in the Persian Gulf war. The Air Force 
should be reduced and its quality improved. We should also have 
fewer types of planes. We have too many of them. After such a 
reduction, the Air Force will become more capable of combat. 
  [Bakovsky] The Military Air Force will use five permanent 
airports. What will be the situation during a possible military 
threat to the state? 
  [Nekvasil] We will have the airports in Kbely, Pardubice, 
Namest, Caslav, and Prerov. We are not going to abandon other 
airports completely. The offer we received for renting the 
airports contains certain conditions that will allow us to use 
them during mobilization. In a few countries, the air forces 
use civilian airports. By reducing the number of airports, we 
want to accumulate funds for the purchase of equipment, so that 
pilots, technicians, and service personnel might work in 
conditions corresponding to European standards. This also 
applies to guards. 
  [Bakovsky] What is the situation in missile testing? Where 
will it be conducted? 
  [Nekvasil] After so long, for the first time we will conduct 
the testing in Poland. This will include Air Force, Air 
Defense, and short-range missiles, specifically the Neva system. 
  [Bakovsky] Did the deployment of our troops change after the 
division of the Republic? 
  [Nekvasil] Since 1990, troops have been uniformly deployed 
over the entire territory. The main goal was to uniformly 
deploy troops over the territory and to allow the soldiers to 
serve closer to their places of residence. In that way, the 
soldiers are less anonymous. The attitude of the public toward 
the Army has begun to improve. For the time being, 
transformation has not been completed, and some soldiers from 
Moravia have to serve in Bohemia. Their number is constantly 
declining, however. In 1995, the deployment of the troops will 
allow the soldiers to serve within 100 km of their homes.

  [Correspondent] What is the education of the General Staff 
members like? 
  [Nekvasil] Currently, there are 34 graduates of former 
Soviet universities, and, of these, 14 are graduates of the 
General Staff Academy of the former USSR. Some of them are 
graduates of two schools. At present, we are not sending our 
experts to Russian schools. Nineteen people have graduated from 
foreign military academies (in the United States, France, Great 
Britain, Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, and Poland). Twenty 
are still studying there. The difference is that formerly 
people who had some languages were sent to schools abroad, while 
now we are organizing courses for people in whom we are 
interested. They are people who have the ability to command and 
the moral qualities to be useful in the Army.

<F P=106> [Article by "(km)": "Ground-Air Missiles To Be Put To Rest"] </F>
  [Text] The Army Command has proposed to the government to 
abolish the ground-based air defense of Prague, Brno, and 
Ostrava by 1995, when the transformation of the armed forces is 
expected to be completed. 
  "The Army believes that it is inefficient to constantly keep 
the so-called positional defense of objects in a state of 
alert," Vladimir Novak, commander of the Air Defense Department 
said. "This is why the Army wants to replace this defense 
system with a concept that would include the defense of 
important regions. Important regions would be designated as 
such depending on where the threat would be coming from." 
  The air defense missiles deployed in the vicinity of Prague, 
Brno, and Ostrava, which can be immediately launched at any 
time, would not be in a state of combat alert in the future. 
The Defense Ministry proposes that the air defense emergency 
system should be secured only by communication troops and 
fighter aircraft troops. 
  Air defense missiles would be put in a state of alert only 
in 
case of a military conflict. 
  Air defense is being secured by the Air Defense Brigade and 
the Air Defense Regiment--the exact deployment of which the Army 
declined to reveal--communication troops, and other units. An 
elite fighter aircraft regiment is in Ceske Budejovice, an 
independent fighter aircraft troop in Prerov, and a 
communication brigade in Klecany. The Air Defense Command is 
based in Stara Boleslav. 
  The first stage of air defense transformation began this 
year 
and will continue in the next year. Another two stages are 
planned for 1996 to 2000, and 2001 to 2005.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb forces seized 17 UN 
peacekeepers Thursday guarding a weapons stockpile at Cifluk, 19 
kilometres (12 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, UN Protection Force 
spokesman Rob Annink said. 
  The peacekeepers -- 14 Canadian peacekeeping troops and 
three 
UN military observers of unspecified nationality -- were taken 
by the Serbs to a barracks at Ilijas, Annink said. 
  Cifluk lies just inside the heavy weapons exclusion zone 
around Sarajevo ordered by the United Nations in February. 
  A French UN soldier was wounded Thursday morning by Serb 
sniper fire, UN spokesman for Sarajevo Lieutenant-Colonel 
Richard Pernod said. 
  He said the soldier was hit while manning an anti-sniper 
post 
near Vrbanja bridge on the front line not far from central 
Sarajevo. He was rushed to hospital for surgery but the 
spokesman had no details on his condition. 
  Nineteen French UN troops have been killed so far in 
ex-Yugoslavia while more than 250 have been injured, the 
spokesman said. 
  The incidents came amid heightened tension in the capital 
and 
other points in Bosnia after NATO air strikes against Serb 
attackers besieging the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde, a 
UN-declared safe area. 
  Sarajevo was rocked Wednesday by two series of explosions 
that marred a two-month old ceasefire, as Bosnian Serb strongman 
said he had "cancelled" all accords with the United Nations 
after the air strikes, saying he could no longer trust the world 
body. 
  Earlier Wednesday, Radio Sarajevo said Serb forces continued 
an offensive against Gorazde, despite an announcement Wednesday 
by Russian envoy Valeriy Churkin that he had brokered a 
ceasefire around the enclave.

<F P=106> [Hamiz Deronjic report from Brcko] </F>
  [Text] Suffering heavy losses in manpower and unable to 
break through our defense lines, the aggressor called up his air 
force for assistance this morning. At 0900 two enemy combat 
helicopters from the direction of Sumari and (?Jelina Ravan) 
attacked the defense positions in Vranovaca. After one of them 
had fired its Maljutka missiles, our antiaircraft defenses 
opened fire and the enemy helicopters were forced to withdraw. 
Then, from the direction of (?Jelina Ravan), the chetnik 
Gazelle helicopters carried out three bombing raids against the 
defense lines in Boderiste. These air raids only increased the 
tremendous pressure under which the aggressor's tanks and 
artillery have been keeping the defense lines of the free Brcko 
territory. 
  Almost 1,000 shells of all calibers have so far landed on 
the 
area of Omerbegovaca, Vranovaca, and Boderiste alone. On this 
part of the front the aggressor this morning attempted five tank 
and infantry breakthroughs. The fighters of the 108th Motorized 
Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade successfully repulsed all 
these chetnik attempts. The defense lines are unchanged. 
  During the chetnik attacks on Vranovaca, our artillery men 
targeted a strong enemy infantry unit near (Miladici) and 
destroyed the entire unit with pinpoint fire. There were some 
officers of the aggressor's army among the dozens of killed and 
wounded chetniks. Unfortunately the Serbian aggressor retaliated 
against civilian targets. The population has been warned to 
remain in their shelters by means of the general alarm, as the 
sudden and intense shelling of the free territory has been under 
way since early this morning.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following his return 
from the Muslim-held part of Sarajevo this afternoon, Vitaliy 
Churkin, special Russian envoy for former Yugoslavia, told 
journalists in Pale that in the context of an initiative for the 
overcoming of the newly created situation, he had "numerous 
contacts in Sarajevo with the relevant factors for the entire 
situation in Bosnia" [as received]. 
  We had very long and strenuous negotiations in the past 48 
hours, Churkin stated, stressing that he had traveled between 
Pale and Sarajevo three times. 
  Churkin singled out as positive the fact that the region of 
Gorazde is more peaceful. He added that he has received 
assurances from the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs that no 
offensive actions will be continued in this area. 
  In return the Serbs expect adequate confirmation by the 
other 
side, Churkin said. "Apart from that, as regards the 
continuation of fighting in other areas, what we are going to do 
and what we can do here in Sarajevo is not to talk about Gorazde 
alone, but rather about the situation in general," the Russian 
envoy said. 
  The ultimate aim of all activities is, he said, a political 
agreement, and he asssessed that there are no special 
opportunities for success unless all sides realize that without 
mutual cooperation and cooperation with the international 
community there can be no political agreement or normalization 
of relations in this area. 
  "When I say normalization, I am thinking here of the lifting 
of sanctions and the return of Yugoslavia to normal 
international life," Churkin added. He pointed out that he made 
to President Karadzic "some specific proposals which include 
placing the warring sides under control" and that "the 
implementation of these initiatives on the ground could ensure 
stability in this area."

  [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs and 
Moslems have agreed to a ceasefire around the Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin said Wednesday 
[13 April]. 
  According to the Bosnian Serb SRNA news agency, Churkin said 
after a meeting with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his 
Pale headquarters that the "accord should help lead to a general 
ceasefire between Moslems and Serbs." 
  "I received assurances from the Serb and Moslem parties that 
they did not intend to engage in offensive acts in the Gorazde 
region, where the situation seems to be calm at the moment," he 
said. 
  "I think what we have achieved in Sarajevo and what we hope 
to achieve in Gorazde must be applied across the whole of 
Bosnia," he said, declining to say whether an actual ceasefire 
document had been signed. 
  Churkin, the personal envoy of Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, has been mediating between the Bosnian Serb and Moslem 
factions and the UN Protection Force since Tuesday [12 April]. 
He had earlier met Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. 
  The latest crisis in Bosnia, sparked by a Bosnian Serb 
offensive on Gorazde, was heightened at the weekend when North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft launched two air strikes 
against the besieging forces. 
  Churkin added: "All the parties to the conflict must 
understand that political accords about Gorazde cannot be 
implemented without their cooperation with the international 
community and among themselves."

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Vitaliy Churkin, the 
Russian president's special envoy, said in Belgrade this evening 
that he received assurances from representatives of the Srpska 
republic in Pale today that they will not take any military 
actions against Gorazde, provided that the Muslims do not force 
them to do so. 
  Churkin described the newly created situation around Gorazde 
as "slightly better," but, as he said, it is still very 
dangerous. "Now is the moment to make decisions on which course 
the Bosnian peace process should follow -- toward peace or war," 
he said. 
  Speaking about his talks in Pale, Churkin said that the 
Bosnian Serbs do not pose a threat to the international 
community. 
  The Russian envoy told journalists that he presented to 
Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic and then Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic some ideas and initiatives about 
the possible continuation of peace talks on Bosnia. Churkin did 
not specify which initiatives this referred to, but said that he 
would wait in Belgrade for Karadzic's and Milosevic's reply.

regular 21-minute newscast two reports updating the fighting in 
the republic. 
  Gorazde correspondent Mustafa Kurtovic reports on the 
dramatic situation in the town and says that "the Gorazde war 
drama continues. The chetniks are (?advancing) from all 
directions toward the defenseless people on the free territory. 
Their activities are particularly fierce from the direction of 
Kozara, Nekop, Ustipraca, and the Praca River valley. The 
situation in the town is extremely dramatic. Women and children 
are exposed to terrible suffering. There is no longer any space 
for the injured in the field hospital. The chetnik hordes are 
advancing mercilessly toward the town center. We have just 
received information that [words indistinct]. (?Under the 
leadership) of the well-known criminal Dragan Kuravac, alias 
Draga, they are setting out from the direction of [name 
indistinct] and are trying to kill as many Muslims as possible 
in this area. These (?notorious) butchers have been on all the 
fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and have been dominant factors in 
genocide against the innocent Muslim people. The latest 
information from the front says that Karadzic's [word 
indistinct] are concentrating in the Praca River valley and in 
the area of Ustipraca, from where they will probably launch a 
fierce attack on the town center. As we report this, 
large-caliber shells are destroying the Gorazde commune." 
  Hamid Deronjic reports from Brcko on the situation in the 
area and says that "this morning at 0450 the aggressor 
intensified the shelling of our positions on Omerbegovaca, 
Vranovaca, and Bodriste. At the same time, movements of chetnik 
units, the so-called Panthers, was sighted. At 0630, the enemy, 
using all available weapons, launched a tank and infantry 
attack. The chetnik attack was repelled, but the fighting is 
still in progress."

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] Continuing their fierce offensive on Gorazde, the 
chetniks have since morning been launching extremely heavy 
combined artillery and infantry attacks on (Borovo) from the 
direction of Ustipraca, and on the right bank of the Drina River 
from the direction of Cajnice. The aggressor has deployed very 
strong forces, reinforced with newly arrived units from the 
Uzice Corps, the Herzegovina Corps, and the Sarajevo-Mt. 
Romanija Corps, and special units from Nis, which are equipped 
with the most state-of-the-art weapons and the most lethal ones, 
too. 
  The information from these areas indicates that extremely 
heavy fighting is under way. The chetnik attacks on these 
defense lines are continuing. The aggressor is pounding every 
inch of these areas with mortars of the heaviest caliber. The 
fighters of the Eastern Bosnia Operative Group of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, the unrelenting defenders of Gorazde, 
are withholding all the attacks by these insane killers [word 
indistinct] to enter Gorazde as soon as possible. 
  There is total chaos in the clinic and the Gorazde war 
hospital. Screams, cries, and the wailing of children. Several 
people have been killed today by shells that have landed on the 
town. The exact number is still unknown, but the deaths of 
three children and two women have been confirmed. Dozens of 
civilians have also been wounded, three of them children and one 
woman very seriously. 
  The chetniks are shelling the surrounding villages, but we 
have no information about the casualties from these areas. 
During the day the aggressor has also intensified attacks on 
all the other defense lines. The chetniks are simultaneously 
reinforcing their forces, and concentrating them from the 
direction of Foca, (Medici), and the Praca River valley . 
  The general alarm has been in force in Gorazde since this 
morning owing to the shelling of the residential areas in the 
region. The Gorazde defenders are putting up strong resistance 
to the aggressor despite the inadequacy of their weapons.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 13 April carries in its 
regular 10-minute newscast three reports on the continued 
fighting in the republic. 
  Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "the 
chetniks 
are still at the access points to Gorazde. They have fiercely 
begun the 17th day of their offensive on Gorazde by firing all 
available weapons on residential areas and defense lines. Last 
night and overnight, the situation was particularly dramatic in 
the village of Vitkovici. Attempts to kill the local population

The chetniks are shelling the population of (?Basnjak),

butchering, fascist rampage, the chetniks yesterday set ablaze 
the villages of Kucine and Zmijuki and massacred the women and 
children. We have no information on the number of slaughtered 
and imprisoned. The number of villages that have been burned in 
this offensive alone has climbed to 30, while casualties and 
refugees amount to several thousand." 
  Mirza Sadikovic, correspondent from Bihac, says that 
"Karadzic's terrorists overnight continued to attack the Bihac 
commune. Buzim, (?Plavas), [name indistinct], and other 
villages in the area continue to be the target of artillery 
attacks. The aggressor also fired at the positions of the 
defenders on this part of the Bosanksa Krupa front and on the 
Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez. Several times the 
chetniks attempted infantry breakthroughs in these areas, but 
they were decisively repelled. The members of the paramilitary 
forces of the Kladusa traitors also continued their activity. 
They attacked in the areas of Todorovo, Pecingrad, Skokovi, and 
[name indistinct] with chetnik [word indistinct] and artillery 
support. Overnight, the chetniks also shelled the Bihac and 
Cazin areas [words indistinct]." 
  Olovo correspondent Amira Salibasic reports on an extremely 
poor line and says that "the night was somewhat calmer on the 
Olovo front. However, the defense lines are still the target of 
destructive howitzer, mortar, and tank shells."

  [Text] Cajnice, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- Early this morning, 
Muslim forces launched fresh offensive actions on the Gorazde 
battlefront, and according to a communique issued by the command 
of the Herzegovina corps, the fiercest attacks on Serb positions 
are coming from Gradina and Jartiste, five kilometers from 
Gorazde on the left bank of the Drina river. 
  Infantry attacks are being supported by artillery fire from 
the very center of the town next to the facilities with Red 
Cross and UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] markings. Fighting is 
in progress along the entire frontline on the right bank of the 
Drina river. 
  Chaos has descended on all bridges in the town. Strong 
Muslim forces are crossing to the right bank of the Drina, while 
the population is hurrying to cross to the other bank in fear of 
a general disarray within the Muslim troops and a counterattack 
by the Serb army as happened several days ago. Not even the 
strong police force that was deployed in Gorazde for this 
eventuality can secure order in the town. 
  Shooting can be heard in Gorazde itself this morning. It is 
presumed that the Muslim police are shooting at deserters who 
did not heed the mobilization call ups. 
  There are no details about possible casualties on either 
side 
in today's fighting. 
  The command of the Herzegovina corps links such behavior by 
the Gorazde Muslims with the increase in the number of NATO 
flights over the Herzegovina corps positions. These two things 
have already become a rule on the Gorazde battlefront, Serb 
military sources say.

  [Text] Bratunac, April 13 (TANJUG)--Moslem forces from 
Gorazde on Wednesday continued artillery and infantry attacks on 
Bosnian Serb Army positions, the military sources of the army of 
the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS) have said. 
  The U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) commander for Bosnia, 
British General Michael Rose, on Tuesday said that the Gorazde 
Moslems are continuing unprovoked attacks on the Bosnian Serb 
army. 
  U.S. NATO jets on April 10-11 bombed Bosnian Serb positions 
near Gorazde, a U.N.-designated safe area which should have been 
demilitarized. 
  Instead, this Moslem enclave served as the startingpoint for 
a 10,000-strong Moslem offensive on Serb territories in late 
March. 
  At the same time, in northern Bosnia seven civilians were on 
Wednesday wounded seriously and four only slightly in a Moslem 
mortar attack on the city of Doboj, the Bosnian Serb military 
sources said. 
  The Moslems mounted artillery and mortar attacks on the 
Bosnian Serb army in the region of Mount Ozren, close to 
Gradiska, Orasje and Novigrad (northern Bosnia), Srbobran and 
Olovo (central Bosnia), Bihac (western Bosnia) and in the region 
of Mt. Majevica (northeast Bosnia). 
  In the Sarajevo area, the Bosnian Serb army repelled a 
strong 
Moslem infantry attack, while infantry fire was opened from the 
Moslem-controlled part of Sarajevo on the Serb parts of the 
city, it is said. 
  All these attacks are a part of a Moslem offensive on almost 
all parts of RS with the aim of seizing as much as possible 
territories before a final political solution is reached.

  [Text] Doboj, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces on 
Wednesday continued attacks on Serb defence positions and 
settlements on all parts of the front in the region of Doboj in 
the north of the Serb republic (S.R.) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Bosnian Serb army sources said. 
  The command of the first Krajina corps of the S.R. army said 
on Wednesday evening that Serb defenders in the area of Teslic 
some 20 kilometres south-west of Doboj had repulsed an attack 
there and forced the enemy troops to return to their earlier 
positions. 
  The Moslems continued to bring in fresh troops from the 
direction of Zenica and deploy them close to Serb positions in 
the southern and south-eastern part of the Teslic front, the 
command said. 
  After daily defeats and major losses in manpower and 
weaponry 
along all lines of contact in the area of Ozren and Vozuca, 
Moslem fighters vented their anger by opening infantry and 
artillery fire on Serb civilian settlements. 
  Apart from major damage, there were no civilian casualties, 
the S.R. army command said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- "We are ready for a 
peace process but we are not ready to accept as negotiators 
those who ordered the bombing of the Serb positions," Srpska 
republic president Radovan Karadzic said ahead of talks with 
David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the 
conference on Yugoslavia. He stressed that the Serb side would 
choose who will be the mediators in peace negotiations. 
  "The European Union was completely pushed out of the 
resolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict after Washington 
launched its diplomatic initiative," Karadzic. He added that now 
"a new crisis has been created in which the United States can be 
proclaimed a warring faction." 
  "This may be the moment for the European Union to return to 
the political scene in search of solutions to the current 
conflicts in Bosnia," the Srpska republic president said.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following his tour 
yesterday of the Bosnian Serb Army positions on the Gorazde 
battlefront and areas devastated by NATO air strikes, Vojislav 
Seselj, chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, met with Serb 
President Radovan Karadzic in Pale this afternoon. 
  Following that meeting, Seselj told journalists that NATO 
air 
strikes against Serb positions have greatly complicated the 
situation on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina, since 
the air strikes against Serb positions mean NATO has sided with 
the Muslims. 
  The leader of the Serbian Radical Party added that this made 
NATO one of the warring sides, and as a result, it will have to 
bear all the consequences. The United Nations, by siding with 
the Muslims, has also lost its elementary objectivity. 
  "They can no longer be mediators in this conflict. In this 
way they have lost a lot -- not the Serbs. The morale of the 
Serb fighters, in my opinion, has never been better than now," 
Seselj stressed. 
  He added these air strikes have shown the war cannot be won 
from the air and that the Serbs cannot be defeated in this way.

  [Text] Belgrade, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic 
president Radovan Karadzic expressed the hope today that "a 
positive turn in UN behavior is still possible," if bombing and 
other enemy acts against the Serbs stop immediately. 
  "If this does not take place there is not a nation in the 
world that will accept the presence of UN forces on its 
territory," Karadzic said in a letter sent to UN Secretary 
General Butrus-Ghali. 
  "After this bombing, which can only be explained as 
involvement in the civil war on the Muslim side, our relations 
cannot be the same as before," the letter sent after NATO's 
second air attack on Serb positions near Gorazde says. 
  Reminding Butrus-Ghali that he himself said on one occasion 
that the "safe areas" were Muslim army strongholds, Karadzic 
cites the international law on war, according to which "safe 
areas" should be demilitarized and in which only the armed 
presence of a third side, in this case UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces], is allowed. 
  "Muslims are constantly killing us from their `safe areas', 
protected by your soldiers, and they have launched a major 
offensive from Gorazde against the Serbs," Karadzic stresses. 
  He stresses that UNPROFOR has placed itself completely on 
the 
Muslim side and bombed Serb civilian and military targets at a 
time when the Serbs are offering a cease-fire and the Muslim 
side is rejecting this. 
  Karadzic says that there have been many irregularities in 
UNPROFOR's behavior in the two years of war. Its members have 
engaged in illegal trading, they have smuggled arms and 
ammunition to the Muslims, and they have openly given them 
military assistance in terms of reconnaissance and other actions. 
  Despite this, the attitude of the Serbs toward the UN 
authorities has been exceptional during this entire time, 
Karadzic says, adding: "There have not been any serious 
incidents, while the other side has killed dozens of your 
soldiers." 
  "The most recent UNPROFOR command in Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
utterly damaged these relations, while its bombing has destroyed 
the last remnants of respect for your armed forces here," 
Karadzic stresses. 
  "You will understand that we can no longer cooperate with 
this command of yours that ordered the bombings. You will also 
understand our greater caution regarding the movement of members 
of UNPROFOR and the equipment being transported by them. All 
the agreements and good relations until now, which arose out of 
trust, have been wiped out, and we must monitor the behavior of 
UNPROFOR as a potential hostile force." 
  "I hope, Your Excellency, that a positive turnabout in the 
behavior of the United Nations is still possible. Of course, 
this implies that the bombings and other hostile acts against 
the Serbs must stop immediately," Karadzic concludes in his 
letter to Butrus-Ghali.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Following a Gorazde 
attack, NATO had already made plans to attack Bosnian Serb 
command posts, bridges on the Drina (eastern Bosnia), supply 
routes and even Pale, the administrative centre of the Bosnian 
Serb republic (S.R.), said Obrad Kesic, an expert on Balkan 
policy, who is close to Washington circles. 
  Speaking for the Belgrade evening paper VECERNJE NOVOSTI on 
Wednesday, Kesic said that a very powerful group of anti-Serb 
inclined Washington officials, having realized that Washington's 
peace initiative for Bosnia-Herzegovina had collapsed and 
fearing the reaction of the public opinion and media, were 
plotting to continue the aggression against the Bosnian Serbs. 
  He said that the group, which had already made plans of 
attacks on Bosnian Serbs, was headed by Anthony Lake, President 
Clinton's national security advisor, and added that it was 
especially influenced by Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador 
to the United Nations. 
  Kesic said that the world power wielders had gone so far now 
that they had to launch airstrikes to prove their effectiveness. 
They were now, however, trying to find a way out of the 
horrible situation they had created themselves, knowing that if 
they backed up now the media would tear them apart. Kesic said 
that a continued aggression against the Serbs was very likely, 
which is supported by the fact that plans to that effect had 
already been made. 
  The bombardment of Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde is 
a 
hot issue in Washington because the U.S. public initially backs 
U.S. military actions, but as soon as problems arise, it turns 
to fierce criticisms, Kesic said in conclusion. 
  U.N.-sponsored American warplanes within 24 hours (on Sunday 
and Monday) launched two air raids on Bosnian Serb positions 
around Gorazde (a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia), just as the 
Serb forces were about to crush a Moslem offensive, launched 
from Gorazde, a U.N.-designated "safe area", which should have 
been demilitarized back in 1993. 
  The anti-Serb lobby in Washington is preparing fresh attacks 
on the Bosnian Serb republic because it has realized that, after 
the failure of the U.S. peace initiative, Russia would become 
more engaged in helping settle the Yugoslav crisis and Europe 
would urge that the peace initiative for the former Yugoslavia 
be returned to Geneva.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Assembly 
President Momcilo Krajisnik said on Wednesday that Bosnian Serbs 
would leave the doors open to talks, but not with U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. Michael Rose, and others who have 
abused their position. 
  "We are particulary angry at Mr. Rose because we believe 
that 
he played an emperor and called the NATO pact without any cause. 
Why didn't he call NATO when Moslem shelled Serb positions on 
Tuesday," Krajisnik told Belgrade's television network Politika. 
  "In any case, Mr. Rose has ended his role in our battlefield 
and he must be removed from these regions," Krajisnik said. 
  NATO-assigned U.S. warplanes on Sunday and Monday bombed 
Serb 
positions around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde after Serbs 
crushed a Moslem offensive begun from this U.N.-protected area 
in late March. 
  Gen. Rose requested the NATO air strikes allegedly to 
protect 
the U.N. peace troops in Gorazde, although there were only five 
U.N. observers and seven British special SAS troops there, who 
guided the NATO planes to Serb positions. 
  The Bosnian Serb authorities suspended relations with the 
UNPROFOR, including the civilian sector, after the first NATO 
air strike on Sunday, assessing that the U.N. peace troops had 
openly sided with Bosnian Moslems. 
  Krajisnik also said that the Serb side was doing its best to 
answer the NATO attacks. 
  "When the NATO pact bombs us that is one evil, but it is a 
double evil if we attack NATO and if we answer (its attacks)," 
Krajisnik said, assessing that the bombing had brought harm to 
the Serb people, but that its effects had remained inside the 
borders within which it pays to be patient in the interest of 
peace. 
  "If we openly started resisting the NATO pact, downing their 
planes, and this will probably follow if they try to continue 
attacks on Serb positions, then there will be neither peace nor 
delimitation and many plans would fail that way," Krajisnik 
said.

  [Text] The Republic of Turkey is the first country to open 
an embassy in the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At today's 
modest ceremony, Sukru Tufan, Turkish ambassador to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, unveiled the sign on the embassy building, 
thus officially opening the embassy and marking the beginning of 
its work. 
  Ambassador Tufan spoke about the friendly attitude of his 
country toward Bosnia-Herzegovina and the insistence of Ankara 
on the implementation of all the UN Security Council resolutions 
concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina. By sending in its armed forces, 
Turkey will be directly participating in the establishment of 
peace in our country. It is obliged to do so by both the deep 
roots and the links between our cultures and traditions. Thus 
the link between these two friendly and close countries is 
natural. 
  Turkey will continue to (rally) all the international forces 
in order to reach a just settlement to the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible, Ambassador Tufan said. 
  Another ceremony will be held this afternoon to mark the 
opening of the Turkish embassy in Sarajevo.

  [Text] Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of 
the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, arrived in Sarajevo 
today. They held talks with President Izetbegovic and Prime 
Minister Silajdzic in the presidency building. 
  Addressing correspondents after the talks, President 
Izetbegovic said the main topics touched upon were Gorazde, 
Sarajevo, Mostar, the possibilities for a cease-fire, and the 
continuation of the peace process. We presented our well-known 
stands, President Izetbegovic said. This implies the withdrawal 
of the (?enemy) forces to the positions held before 30 March. 
Only then could we return to the negotiating table. We accept 
the cessation of all military activities for a limited period of 
time. This would create conditions for the continuation of 
negotiations, President Izetbegovic said. 
  Lord Owen told correspondents that most of the time was 
spent 
discussing Gorazde. He also stressed that he was interested in 
changes in Sarajevo, where there is no more shelling. However, 
this is still a closed city, Lord Owen stressed. We are going 
to Pale from here. We will try to find more understanding there 
for the issues that we are discussing. We are here to try to 
put the peace process on the right track, Lord Owen said at end 
of the news conference.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Robert Hochner; Silajdzic in Sarajevo, Hochner in Vienna -- 
live; Silajdzic statements in English with simultaneous German 
translation] 
  [Text] [Hochner] In the studio in Sarajevo I now welcome 
Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of Bosnia. Good evening, 
Mr. Prime Minister. 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, hello. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, over the past hours we have 
heard reports that shooting has broken out in Sarajevo again. 
Do you fear that the cease-fire, which is not even two months 
old, may crumble in your capital? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, for the first time in a month we have had 
shooting again, 10 to 12 shells came into Sarajevo. Of course, 
this is something that worries us very much, but we have 
expected it after the weak, limited UN warning to the Serbs, the 
aggressors, in Gorazde. In my view, they were encouraged by the 
half-hearted UN mission in Gorazde, a mission that was also 
delayed, because for 15 days people were being killed and 
attacked there, and when the UN and NATO finally intervened, 
this was too limited really to give them a clear message. 
  [Hochner] What is the situation like in Gorazde today, as 
far as you know? Is the town in danger of being taken by the 
Serbs? 
  [Silajdzic] Of course, there is always such a danger. As 
you know, we do not have any weapons, we do not have any 
ammunition, and the people in Gorazde.... [sentence incomplete 
as heard] About 200 people have died since the beginning of the 
attacks; 720 people have been injured, some of them are in 
danger of losing their lives, of course. The situation is not 
good at all. As I said, I think that the Serbs feel encouraged 
by all that they have been able to achieve with the 
international community. I do not think that this course of 
action was productive for the peace process, because the warning 
was not strong enough. 
  [Hochner] Russia's envoy to Bosnia, Churkin, said this 
evening that the Serbs have promised him to agree to a 
cease-fire. Do you know anything about this agreement, and do 
you believe that such a cease-fire can be achieved in your 
country through Russian mediation? 
  [Silajdzic] Permit me to say here that we are -- at least I 
am -- greatly frustrated by this very late Russian initiative, 
which is coming now toward the end to set a diplomatic sign. 
Where were they 15 days ago, or seven days ago, or just three 
days ago, when people were dying like flies and the Serbs were 
shelling not only civilians but also attacking UN troops? 
  We say that it was a mistake to carry out these air raids. 
[German sentence as heard] It was said that the Russians were 
not consulted. I think it was a grave mistake to let them take 
all these diplomatic steps whenever they want to. I think one 
should adopt a clear position and those who committed this crime 
should be punished. We are now practically the hostages of a 
geopolitical situation, in which one has to consult the Russians 
regarding all details. People are being killed -- and the 
attackers should be punished for that. A withdrawal must take 
place, and as long as such a withdrawal does not take place, we 
will not hold talks. If they withdraw behind the line from 
where the attack started, then the peace process may continue. 
  Let me add one thing, they are now holding 58 UNPROFOR 
observers hostage. They have stopped all the humanitarian 
convoys. That behavior belongs to the Stone Age. In the end, 
we will probably have to talk to them, make concessions to them, 
go to Geneva again or somewhere else, where speeches are made 
then about how the Serbs became victims because of the UN and 
NATO troops. I believe that this farce should stop. They are 
fascist criminals and they must be punished. 
  [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for this 
interview. Good evening to Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic by Zdravka Soldic; place and date not given: "It Has 
Not Been Agreed That Zubak Will Be the Head of the Federation!"] 
  [Text] In Sarajevo, Mr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is mentioned in the context of being the 
future president of the federation in which the Bosniak-Muslims 
and Croats will make up the majority. Silajdzic is also 
interesting as a protagonist of the Washington agreement, while 
we were particularly interested in the attitude of the 
Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina toward the Serbian issue in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and its settlement, as well as toward the 
question whether the new Yugoslavia that has been much talked 
about in the recent days is possible. 
  In Sarajevo, Silajdzic is considered to be a politician 
inclined to the West, although he studied theology in Libya. He 
is esteemed by the more moderate Sarajevans, but he does not 
enjoy the support of the Islamic community. 
  [Soldic] Mr. Silajdzic, since the Constitution of the 
federation was signed in Washington, the name of Kresimir Zubak, 
chairman of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna, is being 
mentioned as that of a candidate for the new president of the 
Bosnian-Croatian federation. It is claimed that was agreed in 
Washington. However, in Sarajevo, I hear that it is you who is 
expected to be the president of the federation. 
<H5>  The Media Have Brought About a Lot of Evil </H5>
  [Silajdzic] Who will be the president of the federation was 
not agreed in Washington. What was agreed is to be found in the 
text of the Constitution. There were discussions on that topic, 
but no agreements. On this occasion I have to say that the 
media are heating up the situation unnecessarily, and that is 
not good. The media have already brought about a lot of evil, 
and as though they cannot get enough, they seem to be craving 
for some more victims. Nothing has been agreed, and if they do 
not believe this, let them ask the representatives of the 
Croatian people, and they will confirm that. If the issue had 
been agreed upon, I would have said so. 
  [Soldic] According to the new Constitution, the Presidency 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina continues its work in the same team, while 
it is the president and the vice-president of the federation who 
will be elected. Does that presuppose the parallelism of 
administration? Does the Constitution clearly say what the 
particular authorities of those two bodies are? How are those 
two bodies going to function? 
  [Silajdzic] The Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina remains. 
The federation with the Bosniak and Croatian majority is a 
single federal unit. The parallelism of administration is 
inevitable. We could not leave the federation without 
authorizations that are quite necessary. However, if there is 
no good will, everything that has been written, everything that 
has been established in detail, for instance, that there are no 
parallelisms, nothing will be implemented. We wanted to agree 
because we wanted that, rather than because somebody forced us 
to agree. Other factors helped us to articulate the will 
expressed, to surmount difficulties in very difficult 
conditions. We are certainly most thankful and indebted to the 
United States for all that. 
  [Soldic] REUTER has reported that President Izetbegovic is 
expected to resign within the next month. 
  [Silajdzic] I do not know whether REUTER has reported, and I 
also do not know whether Izetbegovic intends to resign, so the 
best thing would be to ask him personally. 
  [Soldic] The president of the Presidency, Mr. Izetbegovic, 
has been reelected as chairman of the Party of Democratic 
Action. Can we take that fact as an indicator that Izetbegovic 
still intends to relinquish his presidential office to somebody 
else? 
  [Silajdzic] The president has taken up the chairmanship of 
the party again, and as for his staying in or leaving the office 
of the president of the Presidency, as I have already pointed 
out, you should ask him. I am not familiar with that. 
  [Soldic] The elections for the federation bodies, as well as 
the general elections on the level of cantons, have been 
announced to take place in six months. How do you intend to 
conduct the elections when it is well-known that a large part of 
the population has been displaced, while many people are abroad 
as refugees? 
  [Silajdzic] The first task, the most difficult and basic 
one, is to ensure the return of the refugees to their homes. 
That is the basic precondition for everything. We shall work on 
that. I do not know how successful we shall be in it. Again, 
everything depends on good will. One must have a lot of 
patience and understanding for the people who really suffered so 
much. The level of organization must be very high, everything 
must be planned and controlled. The people are quite irritable, 
one will have to take care not to provoke new clashes. All of 
them have awful experiences, wounds that only time will heal. 
  [Soldic] If the refugees and the displaced do not return to 
their homes in the next six months, will that obstruct the 
elections? 
  [Silajdzic] Look, we do not know what will happen in the 
next six months. We shall be making efforts to ensure the 
return of as many refugees as possible to their homes. I do not 
consider myself to be an expert in the field, but I think that 
we shall not be able to have all the refugees back in their 
homes. Still, I think it is necessary to find a solution, to 
organize the civil authorities there, because the refugees will 
not be able to return to their homes if the local authorities 
are not functioning there. 
<H5>  Criminals Will Not Be Forgiven </H5>
  [Soldic] At the assembly there was much talk about war 
crimes having been committed by both parties. How do you 
comment on the statement by Nijaz Durakovic: "In order to 
preserve a marriage of interest, witnesses and a good deal of 
wedding guests have to be replaced"? 
  [Silajdzic] I am not accustomed to commenting on other 
people's statements. You should ask Durakovic what he meant by 
that. 
  [Soldic] What do you think about war crimes that both sides 
committed in the conflict? Is that question going to be 
discussed particularly, or has it been made ad acta by the 
agreement on the federation, and forgotten? 
  [Silajdzic] My attitude, the attitude of this government, is 
that war criminals must not be forgiven. There must be no 
dilemmas about that issue, nor does anybody have a right to 
pardon any of them. 
  [Soldic] In this particular case, will it be the 
international institutions that will determine what is a crime 
and what is not? 
  [Silajdzic] I am not a judge. The international 
institutions will certainly be involved, though. Nobody has a 
right to pardon a crime. 
  [Soldic] President Tudjman recently talked about the 
accountability that the Croatian and Muslim sides share for the 
conflict. The president expressed himself in percentages, 
saying that the responsibility of the Croatian side for the 
breakout of the conflict amounts to 30 percent, while the Muslim 
share amounts to 70 percent. Do you agree with President 
Tudjman's estimate? 
  [Silajdzic] I think that one cannot speak about that in such 
a way. We deal here with the relations among the living people, 
and there is no place there for mathematics. Those whose job 
will be to determine the accountability for the conflict, will 
estimate that. However, I think that even now everything is 
clear, and if somebody still has any doubts about what happened, 
he or she should ask the international community. 
  [Soldic] Why did it take so much time, or precisely a year 
and a half, for the agreement to be signed as late as now, as if 
nothing had happened? Could the course of events have been 
avoided? 
  [Silajdzic] It could not have been avoided. Because, for 
love and peace two parties are needed, while for a conflict a 
single one will do. It was about an option that involved quite 
definite plans. It is known who triggered the conflict and 
where. So, everything is clear. 
  [Soldic] Who triggered the conflict and where? 
  [Silajdzic] I believe that is clear to anybody who wants to 
know. Unfortunately, those people succeeded in generating such 
an unnatural conflict. Why do I say unnatural? Because the 
Bosniaks and Croats lived for centuries not only in peace, but 
also in real friendship. Therefore, whose interest was supposed 
to be satisfied by that conflict? What was the goal? The goal 
was the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From this fact you can 
draw all other conclusions. 
  [Soldic] Right now, the establishment of the joint 
commander of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] is being worked on. Are you satisfied 
with the dynamics of the talks? 
  [Silajdzic] I know that the talks are going well. Generals 
Roso and Delic are working together. As far as I am concerned, 
the results achieved so far go beyond my expectations. I hope 
they will continue that way. I cannot tell you the details, so 
you should ask them. 
  [Soldic] What is your attitude toward the incident in the 
Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina involving Miro Lazovic and 
Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the government of Herceg-Bosna? 
  [Silajdzic] Lazovic explained later that his behavior was 
not right. It was he who caused the incident, so he himself 
accounted for it later. 
  [Soldic] Can there be the federation without the 
confederation? The officials of Herceg-Bosna say that if the 
issue of confederation were to be called into question, then the 
issue of federation would be also called into question. 
  [Silajdzic] First of all, why should the issue of 
confederation be called into question? I do not understand 
that. We have to get used to viewing the things positively, and 
not always negatively. The war has brought about a terrible 
thing: Everybody is looking for trickery, wherever it is 
possible. Confederation is a model of cooperation between two 
sovereign countries, which is what both sides need. Thereby a 
model of very close economic cooperation is developed, which is 
necessary for the circulation of people, goods.... In this 
confederation, the two sovereign states supplement each other. 
There are much more reasons for the confederation to exist, 
rather than not to exist. The confederation, of course, must 
not encroach upon each country's sovereignty, and I do not 
understand why that confederation should not exist. 
  [Soldic] What was agreed upon in Washington, is the 
federation conditioned by the confederation? 
  [Silajdzic] No, it is not conditioned, but is a matter of 
interest. The confederation was not agreed upon because the 
statesmen wanted it, but rather because it is in the interests 
of the people, and if the people do no want it, then it will not 
come about. 
<H5>  Serbs Cannot "Take Out" Territory </H5>
  [Soldic] Are you familiar with the U.S. intentions regarding 
the Serbian side in Bosnia-Herzegovina? Will the Americans 
press the Serbs to join the federation, or will they let them to 
take out a part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Silajdzic] The United States cannot allow somebody to take 
out a part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, nor can 
anybody else allow that. Bosnia-Herzegovina remains within its 
borders, just like Croatia. The internal reorganization of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is its internal affair. With regard to the 
fact that the Serbian assembly has definitely rejected the 
federation, it will most probably come to the creation of a 
federal unit in Bosnia- Herzegovina, with the Serb population 
making up the majority. One should know that the U.S. interest 
is the cessation of the war in this region. They have many 
other problems to deal with. From their point of view, all this 
costs a lot of money, it is dangerous, and brings about some 
unprecedented things that they cannot allow, because remedying 
the consequences would cost much more than their current 
engagement. Which is to say, changing the borders is 
unacceptable, while genocide cannot be rewarded. It is true 
that the U.S. initiative has come about quite late, but better 
late than never. 
  [Soldic] If Karadzic's Serbs were to condition their joining 
the federation by demanding confederation with Serbia, what 
would the Government of Bosnia-Herzegovina do in that case? 
  [Silajdzic] Undoubtedly, some affiliation between the 
Bosnian Serbs and Serbia will come about. What that affiliation 
will be like remains to be seen. In my opinion it is normal for 
Serbs to have some connection with Serbia. I personally have 
nothing against it. If we want peace, then let it be so! 
  [Soldic] Is that a creation of a new Yugoslavia? 
  [Silajdzic] No, a new Yugoslavia is out of the question. 
That is the past. Any of these states have to have their 
sovereignty, while they will associate with one another to a 
degree acceptable to each of them. 
  [Soldic] Do you think that, after everything that has 
happened, the authorities will be able to function if Karadzic's 
Serbs accept the federation? I remember the pre-war meetings of 
the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at which, thanks to the 
Serbs, it was impossible to make any decision, because they 
found nothing convenient enough for them. 
  [Silajdzic] The authorities will have to function. We 
cannot stop life. It is just like water, it always finds its 
way through. The fact is that Karadzic and his aides have 
largely mislead the people, they have a mighty propaganda, or 
rather the way of spreading lies, but we are obtaining different 
information from the field. Foreign journalists go there, in 
their territory. We hear from them that people are fed up with 
everything, they ask themselves what the purpose of it all is. 
Pressure from above is necessary to crush the existing regime, 
or else that will be achieved by some other methods. 
<H5>  Sarajevo as A Civilizational Achievement </H5>
  [Soldic] We can say that the opinions about the role of the 
Russians in settling the crisis in the Balkans are disparate. 
Some people feel that Russians are working for greater Serbia, 
while the others believe that the Americans are using Russians 
to put the pressure on Serbs. 
  [Silajdzic] Again, we have a black-white projection. The 
things are different in reality, though. The Russians are doing 
things for Serbs, that is unquestionable, but they are also 
working together with the Americans. It is certain that many 
things are solved between Washington and Moscow. Given such a 
situation, we are making efforts to protect our interests. We 
cannot influence the presence of Moscow in the region. The very 
statement by Churkin, saying that Sarajevo will be divided, is 
making us suspicious about whether, perhaps, the new, democratic 
Russia stands for fascism, whether Moscow intends to build new 
Berlin Walls. Is such a wall supposed to be erected in Sarajevo, 
which is a model of multicultural, multiethnic life? Regardless 
of whether some will like it or not, that is a fact. Sarajevo is 
undoubtedly a civilizational achievement that should be 
cultivated, rather than destroyed. In this town there are many 
layers of civilization sediments that are proof that people are 
capable of living together.

<F P=106> [Statement by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency adviser Kemal </F>
Muftic in Sarajevo on 12 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] The statement by General Rose has caused justified 
dilemmas among our (population). According to his statement, 
which carries critical undertones, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
shelled the forces of the Serb aggressor near Gorazde. 
Unfortunately, and as you will see from this statement, we have 
many reasons to doubt the reliability of the sources of 
information used by General Rose. General Rose also failed to 
explain whether our forces merely responded to an attack, that 
is, fired in self-defense, or in order to defend civilians as 
they have a duty to. 
  The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] have obviously still not 
undertaken adequate measures to prevent the advances of 
Karadzic's forces in Gorazde, and effectively to protect the 
lives of innocent people. Some 20 days ago we warned of the 
grouping of the aggressor's forces [words indistinct]. The safe 
haven of Gorazde was soon afterward attacked with enormous 
forces [words indistinct] of Karadzic's Serbs. Every day we 
reported on the heavy shelling of the town and the aggressor's 
advances into the safe haven. UNPROFOR consistently denied our 
reports. Finally when the situation really got out of hand, the 
UNPROFOR Command decided to launch air strikes of limited 
intensity against the forces of the attacker. However, the mere 
selectiveness and limits of the strikes seemed to encourage the 
enemy. The invasion of Gorazde has continued. Yesterday alone 
the aggressor's shells killed at least 23 civilians and wounded 
many others. 
  We are ready for a cease-fire, and not only around Gorazde 
but on the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on condition 
that it is followed by the withdrawal of the Serbian invasion 
forces from the protected area of Gorazde, and that it does not 
predispose the final political solution. In no event will we 
agree to the current situation being frozen, which would 
perpetuate the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Because of the great differences between the information 
provided by UNPROFOR officials and our own reports, that is, 
reports by doctors and others who are in Gorazde at the moment, 
we believe that it is necessary for General Rose and a team of 
reporters to go to Gorazde as soon as possible in order to 
dispel any dilemmas when it comes to obvious things. We are 
ready to join General Rose on that trip. We also believe that 
UNPROFOR [word indistinct] and in accordance with the UN 
resolutions is obliged to provide the delivery of humanitarian 
aid to the many civilians in Gorazde, as the reserves of 
medicine and food in the town are depleted.

  [Text] All Muslim-Bosniak prisoners in Mostar's Heliodrom 
prison, except two, today ended their hunger strike. 
  At his first news conference today Vlado Sojic, new defense 
minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, said, I quote, 
that he feels like a minister of peace rather than war as he was 
appointed at the time of the Washington agreement. Asked 
whether the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was over he nevertheless 
said: 
  [Begin Sojic recording] Unfortunately, the war is not over. 
[end recording] 
  Of course, Sojic said, the Croat side will continue to do 
everything, just as it has been doing hitherto, to achieve peace 
through negotiations. He then called on his fighters to be 
patient enough until a final peace, given the fact that they 
have managed to save Croat territories and the Croat population. 
Replying to a question as to who started the war and whether 
the Croats are the losers, Sojic says: 
  [Begin Sojic recording] The Croats did not start the war, 
nor 
are they the losers. As to what extent they are the winners, 
one can speculate in various ways. [end recording] 
  Minister Sojic also added that the Croats had so far always 
accepted every peace agreement, ranging from the Cutillero 
agreement to this latest Redman one. Asked whether the Croats 
and Muslim can live together after so much bloodshed, Sojic says: 
  [Begin Sojic recording] The, shall I say, memories of the 
war 
with the Muslims are still fresh, so it is hard to talk about 
coexistence, particularly so where there has been fighting, but 
I nevertheless believe that Croats and Muslims can live in a 
common state if it is organized in a democratic way and secures 
the national rights of all peoples. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has replied to the letter from 
Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia, of 11 
April. We are carrying the letter in full: 
  Esteemed Mr. President, 
  I fully agree with you and support your stand on the urgent 
release of all detained Bosnian from Mostar's camps, and of all 
HVO [Croatian Defense Council] soldiers from Zenica and Travnik 
military prisons. In this respect we had previously made the 
necessary decisions and issued the necessary orders. The 
exchange of prisoners would have already been completed had it 
not been for the stand of the HVO's Commission for Prisoners' 
Exchange which is incomprehensible to us. Namely, this 
commission insists that four persons -- found to have committed 
crimes against civilians -- be included in the exchange. No 
country in the world can pardon such crimes, whichever 
nationality commits them. You are certainly aware of the fact 
that last year in Sarajevo a group of our soldiers was given 
long-term prison sentences for murdering two Croats, and that 
another trial is under way of the persons suspected of killing 
Franciscan priests in the military monastery [as heard]. To 
leave these crimes unpunished will shake the foundations of the 
law and security that our country -- despite everything -- 
managed to preserve. 
  I conclude from your letter that you were not acquainted 
with 
these facts and I, therefore, beg you to do everything in your 
power to end the suffering of 340 people imprisoned in Mostar, 
Zenica, and Travnik and ensure that their fate is not linked 
with the fate of the four persons accused of war crimes. 
  Esteemed Mr. President, I assure you that the people and 
government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic are very keen to 
wipe out all disagreements between Croats and Bosnians. The 
last two months of peace have clearly confirmed that these two 
nations are capable of building a joint state and rebuilding the 
kind of life they enjoyed over the past five centuries, before 
the recent unnecessary and mutually destructive clashes had 
started. 
  In this spirit, I am expecting your visit to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, convinced that it will strongly encourage 
the restoration of trust between our peoples and countries. 
  I beg you to accept the expressions of my respect.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>
  [Text] New York, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Under NATO's 
"umbrella" and with the United Nations' "moral" blessing, the 
United States again dropped bombs on Serbs on April 10 and 11, 
raiding Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde in the southeast of 
the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Americans did it for the first time in World War II, 
precisely on Orthodox Easter in April 1944, when they bombed 
towns of their Serbian allies, including Belgrade, in order to 
allegedly destroy facilities of the German army. 
  This time they did it while Croats in the U.S. were 
"democratically" celebrating in their clubs and churches 
throughout the U.S. April 10 -- the day when the Nazi puppet 
independent state of Croatia was created under Hitler's 
patronage in World War II. 
  If one adds to this the fact that the world has recognized 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent state on April 6, 1991, at 
the 50th anniversary of the German bombing of Belgrade, it is 
hard to resist the impression that someone has deliberately been 
playing with historical dates. 
  It is impossible at this point to foresee the consequences 
of 
the NATO (i.e. U.S.) raid on Serb positions in Bosnia but this 
heinous act should be a signal for the Serbs to sober up and 
give up their illusions about "the country of brave and free," 
as the Americans like to think of themselves. 
  What they did near Gorazde is a cowardly act of 
power-wielders manipulated by the flickering images on the TV 
screen who have lost the ability to form judgement under the 
loads of money offered by Moslem, Croatian, Jewish and who knows 
whose else lobbies. 
  Giving the "green light" for air strikes on Bosnian Serbs, 
the U.N. and its secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali waded 
even deeper into the moral swamp from which they can hardly be 
expected to walk out clean. 
  Butrus-Ghali's spokesman Joe Sills said on Monday that the 
real objective of the air attack had been to protect the Moslem 
enclave of Gorazde while protection of U.N. monitors had been 
only "a moral framework" for the action. In other words, it was 
a false excuse. 
  Even Butru-Ghali himself clearly indicated in a report to 
the 
U.N. Security Council that Moslems had used the U.N.-declared 
"safe havens" for training and resting of their troops and for 
armed provocations against Serb positions. 
  The U.N. Secretary-General's Adviser Chinemaya Garrehan and 
current Chairman of the U.N. Security Council Colin Keating last 
week also confirmed that the fighting around Gorazde had been 
initiated by Moslem forces. 
  All these facts, however, were completely forgotten under 
the 
pressure of U.S. and NATO hawks, who were eager to drop bombs on 
Serbs and thus force them to bow to unacceptable conditions for 
peace. 
  All things considered, the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
commander, British General Michael Rose, who has proved himself 
highly sensitive to his media image, seems to have played the 
most dishonest role because he requested air strikes despite the 
fact that he had previously given 48 hours to the Moslem and 
Serb sides to think again about possibilities for reaching a 
comprehensive peace accord. 
  Such an accord has been proposed by the Serb side, and 
rejected by the Moslem, but even that fact has been hidden from 
the public at East River. 
  After the air strikes on Serbs, Washington can expect new 
Moslem provocations and terrorist actions in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
because crime is obviously worth their trouble. 
  Even Bosnian Moslem Deputy Prime Minister Ejup Ganic made 
hints in that direction when he told the U.N. Security Council 
on Monday that Moslems would not negotiate unless Serbs withdrew 
from their positions around Gorazde to the positions they held 
on March 30. 
  He called for new air strikes -- including the blowing up of 
bridges, roads and lines of supply in the Bosnian Serb 
territories -- in order to force the Serbs to agree to a peace 
solution fashioned to fit the interests of the Moslems and the 
West.

<F P=106> [Article by Milos Vasic, Filip Svarm, Isabelle Lasserre, </F>
Paja Rovic, and Pepi Orlov: "War and Trade: Private Initiative"] 
  [Text] What is the connection between the downing of 
four airplanes over Bosnia and the price of a pack of cigarettes 
in Tesanj, Gojko Susak's fortune, poker gambling machines from 
Banja Luka, and oil for transformers? Is the Krajina blood money 
earned in western Bosnia the backing for the solid dinar? How 
are 10 television sets smuggled with the help of a wounded man? 
You can find the answers to all these--and other--questions in 
this article. 
  Why are wars even waged? There are two theories about that: 
the romantic one and the realistic one. The romantic 
interpretation cites "historic rights," "living space," 
"national dignity," and "the state is more important than 
bread." The realists do not believe all this, but they have 
nothing against it: They expect wars to begin, and sometimes 
they even help the process along (depending on investments that 
have been made and the pace at which money turns over). Wars are 
able to turn into business at a surprising speed, and romantics 
are not skilled in business dealings. They are there to perish 
heroically or afterwards, as cripples, to marvel at the fact 
that they have nothing while the realists are getting rich. For 
example, there is a well-reasoned theory to the effect that the 
war in Laos (1960-75) was not waged against communist 
aggressors, but was instead about achieving a monopoly over the 
opium trade. 
  In order to turn war into successful business, there must be 
authorities who--by their very nature--impose obligations and 
restrictions that generally do not suit their subjects. The 
foundation of ruling authority lies in romantic, ideological 
presumptions, but miraculously there are usually realists among 
those in power. For example, authorities introduce various 
measures for patriotic reasons: universal military conscription, 
a prohibition on the misappropriation of weapons and military 
equipment, restrictions on the movement and activities of 
citizens of other nationalities, a prohibition on cooperation 
with the enemy, and similar expected and seemingly normal 
things. However, you cannot eat patriotism, and it is not noted 
for generating profits (except in some cases, to be discussed 
later). All the noted prohibitions and commands, it turns out, 
are transformable into quantities of German marks [DM], which 
depend primarily on the laws of the market. In a nutshell, this 
means: Whoever pays is exempt. The conditions for this 
transformation were created very quickly in the 1990 Balkan 
wars. Specifically, the belligerent Serb lands, the republic of 
Serbian Krajina [RSK] and the republic of Srpska, are very poor. 
Under the normal conditions of the old Yugoslavia, they survived 
exclusively as part of an economic and market entity and with 
state support for underdeveloped areas (aside from two or three 
regional exceptions). Both states made it through the first 
phase of the war with the help of mother Serbia and through 
plunder. However, as the Vikings discovered in their day, the 
plunder economy has one major shortcoming--something can be 
pillaged only once. That phase is now complete, which is 
reflected in the increasingly poor state of public security in 
these lands: Plunder has become a normal affair, so that now 
some people need to be reeducated, because they have gotten used 
to it; they have used up the effects of others and moved on to 
their own people. This is a critical period of history: Now, it 
is necessary to move on to some more organized, institutional 
form of business. 
<H5>  Market Laws </H5>
  The first and traditional economic resource is the 
population 
and its elementary needs for survival: food, clothing, alcohol, 
cigarettes. Whoever establishes a monopoly over satisfying these 
vital needs is the winner. For example, a certain Zeljko Holman 
of Zenica has become the main supplier of food to that large 
city; half of the total supply has passed through his hands 
since the war began. He founded the HOS [Croatian Defense 
Force], put together a team of 30 people who never saw the 
front, declared himself a general (although he has a sixth-grade 
education), and started up the Zagreb-Zenica trade, which lasted 
until Easter 1993. That was when the cooperation between Croats 
and Bosnians ended; someone else wanted control over the food, 
Holman was arrested, and allegedly they are still beating him at 
the Zenica Culture and Education Center to find out where the 
money is. Serb brothers have also turned a good profit in 
Zenica: There are two brothers who had an exclusive monopoly 
over cigarettes and Cerali tractor-trailer trucks for months. A 
pack went for DM10 retail. Incidentally, a record in these wars 
was registered in 1993 in central Bosnia: A carton of Marlboros 
cost DM500. 
  This is a case of the unbending natural law of supply and 
demand. In Zenica, the prices at the illegal market in Gluva 
Bukovica, at the foot of Mt. Vlasic, where Serbs and Muslims 
trade were as follows in January 1994: white flour--DM20; a 
liter of cooking oil--DM20; a kilogram of meat--DM15; a liter of 
brandy--DM10, and so forth. In other places (primarily in 
central Bosnia), there are more luxurious items available: A 
gram of cocaine costs DM300 (DM150 in Belgrade); a gram of 
"domestic" grass DM10-12 (Belgrade: DM3-5). All of these 
transactions are the result of private initiative by individuals 
and a free black market where there is no competition. The 
profit margins are great, but do not even approach those 
realized on the state level. Because it can block free trade 
through administrative hurdles, the state is beginning to charge 
for freedom of trade. As long as the end buyer pays the state 
racket and as long as the dealer can endure the reduced profit 
margin, the state is financially stable. 
  State revenues from taxes, rackets, its own 
black-marketeering, and the exploitation of natural resources 
(sometimes suicidal--as in "Hadzic's barricades") can hardly 
cover the costs of extended warfare. After all, war is a costly 
pastime, and if it does not bring some sort of benefit or a 
stable peace quickly, the state is in trouble. For example, 
soldiers of the republic of Srpska are already publicly 
grumbling that Serbia charges them "a high price for every 
bullet and shell"; for months now, the armed forces of the RSK 
have received payments of food and basic necessities in kind 
instead of actual wages. The events in Banja Luka in September 
1993 are the best illustration of the crisis in the republic of 
Srpska: Reservists rioted because their families were starving 
(and they, in the trenches, were too), while dealers and 
swindlers were growing nice and rich. Dr. Radovan Karadzic put 
down the rebellion, while promising protection to "business 
people," on whom--as he put it--"the future depends." Patriotism 
is patriotism, but money is money.... 
  Because of all this, all the warring states in the Balkans 
are forced to enter into certain transactions that are 
completely understandable to realists, while among romantics 
they elicit confusion that sometimes borders on despair. 
<H5>  One Hand Washes the Other </H5>
  Transactions between states also depend on supply and 
demand: 
who has something and who needs it. Thus, the Bosnians have 
people but no weapons; the Serbs have weapons but are short on 
people; the Croats, with both people and weapons, are somewhere 
in-between, but they have tactical and strategic problems. These 
things vary from region to region, just as tactical interests 
vary. Because of that, we have seen all possible alliances 
between two parties against a third. This began back during the 
war in Croatia, when the Bosnian police of Alija Delimustafic 
cooperated fraternally with the JNA [Yugoslav People's Army]; 
then the JNA fraternally armed the just-established HVO 
[Croatian Defense Council] in Kiseljak; then the Bosnians and 
Croats fraternally clobbered the Serbs, the Serbs and Muslims 
clobbered the Croats (Herzegovina, Kupres), and the Serbs and 
Croats seriously united against the Bosnians (although they 
regularly supplied ammunition to them in Herzegovina), all the 
way up to several days ago, when yet another Croat-Bosnian pact 
was signed. 
  The best reflection of this in practice can be found in 
central Bosnia, i.e., the Kiseljak-Kresevo front. This began in 
the summer of 1992 with the renting of artillery to HVO forces 
(with or without crews and ammunition); it continued through the 
renting of tactical services (artillery support), and concluded 
with the sale of major weapon systems and ammunition. At one 
point in 1993, the Serbs sold the HVO one T-55 tank, one "Praga" 
(a two-barrel 30-mm antiair gun on a tank chassis), and 2.5 
million rounds of various ammunition for a sum that was later 
disputed. Specifically, the HVO contends that it paid DM4.5 
million, while the Serbs contend that they received DM4 million; 
one Serb source says that he believes the Croats and wonders 
where the half a million marks went. 
<H5>  Case of Bihac </H5>
  It is not only the Serbs and Croats who are doing business. 
The example of Cazin Krajina and Fikret Abdic's autonomous 
province of western Bosnia [APZB] shows that local tactical 
circumstances result in realistic alliances. As Miroslav 
Lazanski writes in his new biweekly ARGUMENT, there is fierce 
fighting around Bihac between units of the 5th Corps of the Army 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina under the command of Atif Dudakovic and 
Fikret Abdic's forces, which include Serbs. "The probable goal 
of operations by the Serb army and Fikret Abdic's forces in this 
region is... to break out to the banks of the Una River, 
whereupon this region would be territorially divided between the 
republic of Srpska and the autonomous province of western 
Bosnia." VREME has learned from independent sources in the field 
around Bihac and from our special reporter who stayed in Bihac 
that at least since the end of 1993, entire military units of 
the Serb armed forces of Krajina [SVK] and of the MUP [Ministry 
of Internal Affairs] of Krajina have been fighting for Fikret 
Abdic. Legend has it that Babo asked his friend from Bijeljina, 
Zeljko Raznatovic, whether he could take Bihac for him; when he 
heard that Arkan was demanding DM8 million, Babo reportedly 
concluded that for that amount of money he could take Bihac 
himself, and he turned to Captain Dragan. The bulk of the aid 
from the RSK is provided by the people of Capt. Dragan 
Vasiljkovic from his "Alpha" training center, while the rest is 
filled in by SVK soldiers and special units of the MUP of 
Krajina. It appears that authorities in Serbia are familiar with 
the entire operation, because weapons and equipment are 
allegedly received through them. The people fighting in the APZB 
are listed in Serbia as being on leave. The operation is 
organized on-site in Velika Kladusa by a certain major with the 
SVK. The going rate for this fighting is as follows: DM2,000 for 
five to seven days of action; DM1,000 for one day of 
reconnaissance inside enemy territory; DM200 for a prisoner; 
special rewards for each occupied town (DM1,000-2,000 per 
person). Renting fire support and other services costs the 
following: DM50 for each day at the RSK military hospital in 
Vojnic; DM50,000 per day for three T-55 tanks with crews; 
DM50,000 per day for a battery (six pieces) of 122-mm howitzers 
plus DM1,000 for each fired shell if the artillery is on APZB 
territory, but if it is fired from Serb territory, then only the 
ammunition (between DM1,000 and DM3,000, depending on the type 
of ammunition); one day of antitank support from a "Gazela Gama" 
helicopter costs DM100,000. 
  VREME's reporter in Bihac says that "Gazela" helicopters 
fired on the towns of Srbinje and Sokolac during her stay there 
(in early March), and also reports continuous artillery fire 
against Bihac from the Grabez and Golubic plateau. French 
Colonel Legrillet of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] has 
confirmed this activity. The 5th Corps of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina presented an ultimatum to Abdic to surrender 
by 10 February, or else it would move on Kladusa; four days 
before the ultimatum ran out, the Serb offensive against Bihac 
and the forces of the 5th Corps began, so that the pressure was 
taken off of Abdic. At the same time--interestingly 
enough--UNPROFOR headquarters in Zagreb was systematically 
ignoring and downplaying events on the Bihac front (the 
situation is normal, an occasional mortar shell here and 
there...). 
  Where does Fikret Abdic get the money to pay for all these 
services and goods? It has long been known that Abdic imports 
from Croatia into the APZB much more food, fuel, and other goods 
than the local population needs. Also, a large part of the 
"Agrokomerc" capital has been successfully turned over abroad 
(purchasing arms for Croatia), while it is felt in Zagreb that a 
large part of the capital of the powerful Herzegovinan war-mafia 
lobby is moving by way of Babo and his friend Alija 
Delimustafic. Thus, Babo is buying for the Serbs what they need 
and charging them both in cash (trade) and in services 
(warfare). At present, this suits the Croats in tactical terms; 
UNPROFOR has closed its eyes (and that costs money), while 
Serbia is making a political point out of Fikret Abdic: He is a 
model of exemplary "coexistence" and ethnic tolerance.... 
<H5>  Sad Ending </H5>
  However, everything changes if the Washington Bosnian-Croat 
agreement by some chance goes into effect. In that case, two 
important players in the Balkans become superfluous, or even 
detrimental: Fikret Abdic and Gojko Susak. If the Bosnians and 
Croats actually, sincerely enter into a new alliance, without 
the usual back-stabbing (as has happened many times in the 
past), Abdic is left all alone: The Croats do not need him, and 
he is left without oil and food, and in that case the 5th Corps 
quickly grows stronger; nor do the Serbs need him any more, 
because he has neither money nor goods. If the Croats have 
really decided in favor of an alliance with the Bosnians, it 
will not work, nor will anyone believe them, as long as several 
Herzegovinan political figures are a visible presence at Jelacic 
Square. Gojko Susak sensed this immediately, given the fact that 
two weeks ago he started grumbling about "swallowing a bitter 
pill": The Serbs say that "he has a bee in his bonnet," i.e., 
that thought is being given to him. Specifically, Dr. Tudjman 
was wrong to enter the war in Bosnia at Herzegovinan insistence, 
and the entire adventure went awry. Now he must acknowledge that 
he made a mistake; someone must pay for this, and Dr. Tudjman 
would rather not be that someone. The list of other candidates 
is not a long one.... 
  Here we arrive at one interesting political speculation of a 
completely hypothetical nature, although it is quite reasonable. 
In the event of a successful Bosnian-Croat alliance, it is not 
only Abdic and Susak who are superfluous and detrimental; the 
logic of Realpolitik says that Mile Martic will also not be as 
desirable as he is today. He has the least money, and in that 
case his state is the most threatened; in any attempt to abandon 
Krajina to Croatia (because in that case defending its 
sovereignty would be too costly), Martic is superfluous. The 
same is true of Herceg-Bosna; Mate Boban is already on thin ice 
in Zagreb, even though he still holds real power. 
  When all of the above is considered, we arrive at a natural 
junction of interests: Who is most interested in undermining and 
subverting the Washington accord? Susak, Boban, Martic, Palama, 
and Abdic, more or less in that order. If that is true--and it 
appears to be--then nothing is impossible, especially since 
everything has already happened in the past. It is known that 
the RSK air force has already conducted combat missions in 
Bosnia (bombing and helicopter support) for the VRS [armed 
forces of the republic of Srpska], but also for the HVO and APZB 
forces, for monetary compensation. Relations between the RSK and 
UNPROFOR are so poor that neither side was interested in 
insisting on this: UNPROFOR would not know what to say (it is 
tied up anyway), while the RSK would have to explain why its 
airplanes are flying over Bosnia but did not fly against the 
Croats during the offensive at Medacki Dzep. The very fact that 
all sides continue to refuse to take responsibility for the 
bombing of Novi Travnik and Bugojno and for the four ill-fated 
airplanes is clearly disturbing here; the romantics have 
perished, while the realists are not foolish enough to 
acknowledge it. It is unknown whether the Herzegovinans paid for 
it while Serbs from the two states did the flying in order to 
subvert the Bosnian-Croat alliance, but it will be learned 
sooner or later. 
<H5>  Catch-22 </H5>
  No war is pretty, on the contrary. However, these wars of 
ours have managed in record time to degenerate into cynical 
business dealings and ordinary plunder as the main motives. 
Since the motives and interests of all sides are similar (which 
is not to say identical), mutual understanding is somehow 
inevitable: If the momentary ally is in trouble, we will sell 
him a pack of cigarettes for DM10, or a tank, shells, and so 
forth for the price that he is able to pay. Thus, the "Border 
94" campaign in the republic of Srpska revealed that there is a 
great deal of trade going on with "the enemy" (tanks, 
ammunition, weapons, vital strategic materials). Everyone aims 
at transformer stations (which are repaired by UNPROFOR) because 
a lot is earned on oil for transformers; wounded Serbs being 
treated in Serbia have the right to a television set, so that as 
many as 10 plundered television sets are smuggled in for each 
wounded person and his permit. Strategic installations of the 
military industry, such as "Kosmos-Cajavec" in Banja Luka, 
produce electronics for poker gambling machines--a serious 
business that yields serious money (and heads roll because of 
those machines, too) supplying the significant Eastern European 
market. 
  Avramovic's solid dinar has been introduced in the republic 
of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina (20 million have 
been issued); if each dinar is backed by foreign exchange--and 
Martic and Karadzic swear that such backing exists--then where 
are the marks coming from? Certainly not from the economy and 
exports. What remains is rentals of personnel and military 
technology, money from the Herzegovinan political lobby, the 
remainders of the pillaged stashes of money and [trange-frange] 
with Serbia (importing food and vital necessities and sucking 
foreign exchange out of the populace). Who is whose "enemy" now? 
The answer is offered in the classic study of all 
warfare--Catch-22, by Joseph Heller. There, Milo 
Minderbinder offers an interpretation of why he has agreed with 
the Americans that they first bomb an overpass, and also agreed 
with the Germans to defend it. "The Germans are not our enemies. 
True, we are at war with them, but Germans are prominent members 
of our syndicate, and I must protect their rights...." Later 
Milo agrees with the Germans to bomb his own air base, because 
he has run out of cash. A scandal results, the newspapers 
bluster, mothers of recruits protest (which we know something 
about), but Milo has the impeccable logic of a war realist: "In 
a democratic state, the people are the government. And are we 
not a people? So why should we not hold on to our money and 
eliminate the middle-men? Quite frankly, I would like most of 
all for the governments to give up war and turn this entire 
field over to private initiative." If war has become the only 
branch of the economy that can turn a profit--why not?

  [Text] Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle took part in the 
Radio Villa Opicina contact program last night, answering 
questions on relations between Slovenia and Italy and analyzing 
the political situation in our country. Here is a short report 
by Andrej Pirkovic: 
  [Begin Pirkovic recording] When asked whether 
Slovene-Italian relations could be complicated with the possible 
appointment of the new Italian Prime Minister Designate 
Berlusconi, Minister Peterle replied that one should first wait 
for the official stance of the new government. He is convinced 
that it would not be in Italy's interests to strain the mutual 
relations. 
  We shall see it as an act of goodwill, Peterle said, if 
relations will develop the way we want them to, which is 
something we have been striving for all the time. In his words, 
Slovenia will insist on the observation of the legal bases that 
have already been laid and here the Osimo agreements are a fact 
that cannot be negated. He assessed positively the work of the 
negotiating teams for the update of the Osimo agreements. 
  The fact is that Slovenia and Italy need each other in this 
region and that this is the only way in which we can envisage 
the realization of the plans for Trieste and the border 
provinces. 
  Regarding Slovenia's integration into the European Union, 
Foreign Minister Peterle stated resolutely that we would not 
tolerate any possible Italian blackmail. 
  Asked about the protection of the Slovene minority in Italy, 
he replied that our state will continue to take care of the 
Slovene minority and demand the observation of the European 
standards by Italy. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] Following the dismissal of Defense 
Minister Janez Jansa on 28 March, his Social Democratic Party of 
Slovenia [SDSS] left the governing coalition, raising the 
prospect of a political crisis in Slovenia. Prime Minister Janez 
Drnovsek tried to discount this possibility in an interview 
published by the Brussels LE SOIR on 31 March. In response to a 
question about the governing coalition (comprised of Drnovsek's 
Liberal Democrats [LDS], the Christian Democrats [SDK], the 
United List of Social Democrats [ZLSD], and Jansa's Social 
Democrats) now being "threatened" by Jansa's removal, Drnovsek 
said that his party was prepared to rule with the Christian 
Democrats alone, because "above all, the entire country first 
needs continuity and stability." Drnovsek minimized the 
possibility that other parties would demand a new election, 
saying he was convinced that the LDS, his own party, would 
emerge with a majority if "elections were held today." 
  According to 31 March Ljubljana Radio reports, the LDS 
discussed future relations with its coalition partners at a 
closed meeting in which Drnovsek remarked that the coalition 
agreement would probably have to be "redefined." The SKD, led by 
Foreign Minister Lojze Peterle, discussed two possibilities: 
immediate departure from the government or continued 
cooperation. The SKD leaders decided to remain, stating that in 
"times of political crisis" the cooperation of the two parties 
was necessary to establish a "new political balance," and 
recommending to Drnovsek that the ZLSD, a coalition of leftist 
parties, leave the government. 
  A commentary in the 28 March issue of the right-of-center 
Ljubljana daily SLOVENEC strongly criticized Jansa's removal, 
characterizing it as "a putsch" organized by the leftist forces, 
and predicted further polarization of the Slovene political 
scene--the strengthening of the right-wing opposition parties in 
their fight against "corruption and neocommunism" on one side 
and attempts by the leftist parties to "restore old political 
structures" in all spheres of public life on the other. 
  The liberal Ljubljana daily DNEVNIK of 28 March expressed 
concern about the impact of Jansa's dismissal on the military 
readiness of the armed forces, emphasizing that the army must 
remain depoliticized. Indicating that there might be further 
personnel changes in the Defense Ministry and in the armed 
forces, the paper says that military personnel "carry the 
largest burden" and must prove that "the army serves the country 
and does not take part in politics in this critical political 
situation." In this context, DNEVNIK sees Colonel General Albin 
Gutman, the armed forces commander, having a "special 
responsibility," because it depends largely on him how much 
impact political developments might have on his subordinates. 
  On 29 March Ljubljana Radio reported that the State Chamber 
of the Slovene Assembly had confirmed Jansa's removal as defense 
minister by a vote of 49 in favor and 39 opposed and approved 
Jelko Kacin, Prime Minister Drnovsek's choice to replace him, by 
a vote of 48 to 39. In an interview published in DNEVNIK on 25 
March, nominee Kacin stated that "recent events" had damaged the 
reputation of the military, which must try to restore its 
positive image. He said that as defense minister he would strive 
to restructure Slovenia's Territorial Defense Force into a 
modern army composed of highly trained personnel and equipped 
with sophisticated technology. His goal, he added, was to create 
a "depoliticized, professional" army whose members would be 
sought as specialists in the civilian economy when their 
military careers were concluded. 
  DNEVNIK's 28 March prediction of further personnel changes 
appears to have been borne out by Kacin's replacement of Anton 
Krkovic, commander of the "Moris" 1st Special Brigade, with 
Vojko Pavlin, former head of the School for Noncommissioned 
Officers, reported in the 31 March issue of SLOVENEC. According 
to the 29 March issue of Ljubljana MLADINA, a pro-LDS weekly, 
"special" units are subordinate directly to the defense minister 
rather than to the armed forces' chain of command.

  [Text] Knin, 13 Apr (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, the president 
of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], sent a letter today to 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander General Bertrand de 
Lapresle expressing his surprise after being informed of 
UNPROFOR's intentions to deploy UN troops along the state border 
between the RSK and the Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia 
[APWB]. 
  Such a deployment, Martic says in his letter, is absolutely 
unacceptable and out of the question for us. The same goes for 
other RSK borders except those along demarcation lines with the 
Republic of Croatia, in accordance with the Zagreb agreement. 
  Reminding UNPROFOR Commander de Lapresle that he was one of 
the signatories of the Zagreb cease-fire agreement, in his 
letter Martic also points out: The governments of the RSK and 
the APWB have signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation; 
there have been no incidents in the border area and there is no 
need for your presence in this area, Martic says in conclusion.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Excerpt] Knin, April 11 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) Milan Martic said the R.S.K. 
accepted talks with Croatia on economic relations, but on an 
equal footing. 
  After talking with U.S. Zagreb Ambassador Peter Galbraith 
Monday [11 April], he assessed that the plan for economic 
cooperation of the international community, that is, the 
conference on former Yugoslavia and Croatia offered contained 
[as received] a number of elements with which the R.S.K. agreed 
and with which it could agree. 
  At the beginning of the talk with Galbraith, Martic issued a 
strong protest to the U.S. Government and U.S. President Bill 
Clinton because of, as he put it, "unprecedented bombing of Serb 
positions" around Gorazde in southeastern Bosnia. 
  This act of force did not contribute to peace and must not 
be 
repeated, said Martic, recalling the mutual commitments of the 
R.S.K. and the Srpska republic (R.S.) on joint defense. 
  Galbraith told newsmen NATO action around Gorazde was 
justified and that the U.S. has responded to commitments to the 
allies in NATO, the international community and the U.N. 
  The U.S. NATO planes bombed Sunday and Monday (April 10 and 
11) positions of the Srpska army near Gorazde, a Moslem enclave 
and U.N.-declared safe area, which should have been 
demilitarized last spring. 
  Galbraith stated satisfaction with the talk on Monday and 
stressed he expected complicated talks between the 
representatives of the R.S.K. and Croatia and believed in its 
success if both sides, as he said, showed flexibility. The 
R.S.K.-Croatia accord on cessation of hostilities, signed on 
March 30 at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, was being implemented 
successfully. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and </F>
minister of foreign affairs, by unidentified announcer; from the 
"Slikom na sliku" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Mr. Granic good evening. 
  [Granic] Good evening. 
  [Announcer] You have returned from Greece where you had 
talks 
with Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias. 
According to news agency reports, you obtained support for the 
peaceful reintegration of the occupied areas. A visit by 
European Union [EU] ministers to Knin has been announced. What 
does this mean in concrete terms? 
  [Granic] Greece supports the territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia and the resumption of 
talks with the local Serbs. In this it sees a chance for the 
final normalization of Croatian-Serb and Zagreb-Belgrade 
relations. I put forward a proposal that a European troika 
should visit Knin, and as Greece currently holds the EU 
presidency, Mr. Papoulias accepted this, and he will join peace 
efforts to continue the peace process. Greece has a great 
interest in the normalization of Croatian-Serb relations and in 
this respect it will do everything it can. 
  [Announcer] Today you also discussed Croatia's admission to 
Partnership for Peace, aid for reconstruction, and its 
membership of international political and financial 
institutions. What would you single out as particularly 
important from these talks? 
  [Granic] A very interesting thing is that totally identical 
support was given both by Greece and Turkey as regards the 
demands of the Republic of Croatia toward the European Union, 
both in connection with an agreement on cooperation with the 
European Union, aid for the reconstruction of the Republic of 
Croatia, and its admission to certain concrete projects, such as 
the PHARE [Poland-Hungary -- Actions for Economic Reconversion] 
project. We also discussed Partnership for Peace and Croatia's 
admission to it. Both countries lent their strong support for 
this. 
  [Announcer] You returned from an official visit to Greece 
and 
Turkey, two countries having strong links with events in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in Croatia. How much were the talks 
determined by this current Turkish support for the Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Greek closeness to Belgrade? 
  [Granic] It is indisputable that Turkey has a significant 
influence over the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a very 
positive one. Throughout the entire war it has been a positive 
influence. We have always had very good and excellent contacts 
with Turkey, in the course of the entire past period, and 
naturally, especially now. 
  On the other hand, Greece has good relations with Belgrade, 
Greece wants a final normalization of Croatian-Serb relations. 
We do not see any obstacles to the positive development of 
relations both with Turkey and Greece. 
  [Announcer] Greece was one of the rare countries that 
condemned the latest NATO air strikes around Gorazde. There is 
a demand for a cease-fire and the resumption of negotiations 
between the Croatian- Bosniak federation and the Serbs. How did 
they assess the latest developments, particularly NATO air 
strikes on Gorazde? 
  [Granic] Well, we discussed that, of course. Greece believes 
that nothing that would prevent the process of negotiations 
should be carried out. I pointed to the fact that this was, 
nevertheless, an aggression on Gorazde launched by the Bosnian 
Serbs, and that NATO had reacted in a legal and legitimate way. 
However, we agreed that it was of primary importance to halt 
all conflicts, achieve a cease-fire, and organize negotiations 
between the Bosnian Serbs and the [Croat-Muslim] federation. 
  [Announcer] How do you view the latest developments? I know 
you have just returned from Greece, but as you are here I am 
availing myself of the opportunity to ask you, the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is again being complicated. News has come 
about a fresh violation of the cease-fire in Sarajevo. It seems 
that shooting has again started there, that the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is restarting. 
  [Granic] The Bosnian Serbs' reactions have been edgy. But, 
still, the Serbs were surprised by the NATO action. They had 
not believed it would take place. There are considerable 
differences among the Serbs themselves in their approaches. 
This was discussed today in talks with Minister Papoulias. 
Greece is ready to do everything to achieve a cease-fire and 
for negotiations to start. 
  I would like to point to one more thing: Croatia's 
reputation in both Greece and Turkey, and particularly President 
Tudjman's reputation. It is interesting that both countries 
emphasized this, both ministers, especially President Demirel 
who said that Turkey has always maintained good relations with 
Croatia, particularly after the Washington agreement was signed. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Granic, thank you very much for finding time 
to be a guest in our Slikom na sliku program. 
  [Granic] Thank you.

  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, has returned to Zagreb following a 
visit to Greece today and Turkey yesterday. In Athens he had 
talks with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias. After the 
talks both ministers concluded that it is possible to extend 
cooperation between the two countries. Andjelko Perincic 
reports on Minister Granic's visit to Athens: 
  [Perincic] Ministers Granic and Papoulias agreed that 
interstate treaties on industry, traffic, protection of 
investments, and the prevention of double taxation would soon be 
signed, and that business transactions should begin immediately. 
  At the meeting the two delegations also discussed military 
cooperation, Croatian-Greek cooperation in the sphere of 
security in southeast Europe and in the Mediterranean, and 
international military cooperation within the United Nations. 
Croatia obtained Greek support for its admission to NATO's 
Partnership for Peace. In this regard, Greece wants the same 
kind of friendship with Croatia as with all other countries of 
former Yugoslavia, it was said. 
  The Greek hosts also supported Croatia's efforts to 
reintegrate occupied Croatian areas in a peaceful way, adding, 
as Minister Papoulias himself stated at a news conference, that 
peace in that area and in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be a basis 
for peace in the entire region. Papoulias said that fighting 
should be halted in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is endangering 
peace processes, and that negotiations in which Serbs should 
also be included ought to be initiated. 
  As regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, Minister Granic stated for 
Croatian Radio: 
  [Begin Granic recording] Our joint conclusion is that a 
cease-fire agreement, and after that, the inclusion of the third 
party, the Serb party, into negotiations with the federation [of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina] are the most important things at the moment. 
Greece ought to take an even more active part, as the European 
Union [EU] chairman, in the peace process, the process of 
negotiations, together with the United States and the Russian 
Federation. [end recording] 
  [Perincic] The talks in Athens were also useful because 
Greece is currently the EU chairman. Therefore, its support for 
Croatia to join the EU PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for 
Poland and Hungary] program is not insignificant. Greece lends 
its support to Croatia for other forms of cooperation with the 
European Union and for our efforts to obtain aid from the IMF, 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other 
international financial institutions for the reconstruction of 
our country.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, chairman of the Chamber of </F>
Representatives of the Croatian Assembly, by Heni Erceg; place 
and date not given: "Stalinism Is Being Restored in Croatia"] 
  [Text] [Erceg] Did you expect that in one moment it is 
precisely Josip Manolic who would become an item on the agenda 
of your party's Council? 
  [Mesic] The Council of the Croatian Democratic Community 
[HDZ], just like the leadership of any other party, can and must 
discuss all problems in foreign and domestic policy. And it is 
not strange at all that the Council analyzed some of Manolic's 
performances. However, the debate did not give a single 
indication that the exclusion or punishment of Manolic might be 
demanded. Only three members demanded that Manolic be excluded. 
Everything else was within the limits of a principled debate. 
  [Erceg] Who are those three members? 
  [Mesic] Antun Vrdoljak, Ivan Milas, and Ivic Pasalic. At 
the end, President Tudjman concluded that the Manolic case 
should still be brought up in the Court of Honor. Even that 
could be accepted as a part of the democratic procedure, and a 
right of the party's chairman to make such a decision. 
  [Erceg] What was the debate at the meeting of the Council 
like? Did you support Manolic's attitudes? 
  [Mesic] I referred in my speech to the attitude that the 
issue of Bosnia was a difficulty for both the great powers and 
the European Community, but now, when we have the Washington 
agreement, everybody has to take the consequences for his or her 
earlier policy, and that is it. When the president demanded 
that Manolic go to the Court of Honor, I thought that would be 
the end of the issue. Moreover, President Tudjman invited us all 
to a lunch. I did not join them for the lunch, because a 
meeting of the Assembly was to start at the same time. And then 
everything, which is so far away from any democracy, started. 
<H5>  Lunch at Tudjman's </H5>
  [Ercog] When did you realize that the invitation to the 
lunch was actually an invitation to something completely 
different? 
  [Mesic] At the time when Manolic and I reached the Assembly, 
the action of his removal from the office of chairman of the 
Chamber of Counties was already going on, despite the conclusion 
of the Council that the Court of Honor was supposed to meet only 
later! When we arrived at the Assembly, we heard that some 
signatures were being collected, and who was collecting them. 
  [Ercog] Who was collecting them? 
  [Mesic] Vrdoljak and Milas were engaged from the beginning, 
and then Pasalic and Jure Radic joined them. The issue is about 
an action that reminds me of a sort of enlightened bolshevism, 
and I cannot accept that. For it means that, while we were 
sitting in the Council, somebody sent a message that the action 
should start. 
  [Ercog] Somebody means President Tudjman, does not it? 
  [Mesic] I do not know that, but if he had been against it, 
he could have stopped it. He still can stop it, and call to 
account those who took to themselves a right to ignore the Court 
of Honor. Of course, the question is raised how that group in 
the Assembly came to know what the HDZ Council had decided, 
since there are no letters, written statements.... This means 
that an underground connection provided the information, and all 
that has nothing to do with democracy. 
  [Ercog] It is being claimed that 36 signatures have been 
collected against Manolic. 
  [Mesic] Which method did they use to obtain those 
signatures? Who charged them with doing that, and on whose 
behalf? The Council did not make such a decision, while the HDZ 
club is not the place where the policy of the party is designed. 
Everything that was done is illegal, and somebody has to take 
the consequences for that! 
  [Ercog] Do you share the opinion that there is a 
parliamentary crisis in Croatia? 
  [Mesic] Basically yes, although it does not necessarily have 
to continue, unless it is insisted upon. The cause of the 
crisis is to be found in the fact that the internal conflict in 
one party has reflected itself in the work of the parliament. 
Of course, that may cause a deeper parliamentary crisis. 
Because, look, a meeting of the Assembly has been announced for 
Thursday, but prior to the meeting we have to get the approval 
from the Chamber of Counties with regard to certain laws. If 
the Chamber of Counties fails to meet, or its work is blocked 
again, then neither will the Chamber of Representatives be able 
to function, and the entire work of the parliament will be 
called into question. 
<H5>  Early Elections? </H5>
  [Ercog] In that case, will early elections possibly be taken 
into consideration? 
  [Mesic] If the crisis continues, early elections will be 
inevitable. 
  [Ercog] Milas persistently maintains that the majority of 
the parliamentarians lost their confidence in Manolic a long 
time ago. 
  [Mesic] Everybody has a right to struggle for his or her 
opinion, and to disagree with Manolic's opinion. A right of the 
parliamentarians is also to say and undertake whatever actions 
they want, but regardful of the Assembly procedure. However, we 
have reached the stage where a university professor is used, 
namely Smiljko Sokolj, who publicly, in front of the TV 
audience, does not speak the truth, who misconstrues the essence 
of the dispute. I am a jurist as well, and I have checked out 
the document that the group demanding the removal of Manolic 
brandished all over the place. All that is stated there is a 
demand, written in a commanding manner, that a commission should 
be called, while everything else are illegible signatures. 
Civility, rather than law, demands that it should be written as 
follows: We would appreciate it if a meeting of the Commission 
were to be called... we propose that the following issue be put 
on the agenda... and also that the deputies who make that demand 
should put their signatures next to their typed names, so it can 
be seen that those are authentic signatures. We are not living 
in a dictatorship, for God's sake.... Instead, scandalous 
violence has been applied that discloses the uniformity of 
opinions. I said already 100 times that I shall never accept to 
put up with the uniformity of opinions again, and now it is 
being imposed on me again. And when I only think about who is 
doing that.... 
  [Ercog] Was it not natural, and what was obviously expected 
by Manolic himself, that after the Washington agreement, those 
who are responsible for the breakout of the Muslim-Croatian 
conflict should be removed from political functions? 
  [Mesic] It would be normal if everybody were to take the 
consequences for his or her earlier policies, because the people 
are neither mentally retarded, nor are they politically 
ignorant. The people know all too well which policy any of us 
supported. I still stick to my principle that names should not 
be publicly named, but I have a right to perceive certain 
occurrences, and consequently, those who brought about those 
occurrences as well. 
  [Ercog] Do you think that it is his public disagreement with 
the policy of President Tudjman, particularly with the policy on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, that was fatal for Manolic? Do you 
personally agree with Manolic? 
  [Mesic] Manolic is a man who had entered politics as a 
principled fighter for democracy and the lawful state. If the 
lawful state does not function, somebody has to be called to 
account. The same attitude is also toward the Croatian policy 
on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Manolic rightfully raises the question 
of who made the decision on the opening of the concentration 
camps in Bosnia. It is not sufficient to say that the other 
warring faction also had such camps. That is no justification. 
Let us see who made the decision. Who passed the regulations 
on the behavior in the camps, who is to blame for the conditions 
there? Who made decisions on that? Somebody had to make 
decisions on that, as well as the decision that a conflict with 
Muslims should be triggered. And when the conflict broke out, 
why was not a way out sought in negotiations? No, the efforts 
were made only to make the conflict escalate. All these 
questions urged Manolic to demand that accountability for that 
policy be established, and that the names of the guilty parties 
be made public. He has never been in a personal conflict with 
Gojko Susak, but all Manolic demands is that occurrences and 
their protagonists be identified, and that they be called to 
account. 
<H5>  Vrdoljak's Announcement </H5>
  [Ercog] Did you expect this attack against, until yesterday, 
the second most important official in the country to happen? 
  [Mesic] First I have to say that Manolic is so independent 
that he never consults with anybody. So it is first you and 
your newspaper that learned about his latest performance, while 
as for myself, I knew there would be reactions as soon as I read 
the interview in the FERAL TRIBUNE. In the first place because 
President Tudjman often emphasized that Susak is his best HDZ 
member, and one of the best ministers. I supposed that the 
president would try to protect Susak. However, the way in which 
that group tried to make use of Manolic's criticism equals the 
most magnificent moments of bolshevik persecutions at the time 
of Stalin. 
  [Ercog] Why did not President Tudjman ever defend you and 
your dignity from the attacks by your party colleagues in the 
way he is defending Susak now? 
  [Mesic] You know, Branimir Glavas said of me that I was a 
personification of evil, while -- conditionally said -- Vrdoljak 
said, following my warning at a parliamentary meeting that he 
ought to calm down, that he did not talk with the politically 
dead. And nothing happened! Nobody calls him to account, 
although I am the chairman of the parliament. Is that not 
interesting? Which means, an entire group of HDZ members is 
involved in the defense of one man by attacking Manolic, while 
in view of everything else that other people were told -- and 
many offensive things were said -- nothing has ever been done 
about it. 
  [Ercog] Will the issue result in the creation of some more 
room for hawks, and even for the possible continuation of purges? 
  [Mesic] I expect that the supporters of Manolic will be the 
main target now. All those who want to square accounts with 
somebody will be finding Manolic's supporters in their towns, 
firms, neighborhoods,.... Just like at the time of the most 
rigid communism. I am afraid of that, and it would be really 
good if that could be possibly avoided. 
  [Ercog] Do you think that the time for doing away with you 
has come? 
  [Mesic] I think it has. Particularly in view of the fact 
that Vrdoljak has already announced that by calling me a 
politically dead person, and he is usually very well informed. 
<H5>  Many Are Intimidated </H5>
  [Ercog] If Manolic still offers his resignation, will you 
stay in the office of the chairman of the Assembly? 
  [Mesic] Manolic is not going to resign, and therefore I am 
remaining in office. 
  [Ercog] There are many other mechanisms of elimination. 
  [Mesic] Yes, there are, but the democratic ones, and that 
process is quite long, you know.... 
  [Ercog] Do you believe that President Tudjman will stick to 
his attitude in this situation, or is he going to make yet 
another of his political turns? 
  [Mesic] I want to believe that the president will call to 
account all those who have gone for such a vulgar way of 
squaring accounts with opponents, and that the tensions will 
ease off. If that were not to be that way.... 
  [Ercog] Would you then join the party the foundation of 
which has been announced by Manolic? 
  [Mesic] Manolic is a co-founder of the HDZ platform that 
suited me at the time. If Joza [Manolic] proposes a new 
platform that proffers much more, I will certainly think about 
that. 
  [Ercog] What has been the reaction in the world to this sort 
of onslaught on the Croatian Parliament? 
  [Mesic] I have received many inquiring letters from many 
colleagues from the European parliaments, as well as from our 
citizens from abroad. For all of them it has been quite 
unexpected, and many feel intimidated. I told them the same as 
I have told you. I repeat that a vulgar, bolshevik-style attack 
has been undertaken against Manolic. I do not know who approved 
it, but do not worry, I shall bring that issue up for discussion 
at the next meeting of the HDZ Council. 
  [Ercog] Are you afraid of a possible turn toward 
dictatorship? 
  [Mesic] I shall bring the issues we have talked about up in 
the Council, and after that you shall see what kind of 
conversation we shall be carrying on, and if we shall be able to 
carry on any at all.

<F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Kruselj: "Tudjman's Message to the </F>
`Elimination Candidates'"] 
  [Text] Admittedly, the commentators who have been trying 
to justify Tudjman's "elimination" of Josip Manolic [president 
of the Chamber of Counties] in every possible way are not having 
an easy time. One of them has, thus -- perhaps to make this 
reckoning seem a "historical inevitability" -- compared Manolic 
to "Macek in 1941, when the creator of the Bannat of Croatia 
established that the antifascist coalition would win the war." 
He said that the estimate was good, but Macek did not benefit 
too much from it in 1945. Manolic would have fared the same way 
at present with his story about the "integral 
Bosnia-Herzegovina" if President Tudjman had not helped the 
Croats there in their defense against Serb aggression. 
  If we neglect the fact that it was Tudjman, rather than his 
opponent, who was obsessed with the idea of the Bannat, which is 
one of the reasons that the Croat-Muslim conflicts escalated, 
the basic question remains: Who does Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman represent in this analogy? There is only one logical, 
but also historically acceptable, answer: Josip Broz. More 
precisely, he became so only after the Washington agreement, 
while at the beginning of the Bosnia-Herzegovina plot he seemed 
more like a "poglavnik" [reference to Ante Pavelic -- wartime 
Croatian leader], convinced that the Muslims must accept the 
Croat-Serb squaring of accounts regarding "the most complicated 
country in the world." 
<H5>  Who Is "Rankovic" and Who Is "Tito"? </H5>
  However, if Tudjman is Tito in this analogy, who has after 
all always fascinated him with his style of ruling, then Manolic 
can only be the personification of the protagonists of the 
Croatian spring, Savka [Dabcevic-Kucar, president of the 
Croatian National Party] and Miko [Tripalo], his parliament 
colleague. Namely, Tito overthrew the Croatian leaders after 
they had correctly identified the "carcinoma" of the Yugoslav 
federation of the time. The Croatian "pair of oars" had to fall; 
although Tripalo had been "predestined" to be Tito's successor, 
a radical constitutional reform, as they conceived it, could not 
be avoided. A similar thing has been happening with the 
reestablishment of Manolic's view of Croatian policy toward 
Bosnia, as well as the problems of the internal strengthening of 
the legal state. 
  This is why the claims, formed by the "right" faction in the 
party in power, about Tudjman in fact removing "the Croatian 
Rankovic", are somewhat tragicomical. Namely, Manolic's 
political trouble started the moment he started to support the 
democratization of Croatia -- too loudly and on the recognizable 
antifascist basis -- rather than its transformation into a 
police state. The problem was also that the former "number-two 
man" had, during his "Udba" [Yugoslav State Security Service] 
career, when he did not bother Tudjman at all, created too wide 
a circle of political enemies for himself, mostly in the top 
state circles. Eventually the "anti-Manolic coalition" became 
so numerous and influential that it was much easier for the 
Croatian president to say goodbye to his old friend than to 
directly oppose those whose politics have been seriously shaken 
by the Washington change. 
  The worst thing for Manolic in all this was that, until the 
last moment, he could not believe that the rule of unquestioning 
obedience also held true for Tudjman's closest associates, and 
even for those who made his breakthrough to power possible, 
which his opponents had been making good tactical use of all the 
while. They will verbally support the Croatian president as 
long as he keeps them in their present positions, that is, until 
they raise the issue of his responsibility for joint mistakes. 
  Be that as it may, the key question at the moment is how the 
departure of the leader of the "left" within the ruling party 
[Croatian democratic Community -- HDZ] will be reflected on the 
Croatian political scene. The answer cannot be unambiguous, but 
Manolic's departure will surely incite new political regrouping 
as well as a clearer profiling of the HDZ from a movement into a 
party of the proclaimed Christian democratic orientation. This 
aim ensues from the conclusions of the Second General HDZ 
Congress, when the intraparty conflict was temporarily 
"conserved," but in the new circumstances there is no reason not 
to start implementing it. 
  Naturally, the precondition for this is Tudjman 
reestablishing the balance of his "left" and "right" factions -- 
concealed behind whose ideologized names there are, in fact, 
radically opposed views on the democratization of state power -- 
or getting rid of all their leaders as soon as possible. More 
precisely, it is a public secret that "Susak's faction" will now 
try to remove Stipe Mesic, with whom it "waged a war" in a more 
open way than with Manolic until the Second General Congress. 
If Mesic falls, the fate of the other "Manolic followers" who 
hold important positions within the parliament is also sealed -- 
primarily Degoricija and Boljkovac -- after which the purge of 
the "technomanagerial" faction will follow, ranging from Franjo 
Greguric to the present Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. 
<H5>  Valentic's Threat "Frozen" </H5>
  The "lobbyist" information on Valentic's recent threat to 
resign, which would have disastrous consequences on the final 
success of the economic reform, speaks of how important 
Manolic's departure is in this disturbance of relations. 
Tudjman has temporarily "frozen" this threat by promising some 
-- still insufficiently known -- personnel "abortions," but it 
is clear who it is in the party in power who bothers Valentic 
the most in implementing the further stage of restructuring the 
Croatian economy. 
  If Tudjman opts for the policy of balance, it is inevitable 
that he will not only have to prevent more departures of "soft" 
HDZ members, but also to listen to Manolic's swan song and get 
rid of Defense Minister Gojko Susak, for whom it is not 
difficult to find something "incriminating" regarding the events 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In these complex combinations, Vladimir 
Seks, the government person most responsible for the poor 
functioning of the legal system, is in the same danger as lower 
parliamentary officials such as Ivan Milas and Luka Bebic. The 
claim of the "right" that it had already bled because of Vice 
Vukojevic's departure from the information service of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not satisfy the opposite side, 
because his intraparty influence has not decreased 
significantly. Involving the "retired" Mate Boban in this story 
would be even more absurd, considering the fact that he is a 
politician from a neighboring country. 
  If the current international situation is taken into 
account, 
which, after the Croat-Muslim agreement, is much more favorable 
than in the period when the conflict between the HDZ factions 
culminated, it is certain that Tudjman will keep an eye on the 
intraparty balance, but in the way that he will gradually get 
rid of both the "left" and "right" factions. The most important 
thing in these politics, which could most easily be described 
with the proverb regarding drinking half and giving the other 
half to the horse, is perhaps the fact that a start was made by 
eliminating Tudjman's best known friend and fellow fighter, so 
that the other "elimination candidates" could be informed that 
their political future will cause even fewer dilemmas. 
Naturally, political wit will not allow Tudjman to make such 
replacements in a "package," considering the fact that, in such 
circumstances, there is a danger of a mass escape of members to 
competitive parties. The "certificates of withdrawal" will 
arrive individually, equally on both sides, and after each the 
pulse of the electoral body will be felt with great care. 
  Tudjman has the whole of two years to "renovate" the party 
in 
power, which is how far ahead the following parliamentary 
elections are, so it is to be supposed that the written-off 
officials, including Manolic, will not be capable of causing a 
serious parliamentary crisis or a paralysis of the political 
system, let alone of threatening a coup. Of the protagonists in 
the current intraparty conflicts, the only faction spared will 
be the above mentioned "technomanagerial" one, which Tudjman 
needs to shape a modern market economy. On the other hand, all 
the important instruments of power will be held by the 
representatives of the Christian Democratic faction, primarily 
Jure Radic and Mate Granic, who will, at the lower level, rely 
on the "subsequent" HDZ members not burdened by the present 
ideological conflicts. The only winner in that period will, all 
in all, be President Tudjman, so that at the next elections 
there could be a test of how interesting the party, redesigned 
in terms of personnel and program, is to potential voters. 
  During this two-year HDZ "cleaning up," the chances of 
Manolic and those who will soon follow him making a political 
career are slim. If Manolic's positions are analyzed, it is 
evident that they are already contained in the programs of some 
Croatian parties, primarily in the Liberal and Social Democratic 
parties, so that, in the case of a new party being founded, he 
could not expect too many members joining. It would be more 
realistic for the future "renegades" to join related parties, 
unless the leaderships of the latter establish that the HDZ 
"early guerrilla fighters" are too great a weight around their 
necks. 
<H5>  No One Needs Losers </H5>
  As far as Manolic is concerned, he immediately felt what it 
meant to be a political "renegade." After he sought the support 
of the parliamentary parties and the general public for the 
replacement of his opponent Gojko Susak, the leadership of the 
main opposition party spoke up, but in defense of the defense 
minister. Namely, Liberal leaders Drazen Budisa and Damir Zoric 
estimated that it was a good opportunity for improving their 
relations with the Herzegovinian lobby, as they intended to 
cover the Bosnia- Herzegovina areas too. Manolic was thus 
tricked here too, and Tudjman had no more reason to hesitate. 
The later support of the Liberals in preventing Manolic's 
abdication at the Chamber of Counties bears no special 
significance, because it is known in advance how the HDZ 
"machine" will vote next time. Evidently, no one needs 
political losers, even when the events confirm their premature 
"cock's crow."

<F P=106> [Article by Ma.S.: "Pawlak Government Currently Proposes: </F>
Defense Affairs Committee, Not a Council"] 
  [Excerpt] The Pawlak Cabinet established the Committee of 
Defense Affairs of the Council of Ministers [KSORM] on Tuesday 
[12 March]. The ministers also accepted a bill on managing 
immovable property left over by the Russian Federation troops. 
Tuesday was the deadline for the government to take a stand on 
the demands of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union 
Solidarity. The union demands, among other things, that the 
budget law be amended. However, the Council of Minister first 
wants to adopt a program of socioeconomic policy for 1994-97. 
  National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said after the 
government session that the president had promised to appeal to 
the Constitutional Tribunal against the already signed budget. 
What he wants changed is the commitment of the National Defense 
Ministry to earmark 300 billion zlotys for the purchase of Iryda 
[Polish aircraft]. Minister Kolodziejczyk believes that 
maintaining this paragraph of the law with such wording would be 
a dangerous precedent. He also announced that he would not meet 
this commitment unless Iryda satisfies Army requirements. 
  The issue of establishing new defense structures has already 
been discussed once at a Council of Ministers' session. Toward 
the end of November, the National Defense Committee [KOK] 
decided that the National Defense Council [RBN] would be set up 
as "the supreme state organ in the area of defense." This would 
call for amending the law on general defense duty and the Small 
Constitution. The Basic Law envisions the existence of the RBN, 
but as an advisory organ of the president. Lech Walesa is 
trying to ensure that the council decisions are binding for 
everyone, including the government. For the time being, there 
exists KOK, a structure that coordinates the activities of state 
authorities in defense issues. 
  In December, when the Pawlak Cabinet had already dealt with 
these issues once, it was officially announced that 
"interministerial agreements still need to be reached." 
Unofficially, there was speculation that the government "became 
frightened" of giving all of the powers in defense issues over 
to the president. 
  The newly established KSORM is supposed to be a collective, 
internal organ of the government, with a structure similar to 
the already existing committees of the Council of Ministers: the 
Economic and Sociopolitical Committee. The chairman of the 
committee is the prime minister. During natural calamities and 
mass catastrophes, the new body is supposed to coordinate all 
government activities. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk evaluated the establishment of KSORM 
as an opportunity to reform the Army. He added, however, that 
he had supported a different order: the establishment of the RBN 
first. Contrary to initial proposals, KSORM does not include 
National Security Office Secretary Jerzy Milewski. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Elzbieta Graczyk: "It's Our Turn Now"] </F>
  [Text] Work on the organization of an apolitical, loyal, 
and professional civil service corps has continued since the end 
of 1989. All successive prime ministers, from Mazowiecki to 
Suchocka, believed that the head of the Council of Ministers 
Office [URM] should not be involved in any way or degree in the 
shaping of any personnel policies in the state. However, thus 
far none of the government teams has made an effort to make any 
radical moves. During the election campaign, parties belonging 
to the present government coalition had very little to say about 
their proposed personnel policy. However, it was possible to 
predict their appetites when, immediately after the announcement 
of the election results, the winners let slip a resounding, 
triumphant cry: "It's our turn now!" And that was heard not 
only among the so-called grass roots, but also in the ranks of 
experienced politicians. For example, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz 
soon demanded that immediate changes be made in the Polish 
National Bank [NBP] and the Supreme Chamber of Control. 
Although the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] leader Aleksander 
Kwasniewski tried to tone down such utterances and persuade 
people that the alliance wanted to form a government of experts 
and did not intend to make profound personnel purges, even 
though it did mean to put an end to the Solidarity tradition of 
a "buddies' republic," he did not give the impression that he 
himself was convinced by his arguments. At that time, the 
peasants kept quiet, but, as soon as the coalition negotiations 
gave them the prime minister's chair, they began to implement 
the principle "it's our turn now" quickly and consistently. 
  The prime minister's first office appointments turned out to 
be quite significant. He gave Ewa Wachowicz, a student from a 
farming background and a former Miss Polonia, the post of prime 
minister's press assistant. During her very first press 
conference, Miss Wachowicz disclosed with a charming smile that 
she could say "I love you" in several European languages. 
Furthermore, the prime minister appointed the Polish People's 
Republic's [PRL] blue-eyed boy Ireneusz Sekula to the office of 
head of the Customs and Excise Office, while the post of voivoda 
of Olsztyn went to Janusz Lorenz, who was introduced there as 
"currently director of a meat-processing plant and author of a 
scientific dissertation on the quality of Polish export ham." 
Needless to say, Lorenz is a member of the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL]. Already during his Sejm preliminary hearing, the URM 
boss Michal Strak (Prime Minister Pawlak's most trusted 
colleague and former cabinet director at President Wojciech 
Jaruzelski's Chancellery Office) asserted that pre-1989 
activists would prove to be better stewards to the country than 
their predecessors, and that the coalition parties would refrain 
from demanding voivodas' posts for their own members in only 10 
voivodships. All announcements made by Strak are extremely 
important. At one time, personnel decisions were made by the 
Central Committee, while, after 1989, the role of URM head 
increased so much (he handles the civil service attached to the 
prime minister, the government, and all of the state 
administration) that, after the president and the prime 
minister, he is practically the third-most-important figure in 
the state. 
  The Office of the Council of Ministers employs 600 people 
directly and 900 in so-called ancillary enterprises. During the 
17 months of the so-called system transformation, Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki dismissed 293 URM employees and appointed 304. On 
leaving office, Strak's predecessor, Jan Maria Rokita, had 
prepared a complete draft program of a transformation of the URM 
structure and organization. The present incumbent has no 
intention of implementing Rokita's program or even reforming it 
according to his own concepts. "On assuming office, our new 
civil servants do not need to memorize room numbers or acquaint 
themselves with the telephone system. These are people who know 
very well how to move around the URM." 
  New appointments to the URM include one secretary of state, 
six under secretaries, and five directors general. The posts of 
secretary of state and secretary of the Economic Committee of 
the Council of Ministers [KERM] went to Andrzej Zor, a 
54-year-old philologist, formerly (1978-82) departmental 
director at a ministry, later in other high-ranking URM posts, 
then Polish Republic ambassador to Malaysia. He has had no 
party allegiance since the dissolution of the Polish United 
Workers Party [PZPR]. 
  The posts of under secretary of state were offered to 
Kazimierz Korona, a graduate of the Main School of Planning and 
Statistics [SGPiS], an activist of the agricultural circles 
movement, a member of the supreme administration of the United 
Peasant Party [ZSL], an URM official since 1984, a ZSL and 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL] adviser to deputy prime ministers, 
and deputy director at the State Treasury Agricultural Property 
Agency since 1992; and Stanislaw Dobrzanski, a graduate of the 
Maria Curie-Sklodowska University [UMC], former deputy director 
of the National Library in Warsaw, subsequently director of the 
Sugar Refineries Industrial Bank's East Poland Division, and a 
member of the PSL. The posts of URM under secretary of state 
and secretary of the Council of Ministers' Sociopolitical 
Committee went to Grzegorz Rydlewski, a graduate and member of 
the Institute of Political Sciences and a high-ranking official 
of the Office for Religious Denominations during the 1980's, 
since 1990 a member of the Public Initiatives Foundation, and a 
PZPR member until 1990. He is directly responsible to 
Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz. Another under secretary of state is 
Jan Zagajewski, a former employee of the Spolem [food retail] 
cooperative and later an official at the City Office in 
Pruszkow. He was URM director general during Pawlak's 33 days 
[first term of office as prime minister in 1992], and has 
returned to URM now. 
  Two more appointees to the office of secretary of state are 
prime minister Pawlak's advisers Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz and 
Franciszek Mleczko. The former has no party affiliation and is 
a professor of economic sciences; the latter, also a nonparty 
member (but a PZPR member until the party's dissolution), is a 
sociologist, formerly a lecturer at the Main School of Rural 
Economy [SGGW] and the Academy of Social Sciences attached to 
the PZPR Central Committee [KC]. He was deputy director at the 
Ministry of Culture and the Arts in the years 1974-78. He 
collaborated with Michal Strak and was author of election 
forecasts and analyses for the PSL. 
  The post of URM director general was offered to Andrzej 
Piwowarczyk, former teacher and later a high-ranking official at 
the Voivodship Office in Siedlce, who, tragically, died recently 
in a car accident. Another URM returnee is Jan Guz, a graduate 
of Leningrad University, an employee of the PZPR Central 
Committee Planning and Analysis Department and a long-serving 
adviser to former prime ministers in the 1970's and the 1980's; 
and Marian Wegorowski, also a long-serving and high-ranking URM 
official, a PZPR member from 1951 until the party's dissolution, 
currently of no party affiliation. He now runs the URM 
personnel movements department. The post of head of the Public 
Administration Office was won by Marek Ungier, political 
scientist and activist in the Union of Socialist Polish Youth 
[ZSMP], and then (from 1974 to 1990) in the PZPR. He was later 
a partner in a light-clothing business, a member of the 
Supervisory Board of the ATU Insurance Society, an activist in 
the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP], and an 
adviser to the SdRP chairman. 
  The following have returned to active politics (not only as 
high-ranking officials but also as advisers to the prime 
minister and the URM boss): Wladyslaw Szymanski, former member 
of the Council of State and ZSL and PSL expert; Marek Ksiazek, 
deputy chairman of the Cepelia [Central Office of Folk and 
Artistic Crafts] cooperative; Tadeusz Materka, retired leader 
(active since 1952) of the peasant movement, former voivoda of 
Piotrkow and Rzeszow, former deputy chairman of the Samopomoc 
Chlopska [Peasant Self-Help] cooperative, and former deputy 
chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control. He held the office 
of domestic trade vice minister during and after the martial law 
period. Finally, Jan Bisztyga, former PZPR Central Committee 
press spokesman and author of the party's new information policy 
advising "throwing open the doors to party committees" following 
the 12th PZPR Congress, previously under secretary of state at 
the Foreign Ministry and ambassador to Greece. Until his 
retirement (in 1992), he was active as an adviser to Wojciech 
Jaruzelski. 
  There have also been many changes among high- and 
middle-ranking officials at all ministries. By the end of 
January, new appointments were made for six secretaries, 37 
under secretaries, and eight directors general at 16 ministries 
and two central administration offices. Here, as at URM, the 
new appointees are drawn mainly from the "pool" of former PRL 
officials returning to their previous--or higher--ministerial 
offices. At the Construction Ministry, the post of secretary was 
given to Tomasz Lodeczka, until recently chairman of a housing 
construction cooperative in Bielsko-Biala (SdRP member), and 
that of secretary to Wojciech Rzepka, who has been associated 
with that sector since 1978. AT the Ministry of Ownership 
Transformations, appointments to the post of under secretary 
went to Jozef Kowalczyk, a journalist writing for CHLOPSKA DROGA 
[Peasant Way] and ZIELONY SZTANDAR [Green Banner] and head of 
the ZSL Supreme Committee Press Office, and Andrzej Zebrowski, a 
lawyer at the Main School of Commerce and chairman of the Profit 
company. 
  At the Ministry of National Education [MEN], the posts of 
under secretary of state were given to the following: Tadeusz 
Pilch, philosopher and PSL member; Danuta Grabowska, the 
ministry's schools superintendent in Radom, formerly a PZPR 
(later SdRP) Sejm deputy; and Kazimierz Dera, director of the 
MEN Personnel Department from the imposition of martial law 
until 1990. 
  Appointments to the post of under secretary of state at the 
Ministry of Culture and Arts [MKiS] were given to Waclaw Janas, 
who was MKiS vice minister in the years 1983-90, and Zdzislaw 
Podkanski, longstanding Rural Youth Union [ZMW] and ZSL activist 
in voivodship structures. Two new under secretaries of state at 
the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Economy began their careers 
at posts with the State Agricultural Farms [PGR]. They are 
Jerzy Pilarczyk and Ryszard Smolarek. Pilarczyk, who belongs to 
the SdRP, later represented the PGR Association at the Agency 
for Agricultural Marketing [ARR] Council; Smolarek, who for many 
years represented the ZSL in the Sejm, managed his own farm 
after leaving the PGR. 
  Jacek Buchacz, a new appointee at the Ministry of Health and 
Social Welfare, was active on the board of the Dairy 
Cooperatives Association and in the Juventur [student travel 
agency] until 1986, and then held the post of secretary at the 
Polish Embassy in Morocco until 1990. New vice ministers at the 
Justice Ministry are Grzegorz Ciecierski (PSL), formerly an 
official at the Finance Ministry, and Bohdan Zdziennicki (no 
party affiliation now), a member of the Bench at the Supreme 
Administrative Court [NSA] since 1981. 
  Jerzy Szreter is back at the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Policy, where he has been employed since 1978. As secretary of 
state, he took part in the Roundtable Talks; still earlier, he 
worked at the PZPR Central Committee Economic Management 
Department. Another returnee is Leslaw Nawacki, who was 
employed at the Labor Ministry until the end of 1991. 
  Following the successive dismissals of Stefan Kawalec, Marek 
Borowski, and, recently, even Witold Modzelewski, the Finance 
Ministry suffers from an unstable personnel situation. In 
practice, it is currently headed by Henryk Chmielak, director of 
the Planning Commission 1987-89, later under secretary of state 
at the Central Planning Administration, and, still later, deputy 
chairman of the [Government] Committee for Radio and Television 
Affairs. He describes himself as "an expert with no party 
affiliation." 
  Henryk Jasik is new under secretary of state at the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs [MSW]. A chemist by profession, Jasik was 
employed at the scientific and technical directorate of the 
intelligence service between 1970 and 1990; later, he held the 
post of director at Department I--that is, the Intelligence 
Service--and also worked for the State Protection Office [UOP]. 
The MSW gains Jerzy Kozminski (transferred from URM) and 
Stanislaw Szymanski (from a succession of diplomatic posts). 
CUP gains Jozef Zegar, professor of economics at the Main 
School of Planning and Statistics, formerly chief editor of WIES 
WSPOLCZESNA [Contemporary Rural Community], deputy chairman of 
the Council of Ministers Planning Commission (1986), and a PSL 
activist. 
  The new head of the Office for Veterans Affairs is Adam 
Dobronski, historian of the peasant movement. He owes his 
appointment to the support his nomination received from veteran 
soldiers of the People's Army [AL] and the Peasant Battalions 
[BCh]. 
  A proposal offering the post of chairman of the General 
Savings Bank-National Bank [PKO-BP] Supervisory Board was 
extended to Marian Krzak, currently chairman of the Union of 
Polish Banks [ZBP], former finance minister (1980-82) and PKO-BP 
chairman (appointed 1988), dismissed by Prime Minister Bielecki 
in 1991. 
  Zbigniew Sobotka, PZPR Central Committee member since 1986 
and Politburo member since 1988, is to represent the government 
coalition interests in the president's office. 
  In addition, a wholesale exchange of heads of the 
government's local administration structures was carried out 
until quite recently on a nationwide scale. "We have reached a 
situation where the personal composition of the voivodas' corps 
is almost settled. We are a stable and cohesive team," Michal 
Strak said during a recent meeting with voivodas. Of the total 
of 49 voivodas, 27 were dismissed from their posts. Strak also 
added the following remark: "The transfer of power was effected 
in a pleasant atmosphere, and I was even posing for photographs 
with the former Lodz voivoda," who is a Christian National Union 
[ZChN] member. Asked about the new voivodas' party membership 
profiles, Strak admitted that the PSL took advantage of the 
changes to a much greater extent than the SSLD. During the 
aforementioned meeting, voivodas were asked to evaluate a 
proposed parliamentary bill on the Council of Ministers, which 
provides for the automatic dismissal of voivodas following each 
successive change of government unless the new prime minister 
chooses to extend their "contracts." In Strak's opinion, such 
contracts will serve to stabilize the administration system and, 
at the same time, highlight the principle that a voivoda 
represents the current government in his administrative area. 
  We note that a pattern of civil servants returning to office 
according to a specific political key applies not only at URM. 
Notably, the Ministry of Culture and the Arts--or, more 
specifically, its head, Minister Dejmek--is eager to spend 20 
billion zlotys to sponsor publication of a new periodical 
devoted to cultural affairs and edited by Krzysztof Teodor 
Toeplitz. The periodical is likely to be a weekly, with a print 
run of 50,000. As yet, its future chief editor has no blueprint 
for the periodical's program or the composition of his editorial 
team. But he has the money: the taxpayers' money.

<F P=106> [Article by Pawel Wronski: "Leaving Because of Iryda? SLD </F>
Sejm Deputies Want Dismissal of MON Chief"] 
  [Text] Roman Nowicki and Stanislaw Janas, Sejm 
deputies for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], announced 
during a news conference yesterday that a motion will be 
prepared to have the chief of the Defense Ministry [MON], Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk, recalled from his post. According to Nowicki and 
Janas, the minister humiliates the Sejm and acts against the 
interests of the Polish defense industry. 
  In Nowicki's view, he will have no problem finding 15 
members 
of parliament ready to support such a motion. 
  The affair began when Sejm deputies made a decision to 
include a provision in the budget that MON will have to purchase 
Iryda aircraft costing 300 million zlotys [Z] each. 
  "I have a copy of a letter addressed to the Mesko plant in 
which the minister justifies a decrease of orders with a 
decision by the Sejm Budget Commission regarding the purchase of 
Iryda," Nowicki displayed a pile of documents. These were 
confidential expert opinions from which it could be concluded 
that the Iryda is a good aircraft. Nowicki complained that, in 
his recent statements, Minister Kolodziejczyk "made fools of the 
Sejm deputies." 
  The Sejm deputies also pointed out that, under the 
"Expenditures" section of the MON budget, a sum of Z400 billion 
is listed as being devoted to the purchase of 152 passenger 
cars, 150 terrain-passenger cars, and 10 buses, among other 
things. "Perhaps the ministers would like to be driven around 
in Mercedes cars. But they have no right to complain they have 
no money for equipment," Nowicki concluded. 
  Through the president, Minister Kolodziejczyk has addressed 
the Constitutional Tribunal with a question of whether forcing 
MON to make these kinds of purchases is in accordance with the 
legal system. He also voiced the reservation that, even if the 
Tribunal disagrees with him, he will not buy the Iryda aircraft 
in the version proposed by the Mielec-based plant. 
  "We want to purchase about 40 pieces, but they must be the 
kind of equipment that would present combat value. For the 
moment, Iryda is just a training and educational type of 
aircraft," said Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, MON spokesman, in a 
determined manner. 
  General Henryk Mika, the director of MON's department for 
arms and military equipment supplies, was surprised by the Sejm 
deputies' accusations. "We are devoting Z120 billion for cars, 
and these are financial means that the Army itself has come up 
with. The only Western-made vehicles we have are the 16 Peugeot 
405's that were manufactured in Lublin and are being tested now 
because, in general, we purchase [Polish-made] Polonez cars," he 
explained to GAZETA WYBORCZA. 
  According to a high-ranking MON official, the confusion 
caused by the SLD Sejm deputies is "the communists' revenge for 
the failure of Zbigniew Siemiatkowski's candidacy for the post 
of deputy minister in MON."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Plawnicki, general secretary of the </F>
Christian Social Union, by Wieslaw Marnic; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Marnic] Christians in alliance with communists? 
We have not had that before. So what does it mean? 
  [Plawnicki] I have always believed that GAZETA ROBOTNICZA is 
a trustworthy and credible newspaper that does not yield easily 
to fashion or public mood shifts. But you seem to want to make 
me change this opinion. 
  [Marnic] Not at all. 
  [Plawnicki] So why do you use terms that are surely closer 
to the outlook taken by GAZETA POLSKA rather than GAZETA 
ROBOTNICZA? After all, to define the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] as postcommunist is to engage in a blatant falsehood. In 
addition, our alliance involves mostly Social Democracy of the 
Polish Republic [SdRP]. Let us then move away from using 
derogatory terms--although there are some who will not like the 
idea of an accord between Christians and Social Democrats--and 
toward specific facts. 
  On 7 March, we signed an interparty agreement between the 
Wroclaw SdRP office and our division of the Christian Social 
Union [UChS] here. Similar agreements were also signed in Lodz 
and Bialystok. 
  [Marnic] What are the provisions of these agreements? 
  [Plawnicki] As regards organizational issues, they will 
involve mutual contacts, exchange of information, and support. 
As far as practical operations are concerned, we intend to give 
support to each other's candidates in the forthcoming local 
self-government elections. 
  [Marnic] Does this mean that the UChS will enter the 
structure of the Democratic Left Alliance? 
  [Plawnicki] It does. The present left-wing group is 
different from the previous one in that it is not oriented 
toward orthodoxy. This change in its nature enables us to find 
a place for ourselves within the SLD. This is because, 
fortunately, the left-wing camp is made up of people with a 
fairly wide spectrum of political outlooks who are brought 
together by their propublic interest orientation. 
  [Marnic] I understand that the UChS will take advantage of 
relying on the highly organized SLD structures, but how will the 
Left benefit in its turn? 
  [Plawnicki] It will expand its sphere of influence to 
include a whole range of people associated with the UChS. You 
cannot fail to notice that even Pope John Paul II spoke of the 
grain of good present in the system of real socialism. We do 
not engage in wholesale condemnations of everything and anything 
whose roots reach back to the Polish People's Republic. We also 
have a group of people who enjoy a high degree of authority in 
the eyes of the public. They can turn out to meet the needs of 
our society. 
  [Marnic] I understand that you are referring to the 
forthcoming local self-government elections? 
  [Plawnicki] We will run in them within the SLD bloc. We 
intend to nominate four candidates in Wroclaw and one each in 
Trzebnica, Olesnica, and Olawa. Our candidates will be such 
people as Jerzy Janoszka, chairman of the Well-Wishers' Club, 
and Tadeusz Pluzinski, director of the Value Energy Fund. 
  [Marnic] Under what election slogans will they fight for 
their nominations? 
  [Plawnicki] Tolerance, respect for differences, and 
antinationalism. We want to fashion a climate of tolerance and 
acceptance of people who have different views, backgrounds, or 
traditions. Our fundamental motto is respect for every human 
person. 
  [Marnic] And what will your candidates oppose? 
  [Plawnicki] They will stand against the misuse of Christian 
ideas for the purpose of sowing hatred and xenophobia, and 
against selective interpretation of the Holy Father's words. 
Christianity entails the concept of serving others, not 
fighting them. Our candidates want to make use of their talents 
to serve society, and the choice of the SLD as allies is a 
natural consequence of the fact that, of all political groups, 
it was the SLD whose program is most society-oriented. 
  [Marnic] Thank you for talking with us.

<F P=106> [Article by PAD and B.I.W.: "Solidarity `Omitted' by the </F>
Government"] 
  [Text] Roman Adamczyk, chief of the Prime Minister's 
Office, forwarded a letter to Solidarity ["S"], in which he 
stated that, "during its Tuesday [12 April] session, the Council 
of Ministers will discuss the motions resulting from the 
negotiations and the talks of government and union experts, and 
the talks with employees' organizations held so far." Similar 
letters were sent to the chairpersons of 17 other unions. At the 
same time, the prime minister invited the chairpersons of the 
unions to a meeting in the Office of the Council of Ministers 
that is to be held this afternoon. "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski 
announced that he will not participate in the meeting; however, 
the union will send an observer. 
  On Tuesday, the Presidium of the "S" National Committee 
[KK], 
which had a session in Gdansk, waited for the government reply 
as to how it was going to implement the union demands. KK Press 
Spokesman Piotr Zak said that "S" will wait for this reply only 
until the KK starts its session--that is, until this morning. 
The KK will make a decision concerning the further course of 
the "S" protest action. 
  Unofficially, Pawlak's letter was interpreted as an attempt 
to bypass the deadline, set by "S" for 12 April, for forwarding 
the reply to the union. The letter does not say that the 
government has taken a stand on the "S" demands and that it will 
make a decision; it merely says that it will "discuss the 
motions." Despite the announcement made toward the end of March 
that the protocol of the talks between the government and union 
experts would be discussed at the nearest session of the Council 
of Ministers (incidentally, the nearest session was held 
earlier), such an item did not appear on yesterday's agenda of 
the session of the Council of Ministers. In the Government's 
Press Office, we were told that "it may be under the `various 
issues' item, and the `various issues' may include various 
matters of the last moment." 
  The union spokesman announced that "S" will protest against 
the new version of the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases] law. 
  The KK Presidium believes that the Sejm "should complete the 
proceedings against Wojciech Jaruzelski and Czeslaw Kiszczak, so 
that those responsible for imposing martial law can be judged by 
both the Constitutional Tribunal and general courts." "S" 
believes that the Sejm "should also represent the stand of the 
extraparliamentary opposition on this issue." 
  The KK also criticized the work of the Selection Committee 
of 
the National Investment Fund [NFI]. According to the "S" 
leadership, most of the candidates for members of the 
Supervisory Boards of the NFI selected by the committee are 
people who have their roots in the former party 
nomenklatura. "S" believes that, in the Supervisory 
Boards, there should be room for delegates of representative 
unions.

<F P=106> [Article by Bernadeta Waszkielewicz, Piotr Adamowicz, and </F>
JBL: "Trade Unions After Meeting With Prime Minister; Pawlak: We 
Can Live Without Popiwek"] 
  [Text] "Talks with employers and trade unions suggest that 
it is possible to maintain the stable situation in the economy 
without a law on wage controls," said Waldemar Pawlak after 
yesterday's meeting with 18 trade unions, the Confederation of 
Polish Employers, and the National Chamber of Commerce. He 
explained that, as a result of changes in the style of managing 
enterprises, "the popiwek [tax on excessive wage increases] will 
be unnecessary." He will submit the conclusions from these 
talks to the Council of Ministers. "There is a certain risk, but 
I believe that we are prepared to take this risk because we can 
count on responsible cooperation on the part of trade unions and 
managers." 
  As the prime minister wants it, the government will probably 
decide not to submit a new popiwek bill to the Sejm. Even 
though Pawlak did not tell journalists directly that he would 
not forward the new popiwek bill for the time being, Ewa 
Spychalska, chairperson of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement 
[OPZZ], stated that he had admitted that would retreat from this 
idea. He will not forward this bill to the Sejm for a month, 
unless some violent wage increases are observed during that time. 
  According to Pawlak, the road to maintaining a stable 
economy 
without controlling wages is "accelerating the work on laws 
concerning collective agreements (wages would be negotiated in 
them), legal regulations concerning the status of the Trilateral 
Committee for Socioeconomic Affairs, including the issue of the 
representativeness of trade unions, and accelerating the 
commercialization of companies manufacturing goods for the 
Polish market." "In the first order, we should commercialize 
enterprises that are in good financial shape. We will try to 
implement these processes as fast as possible, so that, in 
companies that are in a position to increase wages, the founding 
organs will be able to control these processes efficiently," 
said the prime minister. 
  He also stressed that it is important to "maintain the 
special character of a public company, mainly in the area of 
services, such as the railroads or post offices." "I am 
counting on a responsible attitude of trade unions and managers. 
For the time being, there is no danger of an uncontrolled wage 
increase. If we take advantage of a frank and open exchange of 
views, we will be able to go further and introduce solutions 
that are effective and proven in countries characterized by 
well-organized cooperation of social partners. The Council of 
Ministers will discuss the conclusion of our meeting--that one 
can live without a popiwek as well." 
  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, press spokesman of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD], stated that, before the consultations in 
the SLD leadership, he could not comment on the statement by 
Prime Minister Pawlak. Most of the trade unions were nicely 
surprised by the prime minister's decision to retreat from the 
new proposal on wage controls. 
<H5>  OPZZ: A Meeting a Month </H5>
  Leaving the Office of the Council of Ministers, Spychalska 
reported that, on 15 April, a meeting would be held on the 
governmental program of socioeconomic policy for 1994-97. On 14 
April, there will be a meeting on the final version of the Labor 
Code. On 27 April, the government will submit the main points 
of the reform of social insurance. According to the OPZZ 
chairperson, the prime minister also assured the trade unions 
that the labor minister had given up the changes in family 
allowances--"their size will depend on a given family's income, 
not on the number of children." "In the middle of each month, 
consultation meetings, similar to the one held on 13 April, will 
be held with representatives of trade unions and employers," 
said the OPZZ head. 
<H5>  Solidarity ["S"]: Prime Minister Speaks About Our Proposal </H5>
  "I will not beat around the bush and say bluntly that the 
government has not implemented most of the "S" demands; however, 
we are satisfied with the prime minister's announcement of 
departing from the new popiwek law, which is in line with the 
opinions of experts," Marian Krzaklewski commented on the 
government's stand on the "S" demands. "We have always thought 
that wage regulation should be conducted through a system of 
collective agreements; now, because there exist enterprises of a 
monopolistic character, which may raise wages by setting higher 
prices, there should be some kind of control system. It seems 
that the government will agree to our proposal that, in those 
enterprises, wages not only be regulated in collective 
agreements but also be confirmed in the Trilateral Committee. A 
list of such enterprises should be drawn up by the Antimonopoly 
Office," stated Piotr Zak, press spokesman of the "S" National 
Commission [KK]. 
  The KK hoped to receive a reply from the Council of 
Ministers before the session--the council discussed the "S" 
demands on Tuesday [12 April]. It did not receive a letter from 
the prime minister, and it learned about the government's stance 
from a reporter. Asked after the meeting with trade unions 
about the "S" demands, the prime minister dodged the question, 
drawing attention to the fact that it was a meeting with many 
unions and employers and that the conclusion was different. 
Stanislaw Alot, KK secretary delegated to yesterday's meeting 
with the prime minister, stated that the government had actually 
answered only two demands: that it will depart from the popiwek, 
and that it will review earlier agreements with "S" over the 
next two weeks. It opened itself, to a certain extent, to other 
demands--among other things, the government intends to implement 
a law on collective agreements, representativeness, and the 
Trilateral Committee within a month. Alot also wanted an answer 
to the other demands, but he did not receive it, or, as he says, 
the answer was unsatisfactory. 
<H5>  The Strikes Are Dying Down </H5>
  The "S" head announced that the strikes would be continued. 
"It is not a matter of fighting during the next days or weeks 
but months. In the fall, price increases will be the most 
numerous, which will cause an outbreak of strikes," stated 
Krzaklewski. Earlier statements by "S" leaders suggested that, 
if the talks with the government failed, one should expect, if 
not an escalation of protests, at least their continuation. 
During their session, most KK members were unanimous in saying 
that the entire action and the talks with the government held so 
far were not a spectacular success. "The strikes made it 
possible to regulate the legal status of the Trilateral 
Committee for Socioeconomic Affairs and the issue of the 
representativeness of unions," said Maciej Jankowski. The 
Mazowsze leader, who is said to be the greatest radical, 
admitted that strikes were dying down and that "today there is 
not a good atmosphere for strikes." Similar views were 
expressed by other KK members. "The union has regained a good 
position in society. The protest should be continued; we should 
fight for public support. We should keep pointing to the 
discrepancies between preelection declarations and the 
activities of the government coalition. In the fall, price 
increases will be most numerous; this is when a wave of strikes 
will surge. Let us use this time to collect strike funds," 
appealed Jacek Rybicki, of Gdansk. According to "S" Spokesman 
Piotr Zak, it was finally decided that the protest action would 
not be discontinued; but, at the same time, no serious strikes 
should be expected. He announced street demonstrations and "a 
major propaganda campaign." The fundamental goal is still 
collecting money for the strike fund. 
  Most of the "S" decisionmakers believe that a meeting with 
President Lech Walesa is necessary--skeptics believe that only 
after Walesa defines his intentions, others that cooperation is 
needed because both Walesa and the union would like the present 
postcommunist government to step down. There was not much 
enthusiasm over the recent proposal by Zbigniew Religa; he 
proposed that the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] 
become a political representative of "S" in the Sejm. "Many 
BBWR activists are antiunion," some said. The KK decided that 
the Sixth National Congress of "S" delegates would be held 
between 30 June and 2 July in Mielec.

<F P=106> ["Albania Asks the UN Security Council To Condemn Greece" -- </F>
ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 14, (ATA) -- Albania asked the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] to condemn Greece for the Sunday attack 
by "Greek terroristic commandos" against a military training 
centre of the Albanian Army in the Peshkepi village, near the 
border with Greece. As is known, an Albanian officer and one 
soldier were killed. 
  In a letter to the president of the UN Security Council, Mr. 
Colin Keating, on Tuesday, the Albanian foreign minister, Alfred 
Serreqi pointed out that the incident is "a grave terroristic 
act," "A massacre of the people while they were sleeping," and 
"a serious violation of the territorial integrity and 
sovereignty of Albania with clear and premeditated aims." This 
act aims not only at deteriorating the present relations between 
the two countries but also to the aggravation of the situation 
in the Balkans, the letter says. It is part of a coordinate 
strategy, in order to create premises for the expansion of the 
conflict in the south of the Balkans." 
  The Government of the Republic of Albania asks the Security 
Council to denounce powerfully the Greek Government and to rank 
Greece among the countries that exercise state terror, and to 
make pressure on the Government of Greece, demanding it to throw 
light on this grave incident, to find out and punish the authors 
of the crime. 
  On wednesday, the Albanian Foreign Ministry declared 
"persona 
non grata" the Greek general consul in Gjirokaster "because of 
his activity not in accordance with his status." In revenge for 
this act, the Greek Government adopted the same measure against 
the first secretary ofthe Albanian Embassy in Athens, Kastriot 
Robo.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "President Berisha Meets With the </F>
German Ambassador in Tirana, Claus Vollers, Representative of 
the European Union Troika to Albania"] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 14 (ATA) -- The president of Republic 
of Albania, Sali Berisha, met April 13 with the ambassador of 
the FR [Federal Republic] of Germany in Tirana, His Excellency 
Claus Vollers, representative of the EU troika to Albania. 
President Berisha said: 
  "I called you to this meeting as representative of the EU 
troika, and the same information will also be sent to the 
Belgian Foreign Ministry asking you to inform the governments of 
the EU member countries of the following: 
  "Albania has the necessary documentation that the Greek 
terrorist commando came from the territory of Greece, and after 
the crime, that is, the massacre in the recruits' garrison of 
Peshkepia e Siperme in the early hours of April 10, 1994, in 
which it killed Captain Fatmir Shehu (age 34, born in Tepelena) 
and soldier Arsen Gjini (age 20, born in Seman) and wounded many 
other soldiers, out of whom three very seriously, the commando 
returned to the territory of Greece in the direction of the 
border crossing point of Argjirohor. 
  "The Greek military uniform of the criminals, the 
professionalism of crime, the objects found, which are part of 
the equipment of the special units, prove the argument that the 
Greek commando belonged to the special units of Greece, or had a 
special training. The Albanian Government, in its April 10 note 
addressed to the Greek Government, although it blamed the Greek 
Government for the incident, as the terrorist commando came for 
its territory and returned to the same place, asked the Greek 
Government to find out and punish the authors of the crime, as 
it might not be directly responsible for the incident. But, 
press releases of the Greek Government not only did not show 
regret for the incident, but we learned that this responsibility 
laid on the Greek Government was interpreted by the government 
of Athens as a contradiction of the Albanian note. 
  "Just as in the case of the fire opened by a Greek war-ship 
against an Albanian motor boat in the Albanian territorial 
waters, in the Bay of Saranda on January 4, 1994, that of the 
Greek mine sweeper in the Albanian territories near the Cape of 
Qefali on March 10, of the two Greek armed soldiers who entered 
Vidohova on March 12 and threatened Albanian citizens, or that 
of the killing of Alfred Muco, 20 years old, by Greek patrols on 
March 21, Greece has chosen to deny the fact giving no official 
response. 
  "In revenge for the dispatch of the general consul from 
Gjirokaster, who along with indecent activity has acted contrary 
to the post of the consul he was holding without having the 
approval by the host country, in complete flagrant opposition to 
Article 12 of the Vienna Convention, Greece did not expel our 
consul in Athens but the first secretary of the Albanian Embassy 
in Athens. 
  "In these conditions, Albania is not going to follow a 
policy 
of revenge by expelling from Tirana serious Greek diplomats, but 
on the basis of Article 11 of the Vienna Convention which says 
that 'In case a clear agreement does not exist about the number 
of the embassy staffs, the host country may ask that this number 
be in the limits it considers as reasonable and normal, taking 
into consideration the conditions existing in that country and 
the needs of the said mission,' asks from the Greek Government 
to take all measures so that within ten days it has the same 
number of diplomats in Tirana as the number of Albanian 
diplomats in Athens, respectively 6 diplomats, otherwise this 
number must be defined on the basis of a bilateral agreement. 
  "Albania asks the Council of Ministers of the EU to demand 
from Greece to give an official answer on the event. 
  "Albania is for dialogue, but it will not accept the 
meetings 
offered without having received an official reply from the Greek 
Government for the grave terroristic act. 
  "Albania demands from the Council of Ministers of the 
European Union to verify all the above terroristic acts and 
voices its readiness for full cooperation with these commission. 
We also agree that this task be trusted to the existing 
observers commission of the EU that is observing our 
northeastern border, but since the chairman of the turn of the 
commission for this six month period is a Greek official, 
according to recognized principle of the international law, he 
will not be a party in the judgment. 
  "We also ask the Council of Ministers of the EU to demand 
from Greece to put an end to these acts condemnable by the UN 
charter and which runs counter to the Maastricht principles of 
which Greece has promised it will observe. We would like to 
assure Greece that Albania is resolute to cooperate with the EU 
and its member countries, the countries of the region and Greece 
and all other countries that are interested in the lowering of 
tension and the stability in the region."

<F P=106> ["Albanian Delegation in the Council of Europe Protests </F>
Against the Criminal Act of Greek Terrorists" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 13 (ATA) -- On the request of the 
Albanian permanent parliamentary delegation, headed by Mr. 
Eduard Selami, a meeting was organized yesterday evening with 
Mr. Martinez, the president of Parliamentary Assembly of Council 
of Europe [CE]. The aim of this meeting was to inform Mr. 
Martinez and to protest against the criminal act of Greek 
commandos in Albanian territory. 
  After the presentation of Albanian Government, note of 
protest to the Greek Government, Mr. Selami set forth to Mr. 
Martinez a review of the relationship between the two countries, 
and informed him on the policy of certain Greek ultra 
nationalists circles as well as their continuous attempts that 
aim at thwarting the relations and destabilizing the situation 
in Albania. The policy of these circles has affected Greek 
official policy, added Selami, which is reflected in its 
attempts to hinder Albanian integration to European structures 
and in their anti-human stand towards Albanian emigrants as well 
as the unprecedented case of the open aggression against 
Albanian people and its sovereignty. This policy, pointed out 
Selami, is against the peace process in the region and runs 
contrary to the EU [European Union] policy, member of which is 
Greece as well. Further, Mr. Selami requested from Mr. Martinez 
to intervene in the Council of Europe to examine this terrorist 
act against the Albanian Republic and to arrest this attitude 
that aims to put the whole Balkan region in fire. Greece, as a 
member of Council of Europe, should be responsible for trampling 
down international rules that adjust the relationship between 
the two countries. On his part, Mr. Martinez thanked the 
Albanian delegation for the information in relation to Greek 
commandos terrorist act against Albania. We are worried about 
the Greek policy in Balkans, added Mr. Martinez. This is a 
grave incident and we will investigate it closely in order that 
the culprits should bear the responsibility. 
  Albanian delegation had other meetings with several deputies 
of many European countries and informed them about this 
terrorist act. The delegation will present this issue in the 
meetings of several parliamentary commissions and other 
political groups. The note of protest was delivered to all the 
delegations and members of Council of Europe as well as the 
diplomatic corpses accredited in Strasbourg.

  [Text] President Sali Berisha held a meeting with His 
Excellency Claus Vollers, German ambassador in Tirana and a 
representative of the troika of the European Union [EU] in 
Albania. 
  I have invited you to this meeting, President Berisha 
addressed Vollers, as a representative of the EU troika. We 
will send the same report to the Foreign Ministry of Belgium 
with the request that you inform the governments of the EU 
member countries as follows: 
  Albania has the necessary documentation to prove that the 
Greek terrorist unit came from Greece and that after the crime 
-- the massacre in the recruits' barracks in Peshkepi e Siperme 
in the early hours of 10 April, which resulted in the killing of 
33-year-old Captain Fatmir Shehu, born in Tepelene, and 
20-year-old soldier Arsen Gjini, born in Seman, as well as the 
wounding of several other soldiers, three of whom are in serious 
condition -- turned back toward Greece in the direction of the 
Argjirohor border post. 
  The Greek military uniforms that the criminals were wearing, 
the professionalism of the crime, and the objects that were 
found, which are all part of the special units' equipment, speak 
in favor of the argument that the Greek unit belongs to Greece's 
special units and is subject to special treatment. 
  In its note dated 10 April addressed to the Greek Government 
-- in which the Greek Government is held responsible, since the 
terrorist unit came from Greece -- the Albanian Government asked 
the Greek Government to find and convict the culprits, as it may 
not be directly responsible for the event. 
  However, from the press statements of the Greek Government, 
we have not only heard about its regret over the event, but we 
have learned that this responsibility of the Greek Government 
was interpreted as a contradiction of the Albanian note by the 
Athens government. 
  As in the cases of the Greek warship firing on an Albanian 
motorboat in our territorial waters in Sarande Bay on 4 January 
1994, the violation by the Greek minesweeper of our waters near 
the Qefal Cape on 10 March, the entrance on 12 March of two 
armed Greek soldiers in Vidohov, who threatened the Albanian 
citizens, or the murder of 20-year-old Alfred Muco by a Greek 
patrol on 21 March, Greece has followed the path of denying the 
facts and washing its hands of it by giving no official response. 
  As revenge against the departure of the person appointed by 
Athens as a consul general in Gjirokaster, who was not only 
exerting indecent behavior that was incompatible with that of a 
diplomat but was also carrying out the duties of a consul 
without having the documentation [ekzakuature] accorded by the 
receiving country, which is in flagrant violation of Article 12 
of the Vienna Convention, Greece did not expel our consul in 
Athens but rather the first secretary of our embassy in Athens. 
  Under these conditions, Albania does not intend to seek 
revenge by expelling Greek diplomats from Tirana. However, 
based on Article 11 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic 
relations, which states that due to the lack of a clear 
agreement on the mission's staff, the receiving state can 
request that this staff be kept at a limit it considers 
reasonable by considering the circumstances and conditions that 
exist in this state and the needs of the mission in question, 
Albania therefore asks the Greek Government to take all measures 
so that within 10 days, it will have the same number of 
diplomats in Albania as Albania has in Athens -- that is, six 
diplomats. This number could also be defined on the basis of a 
bilateral agreement. 
  Albania requests the EU Council of Ministers to ask Greece 
to 
provide an official response to this event. Albania is for 
dialogue, but it will not accept the meetings offered without 
having an official response by the Greek Government on this 
Greek terrorist act. Albania asks the EU Council of Ministers 
to set up a commission to verify all the aforementioned 
terrorist acts and expresses its readiness for full cooperation 
with this commission. 
  We add that we have no objection to trust this duty to the 
existing commission of the EU monitors who are supervising our 
northeast border, but as the commission chairman for this 
six-month period is a Greek official, according to a known 
principle of the right, he cannot represent a party in the 
judgment. 
  We also ask the EU Council of Ministers to demand from 
Greece 
to put an end to these acts condemned by the UN Charter and 
which fully violate the Maastricht principles, which Greece has 
committed to keep and develop. We want to assure it that 
Albania is determined to cooperate with the European Union and 
the member countries, the regional countries, and Greece, as 
well as all the other countries who are interested in decreasing 
tension and contributing to peace and stability in the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev by an </F>
unidentified correspondent in Sofia on 13 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The Government Press Center has 
announced that Prime Minister Professor Lyuben Berov is in 
quarantine and is not allowed to have any contact with other 
people over the next few days. 
  Professor Berov took part in the work of the cabinet on 7, 
8, 
and 10 April, but on 11 April developed clinical symptoms that 
aroused suspicions that he had hepatitis. Laboratory tests are 
now being conducted to confirm this, and the results will be 
announced tomorrow or on the following day, the Government Press 
Center announced. 
  According to acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, 
Professor Berov will be in quarantine for seven or eight days. 
He said that Professor Berov's state of health did not prevent 
him from having two lengthy conversations with the prime 
minister today. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent] If I may comment on the 
delicate fact of the deterioriation in the prime minister's 
health, in this aspect, was the decision for him to come back to 
work not made somewhat prematurely, so as to serve a particular 
political situation? 
  [Matinchev] I always maintained that what Professor Berov 
wanted to prove was beyond his powers. He is a man who during 
the period of his recuperation -- even if the process is 90 
percent complete -- a man must always take account of the fact 
that in such a case, anyone's health is extremely fragile. 
  [Correspondent] Nevertheless, the public has been left with 
the conviction that it was not a question of his own decision 
but a decision imposed from outside. 
  [Matinchev] Precisely in connection with everything that 
people have started saying about this, I can tell you that it 
was the prime minister's own personal decision. If you were to 
ask me what my own personal attitude is, I advised him that he 
simply must limit his contacts to a minimum and leave to me and 
my colleague the matters concerning the administration of the 
Council of Ministers. 
  [Correspondent] It would follow that his return to work 
simply saved the cabinet. 
  [Matinchev] No, I would not say this is so. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, by Julius Gembicky in Budapest; date not given: 
"If I Win, I Offer Reconciliation"] 
  [Text] The Socialists' enormous edge in the latest polls 
on party preferences prior to the May elections in neighboring 
Hungary comes as a surprise, to say the least, to many 
competitors. For the right-wing government coalition and the 
Christian Democrats it is downright devastating. The election 
campaign proper starts on Friday, 8 April; in the course of the 
campaign, there will be a moratorium on press, radio, and 
television interviews with the parties' electoral leaders. 
NARODNA OBRODA has therefore asked Gyula Horn, chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], to reply to our questions now. 
  [Gembicky] Mr. Chairman, to what do you ascribe your 
position as the favorite? 
  [Horn] After 1990, several parliamentary parties tried to 
isolate the Socialists. Our reply was an intensive dialogue 
with society. In Parliament we concentrated only on specific 
solutions to society's transformation. Why was this important? 
The fact is that we did not inherit the new social and 
political configuration from Rakosi's regime. Quite the 
contrary, Kadar's barracks were regarded even in the West as the 
merriest in Central and Eastern Europe. Even under Kadar's 
regime, there existed elements of the market economy and its 
management. As early as January 1988, we passed in Hungary the 
law on the freedom of private enterprise, which would have been 
inconceivable in Slovakia at that time. We ourselves enabled, 
by means of law, the emergence of a multiparty society and 
maintained open contacts with Western democracies. This 
distinguished us from the CSSR [Czechoslovak Socialist Republic] 
and the other countries of this region. Hence, there was 
something to build on. The new government that emerged from the 
elections in 1990 tried to change all kinds of things. 
Unfortunately, it did not focus on economic transformation but 
on ideological issues and the unproductive reassessment of the 
past. This was not all that interesting to ordinary people, who 
want to know how they are going to make a living. We therefore 
decided to deal precisely with those issues that are of interest 
to the broadest sections of society. That is one of the main 
causes of our party's popularity. We purposefully refrained 
from personal invectives against political adversaries In 
Parliament. Simply, we dealt with the down-to-earth problems of 
our country. And, last but not least, it needs to be said that 
we have a competent team of politicians and experts to translate 
those principles into reality. I myself was a member of 
Nemeth's cabinet, which had a European hallmark [punc] abroad as 
well as at home. 
  [Gembicky] Even though you top the pre-election polls with 
between 30 and 33 percent of the vote, it could happen to you 
that your competitors join forces and push you into the 
opposition once again after the elections. With whom would you 
be ready to form a post-election coalition, should a coalition 
be necessary? 
  [Horn] That is the most frequent question I have been asked 
recently. The reply? It will be given by the two-round 
elections. We will see then with whom we can cooperate and with 
whom not. 
  [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, can even a coalition with the 
right-wing Liberals from Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats] 
be considered? 
  [Horn] I do not know what Fidesz is up to because it changes 
its opinions every month. But we do consider the possibility of 
a coalition with Liberals, particularly with the Free Democrats 
[Alliance of Free Democrats -- SZDSZ]. 
  [Gembicky] A few days ago the parties making up today's 
government coalition pushed through in Hungarian Parliament the 
adoption of a screening law. An important, and perhaps sole, 
reason for the passage of this law was the endeavor to eliminate 
the most formidable competitor -- Gyula Horn. Will the law 
apply to you, in view of your participation in Ministry of 
Interior units in 1956? Do you have a chance to successfully 
defend yourself against this accusation and those pressures? 
  [Horn] This law was not passed personally against me. It 
should affect, above all, hidden resident agents. There are no 
secret spots in my biography, neither in the fifties, nor in the 
sixties or later years. Besides, the screening law does not 
provide for any sanctions. Its sole aim is to make the past of 
Hungarian political officials more transparent. 
  [Gembicky] What is the Hungarian Socialists' recipe for 
reducing tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations? 
  [Horn] I do not think that the Hungarians and Slovaks as 
nations stand in opposition to one another. We want to push for 
historical reconciliation with neighbors and, therefore, we must 
not allow nationalist politicians to take the helm in any of our 
countries. Therefore, there is no need to deal primarily with 
the past, with the burden represented by historical treaties. 
That is of no real significance. Should we become a government 
party, we would want to conclude a large general agreement with 
the Slovak Republic that ought to be the first big step toward 
building up mutual trust. On the part of Hungary, this 
agreement must chiefly contain the element of unchangeability of 
current borders. At the same time, the two sides should pledge 
to observe the rights of ethnic minorities living on their 
territories. This commitment would apply to both Hungarians in 
Slovakia and Slovaks in Hungary. The other element should be a 
general activation of mutual relations because, in my opinion, 
little has been done in the economic sphere although both 
Slovakia and Hungary acutely need new markets. The 
clarification of neuralgic points in the past should be left to 
historians, instead of drawing into them politicians, who keep 
reviving them and highlighting their relevance as its suits 
their needs. That is pointless. As regards matters that 
introduce neurosis [neurotizuju] into our mutual relations, such 
as military issues, we must establish a system of mutual 
consultations. It is simply not true that Hungary is building 
up its army against Slovakia or that Slovakia is building up its 
army against Hungary. There are several such mutual problems 
that would require very intensive bilateral talks. 
  It would be very unfortunate if the practice of relations 
introduced by the present Hungarian Government and the former 
cabinet of Vladimir Meciar were to be perpetuated. Whenever any 
Hungarian nationalist made any oblique remark about Slovakia, 
Meciar immediately reacted to it. And the view of a narrow 
group was presented as the official Hungarian position. Let me 
say one more thing in conclusion. In my opinion, Hungary must 
support all efforts aimed at Slovakia's integration into 
European structures -- naturally, under conditions as are 
applicable to everyone. And, as far as you are concerned, I 
would recommend that you leave in peace the question of 
bilingual city and village signposts and constitutionally 
guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. We also do not 
consider right all your ideas about Slovakia's territorial and 
administrative division and the reorganization of state 
administration and local self-administration, because the 
intended arrangement does not sufficiently accommodate the 
demands of Hungarians living in Slovakia. 
  [Gembicky] What significance do you attribute to cooperation 
among Visegrad countries from the long-term viewpoint? 
  [Horn] Visegrad needs to be kept alive, even though, to be 
honest, I do not think that this cooperation has any great 
prospects. I prefer the enhancement of bilateral relations 
between the member countries of this group. 
  [Gembicky] One bone of contention in our relations is the 
Gabcikovo hydroelectric project and the demand that we increase 
the flow of water in the old riverbed of the Danube. Do you 
think that you will be able to find with the provisional 
government, or with the government that will emerge in Slovakia 
after the fall parliamentary elections, common language and a 
compromise even in this matter? 
  [Horn] Results can only be achieved by means of compromise. 
This problem, too, needs to be consistently depoliticized and 
its solution must be left to experts. The Hungarian side's 
demand that Slovakia secure sufficient flow of water is 
justified. Therefore, this is not a political but a practical 
problem for experts. Not only the present Moravcik government 
but also the one that will be appointed after the fall elections 
must be a true partner in solving this problem. 
  [Gembicky] A broad-coalition government has taken up office 
in Slovakia. Is there, in your opinion, a chance, and does the 
political will exist, for a historic Hungarian-Slovak settlement 
in the near future? 
  [Horn] I assess the first steps of the Moravcik government 
positively. He wants to negotiate and cooperate, which is 
encouraging. I therefore think that it is worthwhile to 
negotiate with Mr. Moravcik even in the brief period prior to 
the elections. 
  [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, do you not think that the present 
government coalition headed by the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF] might try to make up for all the missed opportunities in 
Slovak-Hungarian relations even before the elections, only to 
reverse the preferences indicated by pre-election polls? 
  [Horn] Such a reversal cannot be party business. Even if we 
have some disputes with the MDF in the way we view bilateral 
relations, bilateral relations represent state interest and, 
therefore, I do not believe that the MDF could change the 
existing trend in bilateral relations in some radical way before 
the elections. The opposition parties maintain good relations 
with their Slovak counterparts, so that they would be capable of 
securing continuity in Hungarian-Slovak relations even after the 
elections. 
  [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, do you think that the Hungarian nation 
is prepared to accept a socialist government or a socialist 
prime minister? 
  [Horn] Let this be determined by the voters. We have a 
chance to win, we have many sympathizers, but I do not know 
whether this will be enough. I only know that many are ready to 
accept a socialist government, not only in our own country but 
also abroad, including large financial institutions. As the 
Polish example has shown, a left-wing government can manage to 
conclude agreements abroad that are very advantageous for the 
country. I do not see any problem for the Socialists to 
participate in a coalition government either. 
  [Gembicky] What is the nature of your relations with the 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] of Peter Weiss? Wherein do 
your views coincide and wherein do the views between the 
Hungarian Socialist Party and the SDL differ? 
  [Horn] We have very good contacts with the SDL and with 
Peter Weiss personally. We also have identical views on most 
problems. If differences appear, it is always in connection with 
our views on how to deal with the position of the Hungarian 
ethnic minority in Slovakia. But we will be able to come to an 
agreement even on this issue. The SDL's policy is in conformity 
with European criteria and I am therefore an optimist even with 
regard to the Hungarian minority. I have only the best things 
to say about Peter Weiss. If we, but also the SDL, became 
government parties after the elections, it would have a positive 
influence on bilateral relations and their improvement. 
  [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 9 April on page 3, 
under the headline "What Has Remained in the Notebook; Mass 
Media and Government Propaganda," carries the following 200-word 
report: 
  ["Recently we published an interview that was given by 
Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn to our editor 
Julius Gembicky. One question from that interview, which is 
topical in Budapest and Bratislava alike, remained in the 
notebook: 
  [[Gembicky] ``During its reciprocal visit to Budapest, a 
delegation of the Slovak Syndicate of Journalists familiarized 
itself with the situation in Hungarian Radio and Television in 
the wake of the March personnel purges in these two most 
important media, which had been initiated behind the scenes by 
the government. What is the Hungarian Socialists' attitude 
toward these events, which took place shortly before the 
elections? 
  [[Horn] ``We consider it unacceptable for the government to 
try to bring large media under its control. Regrettably, the 
enforced changes have already made themselves felt in programs, 
which are dominated by government propaganda. This is 
undemocratic and a gross violation of the principles of freedom 
of speech. After the elections in May it will be necessary to 
pass a big media law and establish a nonpartisan body to oversee 
the electronic media so that they do not depend on a single 
political party.'']

  [Text] [Announcer] The subject of Romania's stand toward 
the latest developments in Bosnia was brought up at a news 
conference held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today. Here 
is a report from our correspondent Doina Saiciuc. 
  [Begin Saiciuc recording] The issue of the Bosnian conflict 
was brought up at this news conference, in the wake of the 
latest reactions of the North Atlantic Alliance. Journalists 
asked Spokesman Mircea Geoana to present Romania's comments on 
the latest developments. Before relaying his statement, I would 
like to emphasize that another indication of the Romanian 
diplomacy's initiative in the region is that an agreement has 
been reached in principle for Bosnia's President Alija 
Izetbegovic to pay an imminent visit to Bucharest, a visit that 
the Romanian side is looking forward to with great interest. 
  As I said before, Mircea Geoana, spokesman of the Romanian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented on the situation in 
Bosnia, which reiterated Romania's position. 
  [Geoana] Everybody knows of the actions undertaken by NATO 
in Gorazde, following a decision made by the UN secretary 
general in this respect and in accordance with certain known UN 
Security Council resolutions. You are familiar with the 
position promoted by Romania, that the main goal and the only 
way to solve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is through the 
determination of all sides to engage in political dialogue and 
reach a lasting and substantial negotiated solution to the 
conflict in that region. It is obvious that the main thing now 
is to bring all the sides back to the negotiating table and to 
ensure their cooperation. We are firmly convinced that this is 
the only possible solution. At the same time, we believe that 
the existence of certain UN Security Council resolutions and the 
prevalence of certain realities in the field should not be 
neglected when analyses are made and decisions are taken by all 
the sides involved in the conflict. I particularly refer to the 
Gorazde town area and the latest developments of yesterday and 
today. 
  Therefore, we continue firmly to advocate a political and 
negotiated solution there and we are striving, to the best of 
our rather modest possibilities, to contribute to such a 
solution. We are keenly waiting to see and seriously examine 
the impact of these actions and of the official positions of 
various important capitals on the progress of the negotiations.

  [Text] The session of the FRY Assembly Chamber of Citizens 
that was interrupted about 20 days ago has resumed. Here is 
Mirjana Protic reporting from the Assembly building: 
  [Begin Protic recording] Fifteen minutes ago, the Federal 
Assembly Chamber of Citizens adopted the Federal Assembly 
declaration concerning the air strikes on the Serbian positions 
in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Yugoslav Assembly 
declaration states: The Federal Assembly of the FRY resolutely 
condemns the NATO armed attacks under UN auspices that caused 
destruction and casualties among the civilian population. 
Having carried out these armed attacks, the United Nations has 
abandoned its impartial peaceful role and openly sided with the 
Muslim side in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Federal Assembly expresses extreme concern about the 
(?unselective) consequences these attacks may have on ending the 
civil war and on reaching a just political solution in the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is known that the clashes have 
escalated because the protected zones, particularly the one in 
Gorazde, were used by Muslims for attacking Serbian positions. 
The United Nations has not ensured disarmament within the 
protected zone which it was obligated to do, nor did it react to 
Muslim military actions coming from the protected zones, nor did 
it exert influence on the Muslim side to stop armed activities. 
  Behaving in that way the United Nations has taken on itself 
the risk and responsibility for all possible consequences that 
cannot be predicted at the moment. 
  It is regretful that the very United Nations that is 
obligated by its Charter to keep peace and international 
security is taking a step that causes the war to escalate and 
threatens the peace process. 
  The Federal Assembly warns that the policy of pressure, 
ultimatums, and armed attacks against the Serbian side does not 
lead to a peaceful solution of the civil war in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Federal Assembly calls on the United Nations to stop 
immediately aggressive actions against the Serbian people, to 
abandon double standards toward the participants in the civil 
war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, to resume dialogue on 
ceasing all military activities, and to seek a solution 
exclusively in a political way, through negotiations, respecting 
the interests of all sides. 
  The FRY will continue its hitherto constructive policy of 
active participation in the peace process. However, the FRY 
will not and cannot be indifferent toward actions that represent 
armed attacks on the Serbian people in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and will continue to monitor closely the 
further development of the situation. Thus concludes the 
Federal Assembly declaration that has just been adopted at the 
session of the Chamber of Citizens. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, April 13 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Defence 
Minister Pavle Bulatovic on Wednesday described NATO air strikes 
on Bosnian Serb positions as an act of aggression against the 
Serb people, which could have unconceivable consequences. 
  In a statement to the Yugoslav news agency TANJUG, Bulatovic 
said that the United Nations had sided with the Moslems and thus 
discredited its peacekeeping role and moral prestige. 
  No one may use "arms to deny anybody's right to defend 
themselves and the Serb people have a legitimate natural right 
to self-defence, guaranteed them by the U.N. Charter," he said. 
  The defence minister said that NATO bombing of Serb 
positions 
around Gorazde had hit "not only all the Serbs, but also the 
conscience of every man opting for peace and ending of the war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [no closing quotation mark as received] 
  Said Bulatovic: If NATO's aim had been to persuade all 
warring sides to start negotiating it produced nothing but an 
exactly opposite effect -- it encouraged those favouring a war 
option, and worried those well aware that peace cannot be 
reached by the force of arms. 
  He went on to say that, after an impartial justice show, 
representing an act of aggression against the Serb people, which 
could bring about unforeseeable consequences, one should expect 
and hope that NATO would give up the law of the stronger and 
enable the warring sides to lay their arms and return to 
negotiating a peaceful settlement.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb forces shelled the 
airport and town of Tuzla in northern Bosnia Thursday after an 
observation post of a Nordic UN battalion there came under brief 
artillery attack, a United Nations spokesman said. 
  Eleven shells fell on the airport mid-morning and three fell 
on the market in Tuzla, said Major Dacre Holloway with the UN 
Protection Force. There were no injuries, Halloway said. 
  He said the Nordic UN troops' observation post was hit with 
artillery fire early Thursday but gave no other details. 
  Elsewhere Thursday, Serb forces seized 17 UN peacekeepers 
guarding a weapons stockpile at Cifluk, northwest of the capital 
Sarajevo and just inside the heavy weapons exclusion zone around 
the capital ordered by the UN in February. 
  Tuzla's airport, closed since the start of the conflict two 
years ago, was opened under the threat of NATO bombardment of 
Serb positions only last month, allowing UN relief flights to 
bring humanitarian aid to hard-hit northern and central Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Article by Antoni Z. Kaminski and Lech Kosciuk: "The </F>
Polish Wedge; If Policies Vis-a-Vis the West Eliminate Chances 
in the East, That Means They Are Bad"] 
  [Text] Lech Kosciuk is chief expert at the Defense 
Ministry's Department of Strategic Studies, while Antoni Z. 
Kaminski, a professor at Warsaw University, used to be a 
director at the same department. While writing about Poland's 
security, they are making unpopular arguments, the most 
important of which is the following: A position based on making 
claims is the worst way of conducting foreign policy. We do not 
share the authors' suppositions that Poland's joining NATO would 
be disadvantageous to the West. 
  While making efforts to join NATO, one should remember that 
Poland is just an element of the European security arrangement. 
Such a perception of Poland was the foundation for the recent 
decisions made in Brussels. The collapse of the bipolar system 
has not resulted in an elimination of dangers. The scale and 
nature of the dangers have changed, and they have become less 
clear, but, nevertheless, they continue to exist and to be a 
challenge for individual countries of the continent, as well as 
for international institutions. These circumstances make it 
imperative to maintain a global perspective while thinking about 
the foundations of European security. 
  The world order, including the European order, is based on 
the strength and efficiency of institutions that constitute its 
foundation, regardless of the fact that those institutions were 
established in the period of the Cold War. Careless 
manipulation with institutional structures creates the danger of 
destabilizing the international order, and, consequently, of 
destabilizing also the global arrangement of forces. In other 
words, the disappearance of the bipolar world did not eliminate 
the need for thinking along the lines of a global arrangement of 
forces, and also along the lines of a feeling of responsibility 
for the fate of the world. This has important implications for 
both our membership in NATO and Russia's place in the European 
security arrangement. 
  In the eyes of the West, the problem of Russia is linked to 
the dangers that are a consequence of that country's huge 
nuclear potential and numerous nuclear power stations, whose 
disastrous condition may lead to results that could be similar 
to those after nuclear weapons are used. It is unacceptable for 
Russia to give up its cooperation with the West by taking a 
hostile position and by becoming, for instance, an ally to 
countries ruled by irresponsible leaders (Iraq, Libya, North 
Korea) or by involving itself openly on the Serbian side of the 
Yugoslav conflict. This becomes a global strategic imperative. 
A development of uncontrolled processes inside Russia may bring 
about different, although equally disastrous for the world, 
effects--for instance, as a result of extremist elements seizing 
control of nuclear weapons. It may also bring about the danger 
of an uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear technologies and of 
nuclear weapons themselves. Polish people must be aware of all 
these problems while developing their relationship with the West. 
  From the standpoint of the degree of advancement of 
transformations of the political and economic system, and also 
from the standpoint of the degree of coming close to the Western 
world, postcommunist Europe may be divided into four groups: 1) 
The Czech Republic, Poland, Slovenia, and Hungary; 2) The 
Baltic states, Bulgaria, Romania, and the Slovak Republic; 3) 
Russia; 4) Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova. 
  The first four countries listed are the most advanced in the 
process of building democratic structures and market economies. 
With regard to those countries, one can assume that the 
processes are irreversible and that the countries' institutional 
integration with the West will be accomplished relatively soon, 
through which the area of stability on the European Continent 
will be widened. 
  The second group of countries listed will also most probably 
go down the same road, even though the countries' starting point 
is less advantageous than in the case of the first group. In 
particular, the countries face a much bigger danger of involving 
themselves both in domestic and external conflicts. The 
remaining two groups constitute special cases. 

<H5>    Russia at a Crossroads </H5>
  Russia continues to be facing the choice of its way of 
development. In comparison with Ukraine and Belarus, Russia is 
still more advanced in the process of market transformations. 
It also has reached a certain level of stabilization and of 
strengthening its state structures, which cannot be said of the 
other two countries. It is worth stressing that, with its 
experienced diplomats, clerical personnel, and various experts 
in the field of international relations and strategic issues, 
and also having been a member of the world configuration of 
forces for hundreds of years now, Russia, the widely accepted 
successor to the USSR, has been handling its sovereignty much 
better than the other post-Soviet republics. 
  Unless Russia falls apart, it will definitely retain the 
status of a world superpower. The question arises: What will 
its nature be? Will it be a civilized power, characterized by 
restraint, or will it be an Eastern despotic country? So far, 
it can be seen that Russia strives at incorporating the big 
Slavic republics and also at making the Baltic states dependent 
on Finland, to say the least. 
  Russia's protest against Lithuania's joining "Partnership 
for 
Peace" is a clear sign of the above. Political destabilization 
in Ukraine, caused by the state's weakness, economic collapse, 
or by both factors at the same time, may lead to the Yugoslav 
scenario repeating itself on a much bigger scale and in a much 
more strategic part of Europe, not to mention the fact that 
nuclear states will be involved in these events. So we are 
witnessing strife that may lead to a serious change in the 
arrangement of forces in this part of Europe, and that may also 
result in major political destabilization and a consequent 
threat to security. 
  Russia's turn in the imperial direction being described here 
is not irreversible. There is an awareness visible in Russian 
political circles that a reconstruction of the empire and market 
transformations are two separate and contradictory options. 
Symptoms of that are visible in responses to the Belarusian 
affair [not further specified]. It is not the case that the 
West errs in principle by thinking that it has the power to 
influence events inside Russia. The influence is not of course 
determinant, but, in a situation where Russian reformers remain 
a significant political force, the factor should not be ignored. 
One can agree with the view that the reformers also want 
Russia's position as a superpower to be rebuilt, but there is no 
doubt that they want to achieve this through different means. 
Leading Russian reformers are aware of a dilemma that exists 
between implementing imperial goals through political and 
military means on the one hand, and a continuation of the 
process of rebuilding the Russian economy, using the free market 
as foundation, on the other. A strong response by the West, 
primarily by the United States, may perform a sobering function. 
<H5>  Intentions and Costs </H5>
  Postcommunist countries undergoing reforms began, naturally, 
to look for ways of linking themselves to Western political, 
economic, and defense structures. The countries wanted to gain, 
first of all, support for the reform process, as well as a 
minimum degree of protection. So they addressed the 
EC--currently the European Union [EU]--and also NATO. Those 
efforts caused a number of serious dilemmas for both of these 
structures. One of the more popularly debated dilemmas was the 
issue of a possible widening of the Community, which dominated 
its meetings in 1991 and 1992. 
  As a defense structure established in the Cold War period, 
NATO was suddenly faced with extremely complicated problems of 
adaptation. The decrease in international tensions led to a 
reduction--an excessive one, according to some--in defense 
expenditures. Political pressure is increasing in the United 
States, aimed at reducing the U.S. military presence in Europe. 
True enough, NATO did introduce a number of major changes in its 
functioning: A "New Strategic Concept" was elaborated, the 
defense system has been reorganized, and, most importantly, an 
effort was made to open up the alliance to its former enemies. 
But the issue of accepting new members into NATO is a 
qualitatively completely different kind of decision. Technical 
obstacles, which are being considered by NATO member states and 
which are impediments to widening the organization, require a 
serious approach. 
  Trevor Taylor, a British security expert, can see the 
following obstacles: 
  --First, a negative impact of the decision to widen NATO on 
the political situation in Russia. 
  --Second, a disorganization in the area of NATO's doctrine, 
structure, and development of forces. 
  --Third, under conditions of economic recession, tensions 
would increase in the area of assets that have been excessively 
reduced to begin with. 
  --Fourth, even debates on the granting of observer status in 
NATO to countries of East and Central Europe caused sharp 
differences of opinion among the alliance's members. If the 
issue of membership were to be debated, these discrepancies 
would definitely increase even more. As a result, a weakening 
of NATO's coherency would follow. 
  --Fifth, given that countries with unstabilized political 
and 
economic structures would become NATO members, one could fear 
that the alliance would not be able to effectively influence the 
countries' behavior. Another problem along the lines of the 
Greek-Turkish one would weaken NATO significantly. 
  --Sixth, other postcommunist countries with even more 
troublesome legacies would line up to become NATO members, and 
that would put in question the credibility of NATO's security 
guarantees. Finally, along with the withdrawal of Russian 
troops from East and Central Europe, the military threat was 
radically reduced, which means that these countries do not need 
to be NATO members to increase their security level. 
  Some of the above arguments, especially the first and the 
last, could be subjected to well-justified criticism. But on 
one fundamental issue, the arguments remain valid: One cannot 
weaken the institutional structures on which West Europe's 
stability is based. Maintenance of the structures' strength and 
coherency is also in Poland's interest. That is because it is 
beyond any doubt that acquiring membership in an alliance that 
has lost its identity and credibility will fail to increase our 
security to any significant extent. 
  It was only in January that Poland, which has fought for 
NATO 
membership in the most vigorous manner, has attempted to 
evaluate the costs of its participation in Partnership. It was 
soon discovered that the necessary funds are lacking, and a 
conclusion was drawn from that: The West should bear at least 
part of the expense of our participation. It also turned out 
that we cannot afford to have more than one company participate 
in joint maneuvers. That is not serious, given statements by 
some politicians that Poland's participation in NATO would 
greatly strengthen its defense capabilities. 
  So NATO was faced with a fundamental question--how to 
respond 
to this situation in a way that could contribute to an increase 
of European peace and security, while satisfying the needs of 
the new democracies, while not losing its positive elements at 
the same time. The maneuvering room is delineated by the 
following fundamental conditions: involving postcommunist 
countries in political and military cooperation and providing 
the European Continent with a minimum degree of security; 
stabilizing and making permanent political and economic 
transformations in the area, which make East and Central Europe 
occupy a special position; preventing of the establishment of 
new divisions in Europe and not allowing for an uncontrolled 
collapse of the Russian state. "Partnership for Peace" is 
exactly NATO's response to these challenges. 
  Partnership does not result in security guarantees that are 
provided for by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty (allies' 
obligation to mutual armed assistance in cases of aggression 
from the outside), but what it does do is create an opportunity 
for partners to conduct consultations with NATO members, as 
provided for by Article 4 of the treaty. The partnership 
formula does not formally discriminate against any European 
country, but it provides for a de facto diversification, 
depending on the extent of real involvement of the partner 
countries in cooperation with NATO, and also depending on the 
capability of meeting expectations associated with that 
cooperation. In other words, the Partnership formula creates an 
opportunity to create a material and functional association of 
ties that would closely link those countries that have the will 
and the capabilities to meet NATO's expectations. According to 
some representatives of the U.S. Administration, the decision on 
achieving NATO member status will be of a purely formal nature 
once a certain stage of cooperation has been reached. 
<H5>  Partnership Is Not Bad </H5>
  Russia adopted an ambiguous position on the initiative (in 
the end, it decided to join the Partnership on 21 April). On 
the one hand, there were numerous statements by Russian 
politicians concerning the country's will to participate in the 
Partnership, and even concerning a possible joining of NATO in 
the future, provided it undergoes deep transformations. But, on 
the other hand, Russia took a negative stand concerning a 
widening of NATO to include countries of East and Central 
Europe, and even concerning participation of the republics of 
the former USSR in the Partnership. At the same time, Russia is 
making efforts for a widening of military cooperation among the 
member states of CIS, and to have them join the Collective 
Defense Treaty signed in Tashkent in May 1992. This means the 
creation of a new political and military arrangement on the 
territory of the former USSR, which has far-reaching 
consequences for European security. The possibility cannot be 
ruled out that, by playing this double-standard game vis-a-vis 
the West, the Russian leadership is hoping for a chance to 
recreate the division of Europe on currently the most 
advantageous terms, from the standpoint of Russia's imperial 
interests. But, even given this scenario of events, the 
Partnership concept is not bad because it enables the West to 
flexibly adapt itself to the circumstances, while not blocking 
any options, including those expected by the countries of East 
and Central Europe. 
  Even in the case of the Partnership, the maneuvering room 
for 
Russia, which uses military instruments of foreign policies, is 
limited. This has put Russia in a dilemma: to join the 
Partnership or not? 
  From Poland's perspective, participation in the Partnership 
will not be an easy task, taking into account both the financial 
standpoint and institutional adaptations. A paradox became 
visible here. As John Roper, a famous expert on international 
security, has noted, an increase in a country's feeling of 
security should lead to a decrease in the country's defense 
expenditures. But, in the case of postcommunist countries 
making their cooperation with NATO closer, an increase in the 
feeling of security must be accompanied by costly adaptation 
measures. It is an unavoidable price for joining West European 
security structures. Plus, one has to be honest: The rate of 
our preparations for making cooperation with NATO closer is not 
at akk impressive. 
  In the context of the issue of cooperation with NATO, we 
must, in Polish policies, draw a few fundamental conclusions. So 
let us stress the fact that seems to be ignored by a majority of 
participants of debates on the Polish Republic's security 
policies: Poland is a country of key importance for Europe's 
future shape and for the future balance of power on the 
continent. So its geographical location is Poland's asset--that 
is, if the development of events in Europe facilitates creation 
of a common political and economic order. It is not the case 
that we have no impact on these events, but, if the situation 
develops unfavorably from our standpoint, we will be the first 
to suffer as a result of a possible European conflict. 
  Mutual coordination of measures undertaken in the East and 
the West is a test for the quality of Polish policies in the 
area of international security. If political activity vis-a-vis 
the West reduces our chances of implementing our interests in 
the East, that means that either the strategic concept is 
mistaken or it simply does not exist. One has a feeling that 
this is exactly what we are dealing with right now. It can be 
seen particularly saliently in our relations with Ukraine. 
Poland, because of its geographic location, must conduct an 
active policy in all directions. 
  Establishment of European security on a continentwide basis 
is in our strategic interest. This implies a need to widen the 
area of stability and cooperation as far to the East as 
possible. The "Partnership for Peace" proposal creates 
precisely such an opportunity. Moreover, in case events in the 
East take a turn that would be disadvantageous to us, the 
Partnership creates a chance for gaining the necessary 
protection against possible dangers. 
<H5>  We for Ourselves </H5>
  While striving to be integrated with the West, we must show 
our understanding for the complexity of the circumstances 
surrounding policies of the countries that make up the West, and 
also of some international coordinating mechanisms. The West 
will only be able to meet our expectations if it manages to 
maintain its coherency and identity. This applies to both the 
EU and NATO. So Polish people must have a lot of understanding 
when it comes to resistance from the Western countries on the 
issue of a too rapid granting of member status to new 
democracies, and they must overcome the resistance in a skillful 
and very thought-through manner. It is a fact that the West's 
position often has particular interests of individual countries 
hidden behind it, but the West's position also includes some 
arguments of a general nature that would be hard to dispute. So 
a strong and integrated West is in our interest, but also a West 
that would be flexible and open enough to widen the system of 
its institutions to cover countries that, while striving at 
making use of the opportunities that participation in these 
institutions creates, are ready to observe the required rules 
and to take upon themselves responsibility for the continent's 
fate. 
  The scale of the transformations going on in Europe is 
comparable to those that took place after World Wars I and II. 
The fact that we are creating this order without having waged a 
war, in the strictest sense, before that creation is a 
distinguishing trait of the current situation. Careless 
political measures can make such a war likely. The 
establishment of the new order in Europe is taking place under 
conditions of a high degree of uncertainty that, among other 
things, is a consequence of a diversification or unclear 
definition of interests and of perception of problems by the 
participating parties, as well as of a high risk factor for 
global and European security. 
  So, before we ask "What should the West do for us?," let us 
ask "What can we do for ourselves?" and also "What could we do 
or propose to our neighbors and to Europe?" In the long run, a 
position based on making claims, especially in the area of 
security, is the least efficient method of conducting foreign 
policy.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Cooperation in fighting 
the drug mafia and drug terrorism was discussed by Czech Foreign 
Minister Josef Zieleniec and visiting Colombian Foreign Minister 
Nohemi Sanin Posada at their meeting today, the two ministers 
told journalists after the meeting. 
  The integration structures of Europe and America such as, 
for 
example, the Partnership for Peace project, the Organization of 
American States, NATO and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) were also discussed, Posada said, adding that 
Columbia was interested in joining NAFTA. 
  The two ministers discussed bilateral Czech-Colombian 
relations. Posada mentioned the prospects of concluding mutual 
agreements, especially an agreement on investment protection. 
The necessity of strengthening concrete cooperation between the 
two countries' businessmen and cooperation in the cultural 
sphere was stressed. 
  At the end of their meeting Posada presented Zieleniec with 
Order of St. Charles, the civic distinction which the Colombian 
Foreign Ministry awards to foreigners contributing to the 
development of relations with Columbia. The decision to award 
it Zieleniec was made by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
Trujillo in late March. 
  In his Decree, Trujillo pointed to Zieleniec's contribution 
to pursuing the principles of international co-existence, mutual 
respect and solidarity between governments and nations and to 
the development of new relations of friendship and cooperation 
between the Czech Republic and Latin American countries, 
including Columbia.

  [Text] Prague, April 14 (CTK) -- In future, the Czech Army 
will only be purchasing weapons and equipment from Czech 
suppliers, NOVA Television said today, citing deputy Defense 
Minister Miroslav Kalousek. 
  Kalousek said NOVA said [as received] that the army is 
considering placing a commission for a modernized version of the 
T- 72 tank with the Czech weapons producers. 
  Kalousek was taking part in a meeting in Jihlava, South 
Moravia, of representatives of Czech weapon factories, the 
Defense and Interior ministries, and other producers which 
looked at the possibility of the Czech Army, police, and 
national security tapping the potential of Czech weapon 
companies. 
  The meeting followed a plenary meeting of the weapons 
consortium RDP Group. 
  The RDP Group Praha joint venture was founded last year to 
negotiate with the ministries and government. Forty 
shareholders participate in it.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Daniel Kumermann: "Slovak Future Is Czech </F>
Challenge"] 
  [Text] Slovakia has, once again, found its way onto the 
front pages of our newspapers. This time, the story was received 
with more than a little malicious joy. 
  The big pain in the neck is gone at last. Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar has been deposed, losing in almost the same way 
that he kept winning. 
  Although the Czech public is almost unified in its rejection 
of Meciar, Czech politicians aren't so sure. At least that's 
what an observer might assume from their cautious treatment of 
this change in leadership. They seemed more careful than 
diplomacy alone would oblige them to be. Another curious sign is 
the degree to which politicians' reactions varied, even within a 
single party. 
  Despite all his faults, Vladimir Meciar was a rather 
predictable politician. In any political situation one had only 
to imagine all the potential options and choose the most 
preposterous, and that would almost invariably be the course he 
took. 
  Meciar did not just offend everyone's common values and good 
sense. He seemed to reach deeper, confounding the very fabric of 
regular life. The only unsolved mystery is whether he did all 
these things according to some ingenious plan or whether his 
method of leading by the force of sheer personality--untainted 
by reason--happened to be just what Slovakia wanted at the time. 
  Whatever his intention, Meciar's troubling ways have been a 
rather useful tool for Czech policy-makers. Enough has been said 
about our leaders' open dislike of Central European integration, 
specifically among the Visegrad nations of Poland, Hungary, the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia. Slovakia itself always helped to 
fuel the argument against cooperation: "Do you really want to be 
in an association with a so-and-so like Meciar? Can a country 
with the least bit of self-esteem team up with him?" 
  From this point of view, the upcoming coalition government 
in 
Slovakia--and especially its prime minister--may eventually 
prove to be more problematic. First of all, the new leadership 
will be hard to pin down because it seems to comprise so many 
differing views. And secondly, Meciar's removal has thrown the 
whole political process off kilter. 
  If the new Slovak government does manage to hang on, 
however, 
the Czech Republic might have to learn to live side by side with 
Slovak leaders who are partners on an equal footing and who 
cannot be as easily dismissed in the public eye for their 
dubious pasts. 
  Worse yet, one part of the new coalition is the Democratic 
Left Party (SDL), the direct descendant of the former Communist 
Party. That may be particularly painful for our side to deal 
with. Just try to imagine the scene when our minister of 
defense, a true, dedicated Christian, meets a Slovak counterpart 
with a godless red past. How can they possibly be seen agreeing 
on something such as peace in Bosnia? 
  The fact is that the Slovak ex-communists have managed to 
cut 
themselves off from their past much more effectively than their 
Czech brethren have. They are rather closer to what is 
understood to be the modern European left. For Czech leaders, 
however, this is where the danger lies. 
  If the Slovak coalition survives and its SDL ministers 
eventually prove themselves, they might be politically much more 
difficult to deal with than Meciar. Remember our officials' 
shocked reaction to the current Polish center-left government. 
Their approach has developed into a very cautious "friendliness" 
mixed with distrust. Now we may be forced to go through the same 
process east of our border. On top of that, there are signs that 
next month's general elections in Hungary may produce a 
government that includes part of the ex-communist Socialist 
Party. 
  Any compromises would be hard to swallow after so many of 
our 
political leaders made presentations to the West, explaining 
that the only possible way out of the post-communist marsh is 
the firm road of a liberal market economy and libertarian 
society. There cannot be any sidetracking, they said--no "third 
way" for us. 
  We can hardly back up now. There are center-left governments 
within the European Union too, and we know they are watching us 
closely. If we cannot make it work with Visegrad, it will be 
harder to become buddy-buddy with the Westside gang. 
  The members of this club seem unwilling to appreciate our 
quiet sacrifice in tolerating such neo-socialism. They keep 
telling us that we cannot play in the big leagues unless we make 
it in our local one first. If Slovakia, be it left or right, is 
functioning well, it will be even harder for them to understand 
why we can't be better team players.

<F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Skinheads Commemorate Fascist </F>
Heyday"] 
  [Text] Right-wing demonstrators commemorating the 55th 
anniversary of the Nazi division of Czechoslovakia exposed their 
weaknesses even as they tried to show their strength during the 
March 19-20 weekend. 
  While word of coming "skinhead" demonstrations and other 
fascist and nationalist activities caused fear in minority 
communities, the weekend's events showed discord among rightist 
factions and a lack of support from the general public. 
  The separation of Czechoslovakia was precipitated by the 
March 15, 1939, invasion of the Czech lands by the German army 
and Slovakia's declaration of independence a day earlier. 
  Memories of conflict and mistrust were evoked by the 
meetings 
of rightist political parties in the big Czech and Slovak 
cities, while ethnic tension in smaller towns was aggravated by 
processions of skinheads and calls for the rehabilitation of 
Slovakia's pro-German wartime leader. 
  The various groups often clashed in their proclaimed 
interests, however much they may seem to have in common. Police 
were quick to state that skinhead activists represented no more 
than a marginal problem. 
  Miroslav Sladek, leader of the Assembly for the 
Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC), made speeches 
at rallies in Prague and Brno, condemning as "apologist" 
President Vaclav Havel's statements on the deportation of 
Sudeten Germans after World War II and calling for "the highest 
possible penalty" for any politicians "opening the door to the 
Germans." 
  "Whenever the Germans have wanted to expand into Europe, 
they 
have always turned to Czechoslovakia first," pronounced Sladek 
form his podium at the Jan Hus statue on Prague's Old Town 
Square. "We should learn a lesson from Jan Hus, who struggled 
for the purity of the Czech nation and was murdered by Germans, 
and not from Saint Vaclav, who, like his modern namesakes [Havel 
and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus] in today's government, opened 
the way for German intervention." 
  Preaching to a crowd of predominantly older men, Sladek 
accused the Klaus government of breaking up the Czechoslovak 
federation and weakening it before an expansionist Teutonic 
neighbor. "The Germans did the same thing in Yugoslavia: They 
encouraged rival factions to fight, and then in the ruins they 
bought up the Adriatic coast for a few pfennigs." 
  The demonstrations were interrupted by outbreaks of 
violence. 
In Brno, anarchists clashed with the republican crowd March 14. 
The Prague demonstration speakers were heckled by skinheads who 
criticized Sladek for inconsistency in his beliefs. 
  About 400 skinheads attended a "White Rock" concert March 19 
in the Karlin district of Prague. The event was organized by 
skinheads in honor of two of their number whom they claim were 
killed by Romanies. 
  The Czech press reported that Romany children in some areas 
of the city were staying away from school as groups of the 
notoriously anti-Gypsy skinheads arrived. 
  Two days before the event, an arson attack at the restaurant 
hosting the concert scorched part of the interior. Firefighters 
said it could have burned the whole building. Skinheads, 
undaunted, flocked from all over the country to hear bands such 
as Hatred 88, Attack and Flag. 
  In Preroy, northern Moravia, skinheads also marched through 
the town chanting anti-Romany slogans. The Patriotic Front 
association organized the demonstration to remind citizens of 
the case of 17-year-old Libor Buzik, who allegedly was attacked 
by two Romanies last November and who still has not recovered 
fully from his injuries. 
  Further demonstrations by skinheads are anticipated on the 
anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birthday in April. Police said 
they expect a skinhead celebration of some kind in the eastern 
Bohemian town of Hradec Kralove to mark the date. 
  Meanwhile, in Bratislava, Slovak opinions were divided and 
emotions ran high as past political passions merged with present 
ones. 
  Competing demonstrators called for both the rehabilitation 
and vilification of Jozef Tiso, the Roman Catholic priest who 
was president of the "puppet government" during the war. Singing 
the Slovak national anthem, a crowd of about 500 gathered near 
Tiso's grave in the Martinsky cemetery, while the deacon of 
Banov, western Slovakia, said it was time for the younger 
generation to hear the truth about Tiso and what he represented 
for the Slovak nation. 
  In the central Slovak town of Zilina, Slovak Peoples Party 
Chairman Ludovit Adamov described the Tiso years as "a Slovak 
miracle" and defended Tiso's inclination toward Nazi Germany as 
a "lesser evil" among the options then available.

<F P=106> [Compilation by Lubomir Sedlak: "National Property Fund: At </F>
the Helm of Privatization"] 
  [Text] The National Property fund, currently embroiled in a 
400 million Kc ($13.3 million) lawsuit regarding its issuance of 
stocks, has become a dominant player in the Czech economy over 
the past three years. 
  --Takeovers. Since its establishment in 1991, the fund has 
taken over state property worth 576 billion Kc, including 148.5 
billion Kc worth of property in the second wave of 
privatization, which ends this spring. 
  --Revenues. Between 1991 and 1993, the fund's revenues 
amounted to more than 54 billion Kc through large-scale 
privatization, including more than 23 billion Kc generated 
through selling shares in companies, 18 billion Kc through 
direct sales of companies and other revenues generated through 
public auctions and competitions. Small-scale privatization 
generated more than 36 billion Kc in revenues. The fund has 
deposited 20 billion Kc of that sum into the Ceska sporitelna 
savings bank, with the interest being used to privatize the 
country's health system. 
  --Expenses. The fund has paid out almost 43 billion Kc on 
large-scale privatization since its founding, spending more than 
half of this sum in 1992 on bond purchases to pay off the debts 
of formerly state-owned enterprises. It also spent almost 4 
billion Kc on small-scale privatization, mainly on liquidating 
state enterprises and helping municipal budgets. 
  --Receivables. The fund requires entities that wish to buy 
property from it to make an advance payment of 10 percent of the 
final price. Various buyers currently owe the agency 6.5 billion 
Kc for the acquisition of 240 enterprises. The fund has already 
filed suits against 93 of these debtors, who owe a total of 
almost 2 billion Kc. 
  --Foreign investment. Almost 41 percent of the fund's total 
revenues, amounting to 22 billion Kc, came from abroad. But the 
share of foreign investors declined in 1993. 
  --Self-assessment. Fund Chairman Tomas Jezek says the fund 
has "the worst behind it," because the coupon privatization 
process is ending this spring with its second wave. There will 
not be a third wave, Jezek says, since there is basically 
nothing left to be privatized in this country. 
  But fund officials note that entities interested in buying 
companies from the agency are facing increasing problems in 
obtaining money from banks, which have become more cautious.

<F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Skoda To Produce Cars in Poland"] </F>
  [Text] The Mlada Boleslav automaker Skoda announced March 
18 that it will produce automobiles abroad for the first time in 
its history. It intends to open a plant in the Polish city of 
Poznan that will turn out an estimated 5,000 cars this year, 
with a capacity for expansion in the future. Ludvik Kalma, 
director of the factory in Mlada Boleslav, explained that this 
is the only way to avoid restrictive tariffs on exporting Czech 
cars to Poland. Skoda has negotiated unsuccessfully with Polish 
officials to reduce these duties, which could increase car 
prices by as much as 41 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Keith Damsell: "Black Market Helping Boost Czech </F>
Economy"] 
  [Text] Black marketeers, crooks and tax evaders could be as 
responsible for the Czech economic miracle as is Finance 
Minister Ivan Kocamik--if a recent report published by Prague's 
Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education is to be 
believed. 
  In a 26-page report on small business and private 
entrepreneurship in the Czech Republic, CERGE associate 
professor Dr. Vladimir Benacek concludes that illegal business 
activity operating outside the taxman's reach is helping fire 
the Czech economy. 
  "Every small businessman cheats," Benacek said. "The tax 
burden is levied on the honest; they have no incentive to do 
business. Those who are more clever cheat." 
  Benacek said the Czech economy is fueled by hidden economic 
forces: a "black economy" including violent crime, drug dealing, 
smuggling and extortion, and a "shadow economy" of entrepreneurs 
who hide their business activities to avoid paying taxes. He 
bases his conclusion on a number of mysterious anomalies in 
Czech economic statistics. 
  --Empty unemployment lines. Between January 1991 and April 
1992, some 450,000 workers--representing at least 6 percent of 
the Czech labor force--either quit their jobs in state-owned 
companies or left school without registering for unemployment 
benefits or reporting themselves as employed. 
  "It is assumed that these people to a large extent 
`disappeared' into the black and shadow economies," Benacek 
writes. "Without doubt, this trend continued during 1993." 
  Benacek suggests that some of these workers may have 
disappeared into fringe areas of the economy such as part-time 
and temporary labor. In addition, he says, the privatization 
scheme allows for more hidden employment, since company managers 
"have used the environment of weak ownership control to find for 
themselves a safe niche allowing them to exercise their own 
shadow entrepreneurial activities." 
  Sources in the business community back up Benacek's 
assertions. 
  Milan Mercl, project director of the management consulting 
firm Mercl Consulting, said that in his research he often comes 
across employees who conduct their own private, unregistered 
business on company time. 
  In addition, some firms will transfer funds to a sister 
company; the transferred funds are then recorded as profit. 
"There's a higher profit recorded on paper and you're able to 
pay management more--even though it's not justified," Mercl said. 
  --Unfilled vacancies. Benacek calculates that 30 to 60 
percent of the people who have registered for unemployment since 
1990 may actually be working. He bases his conclusion on the 
fact that some businesses are unable to fill vacancies even in 
areas where official unemployment figures are high. 
  In Bohemia, for instance, officially unemployed workers 
outnumber job vacancies by nearly 2-1, and in Moravia by more 
than 7-1. If all these people are unemployed, Benacek asks, why 
aren't they filling the vacancies? 
  --Undeclared commuters. At the end of 1992, some 76,000 
Czechs were registered as workers who commuted abroad (to border 
countries such as Germany and Austria) for their jobs. 
Unofficial estimates, however, put that figure as high as 
100,000. The Bavarian Chamber of Commerce estimates that Czech 
commuters can earn as much as 300 million DM per year, or $180 
million, from Bavaria alone. 
  --Hidden productivity. Between 1990 and 1993, the Czech 
gross 
domestic product (GDP) reportedly fell 26 percent. In a Western 
economy, a plummeting GDP would normally mean a deep depression, 
massive layoffs, strikes and poverty. Yet Czechs remain 
optimistic about their economy, unemployment is near zero in 
Prague and expats continue to find gainful employment. 
  How is this possible? 
  Benacek suggests that as much as 30 percent of the country's 
GDP is hidden or undeclared to avoid taxes. 
  As proof, he notes that 15,541 of the Czech Republic's 
limited liability companies, which have stringent reporting 
procedures, generated 84 percent of the country's official GDP, 
while the country's 670,000 entrepreneurs contributed just 16 
percent. He suggests that those figures hint at under-reporting 
by the entrepreneurs. 
  --Tax evasion. In 1993, tax fraud amounted to at least 5 
billion Kc from petroleum sales, 1 billion to 1.5 billion Kc 
from tobacco excise tax evasion, 1.3 billion Kc from evading 
taxes on smuggled clothing and 2 billion Kc from evading taxes 
on antiques and art objects smuggled abroad. 
  Miroslav Tera, the deputy for taxes for the Ministry of 
Finance, refused to discuss the issue. The government is unaware 
of any unregistered business activity, he said, and if it was 
aware of it, would put a stop to it. 
  "Why are you calling us? You should call the companies that 
aren't paying their taxes," Tera said. 
  When asked about tax evasion, consultant Mercl laughed. Of 
course many business-people regularly cheat on their taxes, he 
said, because the tax rates are too high. 
  According to Benacek, business conditions are such that it's 
nearly impossible for an honest entrepreneur to survive and 
prosper. Corporate income taxes amount to 45 percent of profits, 
while social and health insurance taxes total 36 percent of 
gross payroll. That is in addition to the money spent on 
corporate licenses, loans and real estate. 
  To navigate this business minefield, entrepreneurs often 
have 
no choice but to pay bribes and pocket what they can along the 
way, Benacek said. The strong Czech tradition of 
entrepreneurship, having been stirred after 40 years of 
totalitarianism, allows little guilt over bucking the system. 
  The results are mixed: Most untaxed income is poured back 
into the economy and stimulates further business activity, 
Benacek said. But at the same time, decreased government 
revenues mean "long-run damage" to the public goods sector. 
Infrastructure, education and the soon-to-be-privatized 
health-care system all suffer. 
  Not everyone agrees about the size of the problem, however. 
  David Roach, senior tax partner at Price Waterhouse, said it 
is "extraordinarily difficult" to assess the impact of 
unregistered business activity. 
  "Yes, there's a thriving black market. But the question is 
how big it is," Roach said. Bribery of state employees is "not 
totally endemic, but is more commonplace than jurisdictions in 
other countries west of here." 
  Steven Kelly, a partner at KNO Worldwide management 
consultants, countered that illegal business activity must be 
limited, because complex documentation is necessary to make any 
monetary transactions. 
  But bribing government officials to speed up slow service, 
especially for telephone and utility installation, is "rampant," 
he said. 
  "There's money that official types are getting. That's 
definitely going on and not being declared."

  [Text] Budapest, 12 April 12 (MTI) -- After Romanian 
Government complaints about Hungarian politician Geza Entz's 
visit to Romania, a Hungarian Government spokesman said today 
that Romania had made no objections beforehand to the visit's 
itinery, and that requiring a visa for a diplomatic 
passport-holder went against both international practice and the 
Hungarian-Romanian no visa agreement. Both President of the 
Romanian Assembly of Deputies Adrian Nastase, and the Romanian 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, have raised objections since a visit 
by Hungarian State Secretary Geza Entz to Romania. 
  The Hungarian spokesman, Janos Herman, said the visit had 
been coordinated in advance with the Romanian Foreign Ministry, 
and Hungary had also announced that, for the Hungarian 
President, Entz would decorate church dignitaries living in 
Romania who were persecuted for their sympathy with the 1956 
Hungarian revolution. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry was also informed that the 
State Secretary would meet leaders of the Hungarian Democratic 
Union of Romania, on the basis of their invitation. With this, 
the Hungarian Embassy in Bucharest met the prescriptions of the 
1961 Vienna agreement on diplomatic relations. 
  No objections came from the Romanian side. In the light of 
the circumspect proceedings, the Hungarian foreign affairs 
spokesman found incomprehensible the remarks made by the 
spokesman of the Romanian Foreign Ministry at his press briefing 
on March 30. 
  Regarding semi-official remarks made about compulsory visas 
for Hungarian diplomatic passports, Herman said it is a well 
known fact that the bilateral visa agreement does not make it 
possible to unilaterally suspend it. And Hungary is not aware 
of any Romanian proposal to amend this. 
  Even so, introducing compulsory visas for diplomatic 
passports, while upholding the no visa obligation for private 
passports, would be unparalleled in international practice, he 
continued. 
  The spokesman also added that the Hungarian Foreign Ministry 
would not, for its part, see it as desirable to introduce 
compulsory visas for Romanian citizens entering Hungary with 
diplomatic passports. Romanian citizens with valid and regular 
travel documents will be able to enter Hungary without central 
controls, and then meet anyone in Hungary. 
  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry hopes no statements of 
similarly unusual tone and content will burden 
Hungarian-Romanian relations in the future, and that an 
atmosphere can be created in which talks begun on the bilateral 
basic treaty can continue. 
  Herman declined to speculate on a date for signing the basic 
treaty. He said his aim was to settle genuine problems. 
  In answer to another question, Herman confirmed that a 
possible visit of Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat to Budapest 
was raised, but no agreement has been reached as to its date.

  [Text] Budapest, April 14 (CTK) -- Hungary is not opposed 
to including the inviolability of borders into bilateral 
agreements if the partners so wish and if it is in an acceptable 
form and in line with international documents, Janos Herman, the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman tells the MAGYAR HIRLAP today. 
  Herman is commenting on an excerpt of Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik's parliamentary speech in which he said that for the 
sake of reaffirming confidence Hungary should declare the 
inviolability of the Hungarian Slovak border. 
  It is tiring and incomprehensible why Hungary has been 
constantly asked to make declarations on the inviolability of 
the border, Herman states. He also points to the fact that 
Budapest sees an effort to resolve practical problems on the 
part of the Slovak government and expresses the hope that 
Slovak-Hungarian relations can improve. 
  Herman stresses that Hungary has met all the terms regarding 
the recognition of European borders, including its own, and it 
will do so even in future. "Neither the Hungarian government nor 
any of its representatives have made any statement which would 
contradict this," Herman says. He also points out that Hungary 
is a signatory of the Helsinki Final Act, the Paris Charter and 
a number of other documents which guarantee the inviolability of 
borders in Europe.

  [Text] Budapest, 12 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry considers the immediate cessation of attacks against 
the civilian population of Gorazde, the prevention of conflict 
escalation, and the furtherance of the Bosnian peace process 
with the participation of all sides to be a prime necessity, 
Hungarian foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman said at his 
customary press briefing in Budapest on Tuesday [12 April]. 
  Herman was evaluating the situation that has come about in 
the wake of the Serbian attack on Gorazde. 
  The Foreign Ministry is following the situation with 
particular attention. Its situational analysis starts out from 
the fact that the NATO action was carried out based on UN 
Security Council resolutions, and that the implementation of 
these is an obligation of the member-states. 
  In answer to another question, Herman welcomed the Polish 
government's submission of its official European Union [EU] 
membership request to the current presidency of the European 
Union on April 8, parallel to the Hungarian move. 
  Herman noted with satisfaction that these historical steps 
were prepared in close concert between the Hungarian and the 
Polish governments.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 13 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
has asked the prime ministers of the countries of the "Twelve" 
to support Poland's efforts for a membership of the European 
Union [EU]. Pawlak conveyed respective letters to the 
ambassadors of the European Union states at a meeting in Warsaw 
on Wednesday. 
  Greek Ambassador Yeoryios Alexandropoulos said that it is 
not 
for the ambassadors to decide whether to accept Poland as a EU 
member but that they will give their full support to Poland's 
application for the membership. 
  Governmental commissioner for the European integration Jacek 
Saryusz-Wolski said after the meeting that the foreign ministers 
of the "Twelve" are to meet in Luxembourg on April 18 to decide, 
among other things, on the sending of the Polish application to 
the European Commission for examination. "Such a move will help 
begin negotiations on Poland's membership of the union," he 
added. 
  Saryusz-Wolski said he hopes that Poland should become a 
full 
member of the European Union in 1999.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 14--The Central Office of Planning 
(CUP) has drafted a four-year economic development programme for 
Poland under which it is assumed that the gross domestic product 
in the coming four years will grow by 22 percent, real wages 
will increase by 1.5 to 2.5 percent annually, and overall 
consumption in 1997 will be higher by 15 percent that it is at 
present. 
  The programme will be submitted for debate and evaluation to 
the Government Economic Committee (KERM). 
  According to CUP President Miroslaw Pietrewicz who unveiled 
the main assumptions of the programme at a press conference here 
Thursday, the proposed scenario is ambitious but can be 
implemented, given social support for it. 
  The plan calls for creating 1.2 million new jobs. This will 
mean a drop in unemployment by some 600,000 from the present 3 
million. The plan can be implemented only if Poland continues 
along the path of sustained economic growth which began some 18 
months ago, Pietrewicz noted. 
  Growth requires larger investments, savings and exports. The 
success of the programme also hinges on external conditions, 
chiefly the rate of economic growth in Western Europe which 
influences the volume of imports from Poland. "The starting 
point for the programme is not easy," CUP president observed and 
added that the Polish economic situation was still difficult.

  [Text] Gdansk, April 13 -- The Solidarity Trade Union 
National Commission "recognizes as unsatisfactory the reply of 
the Cabinet to union's demands, meant to halt further 
impoverishment of Polish families in 1994," reads a resolution 
adopted in Gdansk on Wednesday. 
  The resolution stressed that "pressure on the Cabinet is 
still indispensable" and recommended the Union Strike 
Headquarters to outline a scenario for further activities, 
preparing the union to the possible "mass protest action." 
  Solidarity Leader Marian Krzaklewski told journalists that 
the battle can last for months. 
  Spokesman for the National Commission Piotr Zak explained 
that the collection of money for a strike fund and preparations 
for at least a several-day long protest are the basic task 
facing the union at present. 
  The government does not care about strikes in plants that 
are 
anyway on the verge of bankruptcy, he said. He warned that "one 
does not need many people to paralyse the life in the country." 
He also announced that other forms of protest, namely 
demonstrations, pickets in front of the office of the Council of 
Ministers and the Parliament and distribution of leaflets, would 
be carried out. 
  The National Commission made amendments to rules governing 
the supervisory board of Solidarity Economic Fund and adopted a 
schedule for union training. It also resolved that the sixth 
national congress of Solidarity delegates would be held in 
Mielec, Rzeszow Province, between June 30 and July 2. 
  The national Commission also examined the main points of a 
draft constitution worked out by the Constitutional commission 
of the union.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 14 -- The Senate adopted on Thursday 
amendments to the law on the mode of enacting a new constitution 
that allow a group of 500,000 citizens to submit their own draft 
of a basic legislation. The amendments were passed with 72 
votes for, one against and six abstentions. 
  Under the law, a group of half a million citizens will be 
able to put forward their proposal for a new constitution within 
three months after the amended law comes into force. The passed 
amendments also provide for a possibility of holding a 
nation-wide referendum on basic principles of the future system 
of the state. The amendments also oblige the National Assembly 
to use all constitutional bills prepared by the previous Sejm 
and Senate. 
  Senator Jerzy Madej, independent, the only opponent of the 
amendments, pointed to the fact that should they be adopted, the 
time of work on a new constitution would be elongated. The 
argument came up frequently in the discussion but finally the 
senators decided that the public should participate in the work 
on a constitution. 
  Also on Thursday, the Senate unanimously decided to put 
forward an amendment to the law on the relations between the 
state and the Evangelical-Augsburg (Lutheran) and 
Evangelical-Reformed (Calvinist) Churches. 
  The amendment provides that donations for the churches' 
charity work would be exempted from tax. For the Roman-Catholic 
and Orthodox churches the right has already been legislated. 
The senators stressed in the discussion that churches should 
have equal rights in Poland and praised the civil virtues of the 
Protestant churches. 
  The Senate will meet for the next session on April 28 to 
discuss the report of the ombudsman on his work and the Senate's 
amendment to the law on unemployment. The Senate is also to 
decide then whether Senator Andrzej Gawronik, a businessman, 
should be deprived of his immunity and stand trial.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 9 -- Leader of the Democratic Union 
(UD) Tadeusz Mazowiecki said in Warsaw on Saturday the UD would 
not contribute to the destabilization of the state by vetoing 
the 1994 budget. Mazowiecki was addressing a congress of 
Warsaw's branch of the party. 
  The leader of the UD expressed the opinion that the present 
government is "the government of stagnation and not of reforms". 
He explained that the UD had supported the presidential veto 
concerning the law on new wage-control measures because the veto 
had been concordant with the party's previous stand on the 
issue. Mazowiecki simultaneously stressed that the party's being 
in opposition cannot mean that it contributes to the 
destabilization of state structures by backing the possible 
presidential rejection of the budget. 
  On Saturday, members of the UD warsaw branch elected 31 
additional delegates to the unification congress of the party 
with the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) to be held on April 
23 and 24. Similar by-elections in all regions were necessary to 
maintain at the unification congress the agreed statistical 
proportion of 2.7 UD delegates to 1 KLD delegate. 
  The establishment of the new party will not mean that "the 
(Democratic) Union is beginning from scratch", Mazowiecki said. 
It is a process of continuation, a transition to a new stage of 
our party's development, he added. 
  According to Mazowiecki, one of the most important problems 
facing the new party is an answer to the question how one should 
reconcile economic reforms with the necessity to meet public 
expectations. 
  Draft statutes of the new party envisage that the first term 
of the new grouping's authorities will last for a year, the 
second one - two years. A 100-strong national council of the 
party is to be composed of 73 present ud members and 27 
liberals. The party's presidium is to be made up of 8 UD 
members and 3 liberals. 
  The new party is to have only one deputy chairman. Under the 
statutes, all members of the new party holding ministerial posts 
must join the national council. 
  National secretaries of the party would be elected by the 
national council to implement "the current policy of the party" 
in various spheres of the economy and public life.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 13 -- The Ukrainian Embassy in Warsaw 
has sent a note to the Polish Foreign Ministry concerning the 
film entitled "Za Polske Trzeba Walczyc" (One Has to Fight for 
Poland) broadcast by the Polish Television on March 31. 
According to Ukrainian authorities the film carries 
anti-Ukrainian overtones. 
  "We would not want this to be repeated, we do not want a 
propaganda war," Ukrainian Embassy attache Teodozij Starak told 
PAP Wednesday. Starak directed attention to press comments 
preceding the film which spoke of "battles with the German, 
Ukrainian and Soviet occupiers." "We have not reacted to any 
other articles in the press, but this film was shown on state 
television," Starak added. 
  According to the embassy, such films do not serve the 
development of positive relations between Ukraine and Poland. 
  "Its not state television, its public television," Foreign 
Ministry Press Secretary Grzegorz Dziemidowicz commented. The 
Polish Foreign Ministry will take up a position on the matter in 
a few days, after having viewed the film, and listened to expert 
opinions.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/4/1994 -- Romania's Chamber 
of Deputies adopted a declaration on April 14 on the recent 
decision of the Parliament in Chisinau referring to Moldova's 
adherence to the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
  ``Both in 1812 and in 1940, Bessarabia was broken away from 
Romania in consequence of understandings of the great powers of 
that time, contrary to the will of the Romanian people, that has 
never accepted the consequences of these understandings,'' says 
the declaration. 
  ``Developments having taken place starting 1989 have made us 
entertain hopes that Bessarabia will be restored to the 
homeland. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Soviet of the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics has declared null and void the 
pact between the two great tyrants of this century, Hitler and 
Stalin, by which Bessarabia split from Romania in 1940. 
  ``It is regrettable that the recent vote of the Parliament 
in 
Chisinau reconfirms the criminal pact and repeals the right of 
the Romanian nation to live within the boundaries of its entire 
historical and spiritual space. 
  ``Owing to the geographical position, culture, history and 
traditions, the normal place of our brothers on the left bank of 
the Prut is, no doubt, with us, in the big family of the 
European nations and not as part of Euro-Asian structures. 
  ``We think that the application of the Republic of Moldova 
for admission to the Council of Europe, Moldova's signing among 
the first of the Partnership for Peace plan and the development 
of its relations with Western countries are significant steps, 
they express the Republic of Moldova's wish to be part of the 
present general process of European integration. 
  ``Romania's Chamber of Deputies therefore declares in front 
of the whole world that it energetically supports the normal 
efforts of the Republic of Moldova to get integrated with the 
European structures and condemns the actions of political forces 
that are making an attempt to integrate Moldova in the old 
structures. 
  ``The special relations between Romania and the Republic of 
Moldova, based on a community in terms of kinship, national 
language, culture and history are and will continue to be one of 
the main priorities of Romania's foreign policy. 
  ``Irrespective of situations specific to one moment or 
another, Romania, the Romanian people will continue to keep 
close to their brothers on the left bank of the Prut, to back 
them on a political, diplomatic, material and spiritual plane, 
in order to overcome the great problems confronting them.''

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 13/4/1994 -- The prime minister 
of the Netherlands, Ruud Lubbers, accompanied by the Dutch 
minister of foreign affairs, Peter Kooijmans, will make an 
official visit in Romania over April 19-20, at the invitation of 
the Romanian prime minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and of the Romanian 
Government, said the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
Mircea Geoana at a press conference on Wednesday, April 13. The 
visit is going to be the first one after 1989 to be made in 
Romania by the Dutch premier and by the Dutch foreign minister. 
  The recent election of Daniel Tarschys as secretary-general 
of the Council of Europe was saluted by the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry which expressed through its spokesperson the confidence 
that "during his, Mr. Daniel Tarschys, tenure, the European body 
will further on the way of integrating the states of Central and 
Eastern Europe, of institutional consolidation, and of 
affirmation of its specific role. On the occasion of the 
election of Mr. Daniel Tarschys, the Romanian minister of 
foreign affairs Teodor Melescanu addressed him a congratulatory 
message. 
  The spokesman for the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
Mircea Geoana, confirmed at the today's press conference that 
the ministry received the application for an entry visa to 
Romania of the former sovereign of this country, Mihai I, and 
said the visa was forwarded to the government. 
  Relative to the visit to Romania of Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic, the spokesman informed the press that it was agreed 
with the Romanian side, in principle, to have it scheduled for 
the immediately following period. 
  In connection with the Crans-Montana Forum due in Bucharest 
from 21 to 24 April, confirmations have been received from 137 
political personalities and 232 businessmen. Of the latter 152 
come from Romania. Also, 7 heads of state, 10 premiers and 
deputy prime ministers, six speakers or deputy speakers of 
Parliament, 12 foreign ministers and deputy foreign ministers, 
20 ministers in charge of various other domains, 9 
secretaries-general and deputy secretaries- general of European 
international organizations have so far confirmed their 
participation. 
  At the Wednesday, 13 April news conference of the Ministry 
of 
Foreign Affairs, spokesman Mircea Geoana said that when the 
period for the negotiation of the relevant documents is 
completed, the visit to Romania of the president of the F.R. of 
Yugoslavia Zoran Lilic will be expected for the signing of the 
treaty. 
  Asked to refer to the decision of the Russian Federation, in 
which the latter expressed its "interest and wish" to convert 
into military bases the Russian troops formerly deployed in the 
territories of ex-Soviet states, spokesman Geoana said: "I think 
that the international reference documents as well as those 
recently adopted by the CSCE, which spell it out clearly that 
the foreign troops in these states are to be completely and 
unconditionally retreated, are the international foundation of 
any initiative." The ministry official also said the matter 
required that those directly concerned and involved made their 
positions known. 
  Spokesman for the Romanian Foreign Ministry Mircea Geoana 
also read out at this press conference, the point of view of 
that institution on the decision of the Republic of Moldova to 
join the Commonwealth of Independent States. Geoana mentioned 
among other things that "owing to its geographic position, 
culture, history and traditions, the natural place of the 
Republic of Moldova as an independent and sovereign state, is in 
the big family of the European nations, an by no means in 
Euro-Asian structures. The foreign policy acts recently adopted 
by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova seem to show a 
tendency towards the latter. 
  Such a global approach, a pan-European one in particular, 
offers access to the opportunities that have already been 
offered to the young independent states and lowers the risks of 
perpetuating dependency on a certain area, full membership to 
organisations getting shaped at present. 
  We are of the opinion that the strategic objective jointly 
established by Romania and the Republic of Moldova concerning 
their economic integration and the consolidation of their common 
cultural and spiritual space is still in sight. It is a concept 
corresponding, in this phase, to the normal yearnings of the two 
Romanian states to get closer to each other, with the economic 
integration being viewed in the context of the integration of 
Romania and the Republic of Moldova within Euro-Atlantic 
structures. At the same time that concept does not hamper 
relations with other states of the world, on the contrary, it 
supposes and promotes such links. This reality is going to grow 
stronger in proportion to the economic revigoration of the two 
independent Romanian states, function of the pace of their 
integration with these structures. 
  The special relations between Romania and the Republic of 
Moldova, based on kinship, national language, culture and 
history continues and will continue to represent one of the main 
priorities of Romania's foreign policy. 
  Devoted to the spirit and contents of the declaration by 
which it recognized the Republic of Moldova as an independent 
Romanian state, Romania, irrespective of the situation specific 
to a moment or another, will always remain close to its brethren 
in the Republic of Moldova, in order to back them on a 
political, diplomatic, material and spiritual plane, for them to 
overcome the difficult problems the citizens of the republic on 
the left bank of the Prut have to face."

  [Text] Bratislava, April 14 (CTK) -- The International 
Monetary Fund's (IMF) approach towards ex-premier Vladimir 
Meciar's government was tougher than that towards the current 
cabinet of Jozef Moravcik, Sergej Kozlik, deputy chairman of the 
shadow cabinet of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) 
and the Slovak National Party (SNS) told journalists today. 
  The current cabinet has included "their shoe sizes" in many 
economic accounts, he said. For the first quarter of this year 
personal consumption as well as investment grew, prices 
stabilized and gross domestic product also grew against the same 
period last year, he added. 
  Kozlik described as confrontational the program of 
Moravcik's 
government and asked whether the current premier who formed the 
government as a non-confrontational one, was not "under the 
pressure of an artificially created opposition." 
  Commenting on rumors about the possible withdrawal of 
further 
deputies from the HZDS deputies' group Kozlik said that he 
"could not see into deputies' mind." However, the deputies' 
group apart, the HZDS was the most stable political party in 
Slovakia, Kozlik said. 
  Spokesman for the shadow cabinet Ondrej Hanko attacked 
Moravcik's government for its interference in the media and for 
exerting pressure on it. SNS Chairman Jozef Prokes said with 
regard to the pro-Meciar daily REPUBLIKA published by the 
state-owned Slovak news Agency TA SR, that there should exist a 
daily criticizing the government no matter who published it. 
"Because there where no criticism exists, objectivity ends," he 
added. Asked by CTK whether the state should finance the 
publishing of REPUBLIKA Kozlik said: "It does not have to but it 
can."

<F P=106> [Article by Bill Reynolds: "Moravcik Traveled Back Roads to </F>
the Top"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The qualities that people most often 
attribute to Jozef Moravcik are not the ones that usually rocket 
a person to leadership. 
  The most frequent description of Slovakia's new prime 
minister is that of the quintessential diplomat: handsome, 
suave, even-tempered and, above all, cautious. Those who have 
dealt with him are quick to add that he is personally and 
professionally honest and not noticeably ambitious. 
  Yet, in private, some of Moravcik's associates complain that 
his moderate personality has made him only moderately effective. 
  The word "slow" is often applied in characterizations of his 
six-month stint as the last foreign minister of Czechoslovakia. 
During his 11 months as the independent Slovakia's foreign 
minister, he was frequently criticized for bad management skills. 
  Moravcik's leading role in the rebellion within the Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)--a rebellion that triggered the 
fall of former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar--has only added to 
the mystery surrounding him. Previously, he was not considered a 
political heavyweight, nor was he seen as someone willing to 
stick out his political neck. 
  Now the fate of Slovakia over the next six months--some say 
the health of democracy in the country for the next 
generation--is in the hands of the 49-year-old former communist, 
former law professor, former revolutionary and former Meciar 
aide. 
  The political and economic chaos in the country is such that 
few dare to predict whether Moravcik is equal to the task. But 
most observers say it should be only a matter of weeks before it 
becomes clear whether he has a chance to be successful or not. 
  The government Moravcik now heads contains no less than five 
political parties, ranging in ideology from the former communist 
Party of the Democratic Left (SDL) to the fiscally and socially 
conservative Christian Democratic Movement (KDH). While keeping 
this potentially fractious coalition united, he will also have 
to hold the unpredictable Meciar at bay in the run-up to 
national elections Sept. 30 and Oct. 1. 
  Egon Lansky, former Czechoslovak deputy foreign minister, 
said Moravcik's better qualities will serve him well. 
  "I remember my first encounters with him," said Lansky. "He 
would frankly say to me, `Tell me about this and that because I 
don't understand it--I have no experience in this field.' That 
was one of his positive sides." 
  Moravcik represented "the better face of Meciarism," said 
Lansky. 
  The ability Moravcik has shown through the years to rise 
from 
relative obscurity to prominent positions can be explained by 
his instinct for promoting his career as well as his genuine 
nationalism, said Lansky. 
  The new leader's supporters in parliament tend to place 
their 
faith in his reputation as a centrist and a consensus builder, 
as well as his history of being a tough negotiator. He may 
succeed mainly because others need him to succeed. In the days 
following the Moravcik appointment, expressions of hope that 
those qualities would keep the coalition together were almost 
universal. 
  Moravcik studied law in Bratislava and Prague. He became a 
law lecturer at Comenius University in Bratislava in 1972, and 
he was dean of the law faculty in 1990-91. In the late 1980s, he 
was a founding member of a younger and more progressive wing of 
the Slovak Communist Party. 
  In November 1989, he quit the party and became a member of 
Public Against Violence (VPN), the Slovak sister of the Czech 
revolutionary movement Civic Forum (OF). He filled a vacant VPN 
seat in the Slovak parliament in January 1991, and when the 
movement split that spring, he became a founding member of HZDS. 
  He was elected to the Czechoslovak federal parliament in 
June 
1992. The following month, he was a surprise choice for 
Czechoslovak foreign minister. Upon the death of the federation 
Jan. 1, 1993, he became a legislative adviser to Meciar. When 
Foreign Minister Milan Knazko was fired in March 1993 after a 
long-running feud with Meciar, Moravcik replaced him. 
  Rumors that he had fallen into disfavor with the 
increasingly 
autocratic Meciar emerged last October after the prime minister 
fired widely respected Ambassador to Austria Rudolf Filkus. 
  Consistent with his non-confrontational style, Moravcik 
refused to support Filkus' removal but stopped short of openly 
condemning the decision. Observers of Slovak politics were not 
surprised when Moravcik and Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac 
formed the Alternative of Political Realism faction within HZDS 
in February. 
  The alternative faction called for Meciar's removal and the 
formation of a broad-based coalition of non-partisan experts. 
For this, Moravcik and Kovac were expelled from HZDS and forced 
from the government. 
  Less than a month later, President Michal Kovac called on 
Moravcik to form a new government in order to reverse Slovakia's 
economic decline and increasing international isolation, and to 
put an end to the roughshod tactics of Meciar.

<F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Koev: "Bulgarian Minister's Visit to </F>
Macedonia Ends With Scandal"] 
  [Text] Skopje, April 14 (BTA) -- The two-day official visit 
of Bulgarian Minister of Science and Education Marko Todorov to 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
was broken off yesterday [13 April]. 
  Having conferred with his Macedonian counterparts Selmani 
and 
Bajaldziev on April 12, at the end of his visit Todorov was to 
sign a protocol on cooperation between the similar ministries of 
the two countries. The document, coordinated in advance with 
Macedonian experts in Sofia, said that the protocol was to be 
signed in the official languages in Bulgaria and Macedonia. 
  Yesterday the Macedonian side demanded that this established 
wording in bilateral practice and documentation be substituted 
for "the Macedonian and Bulgarian languages." The Bulgarian 
side refused to sign the document which marked the end of the 
visit which also envisaged a meeting with Macedonian Prime 
Minister Branko Crvenkovski. 
  Returning to Sofia, Minister Marko Todorov made a statement 
for the media saying there is no Macedonian language. In his 
opinion, it will be a betrayal of the Bulgarian language to 
recognize Macedonian as a foreign language. "I maintain that 
the formulation which Bulgaria suggests, `the official languages 
of the two countries,' is flexible and acceptable enough as it 
places Bulgaria and Macedonia on an equal footing," he said. 
Mr. Todorov expects that the language problem will be settled 
by signing the governmental agreement on cooperation between 
Bulgaria and Macedonia in science, education and culture, and 
that this will help make an adequate political decision. In 
Minister Todorov's view, the differences are temporary and it is 
to the interest of both Bulgaria and Macedonia to maintain good 
relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Edi Paloka: "Is the Greek Government </F>
Responsible for the Crime in the South of Albania?"] 
  [Text] Albanian blood has been shed on Albanian soil by 
Greek terrorists who wore the uniform of the Greek Army and who 
vented their criminal venom in the Greek language. 
  Nothing can disgust an Albanian more than such a thing: A 
foreigner violating your home and murdering in the night. Crime 
disgusts everyone, especially a crime as ugly and macabre as 
that of recent days. However, the Greek Government has reacted 
to it in a peculiar way. In its first responses, it not only 
failed to express sympathy for the victims, which in human terms 
was the least it could do, but government spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos spoke about an Albanian "provocation." This shows not 
only levity, but malice, especially at this time. 
  The progovernment Greek daily TA NEA did the same. 
  Meanwhile, a previously "unknown" group of Greek terrorists 
has shouldered responsibility for the crime. However, Venizelos 
seems not to be interested in this fact. In a way, the 
terrorist group's claim to the crime frees the Greek Government 
and Army of responsibility for organizing it. However, facts 
testify to a group wearing Greek Army uniforms, carrying the 
weapons of special units, and heading for a Greek border post. 
Anybody could telephone the editorial board of a newspaper (in 
this case ELEFTEROTHYPIA) and claim responsibility for this 
crime in order to let off the true culprits. However, let us 
suppose that this terrorist group exists and the government did 
not organize the incident. Is the Greek Government responsible 
for the crime? Venizelos' reply was that the Greek Government 
bears no responsibility. It is easy to shirk responsibility in 
a couple of words, but... 
  Despite attempts toward understanding, Albanian-Greek 
relations have often undergone very fraught periods. Even 
today, although the democratic Albanian Government makes every 
effort to foster not only a calm but friendly atmosphere with 
Greece, no such predisposition is apparent from the other side, 
and serious incidents recur. One might ask what responsibility 
the Greek Government bears for a crime committed by a group of 
terrorists. 
  Does the Greek Government bear responsibility for public 
statements issued by its members, such as the former minister 
Sotiris Kouvelas? Is the Greek Government responsible when such 
a creature as Sebastianos, who God knows why is called a priest, 
has founded a radio station that does nothing but rant against 
Albania and openly spread warmongering propaganda to its 
neighbor? 
  Is the Greek Government responsible when it deceitfully 
talks 
of 400,000 members of the Greek minority in Albania and when it 
issues bogus protests about alleged violations of the rights of 
this minority, which lives better on Albanian soil than the 
Albanians themselves? 
  Are all these things not a direct incitement to such crimes, 
whether they are planned by "independent" terrorist groups or by 
organized Greek military forces? 
  It is inexcusable for the Greek Government to maintain such 
a 
position, in such a serious situation in the Balkans, when any 
incident could lead to a conflagration. The Greeks have already 
come out as allies of the Serbs, but a EU member-state cannot be 
allowed to behave with such a barbaric mentality. 
  Thousands of Albanians work in Greece today, but thousands 
of 
members of the Greek minority likewise work on Albanian soil. 
These members of the minority cannot be used as Trojan horses, 
because we are no longer in the era before Christ and the 
Albanians are not besieged Trojans. The members of the Greek 
minority came to Albania and worked the Albanian land they still 
work today; Albanian kindness must therefore not be rewarded 
with malice, as Greek political representatives have often done. 
  Under these conditions, the present Greek Government would 
do 
well to control its policies, in which it is lining up not only 
alongside the Slavic heathens of Belgrade but against the whole 
of Europe, and possibly setting off on a path fraught with 
consequences for Greece and the Greek people themselves.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with German Foreign Minister Klaus </F>
Kinkel by correspondent Bujar Muharremi in Tirana on 14 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Dr. Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and deputy 
chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, arrived at 1300 
GMT today for an official and friendly visit to our country. 
The chief of German diplomacy, who arrived in our country on 
board a special German Air Force plane, was received by his 
counterpart Alfred Serreqi and high-level Foreign Ministry 
officials. 
  Upon arriving at Rinas airport, Kinkel gave a short 
interview 
for Albanian television: 
  [Muharremi] Dr. Kinkel, can you tell us something about the 
goal of your visit to Albania? 
  [Kinkel, in German fading into Albanian translation] I have 
never been to your country; this is my first visit at the 
invitation of Mr. Serreqi. This is actually a return visit, 
following the visit that your foreign minister paid to Germany 
last year. I would consider my arrival here as an effort to 
assist your country and an indication of further friendly 
relations between our two countries. 
  [Muharremi] Will you discuss the crisis in former Yugoslavia 
and the present situation in the Balkans? 
  [Kinkel] Of course, it is understandable that we will 
discuss the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. This problem was 
discussed in the German parliament yesterday. We have also 
talked with the UN secretary general, who was on a visit to 
Germany. It is clear that upon arriving in Albania, we will 
discuss the situation in the region, since three-fourths of 
Albania's boundaries border the former Yugoslavia. We will also 
discuss the role that Albania plays in the framework of this 
crisis. 
  [Muharremi] What is Germany's foreign policy regarding the 
future of Kosova? 
  [Kinkel] We think the situation in Kosova, which is 
characterized by oppression, should end as soon as possible. We 
have also made it clear that a peaceful solution in Kosova is 
necessary. This is what we will focus on during our talks with 
high-level Albanian officials.

  [Text] Bilateral relations, the development of friendship 
and cooperation between our two countries, and the regional 
situation were the main topics discussed today between President 
Sali Berisha and German Foreign Minister Kinkel. 
  Albania and the Albanian people are very grateful and 
cherish 
the friendly feelings toward the German people, President 
Berisha said. These feelings emanated from the invaluable 
contribution by German scientists studying Albanian culture and 
the immense assistance that Germany has provided to the 
democratic processes in our country since the very beginning. 
  We are grateful to the German Government and Germany for 
supporting Albania's efforts to change from a dictatorship to a 
rule-of-law state and market economy. He said that excellent 
political relations exist between our two countries, and the 
economic cooperation with Germany is among one of the most 
effective. 
  Albania was the most isolated communist country, Mr. Kinkel 
said, and, as a consequence, democratization and promoting 
economic reforms has been most difficult. I can say that your 
efforts and achievements during the transition period are 
astonishing. We understand your difficulties fairly well 
because we Germans have encountered difficulties of such a phase 
twice -- in 1945 after the dictatorship and in the last years in 
the eastern part of the country, where the transition rate has 
not been as speedy as yours. 
  The meeting extensively dealt with the further assistance 
that Germany can render by supplying water to cities, the energy 
field, an improvement in electricity, the traffic 
infrastructure, the solution to the problem of Albania's foreign 
debt, and the opening of a branch of the German bank. 
  Mr. Kinkel committed himself to intervene to the relevant 
German authorities and the European Union [EU] so that Albania 
be helped to complete these demands that he considers priority. 
He will try to see that his government encourages private 
investors as well. He said that Germany will support Albania's 
further integration into the EU, NATO, and the Council of 
Europe, and I will be your attorney to my European colleges. 
  President Berisha expressed his special gratitude for the 
invaluable assistance that Germany has given and is giving by 
allowing the refugees to stay. He informed the German minister 
that those refugees are supporting one or two families with what 
they are earning in Germany. Their deportation would constitute 
a problem for them and the country because they would be 
unemployed and homeless. President Berisha asked that a more 
tolerant stance be adopted toward them and that they be not 
deported. 
  Concerning the situation in the region, President Berisha 
said that the newly created Croat-Muslim federation is an 
important factor in achieving peace in the former Yugoslavia. 
In the same way, the solution to the Albanian question is also 
very important for a stable peace, in which the problem of 
Kosova is the main one. We think that the most efficient means 
for this is the bond of UN sanctions against Serbia by reaching 
an agreement between Belgrade and the legitimate Kosova leaders 
on the status of this province. 
  Concerning Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia], the president expressed once again Albania's 
determination to help and cooperate with this republic. He said 
that Albania is deeply interested in the stability of Macedonia. 
However, he stressed that it is necessary that Macedonian 
authorities carry out the census and meet their commitments to 
guarantee the human rights and freedoms of the Albanians who 
live there. 
  President Berisha also expressed his regret over the current 
crisis with Greece -- namely the criminal and premeditated act 
committed by a terrorist unit from Greece. He said that Albania 
is consistent in its policy of reducing the tension and 
preserving stability in the region. Since the first day, we 
proposed to cooperate with the Greek authorities to discover the 
culprits. Unfortunately, today we received an official response 
from the Greek side. We agree to establish a dialogue at a 
ministerial level to overcome the crisis and accept the creation 
of a joint commission to find and convict the culprits of this 
ugly crime. 
  President Berisha invited President Weizsaecker and 
Chancellor Kohl to visit Albania.

  [Text] The economic, technical, and scientific 
cooperation, the achievements attained so far, and the concrete 
possibilities to strengthen them in the future were the main 
theme of the talks held today between Prime Minister Meksi and 
Klaus Kinkel, German deputy chancellor and foreign minister, in 
the presence of Ministers Xhaja, Halili, and Belortaja. 
  Relations with Germany occupy an important place in our 
entire policy, Meksi said at the beginning of his speech. This 
is based on the special economic assistance and the full 
political support that your country has rendered to Albania so 
far and in the good wishes and will of both sides further to 
strengthen our friendly relations. 
  Talking concretely about the present level of cooperation in 
the economic, political, technical, scientific, and cultural 
spheres, Meksi considered these to be successful and stressed 
that, nevertheless, there exist more favorable possibilities so 
that these relations be more intensively developed in other 
fields as well. Important positive factors are the good progress 
of the economic reform in Albania in its main indices and the 
completion of the fundamental legal framework to attract foreign 
investment. Overall production has increased and there is a 
decrease in the budget deficit and inflation. Stability can be 
noticed in the lek's exchange rate with foreign currencies. We 
can say that we have left behind the most difficult period. We 
have approved the main laws on investment, business, and the 
banking and credit system, and the civil and penal codes are in 
the process of being approved. 
  Meksi further stressed that the completion of a series of 
bilateral agreements that are in the process of being drafted, 
such as the abolition of double taxation, tourism, road and 
maritime transportation, and scientific and cultural 
cooperation, will create a more facilitating legal framework to 
expand relations between our two countries. 
  Focusing on the problem of foreign investment, Prime 
Minister 
Meksi said that German capital is involved in Albania in special 
investment, such as that of Siemens for Rinas Airport, and in 
the form of joint ventures. However, he said, we expect German 
investment to grow considerably during 1994 and beyond and to 
include such fields as infrastructure and telecommunication, 
road constructions, such as the east-west road, aqueducts, 
energy, etc. 
  We greatly appreciate Germany's role both on the bilateral 
level and within the framework of the European Union [EU], in 
which Germany is the main contributor. 
  Mr. Meksi also dwelt on the problem of the foreign debt of 
our banks and discussed ways of settling it, as another 
guarantee for attracting foreign investment. He stressed that 
contacts with German partners have been strengthened and hoped 
that with the Paris Club Agreement, this problem will find the 
way to solution in the framework of the general debt. 
  For his part, Mr. Kinkel said that Germany understands quite 
well the difficult problems that you are encountering during the 
transitional period and that Germany is committed to help as 
before on the bilateral and the EU level. Albania is a country 
that has suffered the most in the past. That is why you fully 
deserve special assistance on our part, Kinkel stressed. 
Germany will fully support you in your goals for an the 
quickest possible political and economic approach to the EU, 
membership into the Council of Europe, the cooperation with BEP 
[expansion unknown], and the strengthening of the security of 
your country, both with the NATO integration and the bilateral 
level. 
  For this reason, we are ready to exchange high-level visits 
and sign a joint statement to display our very good relations 
and the goals of cooperation in the future. 
  In the economic level, our assistance will be increased and 
will be concentrated on the system of energy supplies, the 
construction of roads, economic development, etc. Though we 
have to face our problems with eastern Germany, our attention 
toward Albania will be increased. I also agree to abolish visas 
for diplomatic and business trips. 
  Further on, Kinkel appreciated the achievements in the 
sphere 
of the institutional and legal reform and expressed his pleasure 
that the judicial system is functioning well. He was ready for 
assistance in this direction as well. 
  To conclude, Meksi said that Albania is a small country and 
with a little investment, it can overcome this situation. We 
have understood that the main factor of development is within 
us, our work, which, with your assistance, can give rapid 
positive results. 
  They also discussed German assistance in education, culture, 
and science, the problem of Albanian refugees, and the situation 
in the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by </F>
unidentified STANDART NEWS reporter; place and date not given: 
"International Community's Sanctions Against Serbia Must Also 
Affect Kosovo, Krajina, and Sandzak...."] 
  [Text] [STANDART NEWS] What is Albania's policy regarding 
Albanian minorities in other countries? 
  [Serreqi] Albania issued several official announcements to 
the fact that it respects the borders of its neighbors and 
opposes any change in them by force. However, we are greatly 
concerned by the conditions under which the Albanian minorities 
in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM], and especially in Kosovo, live. We demand that their 
normal human and national rights are respected. They must have 
the democratic possibility to express their opinion. 
  [STANDART NEWS] If the conflict in Bosnia is resolved, will 
Serbian aggression in Kosovo follow? 
  [Serreqi] I think that the crisis in the former Yugoslav 
Federation has many aspects. The fighting in Bosnia is the 
gravest and most tragic aspect, but the conflict also has other 
dimensions. One of them is Kosovo. If the conflict spreads 
there, it will affect the entire Balkan peninsula. 
  This is precisely why we insist on the deployment of 
international observers in Kosovo. They would prevent the 
expansion of the conflict and facilitate the discussion about 
Kosovo's official status. We think that the first thing that 
must be done is to return to the Albanians in Kosovo the rights 
and autonomy that the Constitution of 1974 guaranteed them. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Do you want the restoration of that 
constitution? 
  [Serreqi] No. The Albanians in Kosovo must discuss the 
future of their region, but this is where the discussion must 
start. It is unacceptable to speak about another autonomy, 
which will not even guarantee the conditions provided by the 
older constitutions. 
  Thus, if the peace process progresses, then the sanctions 
and 
all measures of the international community vis-a-vis Serbia 
must be connected not only to Bosnia but also to the other 
crisis areas -- Kosovo, Krajina, Vojvodina, Sandzak.... 
  [STANDART NEWS] What could you say about the Serbian protest 
against your proposal? They think that Kosovo is their internal 
matter. 
  [Serreqi] Kosovo is not an internal Serbian problem, because 
it is not an integral part of their country. This is not even a 
regional, but rather an international issue. An Albanian 
Government cannot decide whether there should be an intervention 
or not. However, the Albanians will react on a national basis, 
because the people in Kosovo are a physical part of Albania. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Do you maintain any contacts with Rugova -- 
the prime minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo, 
recognized only by Albania? 
  [Serreqi] We maintain constant contacts. The Albanians in 
Kosovo demonstrated their civilized character by silently 
withstanding the terrible pressure and the violation of human 
rights. The tension reached a critical level about one year 
ago, when the Serbian expelled the CSCE observers from the 
region. Despite this Rugova and the other leaders continue to 
control the situation. However, we are concerned, because the 
people there feel abandoned. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Could you comment on the rumors that Albania 
supported a coup attempt on the part of the Macedonian 
Albanians, revealed four months ago by the government in Skopje? 
  [Serreqi] Albania was among the first countries which 
recognized Macedonia. We are convinced that this country's 
sovereignty is in the foundation of the region's stability. We 
are prepared to help Macedonia to endure more easily the 
consequences of the Greek sanctions. 
  However, it is obvious that our relations with Macedonia are 
connected with the situation of the Albanian minority there, 
which is about 35 percent of the population. I am sure that the 
Macedonian Government could and should do more for the 
Albanians' rights. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Could you nevertheless compare the rights of 
the Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo? 
  [Serreqi] Of course, the situation is not identical. The 
Albanians in Kosovo are subjected to horrible repressions. 
Nevertheless, I think that the Albanians in Macedonia must 
acquire the status of "first class" citizens -- as all the rest. 
Macedonia should be declared a multinational status. It is 
very suited for this. After all, Bulgarians, Macedonians, 
Albanians, Serbs, and Greeks live there.

<F P=106> [Letter addressed to the newspapers ALEANCA, KOHA JONE, </F>
RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE, ZERI I POPULLIT, and DITA INFORMACION by 
Shyqyri Cela; date and place not given: "Public Order Minister 
Agron Musaraj and Shkoder National Intelligence Service Chief 
Fitim Meta Asked Me To Have My Brother Selami Cela Wounded To 
Excuse Gjovalin Cekini's Tragic Murder"] 
  [Text] I, Shyqyri Cela, former Democratic Party deputy 
elected in Mat District on 22 March 1992, and police chief in 
Shkoder immediately after the elections, an appointment that 
obliged me to hand in my mandate as deputy, feel obliged to 
address the press to condemn the low machinations of Public 
Order Minister Agron Musaraj, and Fitim Meta, National 
Intelligence Service [ShIK] chief in Shkoder, in covering up and 
excusing the murder of Gjovalin Cekini in Shkoder on 14 January. 
  Much has been said and written in the press and in public 
about this tragic murder that shocked the Cekini family, 
Unfortunately, according to what witnesses have written, my 
brother Selami Cela was involved in this tragedy. 
  I know that Selami was not at the Democratic alliance 
meeting 
on 14 January, nor in any group involved in breaking up this 
meeting. While the meeting was taking place in the Midjeni 
Theater, he was with his friends in a cafe in the Rus quarter. 
A policeman found him there, and asked Selami to take him in 
his car to the Migjeni Theater. Selami agreed; when his car 
reached the front of the theater, he saw the participants in the 
meeting emerging. From the published testimonies of relatives 
of the late Gjovalin Cekini, I have learned that Selami traded 
harsh words and insults with the people coming out of the 
theater. Somebody hit him in the jaw, and he began to turn back 
toward Radio Shkoder. He also drew his revolver but did not 
fire it, continuing to move backwards while facing Gjovalin 
Cekini, who was begging him not to shoot. It was at this moment 
that Gjovalin Cekini was shot down and killed. Everyone 
believes this sincere testimony of one of Gjovalin Cekini's 
relatives, who saw the events of 14 January with his own eyes. 
I too believe it, not simply out of relief that my brother was 
not the killer, but because it is the testimony of one of those 
most affected, who was at the scene of the crime. As for the 
relief, I want to say that my family and I remained distressed 
that one of us was involved for no reason at all in a quarrel 
that came to a tragic end. The fact that he was slightly drunk, 
as his friends have told me, is no excuse. 
  Many people know what I have just written, but what I am 
about to write is known only to one or two of my close friends. 
I want everybody to know, because everybody should know. 
  What happened after Gjovalin Cekini's murder? On 17 January, 
three days after the incident, Public Order Minister Agron 
Musaraj summoned me urgently to Tirana. I was somewhat 
surprised. I had been unemployed and without pay for about 18 
months. This minister had not replied to my requests for a 
meeting, for a job, and for an explanation of why I had been 
left in the lurch. Nevertheless, I went to the ministry. In 
the presence of two or three other people, Mr. Musaraj very 
courteously lamented the fact that I had been left unemployed 
and immediately suggested that I should start work at once as a 
lecturer at the Police College. I was in great need of work, 
but the circumstances under which the suggestion was made 
floored me. All Shkoder and the entire press were mentioning my 
brother as implicated in the murder of an innocent lad from an 
ordinary, poor family. It was at such a time that I was being 
offered work in Tirana. Agron Musaraj blithely went on to make 
me another proposal, without imagining that he was offending or 
dishonoring me. In exchange for a lecturer's job, he told me to 
hand in my brother, implying that the matter of 14 January would 
be smoothed over. I did not know where my brother was, and had 
not even seen him. Only our mother had seen him just before he 
left home. 
  Minister Musaraj did not want a reply there and then in his 
office, but gave me three days to think about it. However, he 
did not wait three days. On the following day, 18 January, he 
arrived in Shkoder and asked me to go to the police station. 
This man who disgraces the office of minister, together with 
ShlK chief Fitim Meta, asked me for something that day that I 
would never have believed if I had not heard it with my own 
ears. They told me that my brother had been wounded, and had 
committed the murder in self-defense. My flesh crept. My 
mother had told me that Selami was not wounded, and in fact 
nobody had threatened his life opposite the Midjeni Theater. 
How could I agree to such disgraceful bargaining over the blood 
of an innocent, just-buried victim? Fitim Meta, thinking that I 
had failed to understand the trick, put it bluntly: "We will 
wound Selami, and then bring him to trial, where it will be 
demonstrated that he killed in self-defense. We will put him 
inside for a little while, then release him, and that will be an 
end of the matter." 
  This is not the language of human beings, but of criminals. 
They wanted us to take upon ourselves a blood-score. They 
wanted to conclude the murder of 14 January in such a 
disgraceful fashion. The two people who planned this were 
highlevel officials of this state and members of this government 
for which I too had voted as a Democratic Party deputy. The 
earth almost gave way beneath me. At that moment, it became 
clear to me that my brother was not the direct murderer. It was 
clear to me that Gjovalin Cekini's murder really did have a 
political hue. The public order minister and the ShIK chief 
were trying to cover up this murder in a criminal fashion, and 
they did not turn a hair at involving another person, even 
offering me a good job in Tirana. 
  I left these unscrupulous people. I did not and did not wish 
to see their faces again. I thought I was rid of them, but this 
was not entirely the case. They manage and govern with 
incomparable hypocrisy, and people who trust them do not know 
how wicked they are. I knew, and now had proof that was 
poisoning my life as long as I kept it to myself. I could not 
refrain from telling a few close friends, and thus word began to 
get around. Then these "angels" revealed their true faces, and 
used someone from Kukes to try to liquidate me in an attempted 
assassination. 
  However, I did not wish to vanish without telling the truth, 
which is very bitter not only for myself who experienced it, but 
for all Albanians who do not wish to see their country setting 
out on the path of crime and in the hands of such immoral and 
unprincipled people as Agron Musaraj. The truth will require me 
again, but I am no longer safe here and I cannot entrust my life 
to criminals invested with power. I am therefore leaving 
Albania with a broken heart, but with the hope that justice and 
genuine democracy will not be long in coming.

  [Text] According to the BALKAN NEWS AGENCY the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] could demand the resignation of the 
cabinet if it allows the United Nations to use a corridor 
through Bulgarian territory. 
  During a break in the National Assembly session today, the 
BSP parliamentary group discussed this issue but did not reach a 
specific decision. There were equal numbers of votes for and 
against. 
  The parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces 
is postponing its decision on the same matter, because it is not 
clear whether the United Nations really requested a military 
corridor through Bulgarian territory.

<F P=106> [Report on the National Assembly debate on the cabinet </F>
motion to allow the passage of UN military equipment convoy for 
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Sofia -- live] 
  [Text] [Announcer] As we have already reported, at a 
midnight session last night the Council of Ministers prepared a 
draft resolution by means of which parliament is to permit the 
transit passage through Bulgarian territory of property and 
equipment for the preventative operations of the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]. At the moment the members of parliament 
are discussing the submitted draft resolution. Here is a report 
from Vladislav Stoychev in our studio at the National Assembly. 
  [Stoychev] During the debate the parliamentary groups 
expressed the following basic views on the issue. The NSD [New 
Alliance for Democracy], Independence Parliamentary Group, and 
the Movement for Rights and Freedoms unconditionally supported 
the government's proposal. The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] 
linked its support to criticism of the government for the manner 
in which it acted yesterday, circumventing parliament and 
becoming embroiled in a chaos of contradictions. 
  The BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] motivated its negative 
stance with the following arguments. By citing the 
Constitution, the government acknowledged that the matter 
concerns foreign troops. According to the BSP, this runs counter 
to Bulgaria's decision of 19 April 1993 on nonintervention in 
conflicts in former Yugoslavia. The view of the BSP reminds 
parliament of Bulgaria's respect for the United Nations, the 
losses from the embargo, and the obligations of the United 
Nations and the UN Sanctions Committee toward Bulgaria. 
Incidentally, the issues of respect for the United Nations and 
the efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement of the conflicts 
figured prominently in the stated viewpoints of all the 
parliamentary groups. 
  Gincho Pavlov of the Fatherland Party of Labor declared that 
the UN request has no other meaning in practice than a desire to 
create a precedent for the subsequent passage of Turkish blue 
helmets through Bulgarian territory. The BSP position was 
sharply criticized in the last statement that was made a short 
time ago, by SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. The debate continues.

    [Editorial Report] Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in 
Bulgarian from 0805 to 0949 GMT carried a live relay, 
interrupted by the midday newscast from 0900 to 0920, of a 
debate in the National Assembly in Sofia on a draft resolution 
submitted by the Council of Ministers to grant a request 
submitted by the United Nations for the one-time passage of a 
road convoy with UN property and equipment needed by the UN 
Protection Forces in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 
FYROM, for preventative operations. The different parliamentary 
groups expressed varying stances on the issue. 
  At 0940 GMT National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, 
who chaired the debates, declared the debate closed and asked 
the deputies to take an open vote on the resolution. At 0946 
GMT Yordanov announced the result of the ballot as follows: "A 
total of 215 National Assembly deputies took part in the ballot. 
Of these, 117 voted in favor of the resolution, 92 against, and 
six deputies abstained. Accordingly, the resolution is adopted 
and becomes a resolution of the National Assembly." 
  Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev then rose to express 
"warm gratitude to the National Assembly for officially 
supporting the proposal submitted by the government today on an 
exceptionally important problem." His statement was greeted 
with a mixture of applause and shouting.

  [Text] Klaus Kinkel, vice chancellor and foreign minister 
of Germany, arrived in Bulgaria on an official visit last night. 
  After official talks at the Foreign Ministry this morning, 
Kinkel will pay a call on National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov and have meetings at the Council of Ministers. This 
afternoon he will be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  Upon his arrival, the German foreign minister particularly 
stressed that there are no problems in the relations between 
Bulgaria and Germany. Regarding the international topics to be 
discussed in his talks, he said that he would certainly be 
discussing the situation in former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as 
a whole. In addition, the situation in Russia would not be 
omitted in the talks. Kinkel supposed that other subjects would 
crop up in the course of the talks that would prevent them from 
becoming tedious. Perhaps one of the reasons is this: 
  [Begin Kinkel recording, in German fading into Bulgarian 
report] Bulgaria lies very close to my heart, Mr. Kinkel said. 
He added that he will try to help Bulgaria in solving its 
problems, both in terms of joining the EU and in connection with 
its contacts with NATO and its relations with the IMF. I am 
sure that Bulgaria can count on the German foreign minister, 
Kinkel declared on his arrival at Sofia Airport. [end recording]

  [Text] After a prolonged medical consultation, it was 
announced at a news conference at the Council of Ministers that 
in the last three to four days an acute illness developed in 
Professor Berov's liver. There are tendencies toward 
improvement in the clinical and laboratory indices. 
  The patient has slight hepatitis but with a tendency to heal 
within a brief period of time. There are two versions about the 
basic cause: Either a mechanical clogging of the gall bladder 
vessels, which occurred and passed rapidly, or a light form of 
an acute hepatitis virus. This was announced by 
gastroenterologist Professor Konstantin Chernev. A specific 
blood test of the patient will be carried out abroad. The result 
will be known within several days.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb commanders Thursday 
[14 April] sent troops and a tank to surround French UN 
peacekeepers guarding an arms collection site near Sarajevo, 
sparking a NATO warning of airstrikes to punish similar breaches 
of its heavy weapons exclusion zone. 
  Serb soldiers ordered 30 French troops guarding weapons at 
Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, to hand over the weapons, 
said Eric Chaperon, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR). 
  The arms were placed under UN control following a February 9 
accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on a ceasefire and 
withdrawal of heavy weapons from a radius of 20 kilometres (12 
miles) from the capital Sarajevo, in line with a UN and NATO 
ultimatum. 
  A UN spokesman said a high-ranking UNPROFOR official had 
telephoned the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale after the 
encirclement at 2:OO p.m. (1200 GMT). 
  The tank -- whose presence marked a violation of the 
exclusion zone -- later withdrew into surrounding woodland but a 
"tense" stand-off continued, the spokesman said. 
  In Brussels, a spokesman for the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation reaffirmed the alliance's determination to enforce 
the heavy arms exclusion zone. 
  "NATO's mandate to conduct air strikes -- in close 
coordination with the UN secretary general and upon request of 
the UN -- on any uncontrolled weapons in a 20 km exclusion zone 
around Sarajevo, is still in force. 
  "Close air support to UNPROFOR troops in danger can be 
provided if requested by UNPROFOR commanders and approved by UN 
special representative Mr. (Yasushi) Akashi," the statement 
added. 
  Serb troops tried to seize heavy weapons from the 
Krivoglavci 
site on Tuesday but withdrew after receiving orders from their 
command post in the Serb-held Sarajevo suburb of Lukavica, after 
it had been contacted by UNPROFOR. 
  Following Sunday and Monday's NATO air strikes on Serb 
positions around the eastern Bosnia Moslem enclave of Gorazde, 
Serb troops have also placed mines around three weapons 
collection sites, blocking UN personnel guarding the sites, an 
UNPROFOR spokesman said Wednesday.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--The Information Service 
of the Serb Republic Army's [VRS] main headquarters has said in 
a statement that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] units deployed 
on Mt. Igman and Mt. Bjelasnica, after they had taken over VRS 
positions on the basis of the agreement of 30 July 1993, today 
withdrew to the area of Hrasnica and to Sarajevo airport as 
agreed upon between the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and 
the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo. 
  The statement says that by withdrawing their units from 
these 
positions, UNPROFOR is enabling the Muslim forces that come from 
Sarajevo through a tunnel under the airport to attack VRS 
positions and Serb territory in Trnovo and on Rogoj, with the 
objective to link Gorazde and Sarajevo. 
  These offensive actions--as well as those already taken from 
various locations against the plateau of Nisici--are aiding the 
Muslim offensive aimed at breaking up and conquering the 
territory of Serb Sarajevo. 
  The actions coordinated between UNPROFOR and the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are aimed at forcing an energetic 
response from the VRS in the Sarajevo area, which would then be 
used as a pretext for the use of NATO air force against the Serb 
artillery positions around Sarajevo, which have been grouped and 
placed under UNPROFOR control, the statement says.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (TANJUG) -- Vice-President of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) Biljana Plavsic on Thursday said 
that all persons who had approved the NATO air strikes against 
the R.S. must be excluded from the further consultations on the 
resumption of the peace talks for the former Yugoslav republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "General Rose is a persona non grata on the territory held 
by 
the R.S. army. He simply must leave. His departure would be 
one of the Serb side's three conditions for the resumption of 
the talks," Plavsic said on Radio Jagodina (town in central 
Serbia). 
  The other two conditions on which the R.S. insists have been 
presented by R.S. President Radovan Karadzic, and they are the 
lifting of sanctions against the Serb people and the signing of 
a peace agreement for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, 
Plavsic said. 
  Asked to comment the report from New York that the Sarajevo 
formula should be applied in the case of Gorazde, too, Plavsic 
said that "the Serb side categorically rejects a Sarajevo 
formula which would be applied in Gorazde, because the situation 
is not the same." "The Serbs will not accept the Sarajevo model 
for Gorazde," she underscored. 
  U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, British General Michael Rose on Sunday 
requested that NATO aircraft raid Bosnian Serb positions around 
Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" in eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  U.S. NATO aircraft raided Bosnian Serb positions around 
Gorazde on Sunday and Monday, under the pretext of protecting 
UNPROFOR members. 
  Before the air strikes were launched, the Muslim side had 
accused the Serbs of attacking civilian targets in Gorazde, 
while the Serbs insisted that the Muslims were using the town of 
Gorazde for attacks on Serb positions. Gorazde should have been 
demilitarized last spring as a U.N.-protected "safe area." 
  UNPROFOR representatives, for their part, had confirmed that 
the fighting in the area of Gorazde had been provoked by the 
Muslim side. 
  "The U.N. decision to bomb the army and civilians in the 
R.S. 
is an act of aggression on the R.S. We were aware that UNPROFOR 
was aiding the Muslims since July 1992, when we were forbidden 
to use Sarajevo airport to transport our wounded. However, now 
that we have been bombed, too, both the politicians and the army 
must realize that the U.N. peace-keepers are enemies of the Serb 
people," Plavsic said. 
  "The case of Gorazde has shown from the international aspect 
that the agreements between Western powers and Russia are not 
being respected. Only consent was asked of Great Britain, while 
it appears that nobody had consulted Russia at all," the R.S. 
vice- president set out. 
  General Rose continues saying that the R.S. army has stopped 
outside Gorazde and that there is no more shooting, all in an 
effort to prove that air raids are an effective method, Plavsic 
said. 
  She set out that she left Gorazde on Wednesday night 
strongly 
convinced that the raiding of the Bosnian Serb positions had 
strengthened the Bosnian Serb troops in their determination to 
defend every inch of R.S. territory and the conviction that the 
U.N. peace-keepers were now an enemy of the Serb people. 
  "It is up to the international community to evaluate the 
success of the aggression," Plavsic said.

  [Excerpts] Zvornik, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- General Michael 
Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander for the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is personally responsible for the abuse of 
the UN peace mission on the territory of the Srpska Republic and 
the transformation of the UNPROFOR command into an executive 
branch of NATO, Major General Milan Gvero, assistant commander 
in chief of the Army of the Srpska Republic, has told TANJUG. 
  According to Gvero, "on the basis of fabricated reasons and 
untrue reports he made a decision to use the NATO air force 
against the Serbs and thus caused UNPROFOR to become militarily 
involved in this civil war on the Muslim side." 
  Gen. Gvero explained that Gen. Rose did this "at a moment 
when an agreement on the complete and permanent cessation of 
hostilities throughout the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, as 
proposed by the Army of the Srpska Republic, was about to be 
signed." 
  "He personally did not have any objections to our draft 
agreement," Gen. Gvero said, adding that Gen. Rose even assessed 
the draft agreement as "too good," but said the Muslims would 
not sign it. 
  According to Gvero, Rose should have "put pressure on the 
belligerent Muslims to sign that agreement," but instead of that 
"he encouraged them and sent the air force against the Serbs, 
who were proposing peace." 
  "By this he displayed complete partiality and behavior 
totally at odds with the UN peace mission," Gvero said, 
stressing that Rose "did not prove to be up to this complex 
situation." [passage omitted] 
  "While we were able to discuss facts with ease with Rose's 
compatriot General Ramsey and with other generals -- which is 
why good results were achieved in those periods -- Gen. Rose 
cannot rid himself of the syndrome of one-sided textbook 
schemes, according to which he is a `good guy.' He is always 
right in advance while all those who are defending their country 
are bad and incompetent." 
  According to Gvero, Gen. Rose "is behaving in this sensitive 
situation as if he had just been dropped in with his parachute 
and had met `bad Serb guys.' That is what he has been told," 
Gvero stated. 
  "Gen. Rose lost credibility with the Serb people when he 
finally took off his mask and sent a combat air force to kill 
civilians and defenders of the Serb territory, and he has 
neither a moral, nor military, nor political basis to 
participate any further in the peace process in the area," Gen. 
Gvero believes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- The information service 
of the general staff of the army of the Srpska Republic issued a 
communique today saying that the general staff has reliable 
information that Tuzla airport is being placed under NATO 
control. 
  The communique, which was forwarded to TANJUG, says parts of 
the Nordic UN battalion are being withdrawn from the airport and 
control is being taken over by 150 U.S. Army soldiers who were 
airlifted from The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to 
Tuzla. 
  "We also have information that only NATO transport aircraft 
have been landing at the airport, bringing in weapons and 
military equipment from NATO bases for the Muslims and 
airlifting NATO rapid intervention units," the communique says. 
  The communique goes on to say that it is a well-known fact 
that the Serb side and top Russian representatives agreed that 
the Serbs will agree to the reopening of Tuzla airport only for 
peaceful and humanitarian purposes, and provided that Russian UN 
observers and Serb Army liaison officers are deployed there. 
  "Despite the fact that no agreement on the reopening of 
Tuzla 
airport has been signed and that Russian observers and Serb 
officers are not deployed there, the NATO troops, under UN 
auspices, have been transporting weapons and military equipment 
for the Muslims, thus crudely violating the embargo on importing 
weapons for the warring sides in this area. That is why they 
are replacing UN Protection Forces troops with NATO personnel, 
i.e. with U.S. Army soldiers," the communique says. 
  "These facts and other intelligence reports confirm our 
assessments and indicate that Tuzla airport will not be used for 
peace and humanitarian flights at all, but exclusively for 
arming the Muslims and setting up a NATO base," the communique 
says.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Sarajevo airport was 
closed late Thursday [14 April] after unidentified firing 
targetted UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] helicopters, an 
UNPROFOR spokesman said. 
  Captain Eric Chaperon said two helicopters -- a Sea King and 
a Puma -- were targetted in the attack, but did not say if they 
were hit or where the firing had come from. 
  Only UNPROFOR planes had been continuing to use the airport, 
he said, since the UN High Commissioner for Refugees suspended 
aid flights to Sarajevo in the wake of the Gorazde attacks.

  [Excerpt] Cajnice, April 14 (TANJUG)--NATO aircraft flew 
over Bosnian Serb positions between Gorazde and Cajnice in 
eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina at 16:00 hours local time on 
Thursday, TANJUG has learned from Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) 
sources. 
  According to the same sources, there have be no reports 
about 
whether the aircraft undertook combat action in the area of the 
two towns which are close to the border with the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  U.S. NATO aircraft on Sunday and Monday raided Bosnian Serb 
positions around Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe area" which 
should have been demilitarized last spring. Not only that 
Gorazde has not been demilitarized, but it was used to mass over 
10,000 Muslim troops and launch a strong offensive on Bosnian 
Serb territory in late March. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Rome, April 14 (TANJUG)--NATO sources in Italy said 
that NATO planes buzzed the Moslem-held town of Tuzla in 
northeastern Bosnia for three hours on Thursday to deter Bosnian 
Serbs from attacking U.N. troops on the ground. 
  A NATO spokesman said the U.N. troops in Tuzla were directly 
threatened by Serb forces which repeatedly shelled the airport 
and the town itself. Tuzla is held by the Moslems. The Serb 
troops are deployed around the town. 
  Pairs of U.S. A-10 planes from NATO's base in Aviano, 
British 
Harriers from the Arc Royal air carrier and Jaguars from the 
Gioia Del Cole base, and Dutch F-16s from Villafranca were 
engaged in the "intimidation" action. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said on Thursday that 
NATO transporter planes had been shipping war materiel to Tuzla 
for days although the local airport had not been officially 
reopened. 
  The airport can only be used for humanitarian flights, 
Karadzic was categorical. He also said two transporters that 
were about to land at Tuzla on Thursday decided otherwise after 
the Serb side warned them not to land. 
  "I think this is better than to down them." 
  The Bosnian Serb command on Monday accused NATO of 
transferring parts of it rapid deployment force to Tuzla. 
  Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, told 
TANJUG on Tuesday he knew nothing about that but did not rule 
out the possibility that troops and equipment for securing the 
airport might have been airborne to Tuzla. 
  "We have warned them that the airport will be reopened only 
on the basis of an agreement between us and Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin, peace envoy Vitaliy Churkin and Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev," said Karadzic. 
  Bosnian Serbs opposed the reopening of Tuzla airport fearing 
it might be used for shipping arms to the Moslems, and insisted 
that Bosnian Serb and Russian U.N. monitors be deployed at the 
facility to inspect its operation.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nikola Koljevic, deputy leader of </F>
the Bosnian Serbs, by Dragan Colovic; place and date not given 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Colovic] Good day, Mr. Koljevic. 
  [Koljevic] Good day. 
  [Colovic] We here think that the atmosphere is somewhat 
calmer, that diplomatic-political activities are being stepped 
up, and that the situation is better than it was yesterday or 
the day before yesterday. Do you agree? 
  [Koljevic] Yes, I also think that the situation is somewhat 
calmer, although it is still very difficult to calm the 
justified anger of the entire Serbian nation that was caused by 
the air strikes. I think this will not be easy to do without 
recognizing, acknowledging the very vital interests of the Serbs 
in the Serbian republic and the Serbian people as a whole. 
  However, [words indistinct] is easier today than yesterday 
because there are new initiatives. 
  [Colovic] Vitaliy Churkin, envoy of Russian President 
Yeltsin, stated yesterday that this was the moment when a 
decision has to be made on which path to take, whether to aim 
for peace or war. One can conclude from the context of his 
fairly long statement that the Serbs will not do anything -- if, 
of course, not provoked -- that would endanger peace and even 
his personal efforts. In this context he made some proposals, 
initiatives to the leadership in Pale regarding the continuation 
of the peace negotiations. Mr. Koljevic, when can we expect a 
response to these initiatives. 
  [Koljevic] I think that the response to these initiatives 
could be expected tomorrow, because a decision on possible 
future contacts with the United Nations will be made at the 
meeting of the supreme command of the army of the Serbian 
republic tomorrow. Contacts with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
are out of the question for the time being. However, we will 
very seriously consider a possibility of contacts with the 
civilian sector, those who are not directly involved in military 
matters, and thus in the bombing. If the decision is positive, 
then a meeting with the representatives of the civil authorities 
or civil sector, above all, Mr. Akashi, could take place very 
soon. 
  [Colovic] There is one encouraging fact, and I hope you will 
agree with this, namely that Owen and Stoltenberg, cochairmen of 
the Geneva Conference, who have been out of the game for some 
time, have now rejoined the diplomatic-political action. They 
are now back in the game and it is interesting that they 
returned to the game after your meeting with them in Paris. 
  [Koljevic] Yes. We followed a basic criterion after these 
aggressive attacks on the Serbian people and the Serbian 
republic. Our criterion was simple. Those people and those 
forces who were not directly involved in these attacks are 
possible partners for talks. Considering that Russia was not 
informed [about the air strikes], as has been publicly 
announced, we held a series of consultative meetings with Mr. 
Churkin. Since Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg were not 
involved in this action either, in fact they were left aside, 
they were considered as possible partners for talks. They even 
offered their good services. If it is possible to overcome this 
critical moment, we would find it a lot more acceptable to 
negotiate via them and via Mr. Churkin rather than anyone else. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, you said if this critical moment is 
possible to overcome at all. New threats are coming from the 
United States. How should they be interpreted? 
  [Koljevic] I can interpret them as yet another mistake, a 
big mistake of causing anger among the Serbian people. I have 
already said several times that the unity and anger of the 
Serbian people can only be caused by such unjustified threats. 
I hope that this will remain at the verbal level and that the 
mistakes made so far will not be fatal. After all, we will see 
whether the international community, above all the United 
States, cares more about establishing peace and separation, but 
above all peace, than about threatening the Serbs and menacing 
the Serbian people as a whole. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, can we expect meetings between the 
military commanders of the Serbian and Muslim forces to take 
place soon, at which they could reach an agreement that would 
prevent further incidents, new provocations, by above all the 
Muslim side. 
  [Koljevic] I do not believe that such meetings are possible 
at present. However, agreements or contacts will be possible 
indirectly, via the civil authorities. Direct ones are out of 
the question at present. 
  [Colovic] You are continuing your activities today. Can you 
tell us a little more about your intentions for the next few 
hours? 
  [Koljevic] There will be a number of consultations on, above 
all, our principled stand in this situation, then on our 
military situation. Muslim forces are launching fresh offensive 
attacks in different parts of the Serbian republic. Therefore, 
we will hold diplomatic and military consultations today, and 
tomorrow, we will decide on our conduct in the days ahead. 
  [Colovic] You are talking about the meeting of the supreme 
command of the Serbian republic. 
  [Koljevic] Yes. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, thank you very much. 
  [Koljevic] Thank you and thanks to the listeners.

  [Text] This morning, in an attempt to widen the corridor 
through Bosanska Posavina, the Serbs again launched a heavy 
artillery and infantry attack on the free territory of Brcko 
municipality. Over 400 tank, howitzer, and mortar shells have 
landed on the Croatian village of (Bodariste). All the lines 
jointly held by members of the Croat Defense Council [HVO] and 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army were also pounded. 
  Three infantry forays were attempted during these attacks, 
during which two HVO soldiers were killed and six wounded.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 14 April carries in its 
regular 45-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. 
  Describing the situation in Gorazde, Enes Musovic says that 
"the chetniks have been fiercely shelling all the residential 
areas this afternoon. It has been particularly bad in Vitkovici 
and the surrounding villages." He says that "the chetniks have 
been pounding the village of Kopaci with multiple rocket 
launchers. The latest information is that the chetnik heavy 
artillery and infantry attacks are still under way on (Borova) 
from the direction of Ustipraca. There is very fierce 
hand-to-hand fighting." 
  Enes Osmancevic reports from Tuzla that "this morning 
Karadzic's Serbs fired with tanks and artillery at Tuzla 
airport. A dozen destructive shells were fired at the airport 
from Jablanica on Mt. Majevica, which has been under the control 
of Karadzic's terrorists since the outbreak of the war." He 
says that "just after this artillery attack on Tuzla airport, 
NATO planes appeared and patrolled for a while over Tuzla and 
Mt. Majevica." 
  Reporting from Bihac, Mirza Sadikovic says that "the 
defenders have been heroically resisting attacks that have been 
coming in waves. In decisive counterattacks, the defenders 
today eliminated dozens of chetniks and destroyed one T-55 tank. 
As for Buzim, the attacks on this area have been increasingly 
coming from the territory of Croatia, that is, from the 
so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina, and the enemy 
mortar shells have also been sailing over the heads of members 
of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]." 
  Reporting on the situation in Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says 
that 
"the Serbian aggressor's troops have today carried out a whole 
series of tank and infantry attacks. There have been nine of 
them on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca-Boderiste direction alone, 
and at the moment of reporting chetnik infantry and tanks, 
supported by all sorts of artillery pieces, are attacking the 
central part of the Brcko defenses, and again Omerbegovaca, 
Vranovaca, and Boderiste. These attacks, which were launched 
late this afternoon, came after the aggressor received new 
amounts of MTS [expansion unknown] from Banja Luka." He says 
that "over 3,000 shells of various types have landed on the 
Brcko defense lines today, and the enemy commanders are also not 
sparing their manpower. Such losses by the aggressor have been 
unseen here since last summer. The fighters of the 108th 
Motorized and the 108th Infantry Brigade have brought the 
chetniks to their knees today. At 1615 the fighters of the 
108th Motorized Brigade destroyed a chetnik tank with its entire 
crew, then they destroyed the command post of an enemy unit, and 
then a chetnik stronghold on the central part of the Brcko 
front. There was a real slaughter of chetniks in the 
Omerbegovaca- Vranovaca-Boderiste direction. (Two) high-ranking 
enemy officers and a number of their retinue still lie dead in 
front of our positions. The chetnik ambulances have today 
covered as many kilometers as there are on the Paris-Dakar 
rally." 
  Ahmed Begicevic reports from Travnik that "the chetnik 
shelling started early this morning and throughout the day 
mortars of all calibers have been landing on the town. The 
chetniks also shelled the defense lines in Turbe."

  [Text] Doboj, April 14 (TANJUG)--Bosnian Moslem forces on 
Thursday twice shelled the Serb-controlled town of Doboj in 
north-eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. About twenty shells hit the 
town in this former Yugoslav republic but there have been no 
reports about possible casualties. 
  In the meantime, Moslem-controlled radio of the autonomous 
province of western Bosnia reported that eight soldiers of the 
Fifth Corps loyal to the Sarajevo authorities had been killed 
and 15 wounded during heavy inter-Moslem clashes in the Cazinska 
Krajina region in western Bosnia on Thursday morning. 
  The source also said that three soldiers of the autonomous 
province had been killed. 
  Fierce attacks, supported by artillery fire, launched 
against 
positions of units loyal to Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic 
continued in the area of Velika Kladusa and Cazin on Thursday 
afternoon, Moslem Radio-Sarajevo reported. Two people were 
killed and 25 wounded in the attacks according to the same 
source. 
  Autonomous province of western Bosnia forces are destroying 
everything in their way with multi-barrelled missile launchers 
Osa and Zolja, Radio Sarajevo said. The autonomous province was 
proclaimed last year by Moslems--followers of Fikret Abdic, who 
oppose Izetbegovic's war-mongering policy. 
  The command in Sarajevo admitted that about 500 troops had 
been killed and more than 2,000 wounded during the eight months 
of inter- Moslem clashes. The provincial army announces a 
counter-offensive to liberate Cazin, which is held by 
Izetbegovic's loyalist.

  [Excerpt] Sarajevo, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- Heavy fighting has 
been going on for two days on the several-dozen-km-long front 
line in the northern part of the Sarajevo battlefield. 
  According to Serb intelligence sources, Muslim forces have 
engaged about 15,000 soldiers of the 7th, 2d, and 3d Corps, as 
well as parts of the Sarajevo Corps, in their attacks from the 
direction of Kakanj and Vares, Mt. Zvijezda, and Olovo. 
  According to an assessment by Serb military sources, the 
objective of the comprehensive Muslim operation is to capture 
the Nisici plateau, to take control of the Nisici-Srednje and 
Olovo-Sarajevo roads, and to break through the lines in Ilijas 
and Vogosca, which would enable them to link their forces from 
central Bosnia with those from Sarajevo. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 15 April reports the 
following combat situation in the republic: 
  "The situation is so bad that it cannot get worse. This 
would, in short, be the description of the tragic events in 
Gorazde yesterday and this morning," correspondent Enes Musovic 
reports from this town. "The chetniks are charging on all 
defense lines around Gorazde increasingly more intensively and 
(?frantically). The UN Security Council resolution by which 
Gorazde was proclaimed a safe haven is truly tragicomic." 
Instead of pity and "moral support of the international 
community," as Musovic continues, "Gorazde needs immediate and 
concrete help now to stop the chetniks in their onslaught on 
Gorazde." He says that "the latest reports suggest that 21 
people have died while 62 civilians have been injured in Gorazde 
in the last 24 hours alone. Last night and this morning, the 
situation has been extremely difficult in (?Zabina), which is 
being pounded by the chetniks from Cajnice from all available 
arms." 
  Hamiz Deronjic, correspondent from "the Brcko free 
territory," reports that "fierce offensive of Karadzic's Serbs 
on the free Brcko territory continues. Ferocious tank-infantry 
attacks, supported by all types of artillery arms, at the 
positions of the 108th Motorized Brigade and 108th Infantry 
Brigade have lasted until late last night. The biggest battles 
were fought on Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca-[place-name indistinct] 
line." He reports that the fighters of the 108th Motorized 
Brigade at 1830 last night destroyed another aggressor's T-34 
tank with its crew in the region of Omerbegovaca." As he says, 
"parallel to the attacks on the first defense lines, the 
artillery of the Serbian aggressor has been shelling the 
civilian targets on the free Brcko territory. Despite the fact 
that he is suffering enormous losses in manpower and military 
hardware, the enemy is intensifying the offensive against the 
free territory." Deronjic also reports the arrival of fresh 
Serbian forces and military hardware and their concentration 
along the front lines. "Fierce attacks of the Chetnik infantry, 
tanks, and artillery in the area of (?Boderiste) have been 
underway since 0700," Deronjic says, "and at the moment of 
sending this dispatch the attacks of the chetnik forces are 
spreading to the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line." 
  As Mirza Sadikovic reports from Bihac, "through private 
radio 
Velkaton, the members of Abdic's war headquarters have announced 
another offensive against the free territory of the Bihac 
district, which they have been [words indistinct] carrying our 
together with the chetniks and [words indistinct] of the Serbian 
Autonomous Region of Krajina."

  [Text] On the occasion of the Day of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army, Army General Rasim Delic, supreme commander of the General 
Staff, has sent Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister a note of 
congratulations, which, among other things, says: 
  We are convinced that this year's marking of the Day of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army -- when we recall all the difficulties 
and casualties but also the results we have achieved -- will be 
a great motivation to all of us to continue the war of 
liberation in an even more organized and effective way, with 
dignity and courage to persist in the establishment of a just 
peace. 
  In that respect, we are aware of the moral obligation we 
have 
toward the casualties among the population, the killed fighters, 
our sehids [Muslim fighters killed in battle], our invalids, and 
[word indistinct]. 
  I would like to use this opportunity to express my 
satisfaction and gratitude to you -- your personal stature and 
results, particularly in the diplomatic sense -- for being a 
significant force in preserving and strengthening the moral and 
combat effectiveness of the units and commands of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. 
  This is said in the note of congratulations from Army 
General 
Rasim Delic to Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on the occasion of

  [Text] Belgrade, April 14 (TANJUG) -- Co-chairman of the 
conference on former Yugoslavia Lord Owen on Thursday assessed 
as very good the agreement on a general cease-fire in civil war 
torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was proposed by Bosnian Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic. 
  In a statement to reporters following talks with Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, Lord Owen explained 
that the agreement called for the deployment of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) between the warring sides. 
  It is very important for UNPROFOR to be there because that 
would reduce the risk of new armed confrontations, Lord Owen 
said. 
  Lord Owen said that progress had been achieved in the talks 
with Milosevic and that he now felt there was reason for greater 
optimism. 
  Lord Owen and the other co-chairman of the international 
conference on former Yugoslavia, Thorvald Stoltenberg, who was 
also present at the meeting with Milosevic, said that there were 
three phases in the present diplomatic activities for resolving 
the Bosnian crisis. 
  The first phase begins on Friday when the co-chairmen and 
special Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin will leave for Pale and 
Sarajevo, the seat of the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems. 
  The second phase will be the signing of the peace agreement. 
  The final phase will begin only after the general cease-fire 
agreement is reached. That phase will cover the precise drawing 
of maps, the determining of borders between the Serb republic 
and the Croat-Moslem federation and the lifting of the 
sanctions, Lord Owen said. 
  The U.N. Security Council imposed comprehensive and binding 
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in late May 
1992 because of its alleged involvement in the war of local 
Serbs, Croats and Moslems in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Churkin, who joined the talks between the co-chairmen and 
Milosevic, explained Moscow's stand on this issue, Lord Owen 
said. 
  Lord Owen said that if they [word indistinct] be partners in 
the peace process, then that partnership should not cover only 
the drawing of maps, but also the specification of the process 
of the gradual suspension of the sanctions. 
  Prior to today's joint meeting with the co-chairmen, Churkin 
met with Milosevic three times in the past 24 hours.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 15 (AFP) -- UN envoy Yasushi Akashi 
and mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg met with Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic Friday, the first such meetings since NATO air 
strikes on Serb forces around Gorazde, the Serbs reported. 
  The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said Russian special envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin, who has been mediating between the Serbs and 
the United Nations, was also at the meeting in the Serb 
headquarters at Pale outside Sarajevo. 
  The talks came a week after the Bosnian Serbs announced they 
were suspending contacts with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
in the wake of the NATO raids against Serbs beseiging the 
eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde Sunday and Monday. 
  Since then Bosnian Serb harassment of UN forces has 
increased 
dramatically, with a large number of UN personnel held against 
their will in the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
  Churkin has been in Pale, east of Sarajevo, for several 
days, 
trying to mediate with the Bosnian Serbs. Karadzic was also 
accompanied at the talks by his deputies, Nikola Koljevic and 
Biljana Plavsic, 
  SRNA said the meeting in Pale was aimed at relaunching the 
Bosnian peace process, seriously jeapordized by events since the 
Gorazde air strikes. 
  Radio Sarajevo Friday reported renewed fighting overnight in 
the besieged enclave of Gorazde. The casualty toll in Gorazde 
has risen to 12 dead, including three children, and 49 injured 
in the last 24 hours, the radio said.

<F P=106> [Report by Senada Cumurovic on a news conference by </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Bosnian 
Croat representative Kresimir Zubak in Sarajevo on 14 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Cumurovic] Today's top-level meeting, as Kresimir 
Zubak called it, by the authorized representatives and deputies 
of the Bosniak and Croatian people was held in a positive 
atmosphere, and the two delegations analyzed what had been done 
since the signing of the Washington Agreement. 
  [Zubak] At the same time we discussed the measures and 
activities that need to be undertaken to implement the 
Washington agreement, that is, the constitution adopted by the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. 
  [Cumurovic] Kresimir Zubak also said that some very 
significant issues were raised today, for example, how to 
reorganize the government so that it can function as the 
government of Bosnia- Herzegovina and the government of the 
federation, the question of the leading functions in the 
federation and how to organize the next session of the 
Constituent Assembly. 
  [Zubak] We agreed today to hold the next session of the 
Constituent Assembly sometime between the 28th and 30th of this 
month. We expect that by that time we will have agreed on the 
issues that we discussed today. Today we agreed on the basic 
principles in connection with the determination and nomination 
of candidates for president and vice president of the republic, 
and the prime minister and deputy prime minister. As Mr. 
Silajdzic said, in about seven days we will hold another session 
at the same level, when, I am certain, we will reach complete 
agreement. Then we will nominate the candidates, and the 
assembly session will be scheduled for the period of 28-30 
April. I believe that the assembly [words indistinct] and we 
will confirm [words indistinct]. 
  [Cumurovic] Dr. Haris Silajdzic explained the results of 
today's talks with the following words: 
  [Silajdzic] Our listeners and viewers will probably be 
interested in what we agreed on for the interim period in order 
to find an urgent solution to the problems of everyday life. We 
(?agreed on the opening) of the entire energy system of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the repair of all the transmission 
systems; therefore, on [words indistinct] Rama, turning on the 
hydroelectric power station (?Globovica), on the delivery of all 
the necessary materials for the full functioning of the thermal 
power stations Kakanj and Tuzla. We discussed the problem of 
the return of refugees, and we agreed, of course, on how to 
enable people to return to their last abode of residence. That 
is of course the view held before, only now it has been 
confirmed. 
  We are talking here about issues that have been covered 
before at the meetings of the commissions, and at today's 
meeting all this was confirmed. Priority should be given to the 
reconstruction of destroyed railroad bridges -- we believe that 
is the priority on the Neretva River -- and the repair of the 
railroad line from Stolac toward the west. The construction of 
a bridge across the Sava River between Orasje and Zupanja has to 
be taken most seriously. The telephone lines from the south to 
Sarajevo have to be established, and thus the shattered 
communications system reestablished. Telephone lines have to be 
reintroduced to the left bank of Mostar, and the entire left 
bank of Mostar has to be supplied with water, including the 
reintroduction of the Studenac spring into the system. At least 
two megawatts of electricity have to be allowed into that part 
of the city. There is the question of coordinating the entire 
humanitarian system, and placing that system in the hands [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Cumurovic] The talks between the two delegations led by Dr. 
Haris Silajdzic and Kresimir Zubak were attended by Victor 
Jakovich, U.S. ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Zdravko 
Pancevic, Croatian ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  After making his statement on the results of today's 
meeting, 
Dr. Silajdzic answered several questions asked by foreign 
reporters about the fierce chetnik attacks on civilians and 
members of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR]. 
  Addressing that issue, he said that he was astonished at the 
enormity of the evil happening in Bosnia-Herzegovina, without 
getting any real reaction from the international community. He 
stressed that the people who destroyed Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
people who murdered 200,000 citizens, people who were attacking 
safe havens and UNPROFOR are still referred to as a side in the 
conflict. He wondered what else they would have to do to 
trigger any real action. And we would like to cite the following 
part of Silajdzic's statement: 
  I would like to send a message to those Serbs on the 
occupied 
territories who might be deceived into joining Karadzic. They 
can now see the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims living and 
working together in a normal democratic state. If they want to 
join us, they are welcome.

  [Text] High-ranking Croat and Muslim political 
representatives agreed yesterday in Sarajevo on the release of 
prisoners and on a number of political issues related to the 
functioning of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, the 
Herzeg-Bosna delegation said on their return from Sarajevo. 
Zdenko Vranjes reports from Mostar: 
  [Vranjes] The negotiations in Sarajevo were held in a good 
atmosphere. It was agreed who can represent the Croat and 
Muslim people at the federation level until new elections are 
held. It was also agreed that legal preparations should 
commence to form a government of the federation. It has still 
not been agreed whether the person holding the post of president 
of the federation until the elections should be a Croat or a 
Bosniak, nor what nationality the deputy president and the prime 
minister should be. This decision is to be made by the 
constituent assembly, which is expected to hold a session at the 
end of this month. 
  Before that high-ranking representatives of the two peoples 
will meet again and discuss the remaining issues.

prisons under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
Croat Defense Council has been signed. 
  Those charged with or sentenced for the most serious 
criminal 
offenses will not be released if the signatories show the Red 
Cross by Sunday that charges have been pressed or sentences 
passed. An international committee of experts is to be founded 
to interview those accused of the most serious criminal acts 
within 30 days and examine all evidence relevant to the criminal 
procedures. After that the committee will make decisions on the 
further detention of the accused. The agreement says that the 
Red Cross will determine the dynamics and mode of implementation 
of the prisoner release.

<F P=106> [By Borislav Lalic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 15 (TANJUG) -- A U.S. journalist 
recently advised President Bill Clinton that, if he is uncertain 
about the effects on the United States of the bombing of 
Gorazde, he should meet with the Vietnam veterans or, better 
still, with the American soldiers who recently returned from 
Somalia after the failure of operation Provide Hope. 
  It is highly unlikely that Clinton will take this advise 
although the developments in the war-ravaged ex-Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have reached a critical point. 
  Everything happening there in the past few weeks is linked 
to 
the United States. In Bosnia an "American peace" is being 
negotiated, U.S. bombs are being dropped and the American war 
diplomacy has claimed its first victims. 
  In Bosnia Washington has become lost in the maze of its own 
Balkan policy which it is trying to implement in keeping with 
the principles of its own new international order. 
  Over the past couple of years the Americans changed their 
stands on the Yugoslav crisis so many times that now it is hard 
to say exactly what they want in Bosnia and how they envisage 
the "new Balkans." 
  Clinton's operation for imposing a peace in Bosnia which is 
being separately carried out with the Moslems and Croats, faces 
a total defeat. The Gorazde bombs have not only failed to 
return the Serbs to the negotiating table, but have rendered 
this almost impossible. 
  Everyone is now asking only one question: What will be 
Washington's next move. The answer will depend on whether and 
to what extent Clinton is aware that the U.S. involvement in the 
Bosnian war could well cause its escalation from the Balkans. 
The U.S. President could also apply the already present views 
in Washington that the several bombs dropped on Gorazde were 
insufficient and that new air strikes are required. 
  The Europeans hope that the U.S. leaders will finally become 
aware that they have been licked in Bosnia and that the 
situation there is so serious and complex that it cannot be 
resolved by a few bombs, even on condition that they hit the 
designated targets and are not duds. 
  A positive sign that such a more realistic policy could 
prevail is the sudden appearence in Bosnia of the co-chairmen of 
the international conference on ex-Yugoslavia, Lord David Owen 
and Thorwald Stoltenberg. 
  This could mean that Washington has come to the conclusion 
that it will have to ask its European allies to help it pull the 
chesnuts out of the Bosnian fire. 
  The Europeans have much experience in this because they have 
also been too hasty and were defeated in Bosnia. In 1993 they 
finally concluded that there is only one solution: to divide the 
three warring sides in Bosnia in the same way as the 
disintegration of their former country -- Yugoslavia.

  [Text] (?Astounded) by the increasingly ruthless chetnik 
advances on the protected zone and despite serious warnings by 
NATO, foreign analysts concluded almost without exception that 
the aggressor army around Gorazde was doing everything possible 
to provoke air strikes. They explained this with the 
stubbornness of the Pale leadership, ignoring the fact that they 
are only pawns in a big game. This time, too, all strings were 
in the hands of Belgrade. 
  Milosevic's regime has placed Serbia in the most difficult 
situation in its long history. The process of turning a country 
fascist is drawing to an end. The last foreign witnesses, 
objective correspondents from CNN and AFP, are being removed. 
Others are also being checked out, if they are there at all. 
  The regime has given up its efforts to improve its image in 
the eyes of the world public. Who could possibly get involved 
in that when everything else is going downhill. Objective 
reporting by foreign media has been declared, we quote, a media 
war against the Serbian people, end quote. Not against the 
regime, as it is, but against the people -- something foreign 
correspondents never insisted on. Serbia has simply found 
herself in the same situation that Germany was during the Nazi 
era, Russia during Stalinism, Albania during the time of Enver 
Hoxha, and Chile during the time of Pinochet, with, of course, 
much worse internal problems. 
  The project of a greater Serbia, the greatest inspiration 
for 
Serbian fascism, has definitely failed, mainly because of a 
number of military defeats in Bosnia. There are even more 
troubles in their own home. A new wave of hyperinflation is on 
its way. This wave will finally destroy the last strongholds of 
the Serbian economy. The embezzlement of foreign currency from 
its own citizens is also drawing to an end. It is no longer 
possible to explain to the people who sold their foreign 
currency to the banks that these were automatically bought by 
some new rich men for the freshly printed super dinars, which 
will soon be completely worthless. 
  To stay in power and divert the people's attention from the 
insoluble problems, Milosevic had to invent new enemies, much 
bigger and more dangerous than the previous ones. And who is 
more suitable at present than the biggest world power, the 
United States? Belgrade propaganda therefore produced a new 
puppet show in the public in the sense of (?evil) Americans, 
persuaded by evil Muslims, treacherously attacked the innocent 
Serbian people. Of course, they consciously concealed the fact 
that the action by the United Nations enjoyed the general 
support of the world and that the Russians complained only 
because they were not consulted. Vitaliy Churkin was angry 
because Karadzic's Serbs deceived him and denied their attacks 
on Gorazde. Moreover, they never mentioned the reasons for the 
attacks by the allied aircraft. They did not dare say that 
because of the committed chetnik crimes the world could allow 
hordes of bloodsuckers enter this suffering town and repeat what 
they had already done in Zvornik, Visegrad, and Foca.

<F P=106> ["asa"-signed report: "Coupon Book Should Cost No More Than </F>
1,000 Korunas"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- A group of experts appointed by the 
state secretary at the Ministry for the Administration and 
Privatization of National Property [MSPNM] is working on a 
document on the preparation of coupon privatization, which it 
will submit to the government, probably on 19 April. The 
document will contain the timetable of coupon privatization and 
of concomitant steps. This was stated by Privatization Minister 
Milan Janicina at a news conference yesterday. 
  According to the minister, all efforts are aimed at having 
the registration for coupon privatization start by the end of 
August. G. Porvaznik, head of an MSPNM department, said that 
large enterprises, in particular, are to be included in coupon 
privatization, with the majority stake in these companies to be 
privatized by this method. Altogether, the MSPNM is preparing 
some 200 businesses with shares worth about 80 billion Slovak 
korunas [Sk] for privatization by the coupon method. Added to 
them will be some Sk20 billion worth of shares in companies that 
have been founded by the National Property Fund. The problem of 
privatizing -- including in coupon privatization -- some 
companies, in which the strategic participation by the state is 
foreseen, has not yet been resolved. This concerns, in 
particular, power and gas generating and distribution companies, 
arms factories, and chemical plants. An agreement with the 
founder will determine to which extent these companies will be 
privatized. Similarly, the inclusion of Slovak spas and of 
Benzinol [chain of gas stations] in coupon privatization will 
also depend on an agreement with the founding ministries. As 
for the price of the coupon book, it should not cost more than 
Sk1,000, according to Milan Janicina, and a lower price is even 
being considered. 
  Milan Janicina agrees that although coupon privatization is 
the socially most equitable privatization method, it does not 
bring any capital. He added, however, that, besides coupon 
privatization, the use of standard privatization methods will 
continue; these can secure the inflow of capital. The 
minister's adviser Igor Uhrik said in this context that the 
greatest advantage of coupon privatization is that it eliminates 
the blocking of credit resources. Besides, coupon privatization 
helps establish the capital market, he added. 
  Minister Milan Janicina provided information on activities 
by 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak 
National Party [SNS] deputies to the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic and other state administration officials in 
lobbying for specific privatization projects. According to his 
words, this activity was "reminiscent of methods used under real 
socialism when you needed the support of some party 
organization, at the local or district level, for some project 
to come through." He said that it was interesting that, in all 
cases, the deputies were lobbying for the project that turned 
out to be the "victorious" one. Asked about the further course 
of action in reexamining projects approved by Vladimir Meciar's 
government, Minister Janicina said that the situation is 
complicated by the fact that people are afraid of speaking or 
testifying in individual cases. He said that, in the case of 
the privatization of the Piestany spa, he had the opportunity to 
see an agreement on the quiet partnership of two government 
representatives and one deputy. The minister supposedly avails 
himself of indications that, in three privatization cases, the 
HZDS election campaign was to be financed from the approved 
projects. Evidence for this assertion is lacking, however.

  [Text] A meeting has taken place in Szeged, Hungary, 
between Mr. Oliviu Gherman, president of the Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR], and Mr. Gyula Horn, president of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. The meeting was also attended 
for Romania by Mr. Dan Martian, parliamentary deputy and PDSR 
vice president, Grigore Zanc, prefect of Cluj County, and 
Dumitru Paslaru, deputy. Here is a dispatch from Budapest by our 
correspondent Dorin Suciu. 
  [Begin Suciu recording] The meeting that the two party 
presidents held this morning was an opportunity for a first 
contact between them. The sides examined aspects of 
Hungarian-Romanian relations and the PDSR-MSZP relations. In 
the afternoon, the talks focused on the integration of the two 
countries into the European Union and NATO. 
  During a news conference after the talks, MSZP President 
Gyula Horn said: There is a need for a historic reconciliation 
between Hungary and its neighbors. In concrete terms, this 
means that we should push aside the so-called prejudices or 
historical injustices, or at least remove them from the sphere 
of politics. Otherwise, they will continue to be a source of 
tension. Let us leave it up to the scientists and historians to 
elucidate the white or dark spots in our common history. 
  In the MSZP's opinion, it is possible to reach a common 
denominator on the issue of the basic treaty between the two 
countries, Gyula Horn said. An essential aspect of this treaty 
is Point No. 4, that is recognition of the integrity of borders 
and, closely related to that aspect, the full ensurance of the 
rights of the minorities living on the territory of the two 
countries. One would like to see a law on minorities being 
passed in Romania and Hungarian-language education based on 
legal grounds. The MSZP president expressed serious 
reservations on these two issues. According to Horn, the 
Hungarian minorities both in Romania and Slovakia should enjoy 
internal self-determination. I do not want to be misunderstood, 
the MSZP president emphasized. I am referring to an 
administrative autonomy in the regions inhabited by compact 
masses of Hungarians. We have reservations about the way in 
which the new Romanian Constitution safeguards the rights of the 
minorities. Of course, this is an internal matter, but we would 
positively receive a possible modification along these lines, 
Mr. Horn added. 
  The socialist leader also emphasized the need to enhance 
economic and trade relations and advocated closer links and more 
contacts between the parliamentary deputies and politicians of 
the two countries. I found in the PDSR a constructive partner 
and I am convinced that future talks at expert level and a 
subsequent meeting at a higher level would lead to a mutual 
understanding, Mr Gyula Horn said in conclusion. 
  As far as PDSR President Mr. Oliviu Gherman is concerned, he 
said that the following: From the list of problems raised by 
President Gyula Horn, one might come to the erroneous conclusion 
that there is a huge number of unsolved problems between the two 
countries and that we are only at the beginning of the road. 
Then, Mr. Oliviu Gherman continued: 
  [Gherman] In reality, many problems have been resolved and I 
express the conviction that, with the signing of the fundamental 
treaty of cooperation between the two countries, we will create 
conditions for solving the key problems remaining between our 
two states. I would like to point out that the party I am 
representing sets out from the premise that real relations of 
friendship and cooperation should be established between the two 
countries. Unfortunately, the absence of a fundamental treaty of 
friendship and cooperation between the two countries has 
generated a sentiment of suspicion, at least in Romania. 
  The resolution of the problem of the minorities in Romania 
is 
fully covered by the constitutional stipulation which confirms 
the prevalence of the provisions of the international laws on 
human rights endorsed by the organizations to which Romania 
belongs over the internal laws. This means -- if not 
explicitly, at least implicitly -- that we are fully aligning 
ourselves to international standards in the matter. 
  I would like to stress that the MSZP statement gave us the 
feeling that we must start these initiatives to accelerate the 
normalization of the relations between the two countries and 
even raise them to a higher level. We express the hope that -- 
after the commissions of experts Mr. President Horn referred to 
are going to start putting together a list of problems and 
various ways and means for their resolution -- we will reach a 
situation wherein the two parties will develop relations of 
preferential cooperation links. 
  [Suciu] At the end of the news conference, MSZP President 
Gyula Horn was asked the following question by a journalist: If 
you become head of government, will you also say, as your 
predecessors Joszef Antall and Peter Boross, that you consider 
yourself spiritually the prime minister of 15 million 
Hungarians? The socialist leader gave the following answer: I 
would not like to make forecasts in connection with the post of 
premier. However, if this were to happen, I would refrain from 
such statements, which are bound to irritate our neighbors. In 
my opinion, the future government should establish the best 
possible relations with our neighbors. On the other hand, it 
should do everything that it can to ensure the rights of the 
Hungarian minorities living beyond the borders. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] A leading parliamentary representative 
of Egyutteles [Coexistence], the main political organization of 
Slovakia's Hungarian minority--which numbers 600,000 in a 
population of 5 million--said in a recent interview that he 
believes the minority's political position is now considerably 
stronger than it was under the recently ousted government of 
Vladimir Meciar, despite the absence of Hungarians in Slovakia's 
new government. 
  In an interview published on 18 March in the 
Hungarian-language Bratislava daily UJ SZO, Istvan Harna, who 
represented Egyutteles at the negotiations on the formation of 
the cabinet, told an unidentified interviewer that the new 
government will be forced to take into account the views of the 
Hungarians because the Hungarians "now hold the balance in 
parliament." Without their vote, Harna said, the parliament 
"cannot pass any laws," and if the coalition parties fail to 
"keep their promises" to the Hungarian minority, its 
representatives can "hold back" their votes "at any time." As 
he sees it, the Hungarians are in a more advantageous position 
than if they were in the government, because "if we had even one 
minister, we would share governmental responsibility, and we 
would have to support the cabinet even if it did not satisfy our 
demands." 
  At the same time, Harna expressed disappointment that the 
anti-Meciar coalition had not been more willing to accommodate 
the Hungarians. He dismissed as a political ploy the fact that 
at one point during the negotiations the anti-Meciar groups had 
offered him the post of finance minister, saying they had done 
so "only because they were forced to" when all the other parties 
refused "to accept the responsibility" for the ministry that is 
the "most trouble." No serious attempt was made to include the 
Hungarians in the government, Harna said, because the 
anti-Meciar Slovaks contended that "Meciar would, with his 
demagogic populist statements, use the Hungarians' participation 
to incite public opinion against the new government." While 
saying that there was "some truth" in such contentions, Harna 
declared that it still was "not principled" to leave the 
Hungarians out of the government, because if their vote is 
needed, then "the rules of democracy" dictate that they should 
be included. 
  Nevertheless, Harna indicated that the Hungarians will be 
able to take advantage of the new political situation to get 
some significant concessions. Taking into account the "public 
mood and Slovakia's interests," he said, they agreed to support 
the government even if they could not join it, but in return 
they made eight demands. Evidently referring to Hungarian 
demands for more local government power--which Slovaks have 
criticized as an attempt to loosen Slovakia's hold on 
Hungarian-inhabited areas--Harna said that at first the 
anti-Meciar coalition called the demands "irredentist," but 
later the coalition "realized that they are not, and accepted 
them." Moreover, the Hungarians will apparently be given an 
increased role in education, which they consider a key area. 
According to Harna, the new government will establish a 
"separate Hungarian division" in the Education Ministry, and its 
leading officials will be chosen on the basis of the Hungarians' 
recommendations. While the Hungarians will not get any state 
secretary positions, Harna said, the government has agreed to 
"take into account" the Hungarians' opinion when appointing 
"leading officials" in any ministry that has a particular impact 
on the Hungarian minority.

<F P=106> [Article by Szilvia Zimber: "Unfounded Scare Tactics"] </F>
  [Text] "As the minister vested with powers to authorize the 
use of secret service devices and as a member of the cabinet, I 
categorically label as unfounded any statements that generate an 
atmosphere of fear or hint that certain political parties or 
their headquarters are under surveillance and their telephones 
are being tapped," declared Justice Minister Istvan Balsai 
yesterday in Dombovar at a news conference that preceded a local 
political rally. 
  Yesterday afternoon the justice minister dedicated the 
renovated building of the Dombovar Municipal Court, which has 
been functioning for 80 years. Istvan Balsai rated as 
spectacular the achievements of the government's four years in 
office, the judiciary's elevation to a position worthy of a 
rule-of-law state, the increase in judges' salaries, and the 
improvement of their working conditions. "I am confident that we 
will be able to continue this trend in the future. After all, 
there is much left to be done in the coming period as well," the 
minister said. Incidentally, the development of the security 
system absorbed nearly half of the Dombovar Municipal Court 
building's renovation cost. 
  In the evening Istvan Balsai, member of the MDF [Hungarian 
Democratic Forum] executive committee, and attorney Dr. Marianna 
Monostori, MDF candidate for Parliament in Tolna County's fourth 
electoral district, attended a local political rally. 
  According to Istvan Balsai, the statements made by prominent 
politicians of more than one political party following the start 
of the election campaign were without foundation. They claimed 
that the handing in of nomination forms and the elections 
themselves were shrouded in an atmosphere of fear. He 
categorically denied the accusations made by the president of 
the Hungarian Socialist Party that the vicinity of his party's 
headquarters was under surveillance and the party's telephones 
were being tapped. The purpose of this completely unfounded 
accusation might be to confuse the citizens and to question the 
country's democratic functioning. Istvan Balsai rejected also 
the political statements that questioned freedom of the press, 
citing the situation of Hungarian Radio's public employees.

    [Editorial Report] Tensions between Hungary's two main 
liberal parliamentary parties, the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ) and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz), have 
greatly reduced the liberals' chances in the 8 May elections, 
according to two articles in the 31 March issue of the Budapest 
weekly BESZELO. The journal, although edited by Ferenc Koszeg 
and other prominent SZDSZ politicians, treated the two parties 
even-handedly and urged both of them to resolve their 
differences before it is too late. In the first article, 
political commentator Peter Kende said that the conflict between 
the two parties discourages voters from seeing the liberals as a 
viable alternative either to the present right-of-center 
government--led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)--or to 
the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), whose popularity has been 
growing "like an avalanche." Although "in principle" Hungarian 
popular opinion favors the "liberal center," liberal infighting 
has created a political climate in which most voters think that 
their only real choice is between the left and the right, Kende 
said. 
  The SZDSZ and Fidesz are going into the campaign with an 
agreement not to attack each other, but in Kende's view this is 
"not enough to give their campaign momentum." Voters have 
gotten the impression that "the two main forces in the liberal 
camp are in a cold-blooded competition with each other and are 
in fact pulling in two different directions." Kende indicated 
that this perception is essentially valid. Because it considers 
the right "the greatest evil," the SZDSZ formed a "united front" 
with significant "intellectual" elements of the leftist MSZP 
when it became alarmed by the emergence of an extreme right 
faction from the ranks of the government parties in 1992; 
Fidesz, in contrast, "true to its pragmatic profile," did not 
want to "overdramatize the right-wing danger" and considered it 
a "mistake" to put too much stock in the purported democratic 
transformation of the MSZP, the successor of the previously 
ruling communist party. In fact, in Fidesz's view, Kende said, 
by agreeing to a rapprochement with the MSZP, the SZDSZ fell 
into a "trap" set by right-wing extremist Istvan Csurka. 
  In any case, according to Kende, the break between the two 
liberal parties has put both their futures in jeopardy. "The 
two most probable outcomes of the May elections could both be 
fatal to the liberals. If the left wins, the SZDSZ will be 
forced to play second fiddle in a government dominated by the 
MSZP, while if the right wins, Fidesz will have to play second 
fiddle in a government dominated by the MDF--unless they choose 
the thankless task of forcing new elections by completely 
refusing to participate" in the government. 
  The two liberal parties "can only reverse" these downward 
developments if they "radically" change their approach in the 
weeks remaining before the elections, Kende said. They must do 
three things, he argued: first, produce a "joint program" for 
the voters; second, stress in their campaign, even when their 
nominees are campaigning against each other, that any candidate 
within the "liberal bloc" is "preferable" to any candidate of 
the right or left; and third, announce that "neither of them is 
willing to take part without the other in any kind of government 
coalition" after the election. This would make clear to the 
voters, Kende said, that the liberals are not willing to join a 
government in a subordinate position. "The voter then could 
decide, on the basis of this knowledge, whom he should vote for." 
  The author of the second BESZELO article, Attila Weber, 
agreed with Kende that the liberals are in a weak position 
because of interparty tensions, which he suggested were 
partially the responsibility of both sides. Like Kende, he 
wrote that the central problem is disagreement over Fidesz's 
conviction that the left is a greater threat than the far right. 
"Even if the party did not move to the right, in any case it 
became more open toward the right-leaning or national Christian 
parties," which Fidesz--unlike the SZDSZ--considered to be 
essentially different from the extreme right. A scandal 
involving the MDF and Fidesz, both of which were accused of 
irregularities in selling a building assigned to them as part of 
a postelection agreement on the allocation of party property, 
also helped "sweep Fidesz into the Democratic Forum camp," along 
with Fidesz's decision to emphasize its "commitment to national 
values"--as opposed to the internationalist orientation of the 
SZDSZ. It was a "significant consequence" of these 
developments, Weber said, that Fidesz's relations with Budapest 
intellectuals, especially those "who dominate the [print] media, 
turned ugly." Hinting that the print media were instrumental in 
clouding the image of Fidesz--which has "steadily lost 
popularity" since November 1992--Weber wrote that the popular 
perception of Fidesz was "embellished with new lines" during 
published "polemics with the intellectuals." 
  Weber held out even less hope than Kende that these tensions 
can be resolved in time to have a positive effect on the 
election chances of the SZDSZ and Fidesz. In recent months "the 
conflict between the liberal parties has increased" so much that 
during the election campaign "there can be only limited 
cooperation" between them. Consequently, he said, the liberals' 
ability to attract votes has drastically decreased, creating a 
situation that can "easily lead to the polarization of the 
political system" between the left and right, with no 
significant liberal camp to bridge the gap dividing them.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--The government of the 
Republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] has described the Croatian side's 
proposal regarding future talks on economic relations and 
traffic links as "hardly acceptable at this point". 
  According to ISKRA [Krajina Serb news agency], the 
government 
has prepared its platform--which will be presented to the 
assembly committees--based on the modified Article 20 of UN 
Security Council Resolution 820, which envisages export and 
import of goods from and into the RSK under the control of 
UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] civilian services. 
  The possibility of providing water supplies for Zadar is 
envisaged as a gesture of good will, in exchange for parts for 
the hydroelectric dam in Obrovac. After that, other 
problems--particularly traffic problems--would be addressed. 
  With regard to the assembly's decision that the 
government--which is currently being reappointed--should not 
hold talks with the Croatian side, the government has decided to 
accept this decision, noting that, if necessary, it will send a 
delegation only with a written order from the president of the 
RSK and the president of the assembly.

Chamber of Counties, has refused to convene a session of the 
Chamber in eight days' time, Chamber of Counties Secretary Anton 
Rajcevac told journalists today. 
  At the proposal of some Croatian Democratic Union deputies 
to 
convene a session, Manolic, referring to the standing orders, 
said he did not consider that the reasons to convene a session 
of the Chamber of Counties in eight days' time were justified 
and that he would convene it when he found it necessary for this 
assembly chamber to perform its constitutional obligations.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--Ambassador Branko 
Brankovic summoned Italian Charge d'Affaires Laura Mirachian to 
the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and lodged the 
Yugoslav Government's note of sharp protest over the use of 
Italian airports for NATO military actions against the Serb 
people in the Srpska republic. 
  According to the ministry's statement, Ambassador Brankovic 
stressed that Italy had thereby taken on itself responsibility 
for the risk of escalation of the war with unforeseeable 
consequences. NATO military operations on the very border of the 
FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] are a provocation against 
the FRY, a threat against its security, and pose a serious 
threat to peace and stability in the region. Taking part in a 
NATO military action, even under UN auspices, is contrary to the 
CSCE principles on the peaceful resolution of disputes, the 
observance of which--as the CSCE chair country--Italy should 
particularly advocate. 
  Such actions by Italy are contrary to the efforts to achieve 
a just and lasting solution to the civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and contradict principles of 
good-neighborliness and traditional cooperation between friendly 
countries and peoples. 
  The FRY Government--interested in preservation of peace and 
security in the region, in the fate of the Serbs, and in finding 
a peaceful and just solution for the civil war in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina--expects the Italian Government to prevent 
any further use of its territory for armed actions against the 
Serbs in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] New York, April 14 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Ambassador 
to the U.N. Dragomir Djokic on Thursday warned U.N. Security 
Council President Colin Keating that a tolerant stand of the 
U.N. towards Bosnian Moslems leads to an esclation of the civil 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that the world organization should 
be directly engaged in finding a peaceful solution to that the 
crisis in that former Yugoslav republic. 
  It is important to do everything possible for the Moslems to 
stop attacking and that the peace process is restored, Djokic 
said. 
  Djokic was received by Keating at his own request, since he 
wanted to inform the Security Council president about 
Yugoslavia's stands regarding the latest developments in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Djokic said that the Security Council should not have 
reacted 
so mildly to the Moslem attacks around Gorazde and elsewhere in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and protested because it was tolerated that 
Moslem use U.N. Protected Areas to launch attacks on Serb 
positions, which was confirmed also by senior U.N. officials, 
including U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali himself. 
  The Security Council, in the interest of its credibility, 
should take a strong stand towards all sides, and not constantly 
accuse one side and condone actions by another, Djokic said. 
  Keating said that the Security Council was aware of the 
behavior but that the Serb response to the Moslem of the Moslem 
side hvvut that the Serb [words indistinct]. Provocations have 
been too strong [passage indistinct] Djokic said. 
  The Security Council authorized the bombing of Bosnian Serb 
positions around Gorazde by NATO planes on Sunday and Monday, 
although Keating himself said earlier that the fighting around 
that Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina had been 
provoked by the Moslems. 
  Gorazde, one of six U.N. Protected Areas in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, should have been demilitarized last spring, 
but the latest Moslem offensive was launched from this town.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic on Tuesday said that U.N.-sponsored air 
strikes against Bosnian Serbs and the biased view of the Bosnian 
civil war must stop. Otherwise, the international community 
would be directly responsible for an escalation of the conflict 
with unforeseeable consequences for the entire region. 
  U.S. NATO aircraft on April 10 and 11 raided Bosnian Serb 
army positions around Gorazde, a U.N.-protected "safe haven" 
which should have been demilitarized last spring. 
  In late March, about 10,000 Moslem troops from Gorazde 
mounted an offensive on Bosnian Serb positions surrounding the 
area. The NATO aircraft intervened when the Serbs crushed the 
offensive and launched a counter-attack. 
  Simic told TANJUG that the Yugoslav Government had most 
categorically condemned the U.N. decision to engage NATO 
aircraft as a direct and open engagemement in the civil war in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems. 
  The Yugoslav Government remains consistent in its long-term 
foreign-policy orientation that all hostilities must 
unconditionally cease in Bosnia-Herzegovina before overall 
solutions are found, Simic said. 
  He went on to say that solutions which should not 
dramatically clash with the real situation and the democratic 
principles by which the international community should be guided 
can be sought only on the basis of lasting peace and easing of 
the malignant tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Unfortunately, these principles have long been abandoned and 
grossly abused in the Yugoslav crisis and replaced by an open 
imperialistic policy on the international political scene which 
the U.N. obeys and duly implements although by its very nature 
it should oppose it, Simic said. 
  The U.N. decision to bomb Serb territories, which was also 
highly controversial as far as the required procedure was 
concerned, shows that the contemporary world has gone too far in 
belittling the values without which peace cannot be even 
imagined, he said. 
  The key international factors should sober up and abandon 
their arbitrary, aggressive and reckless actions, and pursue 
instead a realistic policy of negotiations on an equal footing 
as the only way to the ultimate goal -- peace and a lasting, 
just settlement acceptable to all in Bosnia, he said. 
  In this, the international community can always rely on 
Yugoslavia's peaceful policy of active mediation, said Simic. 
  Paradoxically, the future of the peace process in former 
Yugoslavia depends on whether political developments are really 
heading in the direction of peace. If the international 
community is really interested in peace, then the means to 
attain this goal should be corresponding, he explained. 
  Force which only prolongs the war and continues the 
bloodshed 
cannot be justified by aspirations for peace, said Simic. 
  It is utterly cynical when some diplomats say they hope the 
Serbs would join the peace process in the future, because the 
Serb side has always supported negotiations as the only way out 
of the crisis, he said. 
  The Serb side had accepted the latest Bosnia peace plan of 
the European Union which, following the Moslem rejection of it, 
simply forgot it had made any proposal at all, discrediting 
itself as an international factor which could have helped find a 
favourable solution to the crisis and the civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said. 
  Yugoslavia remains consistent in its position that the peace 
process should be based on negotiations in which all sides would 
participate on an equal footing, said Simic.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--In connection with the 
NATO air strikes against Serb targets around Gorazde, Colonel 
General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the general staff of the 
Yugoslav Army, has stated that "such NATO air force action can 
undeniably have unforeseeable consequences for peace in the 
Balkans and Europe." 
  In an interview to be published in the POLITIKA daily 
tomorrow, Gen. Perisic said that "in the case of further air 
strikes against Serb territories, there is a danger of an 
escalation of the war to an uncontrollable degree." 
  He said that "the NATO air strikes against Serb territories 
around Gorazde complicated the military and political situation 
in former Bosnia-Herzegovina", and that this action "encouraged 
the supporters of the war option and worried those who carry 
peace in their hearts." 
  "I particularly wish to stress that this is an act of 
aggression against the Serb people, who have a legitimate and 
natural right to self-defense guaranteed by the UN Charter." 
  The Yugoslav Army chief of staff stressed that "the Yugoslav 
Army has continuously and attentively been following 
developments after the NATO air strikes", and that it has been 
taking "all necessary measures for the protection of the 
territorial integrity of our country." 
  "In the case of a possible violation of the air space of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the army will take actions in 
accordance with the rules of its combat operations," Gen. 
Perisic said.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- A group of 17 
opposition deputies to the Federal Assembly's Chamber of 
Citizens today called on Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic to 
dismiss Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic in connection 
with the withdrawal of accreditation from AFP and CNN. 
  The signatories of this initiative are from the Serbian 
Renewal Movement, the Democratic Party [of Serbia], the Social 
Democratic Party of Montenegro, and the People's Party of 
Montenegro. They maintain that the ban on AFP and CNN causes 
inestimable damage to the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] 
and its citizens, and ask that this decision be revoked. 
  Explaining their proposal, the deputies say that the FRY is 
in this way coming into direct confrontation with the most 
powerful information media and indirectly with the United States 
and France.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- President of Serbia 
Slobodan Milosevic today received president of the Srpska 
republic Radovan Karadzic. They discussed the latest situation 
in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the attempts by 
international mediators and envoys to normalize the situation. 
  After the meeting, Karadzic said, in a brief statement to 
correspondents, that the international community is now most 
concerned by our break of relations with the United Nations. "We 
will see whether our supreme command will make any changes to 
that decision tomorrow," Karadzic added. 
  The Srpska republic president confirmed that tomorrow he 
will 
meet with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy, and that he will inform him about the supreme command's 
position, which determines whether there will be any contacts 
with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] civilian section. 
  Karadzic also commented on the latest situation on the 
Bosnian front. According to him, the first day of good weather, 
which had enabled U.S. NATO planes to fly "was used by the 
Muslim forces to try to chase us away from the right bank of the 
Drina River. They launched a new offensive from the left bank, 
accross the bridges, against our forces. They probably expected 
support from U.S. planes," he added. As far as Doboj is 
concerned it was permanently shelled, and there are losses among 
civilians, Karadzic commented. 
  The Muslim offensive is now under way practically on all 
fronts -- near Kupres, Srbobran, and Teslic. The strongest is 
from Teocak and Zvornik, via Kladanj and Olovo, to Ilijas. It is 
an entirely Muslim offensive, Karadzic stressed. They pulled out 
about 20,000 soldiers from Sarajevo. They were under an 
obligation to keep these soldiers in Sarajevo, but they pulled 
them out and deployed them on other fronts. 
  As for Tuzla Airport, cargo planes have been landing there 
and delivering military equipment for days. "We warned them that 
the airport was not open and that it would be opened exclusively 
on the basis of our agreement with Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, envoy Vitaliy Churkin and Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev," Karadzic said. 
  Before this is agreed, the airport must not be used for 
military purposes, but it must not be abused even after it is 
opened. The airport can be used exclusively for humanitarian 
purposes, the Srpska republic president stressed. "Two cargo 
planes were preparing to land at Tuzla Airport today and we 
warned them not to. I think this is better than shooting them 
down." 
  Dwelling on the latest Russian proposals, conveyed to 
President Milosevic and the Bosnian Serbs by Russian envoy 
Vitaliy Churkin, Karadzic confirmed that these proposals did 
exist and that they could help bring about an overall peace, but 
not a political solution at the same time. Only complete peace 
could possibly lead to the speedy attainment of a political 
solution. We will examine these proposals and we will see, 
Karadzic said. 
  He urged a full cessation of hostilities throughout the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing that he is against "a 
partial cease-fire," because, as he said, "if they are attacking 
us in Olovo we will attack them in all other areas." "We have 
the right to conduct a defense and a counteroffensive in all 
areas." 
  "We believe that an agreement on the cessation of 
hostilities 
ought to be concluded, but it should be understood that the 
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are an act 
of hostility, and if the hostilities cease, then the sanctions 
should also be abolished," Karadzic concluded.

<F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan </F>
Karadzic with unidentified correspondents in Belgrade on 14 
April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic this afternoon 
held talks with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska 
republic. Slobodan Milosevic is expected to hold talks with Lord 
Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the Geneva 
conference, this evening. In the meantime, President Karadzic 
held a news conference [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] What did you talk about with Mr. Milosevic? 
  [Karadzic] We discussed the newly created situation, the 
crisis, and so forth, and, of course, our usual issues. 
  [Correspondent] Are there any signs of progress 
(?concerning) this proposal. 
  [Karadzic] We will see. It appears that the international 
community is currently most aggravated with us breaking off 
relations with the UN. We will see whether our supreme command 
will change something in this respect tomorrow. 
  [Correspondent] Lord Owen stated that you have accepted in 
principle to meet Mr. Akashi, which means the civil sector, in 
order to maintain contacts. 
  [Karadzic] Not to maintain contacts. We agreed to meet Mr. 
Akashi tomorrow and to tell him what the stand of our supreme 
command is. Whether there will be any contacts with the civil 
sector will depend on the stand of the supreme command. 
  [Correspondent] In view of agency reports on the situation 
around Tuzla and Doboj, can you tell us briefly what is 
happening there. 
  [Karadzic] First of all, I will tell you what is happening 
around Gorazde. The first nice day that facilitated the flights 
of NATO U.S. planes was used by the Muslim forces to try to 
drive us from the right bank of the Drina. They launched an 
offensive. They set off in large numbers at our positions and 
our forces from the left bank, over the bridges, probably 
expecting to receive the support of U.S. aircraft. 
  Regarding Doboj, the town is constantly being shelled and we 
are having civilian casualties all the time. Fortunately, most 
of the casualties are wounded and not dead. Finally, we have an 
offensive on almost all the fronts, near Kupres, Srbobran, that 
is formerly Gornji Vakuf [name as heard: Donji Vakuf is what 
the Serbs call Srbobran], and Teslic. The fiercest offensive is 
between Teocak and Zvornik, via Kladanj and Olovo all the way to 
Ilijas. In other words, this is an all-out offensive. 
  They pulled out about 20,000 troops from Sarajevo because 
there is peace in Sarajevo now. They were obliged to keep these 
troops in Sarajevo, but they pulled them out and deployed them 
on other fronts. 
  Regarding Tuzla, transport planes have been landing there 
for 
days and they are bringing military materiel. We warned them. 
The airport is not open. It will be open only in accordance 
with our agreement with President Yeltsin and his special envoy 
Churkin, and finally with Mr. Kozyrev. Before that, the airport 
must not be misused for military purposes. It must not be 
misused after the opening either. It should be opened for 
humanitarian purposes only. 
  Two transport planes were preparing to land today. We warned 
them not to land. We thought it better to warn them than to 
shoot them down. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. Karadzic, just one more question. Mr. 
Churkin today stated that he had conveyed to you some proposals 
regarding the global settlement of the crisis and that he 
expected an answer from you. Can you tell us something about 
that. 
  [Karadzic] There are some proposals, there are some 
proposals that could even lead to total peace. Not immediately, 
of course, to the political solution, but total peace could 
perhaps facilitate a speedy political solution. We will examine 
these proposals and see what can.... 
  [Correspondent] Are the cease-fire and the end to 
hostilities possible at all on the entire territory of the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and not, as you said, only in some 
parts? Is this possible? 
  [Karadzic] A partial cease-fire is impossible. The 
cease-fire on the entire territory would be desirable and 
possible. It cannot be done partially, because if they attack 
us in Olovo we will attack all their other positions. In other 
words, we have the right to defend ourselves and to launch 
counteroffensives on all points. 
  Regarding the halting of hostilities, we take the view that 
we should reach an agreement on that. Of course, one must 
understand that the sanctions on Yugoslavia are an act of 
aggression and that if the hostilities are to be halted, then 
the sanctions should also be lifted.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian Radical 
Party [SRS] Chairman Vojislav Seselj said today that military 
effects of the NATO air strikes were "completely insignificant" 
and that they only caused civilian casualties. [passage omitted] 
  Seselj added that there were 180 Muslim casualties in the 
air 
strikes. "Nobody has won a war using air strikes. If the war 
continues the Muslims will be completely defeated and will be 
left without anything," he said. 
  The radical leader said that the SRS decided that for the 
time being "there will be no retaliation against Italy," 
although NATO aircraft took off from air bases in that country. 
He explained it by the fact that the Italian Government has not 
yet been formed. 
  Seselj welcomed Silvio Berlusconi's election victory and 
said 
that it was an old wish of the radicals that the two countries 
have a joint border in the western part of the Balkans. 
  He expects that Berlusconi, "as an Italian patriot," will 
not 
sacrifice the interests of his country, but will oppose the use 
of Italian territory for NATO aircraft take-offs. 
  The leader of the Radicals explained that the SRS deputies 
had walked out of the Yugoslav Assembly's session out of protest 
that a parliamentary discussion would not be held about the text 
of a declaration on the bombing of the Serb positions near 
Gorazde. 
  He believes that it was the Serbian president who did not 
want the session to be held, for it would prove, according to 
Seselj, that "Slobodan Milosevic was most to blame for the 
bombing -- he was yielding more and more as the Western powers 
were setting increasingly unscrupulous demands." 
  As regards the withdrawing of CNN and AFP correspondents' 
accreditations, Seselj said he wondered why this had not been 
done earlier.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--David Owen, cochairman of 
the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, told journalists this 
evening before his talks with Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic that NATO air attacks near Gorazde were justified, 
basing his explanation on UN Security Council resolutions. 
  He categorically rejected claims that the United Nations had 
placed itself on the side of the Muslims, stressing that it was 
now most important to restore the peace process and resume 
dialogue between the sides in the conflict.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic received Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, 
cochairmen of the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, this 
evening. 
  The Serbian president and the Geneva conference cochairmen 
exchanged views on the latest situation in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and other important issues related to a 
political resolution of the crisis. They particularly focused on 
initiatives and ideas linked to ending the armed confrontations 
and creating conditions to restore the negotiating process. 
  The Serbian president believes that an end to all 
hostilities 
in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina should be achieved, which 
means, first of all, that the Muslim forces should give up any 
further military provocation. The responsibility for their 
behavior rests to the greatest extent with the international 
community, which has not only tolerated but--by undertaking air 
attacks against the Serbs--also openly encouraged the Bosnian 
Muslim leadership to continue the war. 
  The success of the peace process depends directly on 
abandoning discriminatory practices and on returning to the 
international community's principles of impartiality and 
objectivity, Milosevic stressed in his talks with Stoltenberg 
and Owen.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic received Russian Special Envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin this evening for the third time in the last 24 hours. 
  Commenting on the three rounds of talks with Milosevic, 
which 
altogether lasted about five hours, Churkin told journalists he 
was satisfied with the talks, that they were constructive, and 
had focused mostly on the cessation of hostilities in the whole 
of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "I can say now, after the third round, that what I have in 
my 
hands now is a good basis for achieving an agreement on the 
cessation of hostilities in the whole of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," Churkin stressed. 
  The Russian envoy told journalists he was leaving for Pale 
and Sarajevo early tomorrow morning and that he would work very 
intensively on the realization of the agreement on the cessation 
of hostilities in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "My main objective is to end the current very difficult 
situation and to proceed toward the political resolution of the 
Bosnian crisis," Churkin said. 
  He refused to give any more details regarding the talks with 
President Milosevic, but expressed hope that the other (Muslim) 
side would show as constructive an approach as the Serb side. 
"In any case, I am awaiting the talks in Sarajevo tomorrow with 
hope," Churkin added. 
  Asked whether he was now, after the third round of talks 
with 
Milosevic, more optimistic then before the talks, he said: "I 
think we have done a good job and, with a bit of luck, we could 
change the situation in Bosnia."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Kondrashov] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr -- Vitaliy Churkin, Russian 
Federation president's special envoy, again met Serb President 
Slobodan Milosevic today. They discussed the situation in 
Bosnia and Russia's new proposals on overcoming the current 
Bosnian crisis caused by NATO airstrikes against Bosnian 
positions near Gorazde. 
  In a brief statement to the press after the meeting, the 
Russian deputy foreign minister refrained from revealing the 
content of these proposals. They relate to halting hostilities 
and restoring normal life in Bosnia, which is a prerequisite for 
a political solution to the Bosnian crisis, he said. 
  As an ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from well-informed 
sources, a joint meeting of the Serb president, Bosnian Serb 
leadership, and the Russian Federation president's special envoy 
can be expected in the near future to discuss Russia's new 
proposals and determine the Serb side's relevant position.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) leader Vuk </F>
Draskovic by Petar Ignja; place and date not given: "Obscurity 
of National Unity"] 
  [Text] People vote for politicians similar to themselves. 
The relative political success of Vuk Draskovic can also be 
viewed in this way because many people think that his sometimes 
lyrical and romantic, sometimes epic and rhetorical speeches are 
not welcome in politics, which requires more reality (although 
it seems that surrealistic politics are the most successful in 
Serbia). 
  What would the political world look like if we were always 
realistic, deprived of certain natural colors? Perhaps like a 
feast in the form of a pill, which might contain everything, but 
is tasteless. 
  Those who have never heard of the good man from Mancha [Don 
Quixote] -- who got himself into trouble when he decided to give 
up his quiet life and became a wandering knight -- speak and 
write about Vuk Draskovic without much understanding. 
  [Ignja] Will all this struggle of yours pay? Do you think 
that you are sometimes tilting at windmills, like the famous 
wandering knight? 
  [Draskovic] The most profitable thing for me would be not to 
get involved but write my books; however, I do not think that I 
have the right to be so selfish. There is no more important aim 
than to remove the present leadership -- to save the people and 
the state. It is a difficult and unpleasant task, however. 
Sometimes it seems a vain job, but we must be persistent. 
  [Ignja] Some time after the election it seemed that the 
opposition had a chance, since the Socialist Party -- the former 
Communists -- did not have a majority in parliament. It came to 
a breakup within the opposition, however. Were you surprised? 
  [Draskovic] I would not be sincere if I said that I had been 
surprised. In last year's election campaign I warned opposition 
supporters that their votes for change could be used against it. 
I told them that there was no risk only if they voted for 
DEPOS, or for the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement]. 
  [Ignja] Do you want to say that many people fell into a 
trap? Who set it? 
  [Draskovic] It was noticed that one of the opposition 
parties opposed everybody and everything, even itself. It did 
not only oppose hatred and war, but the spiritual and mental 
emptiness. 
  Another opposition party built its image on hidden and half- 
public "dates" with the Socialist Party, but since its love was 
not returned, it was offended and expressed its feelings by 
offering to flirt with Pale. 
  A third opposition party has not even had a political 
strategy of its own; it plays the role of Karadzic's political 
representative in Serbia. This party is practically the bureau 
of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Belgrade. 
  [Ignja] Do you want to say that these three opposition 
parties cheated the people who voted for them? 
  [Draskovic] People who voted for them wasted their ballots. 
The SPO remained the only consistent democratic power of 
resistance and hope. It must be admitted, however, that we also 
had our Kalabic [World War II Chetnik chieftain], which is the 
only thing that surprised me. Mihajlovic's behavior is 
unbelievable; it cannot be excused.... 
  [Ignja] Yes, I know, but you have forgotten to say which 
three opposition parties you are referring to? 
  [Draskovic] If they cannot be recognized based on what I 
said, it is superfluous to mention their names. I am not 
against naming these parties; I just oppose their political 
activities. 
  [Ignja] I think that the Democratic Party of Serbia [DSS] is 
a real opposition party but that it will not meddle with the 
ruling party. 
  [Draskovic] Perhaps not with it, but there is a ruling party 
on Mount Jahorina [location of Bosnian Serb assembly], too. 
This is the leadership that has disgraced us in front of the 
world. For this reason it is opposed by the SPO, but the DSS 
approves of it! God forbid that Pale gets the chance to annex 
Belgrade and Serbia! According to them, and according to their 
representatives in Serbia, their center is neither Belgrade nor 
Topola nor Takovo, but Jahorina. 
  [Ignja] Why is your party so closely linked to the New 
Democracy party? 
  [Draskovic] New Democracy is one of the founders of DEPOS. 
This party obtained four seats in the 1992 election: three in 
the Serbian Assembly, and one in the federal parliament. I have 
to say that there have been no problems whatsoever between the 
SPO and the New Democracy parliamentary members. If you are not 
acquainted with parliamentary issues, you cannot tell which 
DEPOS representatives come from the SPO and which from the New 
Democracy party. The behavior of this party eased the pain 
inflicted on DEPOS by Kostunica after he obtained 20 seats in 
parliament. It was the behavior of this party that made the SPO 
hope that its efforts to unite all the democratic and opposition 
powers under one umbrella -- in the DEPOS -- are not all in vain. 
  [Ignja] The DEPOS umbrella, however, began to leak during 
the first rain -- to the delight of the Socialist Party. Is all 
this a coincidence? 
  [Draskovic] There are rumors that Mihajlovic attended a 
special course, where he was prepared for betraying and breaking 
up DEPOS. This is not true. He was blackmailed. He owns a 
private company, and the New Democracy party is nothing but a 
chain of several dozen large and small private companies. 
People earned big money by investing little or no money at all, 
and when they were faced with the choice of either retaining 
their companies (which meant coalition with the Socialist Party 
and joint government with them), or to stay loyal to the SPO 
(which would have meant the liquidation of their companies and 
probably a series of arrests), they chose the first option. 
  [Ignja] These are perhaps only assumptions, unfounded 
suspicions? 
  [Draskovic] Already in January 1994, the Socialist Party 
leaders proved to Mihajlovic that their threats were serious. 
In Bor.... 
  [Ignja] As soon as Bor is mentioned, one must immediately 
think of Tomidza, Sainovic, and Sokolovic junior. 
  [Draskovic] ...One of the New Democracy leaders, Bosko 
Nicic, was arrested in Bor. He, too, had a private company. He 
was arrested although he was not guilty, and there were no 
reasons for his detention, but the aim was to give an example to 
the big boss of what would happen if he did not give in. He 
gave in and Nicic was released from prison on bail. New 
Democracy allegedly proposed him as Sokolovic's deputy. 
  [Ignja] The party of private entrepreneurs wants to have its 
man in the police leadership. Purely grotesque! 
  [Draskovic] The most important thing in all police states is 
to be in the good graces of the police and its boss. 
  [Ignja] You wanted to form a government of national unity 
and salvation. You have not succeeded in forming a government 
of national unity, but you have achieved a government of 
salvation -- people are entering it in order to save their heads. 
  [Draskovic] If you are good and obedient, you can have every 
position. If your are not, you can end up in prison, although 
you are innocent. You and your family can even be murdered, and 
your company destroyed. Sicilian laws are effective here, but 
they cannot make the political disgrace and betrayal committed 
by New Democracy appear less tragic. There are businessmen in 
the SPO, too. Many of our members have been confronted with 
serious threats for four years, but none of them has responded 
to any of these threats yet. Nobody has given in. 
  [Ignja] You wanted to enter the government of national unity 
yourself. Are not you trying to convince yourself now that the 
grapes are sour? 
  [Draskovic] The idea of national unity and of a government 
of national unity was born in the SPO in 1990. We especially 
insisted on it in the spring of 1991, after the demonstrations 
on 9 March, 1991. During my first encounter with Milosevic I 
reminded him of that idea and told him that he was late in 
accepting our idea. I insisted on a consistent implementation 
of this idea. 
  [Ignja] This means.... 
  [Draskovic] Nothing else than that the chief of state has to 
respect the will of his people. Milosevic told me on that 
occasion: "Naturally, the opposition will get 12 out of 25 
ministerial positions, but it cannot count on the positions of 
the prime minister or minister of internal affairs." The 
president was very generous in offering seven to eight 
ministerial posts to the SPO. 
  [Ignja] The public was not informed about the details of 
this agreement. Can you tell us more about it now that a lot of 
water has gone under the bridge? 
  [Draskovic] Yes, I can. I told Milosevic that the 
opposition should have a majority in the government, since it 
won a majority in the elections, in terms of both the number of 
votes and the number of seats in the Assembly. I added that the 
offer to participate in the government of national unity had to 
be submitted to all parliamentary parties. The president 
frowned and said that there was no place for fascism and 
primitivism in the government of national unity; he probably 
meant Seselj's party. 
  "It was your party which promoted this fascism and 
primitivism; the SPO has had a very critical attitude toward it 
since its very beginning," I said. "This is not true," 
Milosevic answered, adding that they had only supported certain 
patriotic actions organized by the Radical Party, but that they 
had never been willing to give Seselj's party any ministerial 
position, although he had often asked for this. 
  [Ignja] You have to admit, though, that they did not attack 
the Radical Party until Seselj started destroying their 
government, at the beginning of last autumn. 
  [Draskovic] Yes, this is true. I went on to point out that 
600,000 people voted for the Radical Party, a political fact 
that cannot be ignored. These voters have to be as respected as 
those who voted for the Democratic Party of Serbia, but this 
party did not want to participate in negotiations about the 
government of national unity. Milosevic was happy to be able to 
say that he invited Kostunica, who, however, refused to come. 
He also added that the Radical Party was invited, too.... 
  [Ignja] He invited Tomo Nikolic, not Seselj. 
  [Draskovic] This does not matter -- the Radical Party 
refused the invitation. To cut a long story short, I insisted 
on an opposition majority in the government. I also wanted all 
parliamentary parties to be represented in the government and a 
SPO member to become the chairman of the federal parliament, but 
the Serbian president did not accept any of these proposals. 
  [Ignja] Can you repeat his words? 
  [Draskovic] He was astonished that I refused seven 
ministerial positions. 
  [Ignja] I am not sure, but it seems to me that the 
minister of internal affairs is nowhere as respected as in 
Serbia. 
  [Draskovic] In police states the minister of the police is 
the whole government. In the negotiations of which I have just 
spoken Milosevic did not even mention the possibility that the 
Communist Party, a minor party led by his wife that did not get 
a single seat in parliament, could be represented in the 
government. There followed talks with Mr. Minic and Mr. Zoran 
Andjelkovic, and they did not mention this possibility, either. 
It is clear to me now that Milosevic and these gentlemen were 
very skillful in hiding their strategy from me. The story about 
the government of national unity was only one of their false 
methods to bring communists into the government. Formally 
speaking, four of them are communists, but in fact all 30 of 
them are. This means that the Communist Party is the ruling 
party, since the Socialist Party of Serbia is the disguised 
branch office of the communists. 
  [Ignja] Mira Markovic, the Communist Party leader, recently 
proposed that political parties should not be active during this 
crisis period. 
  [Draskovic] I have addressed this issue in parliament. The 
aim of this proposal is clear. Under the pretext of national 
unity all political parties should be abolished, except for the 
Communist Party, which means that we would return to the 
one-party system. 
  [Ignja] This sounds absurd. 
  [Draskovic] They see politics as the theater of the absurd! 
The strategists of this evil intent are not interested in the 
price that Serbia will pay for it. The embargo was primarily 
introduced because of the tragic fact that Serbia is the only 
country in Europe that supports the communist world and which 
insists on reviving the communist leadership in the Kremlin. 
The sanctions will remain effective as long as the communists 
rule in Serbia. 
  [Ignja] I did not want to interrupt you, as you were 
speaking very quickly. I think that the opposition leaders are 
not aware of the role that they have to play. Some of them seem 
not to have recognized who their political enemy is. The 
Serbian political scene does not look like that in England, 
France, or Germany, where a political rise or fall does not 
change the political life on the whole. We had communist rule 
for 50 years. The opposition that is not able to disassociate 
itself from this system will disappear from the political scene, 
because former communists and present Socialists are obviously 
doing everything to preserve the socialist system in Serbia. 
Serbia is still a socialist country, as the problem of 
ownership has not been solved yet. 
  [Draskovic] The only hope for Serbia is a democratic 
opposition, but the coalition between the Socialist and the 
Communist Party wants to destroy this hope through the obscure 
project of national unity. They do not care for the Serbian 
people; they are not interested in Serbia. The only thing that 
they are interested in is to preserve their communist leadership. 
  [Ignja] Is it true that they wanted to preserve Yugoslavia? 
  [Draskovic] Yugoslavia was broken up by generals and 
officers, members of the Communist Party. The stories about 
greater Serbia enabled them to keep their positions at that 
time. These people are now preaching a revival of Yugoslavia, 
because they think that the greater Serbia story is worn out. 
Apart from that, many people are nostalgic about the former 
Yugoslavia. Destroyers are becoming founders, masters of war 
are becoming masters of peace. They might even support the 
restoration of the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy if they thought 
that the Communist Party could profit from it. 
  [Ignja] The fear of communism -- which has, admittedly, lost 
an eye already -- has started circulating around all the Serbian 
territories. 
  [Draskovic] The Communist Party rules everywhere from 
Belgrade to Knin. Milosevic told me: "Give us as many people 
as possible for the diplomatic service, since it is horrible. 
More than horrible." He said that but he did not ask for 
anybody, although I accepted the proposal and was ready to send 
the cleverest people to represent the cultural and spiritual 
heritage of our country. Probably the most important diplomatic 
position -- and this is the position of the head of the [FRY] 
Bureau in Zagreb -- was given to a Communist Party member. This 
is a thorn not only in our side, but also in Zagreb's. 
  [Ignja] The chairman of the Democratic Party stated once 
that the opposition did not have a man who could rival Milosevic 
in the election. He was consequently praised by Milosevic. 
("That little Djindjic is not bad.") When you came out of 
Milosevic's office you looked more than happy, you paid him two 
compliments (charming and witty), and he returned by stating 
that your behavior had improved lately. People almost started 
crying. 
  [Draskovic] He also gave me a good grade in behavior last 
autumn, three months before we met. As far as my compliments 
are concerned, I would pay them again. I think that nobody is 
as powerful and superior as an innocent victim. I entered and 
left Milosevic's office with the feeling that my own power is 
superior to his; that is why I paid compliments to him. Apart 
from that, he is really a witty and charming head of state who 
looks you in eye and tells you the joke that he has no influence 
whatsoever on the television and that he does not even watch 
television. 
  [Ignja] The Democratic Party chairman goes even further 
and claims that anticommunism in Serbia does not pay. What does 
pay? Should we wait for the vizier's elephant to die a natural 
death in 100 years? 
  [Draskovic] Djindjic is perhaps right when he says that 
political parties cannot profit from an anti-communist attitude 
in a communist Serbia dominated by communist television, but the 
poverty in which we live, this prison, is the best proof that 
Serbia cannot profit from communism. 
  [Ignja] Will the opposition show enough mercy to the people 
-- to those two-thirds who did not vote for the communists -- to 
change at least some important laws? Although now -- after the 
betrayal by New Democracy -- this also seems to be impossible. 
  [Draskovic] If Djindjic, Seselj, Kostunica, and Agoston do 
not realize that all of us have to be one side in parliament in 
order to change the law on television, the election law and the 
law on election lists, it is senseless to participate in any 
future election. We are confronted with the problem of the New 
Democracy party, which has joined the other side and is now 
preventing us from changing these laws. 
  There are many democrats in the New Democracy Presidency and 
its Main Committee, so I hope that these people will soon take 
over the party and pull it out of its collaboration with the 
communists. 
  [Ignja] Why have they not been expelled by the DEPOS 
Council? 
  [Draskovic] There is no DEPOS Council. We used to have such 
a council in the beginning. In the meantime all the political 
parties that used to be DEPOS members have left the coalition. 
Only the SPO and New Democracy have remained in DEPOS. They 
were joined by the Citizens' Alliance in the last election. It 
is impossible to convoke the DEPOS council now. 
  [Ignja] This sounds logical. But how will you go into the 
next elections? 
  [Draskovic] The SPO will probably participate in the next 
elections as the SPO. We have used up all our reserves for 
turncoats. 
  [Ignja] But this will be a new situation. Is it risky, 
since people have got used to DEPOS? 
  [Draskovic] We can count on 800,000 voters, but our aim is 
to break the 1-million-vote barrier. 
  [Ignja] The Serbian opposition is only interested in a 
majority in parliament. Everything else is a minor issue. 
  [Draskovic] The easiest way to reach this democratic 
majority is to vote for the SPO. We do not rely either on the 
Kremlin or on Pale, we rely on Serbia. 
  [Ignja] Time passes, and you could be considering the 
presidential elections in three and a half years, since 
Milosevic cannot be re-elected. 
  [Draskovic] Yes. According to the Constitution, Milosevic 
cannot be re-elected. He is already the former president -- 
unless he changes the Constitution, or the people. 
  [Ignja] You have recently said: "...and nice weather is 
coming, too." Some people, for example the information 
minister, linked this to the struggle for political power 
outside parliament, in the streets. Will there be 
demonstrations, one of the constitutional rights and a 
democratic aspect of a state? 
  [Draskovic] Of course there will be demonstrations. There 
must be demostrations. The spring does not break up the winter 
only with the sun, but also with rain and wind.

  [Text] [Announcer] New movements of Serbian Army and 
police are reported in Kosova, while raids and the mistreatment 
and arrest of Albanians still continue. For more, Mehmet Haziri: 
  [Haziri] The frequent movements of the Serbian Army are 
giving distressing dimensions to the wave of the Serbian 
repression in Kosova, which have, in the last months, been 
displayed in raids, mistreatment, and arrests. 
  The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance 
[LDK] in Peje reports that in Tabje, a small hill near the city, 
a group of Serbian solders and policemen have been stationed 
since yesterday, while the bridge of Zall over Bistrice is kept 
under continuous control. 
  Another report from Zhur stresses that recently a Serbian 
Army convoy that marched in front of this locality, provoked the 
inhabitants by mistreating several Albanian youths. It is 
reported that the trucks were carrying large-caliber weapons. 
  Reports that arrived today at our editorial office in 
Prishtina and the Kosova Information Center confirmed Serbian 
police raids in many Kosova localities. On the pretext of 
searching for arms, dozens of families were raided in Drenoce 
and Balince of Malisheve, Dobercan in Gjilan, in Bratash in 
Podujeve, in Rahoshish and Jabllanice in Peje, in Ogosh in 
Kamenice, and in Suhareke. There are reports that many persons 
were maltreated and were held under arrest for many hours. 
  As part of the wave of continuous Serbian repression, we 
should mention the dismissal of Albanian workers with no pretext 
at all. The Serbian-installed leadership at the Coca Cola 
Factory in Lipjan dismissed 49 Albanian workers. Sometime ago, 
the Serb occupying power fired 30 other workers from this 
Kosovar factory. Thus, the number of the Albanian workers in 
this factory in Kosova is now only symbolic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish President Lech Walesa by Christophe </F>
Turowski; place and date not given: "Poland: Budgetary Dispute 
-- Lech Walesa: `Government Lied to the Polish People'"] 
  [Text] For the last few months, President Lech Walesa has 
been at loggerheads with Poland's government coalition. The 
Polish president has challenged almost every project making up 
the 1994 budget law passed on 5 March by Parliament, which 
remains dominated by the post-communists. On 12 April the 
President finally agreed to promulgate the budget. The 
government anticipates a $3.77 billion deficit (4.1 percent of 
GDP) and a 27-percent inflation rate. In an interview with "LE 
FIG-ECO," Lech Walesa explains why he has taken so long to 
approve the government's proposed budget. 
  [Turowski] Do you agree with those who claim that the 
political situation is currently stabilizing in Poland? 
  [Walesa] Absolutely. Poland has been carrying out economic 
reforms with a lot of rigor, but the lack of capital prevents us 
from making more headway, and the West is still pondering the 
same question: "to invest or not to invest in Poland?" 
  [Turowski] Supposing you were a foreign investor, would you 
invest your money in Poland given the current political 
situation? 
  [Walesa] Yes, because Poland is a large country which has 
been developing very dynamically, a country with 40 million 
citizens and free of ethnic, religious or other conflicts. 
  [Turowski] Why would you not sign the 1994 budget, which had 
been approved by the IMF and the World Bank and would make it 
possible to reduce Poland's debt to the Club of London faster? 
  [Walesa] Economically, the budget is sound, except for a few 
details. But it is a liberal budget which does not conform to 
the current government coalition's electoral promises. 
<H5>  "Communist Methods" </H5>
  So I ask the coalition this crucial question: why did you 
lie 
to the Polish people? Why did you promise that economic policy 
would change, only to adopt now the same policies as those 
followed four years ago by the party born of Solidarnosc ? 
  [Turowski] So it is politics above economics? 
  [Walesa] No. But I would like, once and for all, that the 
Polish people be told the truth. On the other hand, the 
Solidarnosc union had asked me not to sign the budget passed by 
Parliament. This means it is opposed by part of the population, 
and I also had to take that into account. The budget is 
developed for the population, not the other way around. 
  [Turowski] Although it is now seeking your protection, 
Solidarnosc had drifted a considerable distance away from you -- 
its charismatic leader -- at its last conference... 
  [Walesa] ...And lost its place in Parliament as a result. 
Had Solidarnosc's leaders listened to me at the time, we would 
all be in a different situation today. So the union is now 
fussing about, trying a little blindly to define its direction 
and its place in a society that changes fast, very fast. 
  [Turowski] The strikes sponsored by Solidarnosc over the 
last few weeks have not been a massive success... 
  [Walesa] They can start again at any time if the population 
is not taken seriously. 
  [Turowski] Do you really want to satisfy populist demands? 
This would lead to increasing the money supply which would lead 
to increased inflation in a very short time. 
  [Walesa] I do not share such fears, as the Polish 
population has already given ample proof of its intelligence and 
patience. 
  [Turowski] In a similar vein, you rejected the coalition's 
candidate for the position of deputy prime minister and economy 
and finance minister, a noted specialist who now works for the 
United Nations. Thus because of you the Polish economy has been 
leader- less for two months. Why? 
  [Walesa] The government coalition has an excessive regard 
for communist management methods. The way things used to be was 
that the Politburo would make every decision and all the 
government had to do would be to carry out its orders. 
  Today, things are not the same: The role of the President of 
the Republic is no longer to rubber-stamp and to keep his mouth 
shut. For various reasons, I do not trust the only candidate 
that was presented to me. 
  There are even politicians who say that I have been 
destabilizing Poland; they are mistaken; I just want the men who 
steer the Polish economy to be above reproach and to be true to 
the promises made to the population. 
<H5>  "Europe Bogged Down" </H5>
  [Turowski] Let us now talk about relations between Poland 
and Europe. You have been highly critical of these over the 
last few months. What are your main concerns? 
  [Walesa] It are Western Europe's misconceptions about the 
interests of our Old Continent. Harmonious cooperation between 
Central and Eastern Europe is just as important for the latter 
as it is for the West. 
  The association agreements between Poland and the European 
Union give Poland a privileged position and, two years into 
these agreements, Poland's trade balance is negative. How can 
you expect me to be satisfied? Nevertheless, Poland filed its 
formal application for European Union membership a few days ago. 
  [Turowski] Within the European Union, there are those who 
say that Central and Eastern European countries must first 
strengthen ties between themselves, and then apply together for 
European Union membership. What is your opinion? 
  [Walesa] I want to remind you here that two years ago I 
suggested that we should create our own versions of the EC and 
NATO. Cooperation among countries located between the Vistula 
[as published], Dnepr, and Danube rivers is essential, and it 
has been growing. In this respect, much remains to be done. 
Regardless of all good-neighborly relations and cooperation 
treaties already signed, we must never cease to strengthen 
economic relations. 
  However, this is not something that can be imposed by the 
European Union or by ourselves. Only daily life and daily work 
can bring us closer to this ultimate goal. 
  Today, Western Europe sometimes tends to look for rather 
strange solutions, because it does not comprehend the changes 
that have taken place in the East. There is no doubt that the 
communist system has collapsed, while Western Europe has yet to 
come to terms with the changes that take place every day in 
Central and Eastern Europe. It is Europe that is now bogged 
down while we are advancing at the double.

  [Text] Prior to tomorrow's meeting of seven presidents in 
Litomysl, Polish President Lech Walesa has granted an exclusive 
interview to Czech Radio. The interview is presented by our 
Warsaw correspondent Miroslav Karas. 
  [Begin recording] [Karas] Mr. President, recently you have 
called several times on Western Europe, and above all on the 
United States, to be more active and take speedier steps and 
more courageous decisions. You have also expressed your alarm 
over the situation in Europe following the fall of communism and 
the disbanding of the Warsaw Pact. You have described the 
countries of this part of the continent as a no-man's-land. 
Will you explain your words in more detail? 
  [Walesa, in Polish fading to Czech translation] Everything I 
have done and I am doing is being done with a view to greater 
security in Europe; in one Europe -- not central Europe or 
eastern Europe or whatever Europe. It is clear that for such a 
Europe to emerge it is necessary to change its geography. The 
Warsaw Pact and the CEMA have disappeared and we have not formed 
anything new. The West has understandably stopped fearing 
communism and the Warsaw Pact, and is keeping us in a state of 
uncertainty. 
  As you know, I am not scared by any difficulties and dangers 
-- I do not fear them if I know them. At present I do not know 
them. I do not know what can happen -- whether somebody will 
form a military pact here or whether we will begin to dispute 
our borders. This is why I found myself in uncertainty and this 
is the source of my objections to the West. Following the 
disappearance of the old structures the West has not attempted 
to change the continent's geography to include us -- I mean the 
countries which need it -- into the security zone. And this 
applies also to the economc sphere. The present period is not a 
period of confrontation, and therefore there is no need for the 
chain's individual links to be of the same strength. It is 
possible to create conditions for them and they themselves will 
take care of gaining the necessary strength. 
  However, this is not the only reason for my objections. When 
I hear that we are forming the Partnership for Peace, and that 
one of the partners is to be bigger and that the other is given 
a chance to keep its nuclear weapons -- I have to say, sorry. 
For me this is something similar to the Yalta Agreement. With 
the help of the United States let's build one Partnership for 
Peace in Europe! Let's include Russia, with its nuclear weapons! 
  And subsequently, let's push America out of Europe! -- and 
we 
will thus create the United States of Russia. 
  However, what I want is a United States of Europe and thus 
observing all this I want to warn and call on all those who bear 
responsibility to pay attention to the fact that we have found 
ourselves at a crossroads, and if we make a mistake now it will 
be my grandchildren who pay for it. I simply do not want to 
commit any mistake. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski: "A Vetoing Lech Walesa?"] </F>
  [Text] Recently, President Lech Walesa has been using his 
veto power more and more frequently. We asked some politicians 
to assess the way he has been availing himself of this right. 
According to Jan Maria Rokita, it is a "veto by surprise," 
while Tomasz Nalecz describes Walesa's vetoes as "provocative 
and exacerbating," and Ludwik Dorn uses the term "destructive." 
  The preannounced veto by the president regarding the 
electoral law to gmina [small administrative units] councils, 
would already be the 11th veto in Lech Walesa's term of office. 
The greatest emotions were stirred by two vetoes of an 
electoral law in 1991 (both of which were overruled), a veto 
regarding the law on radio and television in 1991 (not 
overruled), and one regarding a law on retirement pensions for 
uniformed officials in 1993 (not overruled). 
  In recent weeks, the president has definitely reminded us of 
his veto prerogative more often. He vetoed a neo-popiwek 
[wage-controlling] statute by making the claim that it tries to 
interfere with the level of earnings in private companies, and 
that the statute violates the law by granting the government a 
parliamentary privilege to set taxes. For a long time, the 
president also suggested the possibility of not signing the 
Budget Law because of its failure to implement the breakthrough 
announced by the now governing coalition during the elections. 
But once he finally approved of the budget, the very same day 
he announced he will veto an electoral law for self-governmental 
elections. 
  Many politicians of the governing coalition sharply 
criticized the moves by the president, saying that Walesa was 
driven by a hostility toward the coalition and his goal was to 
achieve political destabilization. But the governing coalition 
failed to gather the necessary two-thirds majority required to 
overrule the veto on neo-popiwek. Many papers in turn published 
articles in which efforts were made to establish whether the 
president is violating the legal order by his measures. 
  According to Lech Falandysz -- deputy chief of the 
President's Office and the Belvedere's main legal expert -- the 
president is simply using his powers, while not violating the 
law at the same time. 
  "Some politicians should first read the Small Constitution 
and only then start making judgments on the president's 
measures" -- Falandysz says. "Besides, the president will not 
allow anybody to tell him how to use his powers." 
  In the view of Falandysz, to meet the demand that the 
president make his reservations known before a law is adopted by 
the Sejm and, in this way, try to influence the legislative 
process in parliament, would mean an elimination of veto power 
altogether. 
  "The president would have to fight for his ideas on laws in 
parliamentary commissions and he would also be accused of 
interfering with parliament proceedings" -- Falandysz states. 
<H5>  It Would Be Unacceptable in the United States </H5>
  Center Accord Deputy Chairman Ludwik Dorn: Aside 
from Russia, the only president with veto power is the U.S. 
President. If he has any reservations regarding a bill, he does 
not wait until it is passed by Congress. Representatives of the 
presidential administration simply suggest their protests -- 
without using the media as a go-between -- and then they examine 
the configuration of forces in Congress. 
  Only after it turns out that the congressional majority does 
not want a compromise, the president makes a public statement 
that in case the bill is passed, he will use his veto power. 
But even in such cases, there is usually a meeting between the 
president and congressional leaders, and the dispute most often 
ends in a compromise. But if a veto is indeed used, then the 
whole thing is of dramatic dimensions. 
  What is important in that practice, is the complete 
accountability of both sides, the awareness of what it is that 
the other side wants, and also the fact that neither side is 
eager to put the opponent against the wall. Simply put, nobody 
regards the dispute as a zero-sum game. What happened with the 
Budget Law in Poland would be unthinkable in the United States. 
  In Walesa's case, I do not recall any occasion in the past 
where he would make an advanced warning that he may veto a law. 
He applies his veto power in a destructive manner. 
  After all, the truth is that Walesa is not making use of his 
prerogatives, the men and the resources at his disposal, to 
influence the contents of laws. So it is very clear that he 
does not care about specific issues but only about strengthening 
his own position. 
<H5>  Presidential `No' is Just Like the President Himself </H5>
  Jan Maria Rokita, deputy chairman of the Democratic 
Union Parliamentary Club: Situations arising in the United 
States show that over there, a "veto by surprise" -- which 
President Lech Walesa often applies -- is an unknown phenomenon. 
  But Walesa has some arguments in his favor. First of all, in 
Poland there is no formula for the president's participation in 
parliament's legislative proceedings during which he could 
submit remarks on draft laws being prepared. The Belvedere's 
representatives take part in the commissions' proceedings only 
when presidential initiatives are debated. 
  Second, it also happens that the legislative process itself 
is conducted "by surprise." Some laws are adopted all of a 
sudden and at an insane speed. The reforms of the state are 
going on and the legal system is undergoing constant changes, as 
well. But what speaks against Walesa, is the evaluation of the 
totality of the style in which he executes his office. It is 
clear to any observer of the political scene, that Walesa likes 
to play the card of uncertainty in his position -- hence the 
proverbial "I am in favor and even against." I am convinced 
that even if the president could actually participate in 
legislative proceedings, he would definitely not use his right, 
anyway. Simply put, the current situation is much more 
comfortable to him. The president likes to catch people by 
surprise and attack unexpectedly. 
  Besides, presidential vetoes are becoming an instrument of 
Walesa's political confrontation with the Democratic Left 
Alliance, and recently also with the Polish Peasant Party. If 
Walesa had decided to veto the Budget Law, then one would have 
been able to accuse him of initiating brawls. But since he did 
not veto it after all, a question mark remains in that respect. 
So I would not make an accusation like that. It is probably 
true anyway, but it would be hard to find facts to support it. 
That is because when vetoing the neo-popiwek law and the new 
local electoral law, Walesa had genuine social support. In the 
case of neo-popiwek, he was supported by the opposition, and in 
the case of the electoral law -- by self-government groups. 
<H5>  The Vetoes Are Provocative, Exacerbating </H5>
  Tomasz Nalecz, press spokesman of the Union of Labor's 
Deputies Club: I am very critical of the way Lech Walesa 
has been using his presidential veto. I think that when using 
certain instruments, one should observe rules effective for the 
entire machinery. Otherwise, you break the machinery. 
  According to the Small Constitution, the day-to-day ruling 
of 
the country is in the hands of the government, with the 
parliament adopting laws, and the president serving as an 
umpire. This means that the president is supposed to get 
involved at a point when the machinery malfunctions. Under this 
concept, a presidential veto should happen once in a blue moon. 
But what Lech Walesa is doing, is turning the right of veto 
into an instrument of day-to-day governing of the country. The 
way he applies the right to veto leads to political cacophony. 
It amounts to playing two melodies at the same time. 
  As is well known, being a Sejm deputy for the Union of 
Labor, 
I am not an enthusiast of the current coalition. But one cannot 
paralyze the functioning of the chief institutions of state 
power. But Walesa gets an itch every time he comes across an 
important law -- this applies not only to those laws which are 
supposed to determine something decades into the future, but 
also to those which pertain to quite immediate issues. 
  That is why one can regard the presidential vetoes as 
provocative and exacerbating. President Walesa has made a 
decision to play his political game. That conflicts with my 
concept of the Presidency. 
  This reminds me of a story: An elderly fellow is carrying a 
big sack and every once in a while he stops and stirs around in 
the sack with a stick. When asked what he is doing, he responds 
that he is carrying a sack full of rats and he stirs in the sack 
so the rats won't bite him on the back. "Then they bite one 
another" -- explains the man.

  [Text] National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk has 
announced that he has introduced a motion before the president 
regarding taking legal proceedings against the budget law before 
the Constitutional Tribunal. 
  The head of the Defense Ministry objects to the duty imposed 
by the budget law to buy Polish Iryda planes for the Army. 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] The verdict of the 
Constitutional Tribunal--should it be favorable to the Ministry 
of National Defense--will eliminate a dangerous precedent. This 
would be the first point. The second is that I foresee no 
problems, since the government draft budget would then be 
restored, and all the orders placed in the remaining 30 
enterprises of the armaments industry would then be implemented 
in full. 
  At the moment, this money must be found somewhere. It must 
either be removed from orders already processed by the industry 
in other enterprises that provide equipment needed by the Army 
and that fulfill all specifications, or training will have to be 
cut. This is a matter that is dangerous to the defense 
capabilities of the country. [end recording] 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk gave an interview for the "Sygnaly 
Dnia" program. 
  Presidential spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski has said that it 
is 
not impossible that Lech Walesa will bring action against the 
budget regarding that part that refers to the Ministry of 
National Defense.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Tadeusz Wilecki, head of the General </F>
Staff of the Polish Army, by Miroslaw Cielemecki; place and date 
not given: "The Army Practically Has No Commander Today; 
Maneuvers"] 
  [Text] [Cielemecki] After meetings between Polish and 
Western military commanders information is often leaked to the 
press that the West will gladly admit Poland to NATO. Later it 
turns out that no specific decisions are made after those 
announcements are made. What exactly is going on? 
  [Wilecki] All declarations should be evaluated wisely, 
without unnecessary emotions. Military officers and politicians 
differ their way of evaluating certain phenomena. Western 
commanders are pragmatic; they really are supporters of fast 
integration of Poland with the NATO structures. Politicians, 
however, act in the context of current configurations and 
political situations. I am an optimist. Contrary to the views 
expressed by some people, the "Partnership for Peace" program is 
not a subterfuge of the West. It has drawn us closer to NATO. 
  [Cielemecki] Perhaps politicians are looking at the problem 
of extending NATO to Poland as some kind of a stick against 
Russia? 
  [Wilecki] I do not think so. Compared to Russia, Poland is 
too small and weak to be used as a stick, as a bargaining chip. 
I do not think that NATO politicians had such intentions. 
Placing Poland opposite Russia would not serve stabilization in 
our part of Europe -- either on the political or on the military 
platform. 
  [Cielemecki] Janusz Onyszkiewicz evaluates that the changes 
recently taking place in the Army management structures, which 
limit civilian control over it, will prolong the Polish road to 
NATO. 
  [Wilecki] I am able to understand the reaction of Deputy 
Onyszkiewicz. Right now he is a politician of an oppositional 
party. He is also the author of organizational changes which he 
introduced when he was the defense minister. I must admit that 
in many areas they were justified and rational. However, one 
must also understand the needs of the Armed Forces, which must 
be allowed a certain autonomy in its activities. In Western 
systems these issues are not explained unequivocally as well. 
Generally, I am a supporter of civilian control over the Army. 
However, not only control, but also duties toward it. Civilian 
politicians may display their skills and capabilities, among 
other things, by constructing a broadly-understood defense 
system. 
  [Cielemecki] What are the limits of the Army's autonomy, do 
you think? 
  [Wilecki] They must allow it to be efficiently steered and 
managed. Control over the Army must not mean tying its hands 
and prolonging the decisionmaking process. 
  [Cielemecki] However, oppositional politicians voice the 
opinion that Minister Kolodziejczyk has broadened this autonomy 
too much, that he simply subordinated the Ministry of National 
Defense [MON] to the General Staff. Is it true that the future 
general inspector of the Armed Forces will be beyond any control? 
  [Wilecki] The Polish Army needs a commander for peace time 
as well. Right now it practically does not have a commander -- 
the commander is neither a minister nor a head of the General 
Staff. Such a function might be fulfilled by the general 
inspector of the Armed Forces. At this point I would like to 
explain one thing: I really am not "dying" to fill that post, as 
some people think. The recent changes do not mean MON's 
capitulation. Please note that the previous civilian minister 
wielded enormous power over the Army; he took advantage of the 
old legal regulations, in line with which this function was 
fulfilled by the top-ranking general. Now, can a civilian 
politician, who often does not even have the elementary military 
education, command the Army? I do not think that we should 
lament over the recently-imposed limitations of the role of the 
so-called civilian section. They do not mean that the Army is 
getting out of control. MON is managing, steering, and 
exercising political supervision over the Army. Besides, there 
is also the parliament, the president, as well as the Supreme 
Control Chamber and the spokesman for civil rights. The area of 
civilian power over the Army is still vast. One must say, 
however, that this supervision is not always sufficiently 
coherent. 
  [Cielemecki] What, then, should it look like? 
  [Wilecki] A debate on the defense system is being prepared 
in the Sejm. If it is a substantive and constructive debate, if 
all the problems related to the defense system are noticed, then 
it will certainly be possible to agree on a coherent control 
system. Its shape should be decided by politicians; they should 
bear in mind the broadly-understood political and state interest. 
  [Cielemecki] Still, you and Minister Kolodziejczyk probably 
do not think very highly of the competence of the Sejm deputies 
who decide defense issues? 
  [Wilecki] Let us not generalize things. In the Sejm, in the 
Defense Committee, there are many parliamentarians who know a 
lot about the problems of the Army. There are also others -- 
for example those who have not done their stint in the Army and 
their contacts with the defense system have been next to none. 
  [Cielemecki] When the fight for the budget money is going 
on, the military men warn that the Army has found itself in a 
critical situation, that it is simply dying. However, when the 
context of the discussion changes -- when the subject of the 
discussion is our rapid integration with NATO, which does not 
need weaklings, it turns out that the situation of the Polish 
Army is not all that bad at all. General, what is your 
evaluation of the force and combat efficiency of the Polish Army? 
  [Wilecki] I am embittered that the civilian 
decisionmakers, who should take good care of the financial 
condition of the Army, are not fulfilling their tasks. We heard 
promises that as soon as a civilian ministry was established, it 
would be a guarantee of greater funds for the defense system. 
This is not what actually happened. A modern army cannot be 
built without money. 
  [Cielemecki] However, you have not answered my question 
fully. 
  [Wilecki] It is not possible to make an unequivocal, 
synthesized evaluation. The Army has not only good segments, 
but it also has many weaknesses. Generally, it possesses modern 
combat technology; however, there is too much old equipment. An 
additional problem is that even though the limitations of Cocom 
[Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] have 
been abolished, our arms industry is not able to immediately 
manufacture equipment that would meet world standards. We also 
cannot afford to import much armament. Such a situation -- 
before the industry adjusts itself to new requirements -- will 
last several years. NATO has armies with great potential; we 
cannot match them. However, there are also weaker and smaller 
armies. I believe that our Army might already today be placed 
among the medium-sized armies of the organization, perhaps even 
a little higher. 
  [Cielemecki] Integration with NATO means first of all 
convergent standards, technical compatibility, uniform command 
systems, similar norms, and so on and so forth. However, it 
also entails "compatibility" of a different kind -- of the 
people, first of all of the generals and high-ranking 
commanders. Most of them come from a different epoch, they are 
saturated with different models of thinking, they cherish 
different values. 
  [Wilecki] I agree that not all the people in our Army are 
top-flight aces. However, the same is true of the West; in the 
West there are weaknesses as well. I can assure you that we 
have no reason to be ashamed of our command cadres. Now, as for 
their mentality and habits, the art of war is the same both here 
and there. Already now in many areas of a general nature our 
Army is compatible with the Western Armies. 
  [Cielemecki] During exercises, on staff maps our own troops 
and the troops of our allies are marked red and those of the 
enemy are marked blue. As recently as a few years ago NATO 
Armies were blue on our maps. Who is now playing the role of 
"the blue"? 
  [Wilecki] Now we do not define our enemy that specifically. 
During exercises, our own units fight against each other; they 
are assigned appropriate roles. This is the best way to resolve 
political dilemmas: Who is the ally and who the enemy. 
  [Cielemecki] However, any armed conflict has a defined, 
political undercurrent. Is it not an oversimplification of the 
art of war to eliminate this factor in exercises? 
  [Wilecki] The best art of war consists of the following: 
Being strong, well-organized, and literally prepared for 
everything. We adhere to this principle in building and 
organizing our Armed Forces. We do not do this with a concrete 
enemy in mind. We are rather interested in certain canons which 
are binding in a given period. 
  [Cielemecki] President Walesa has often pointed at the 
concentration of the Russian troops in the Kaliningrad Oblast 
and called it a threat to Poland. How do you -- as a military 
officer -- evaluate this threat? 
  [Wilecki] In line with the recently-concluded international 
resolutions, Central Europe should be a zone without excessively 
concentrated military units. The situation in the Kaliningrad 
Oblast is really disconcerting and it should be thought over. 
One cannot help asking the question: Does such a far-flung 
military point serve only the military interests of Russia? 
Well, but this is a dilemma not for the military, but for 
politicians. In my opinion, there should not be such highly 
militarized areas in the new Europe. 
  [Cielemecki] Two years ago a document called the "Polish 
martial doctrine" was drawn up. Today it is mentioned 
increasingly more seldom; its shortcomings are stressed. What, 
do you think, the main defects of our doctrine are? 
  [Wilecki] It has partially lost its political validity. In 
the substantive section, however, it is still valid and we are 
taking advantage of it in the transformation of our Armed Forces. 
  [Cielemecki] Both Polish and Western commanders -- 
especially Americans -- have already several times said that 
joint military exercises would be organized. Next there came a 
rumble from Russia and the issue of joint military undertakings 
was always moved to an indefinite future. Will they ever be 
held? 
  [Wilecki] This moment is drawing near very quickly. 
Appropriate decisions have already been made. This year joint 
exercises will be held -- for the time being at lower levels. 
These will be maneuvers with German, Danish, and French units. 
The idea of joint exercises of aircraft and naval formations is 
being entertained. I would not like to list any dates and the 
scale of these undertakings, because detailed agreements are 
still being discussed. It looks like we are also going to 
participate in joint Polish-American exercises. We are 
conducting an exchange at the staff level with the most 
important ally armies. It is the requirement of the nature of 
military cooperation that before the units of Poland and NATO 
stand side by side on a training field, all factors be thought 
over, including the training factors.

  [Text] Sofia, April 14 (BTA) -- There was a sharp debate 
in the National Assembly today, provoked by the request of UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that the Bulgarian 
Government give its consent for the transit of UN equipment 
across Bulgarian territory. The equipment is provided by the 
U.S. Administration and intended for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] contingent in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]. It consists of 14 armoured vehicles and 
supplementary equipment. 
  This morning a Government Press Office official announced 
that at its regular meeting the Bulgarian Government decided to 
give its consent for the transit passage of the UN equipment 
from Romania to Macedonia across Bulgaria. Later on the press 
centre of the Foreign Ministry reported that the ministry had 
instructed the Bulgarian permanent representation in New York to 
inform the United Nations about the Council of Ministers' 
decision, stressing that Bulgaria considers this to be a 
one-time act which cannot be seen as creating a precedent for 
future actions. "Besides, Bulgaria informs the United Nations 
that it reserves its right to refuse the transit passage of UN 
property, equipment and peacekeeping troops provided by the 
countries in this region, which is in harmony with the position 
Bulgaria has stated many times," the Foreign Ministry's press 
release says. 
  In the afternoon the MP's included in the agenda of their 
regular parliamentary meeting an older proposal for the adoption 
of a resolution under which Bulgaria's territory, its 
territorial waters and its air space should not be used for the 
passage of foreign military forces involved in the armed 
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. At the end of 1993 the 
Bulgarian Parliament adopted a declaration which states that 
Bulgaria will not interfere neither directly nor indirectly in 
the Yugoslav conflict even if such operations are launched under 
the aegis of the United Nations. The MP's who took the floor 
today accused the government of exceeding its rights and 
violating the Constitution. Under the Constitution, it is 
parliament's prerogative to approve the passage of foreign 
troops across Bulgaria's territory. 
  Minister of Transport Kiril Ermenkov, Deputy Defence 
Minister 
Boyko Noev and General Staff Chief Army Gen. Lyuben Petrov were 
invited to attend the plenary meeting. 
  Addressing the MP's, Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov 
pointed out that in the view of the government the transit of 
military equipment should not be interpreted as crossing by 
foreign troops, therefore the Council of Ministers' decision 
does not contradict Bulgaria's official position. "If 
Parliament reverses the government's decision, this may be taken 
to mean that Bulgaria is not willing to render assistance in 
preventing the possible spread of the conflict to Macedonia," 
Mr. Daskalov told a BTA reporter in the lobbies of Parliament. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, acting as prime 
minister during Prof. Lyuben Berov's absence for reasons of 
health, denied that the government had adopted such a decision. 
According to Mr. Matinchev, Foreign Minister Daskalov had just 
suggested "some views of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry" to the 
government for consideration. 
  The other deputy prime minister, Valentin Karabashev, 
confirmed that the cabinet had decided to approve the UN 
equipment transit passage. 
  The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) proposed a 
draft resolution which says that the cabinet headed by Prof. 
Lyuben Berov, who is in hospital now, exceeded its rights and 
that this act could give rise to mistrust between Bulgaria and 
the United Nations. The SDS moved for presenting the transcript 
of today's cabinet meeting to see if it had decided to allow the 
UN equipment passage or not. Both motions were defeated. 
  The formerly Communist Bulgarian Socialist Party moved for 
an 
extraordinary parliamentary meeting at night, so that parliament 
could pronounce itself on Mr. Butrus-Ghali's request. The 
motion was not put to the vote and though extended by two hours, 
parliament's working time expired. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Karabashev announced that the cabinet 
will hold an extraordinary meeting opening at 2300 hours tonight.

  [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- At its midnight 
extraordinary meeting the Bulgarian Government decided to 
propose to parliament to allow, as a one-time act, the passage 
of the United Nations equipment, provided by the U.S. 
Administration and intended to be used by the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] force in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] for preventive operations, 
across Bulgaria. The media learned about this decision from 
government spokesman Raycho Raykov at 0200 hours. At 
yesterday's meeting the government decided to grant the request 
made by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali for assistance 
for the unobstructed passage of 14 armoured vehicles and 
supplementary equipment across Bulgaria from the border with 
Romania to the border with Macedonia. 
  At yesterday's regular meeting of parliament the MP's 
accused 
the government of having exceeded its rights. Some MP's believe 
that a certain text in the Bulgarian Constitution is given 
different interpretations. According to the text in the 
Constitution, it is the prerogative of parliament to approve the 
deployment, use or crossing of foreign troops; another text in 
it empowers the government to tackle foreign policy problems. 
  According to Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, the 
ministers unanimously confirmed that Bulgaria should allow the 
transit passage of the UN equipment. His answer to the question 
if not allowing it would have a negative effect on Bulgaria's 
image was in the affirmative. 
  The extraordinary meeting of the cabinet to reconsider its 
decision was prompted by the heated debate in the National 
Assembly, which extended its working time by two hours yesterday.

<F P=106> [From BTA press review] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- Last night's heated 
debates in the National Assembly on allowing passage through 
Bulgaria of UN military equipment and property for UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] is a central topic of the press today. 
  According to DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party 
(BSP), parliament is expected to announce today its final 
decision on the draft resolution which the cabinet worked out 
and moved for debate at an extraordinary meeting held last 
night. TRUD, the daily of one of the major trade unions, says 
that MP's of both the former communist BSP and the 
anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) yesterday 
accused the government of violating the Constitution and of high 
treason. The private STANDART NEWS brings forward the fact that 
the government adopted its decision behind the back of 
parliament. "Parliament and government did not come to terms," 
BULGARSKA ARMIYA says. 
  The press reports that Deputy Prime Minister Valentin 
Karabashev and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said in 
parliament that the decision for transshipment of equipment 
across Bulgaria for UNPROFOR in Macedonia was adopted, while 
Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev said it was not. A 
commentary in DUMA, headlined "Corridor -- Yes! But It Depends 
for What Purposes," says that "the Americans cannot understand 
our sensitivity and justified fear of Turkish troops deployment 
in the Balkans." According to the daily with the largest 
circulation, 24 CHASA, the government's decision of yesterday 
has shaken its positions. "Government Discredited Bulgaria 
Again, This Time at the United Nations," reads a front-page 
report in DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the oppositional SDS. 
According to KONTINENT, the scandal in parliament predicts the 
fall of the cabinet. KONTINENT quotes MP's of the SDS as saying 
that the Union will most probably move a vote of no confidence 
in the Government. A signed commentary in KONTINENT says that 
the continued agony of Bulgaria could only end if Prime Minister 
Lyuben Berov resigns.

  [Text] Sofia, April 14 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian Government 
reiterates Bulgaria's hope to be granted full membership in the 
European Union [EU]. Bulgaria is ready to make the required 
representations as soon as the prerequisites for that have been 
created, says a declaration of the Council of Ministers adopted 
today. 
  The document states the resolution of the Bulgarian 
Government to do its best and accelerate this process, proceed 
with the reforms and create the necessary economic, legislative 
and other conditions for Bulgaria's full integration into the EU. 
  The government is ready to continue its political dialogue 
with the EU on foreign policy and security issues on both 
bilateral and multilateral bases. 
  The Council of Ministers suggests that the National Assembly 
consider the effective acts of the EU in the course of its 
legislative work in order to bring Bulgarian legislation in line 
with their standards. In their cooperation with the 
institutions of the EU member countries, the Bulgarian 
ministries and departments will be guided by the stipulations of 
this declaration. 
  The government will rely on the cooperation and support of 
the European Council, the European Commission and the EU 
countries in the implementation of its declaration, the document 
says in conclusion.

closing down of academic institutes and the pensioning off of 
researchers from the institute of military technology with the 
Ministry of Defence who are directly involved in programmes 
concerning defence and national security, the military industry 
would have to face serious problems mobilization readiness would

  [Text] Sofia, April 13 (BTA) -- The editors-in-chief of 
major national dailies, supported by other media, today called 
for amendments to the Value-Added Tax [VAT] Act. They want the 
18 percent flat VAT rate introduced on April to be replaced with 
a zero rate for Bulgarian newspapers and books, scientific 
literature and magazines (excluding pornographic ones), and 
advertising in the media, BTA learned from the group of 
editors-in-chief who initiated the anti-VAT protest campaign. 
  Most newspapers and magazines in Bulgaria suspended 
publication on the last four days of March. Earlier they ran 
blank columns in protest against the "killer tax on Bulgarian 
books and the free press." Joining the campaign, private radio 
stations in Sofia suspended broadcasting for two days after 
which they started airing noises every hour on the hour. 
Provincial newspapers and radio stations also staged protests. 
Leaders of the Unions of Bulgarian Writers and Journalists 
joined a demonstration staged on March 30. The Bulgarian news 
agency also joined the anti-VAT protest campaign. President 
Zhelyu Zhelev supported the protest by Bulgarian intellectuals. 
Amendments which partly met the journalists' and publishers' 
demands were introduced in parliament but were voted down in a 
secret ballot. 
  The initiators of the protest issued a declaration today 
stating that a lot of MP's had failed to appreciate the 
civilized forms of protest and the markedly moderate nature of 
the media's demands. 
  Guided by caste egoism and a totally unjustified sense of 
superiority over the nation, the members of parliament in a 
secret ballot unprecedented in cowardice infringed on the right 
of the public to freedom and plurality of information, the 
declaration stressed. According to the protesters, the tax 
would lead to a large price increase, causing many papers to 
close down. 
  The editors-in-chief who launched the campaign will urge 
that 
the next elections be held according to the majority system in 
the hope that "this will prevent people of dubious business and 
moral character and people unknown to the electorate from 
entering parliament on omnibus party lists."

  [Text] Prague, April 14 (CTK) -- The question of the 
Temelin nuclear power station in south Bohemia should not 
provoke controversy between Czech President Vaclav Havel and 
Austrian President Thomas Klestil at the forthcoming meeting of 
seven Central European presidents in the east Bohemian town of 
Litomysl, Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek said today. 
  "It is impossible for the topic of Temelin not to appear at 
the meeting," Spacek told journalists. He added, however, that 
it was impossible to expect that the debate on the nuclear power 
plant would be conducted on "some specific level." The 
discussion will probably be on how to ensure nuclear security in 
Europe, Spacek said. 
  Klestil intends, during his meeting with Klaus on Friday [15 
April], to convince the Czech president of the necessity of new 
steps concerning the Temelin nuclear plant. In an interview 
with Green representatives in Vienna today Klestil promised that 
he would seek to table discussion on the ecological impact of 
the construction and would contribute to the renewal of talks on 
planning permission.

  [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- Colombian Foreign 
Minister Nohemi Sanin Posada believes that Czech President 
Vaclav Havel, along with Pope John Paul II and former Soviet 
President Michail Gorbachev, are three people who have ended the 
process of the European totalitarianism, Havel's spokesman 
Ladislav Spacek told journalists after meeting between Posada 
and Havel today. 
  He said that Posada had voiced her admiration at the 
restoration of political and economic freedoms in the Czech 
Republic. 
  Havel and Posada agreed on the need to deepen cooperation 
between the Czech Republic and Columbia, especially in the 
economic, technical and scientific fields, Spacek said. 
  Havel acquainted Posada with the basic transformation 
principles of the Czech Republic and primarily with the 
privatization process. 
  Posada conveyed to Havel an invitation from Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria Trujill to visit Columbia, Spacek said, 
adding that in his turn Havel invited the Colombian president to 
visit the Czech Republic.

  [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Colombian Foreign 
Minister Nohemi Sanin Posada, in a meeting with Czech Parliament 
Chairman Milan Uhde today, pointed to the as yet not-utilized 
possibilities for Czech-Colombian political, economic and 
cultural cooperation. 
  She described the current level of Czech-Colombian trade as 
a 
symbolic one, adding that the Czech and Colombian economies were 
fully compatible and were not competing each other in any 
branch. She said that the Czech Republic was capable of standing 
up to competition in Latin American area too. 
  "We have lost many opportunities and this should be 
stopped," 
she said, referring to Czech-Colombian political, economic and 
cultural cooperation. 
  Uhde said that the Czech Republic was capable of offering, 
under advantageous conditions, different kinds of technology to 
Columbia. He mentioned metro construction project in the 
Colombian town of Medelin, Posada's native town, adding that 
such an opportunity should be made use of. 
  Uhde described the Czech Republic as a reliable partner 
pointing to the political stability and its favorable economic 
development. He said that agreements on investment protection 
and on the prevention of double taxation and tax evasion would 
contribute to Czech-Colombian cooperation.

<F P=106> [Report by Arben Karapici] </F>
  [Text] [Announcer] The armed attack by the Greek military 
unit on the Albanian barracks in Peshkepi village have not only 
caused deep outrage in the country but also strong reactions 
from international organizations, high-level European officials, 
and the governments they represent. On the basis of these 
reactions, correspondent Arben Karapici prepared the following 
report: 
  [Karapici] The unprecedented act of official terrorism that 
Greece was finally able to exert against the national 
sovereignty of our country and the victims caused by the 
Hellenistic adventure of Sunday [10 April] do not seem to pass 
so easy in the international arena. 
  In a UN Security Council meeting on 12 April, President 
Colin 
Keating briefed the permanent council members on the letter from 
Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi. Reports from the UN Security 
Council Presidency state that none of the members had any 
objections, which has encouraged the observers to think that the 
Albanian protest will be the object of serious analysis. The 
meeting decided to follow the normal procedure, according to 
which the president gathers information from all sides, reports 
it to the council, and the latter decides on the president's 
report. 
  The representatives of the European Union troika, Germany 
and 
Belgium, energetically condemned the armed attack by the Greek 
military unit by fully supporting the protests by the Albanian 
Government and state to the international security 
organizations. The representatives of Germany and Belgium 
particularly warned of the danger that the event on the 
Albanian-Greek border presents, which, according to them, 
infringes not only upon Albania's stability but also that of the 
Balkans. 
  That is why Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock reacted 
toward the Hellenistic adventure with serious consequences for 
Albania and the Albanians. Mock harshly condemned the terrorist 
act by the Greek unit. The chief of Austrian diplomacy 
expressed Vienna's readiness to seriously consider the Greek 
armed attack. 
  On the other hand, the British Government pronounced that it 
strongly condemns all terrorist acts of this kind and other 
similar actions that, according to London, lead to the 
destabilization of the situation in the Balkans. The Major 
government commits itself to support all efforts by the Albanian 
Government's to continue to preserve stability and security in 
the Balkans. The British Government considers Albania's stance 
toward the Greek act of terror to be fair. 
  Meanwhile, the harsh protests of the Albanian Government and 
state were the subject of special consideration in the U.S. 
National Security Council and the Department of State in 
Washington. They informed our ambassador that the U.S. 
Government denounces this act, while Washington suggests 
dialogue between both sides so that the situation does not 
escalate any further. 
  Meanwhile, representatives of the French Foreign Ministry 
expressed their deep regret over Sunday's event and the victims. 
Paris considered as fully legitimate the Albanian Government's 
demand to the Greek Government that Athens find those 
responsible for the terrorist attack as soon as possible and 
convict them. The French Foreign Ministry considers the finding 
and conviction of the culprits as an important condition in 
normalizing Greek-Albanian relations. 
  Finally, it should be said that the official reactions of 
the 
chancelleries in Europe against the armed attack have been 
accompanied by comments and articles in the most powerful 
European newspapers. You will be acquainted with these comments 
in our future broadcasts.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (TANJUG)--The Bosnian Serb 
Republic (RS) has as of April 14 revoked the credentials and 
banned the movement in its territory of all American journalists 
and persons working with U.S. media . 
  The RS Information Ministry also informed foreign 
correspondents that it would no longer acknowledge press 
credentials and visas issued by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. 
  This measure follows two NATO air strikes of Serb positions 
near Gorazde but, as is stated by the Information Ministry, 
could have m been adopted much earlier because of the 
unobjective, warmongering and openly anti-Serb coverage of 
events in the RS by American journalists. 
  NATO-U.S. planes carried out air strikes Sunday and Monday 
against the positions of Bosnian Serbs near Gorazde, eastern 
Bosnia, which should have been demilitarized long ago as a 
protected area. Instead of being demilitarized more than 10,000 
Moslem troops concentrated in this area and surged at the end of 
March into a fierce offensive against Serb territories. 
  Following the strong counter-attack of the Serb forces when 
the Moslems were threatened with total defeat the U.N. got 
involved in the combat calling on NATO forces to carry out 
strikes on Serb positions to allegedly protect peacekeepers in 
Gorazde. 
  So far the American journalists were given equal treatment 
as 
the one reserved for journalists from other countries, the RS 
ministry statement says. 
  RS Information Minister Miroslav Toholj praised the decision 
of Yugoslav Information Minister Slobodan Ignjatovic Tuesday to 
revoke credentials of the journalists of AFP and CNN for 
spreading anti-Serb propaganda, the Bosnian Serb agency SRNA 
reported Thursday. 
  SRNA states that Toholj supports the decision because the 
war-mongers with journalist accreditations are responsible for 
the largest number of the victims of the war in former 
Yugoslavia, and also those who died as a result of the economic 
sanctions.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 14 (AFP) -- Serb troops surrounded 
French UN peacekeepers guarding an arms collection site Thursday 
[14 April] and threatened them in an attempt to reclaim heavy 
weapons, a UN spokesman said. 
  Serb soldiers and a tank confronted 30 French troops 
guarding 
weapons at Krivoglavci, northwest of Sarajevo, and demanded the 
weapons, said Eric Chaperon, a spokesman for the UN Protection 
Force. 
  The weapons were placed under UN control following a 
February 
9 accord between Bosnian Serbs and Moslems on a ceasefire and 
withdrawal of heavy weapons within a radius of 20 kilometres (12 
miles) from the capital Sarajevo. 
  The spokesman could not describe the nature of Serb threats 
but said the situation was tense. 
  A high-ranking UNPROFOR official telephoned the Bosnian Serb 
stronghold of Pale after the encirclement at 2:OO p.m. (1200 
GMT), and the Serb tank withdrew. Serb troops continued to 
surround the weapons site, the spokesman said. 
  Serb troops tried to seize heavy weapons from the 
Krivoglavci 
site on Tuesday but withdrew after receiving orders from their 
command post of Lukavica, contacted by UNPROFOR. 
  Following Sunday and Monday's NATO air strikes on Serb 
positions around the eastern Bosnia Moslem enclave of Gorazde, 
Serb troops have also placed mines around three weapons 
collection sites, blocking UN personnel guarding the sites, an 
UNPROFOR spokesman said Wednesday.

<F P=106> ["Selection of the most important parts of the Slovak </F>
Government Policy Statement and paraphrasing of some other 
chapters," prepared by the NARODNA OBRODA editorial team: 
"Calming Down Emotions, Setting the Economy in Motion"] 
  [Text] In an extensive introductory part of the 
Policy Statement, which will be discussed by the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic tomorrow, the government sums up 
the reasons that led the National Council to pass a vote of 
no-confidence in Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. These 
included, among others, the confrontational manner of political 
communication, lack of concept in economic policy, the 
politicizing of the economy, the delaying of transformation, and 
the deterioration of economic and social indicators. In the 
present, difficult situation, the government wants to seek 
optimal and pragmatic solutions to unpostponable problems. It 
intends to continue all the positive steps taken by the previous 
government. It regards as the most important tasks stabilizing 
the political, economic, social, and security situation, warding 
off the collapse in health care, education, culture, and the 
judiciary, and completing the drafting of conceptual documents 
and legislative norms. With regard to foreign relations, it 
wants to effectively defend the interests of Slovakia and tackle 
existing problems in a professional way. 
<H5>  Risks of the Starting Position of the Economy </H5>
  In 1993, the first year of the existence of the independent 
Slovak Republic, the development of the economy deteriorated 
once again, particularly in the first half of the year. This 
was caused by the previous government's lack of concept in 
preparing the independent existence of the Slovak economy, gross 
shortcomings in its economic policy, and the slowing down of the 
transformation process and privatization, in particular. 
  This found expression in another decline of real GDP by 4.1 
percent, in a decline of industrial production by 13.5 percent, 
and in a drop of construction output by almost one-fourth. 
  The conditions of internal and external balance 
substantially deteriorated compared with 1992. The deficit of 
the state budget, which increased to 23 billion Slovak korunas 
[Sk] (6.8 percent of GDP), not only contributed to further price 
growth but, by siphoning off credit resources, also had an 
extremely adverse influence on the development of the 
entrepreneurial sphere. The increase in the budget deficit 
was accounted for, apart from the decline in GDP, also by 
shortcomings in preparing the introduction of the new system of 
taxation and insurance. In spite of the Sk's devaluation, 
exports declined sharply (11.5 percent compared with 1992), 
while imports grew at a relatively rapid pace (15.4 percent), 
which resulted in a Sk26.7 billion deficit in the foreign trade 
balance. 
  At the same time, the clearing account registering trade 
with 
the Czech Republic showed a deficit of Sk5.8 billion, which, 
while representing an extraordinary boost to budget revenues in 
1993, aggravated, on the other hand, the starting position for 
budget management in 1994. 
  The starting position of the state budget for 1994 is 
also made worse by the unresolved liabilities of public sector 
branches -- health care, transportation, education, and others 
-- which were not included in the 1993 state budget deficit. 
These represent an additional burden of more than Sk6 billion 
for the 1994 budget. 
  As a result of deficit financing, which assumed unrestrained 
dimensions toward the end of 1993, the net debt indebtedness of 
the government sector rose to Sk60.0 billion. This 
substantially increased the debt servicing burden for the state 
budget in 1994 and the subsequent years. 
  The price level went up 23.2 percent in 1993, more than 
double the 1992 price growth. 
  The unfavorable development of the Slovak economy in the 
years 1992 and 1993 also found expression in growing 
unemployment and in the social situation of the population. By 
the end of 1993 the rate of unemployment increased to 14.4 
percent. 
  The preceding government did not take resolute steps to 
stabilize the conditions for the development of the 
entrepreneurial sphere and in support of its development. This 
was reflected in another increase in the number of companies 
operating at a loss, the proportion of which reached 57.5 
percent by the end of 1993, with their aggregate loss amounting 
to Sk42.5 billion. This further aggravated companies' inability 
to pay their bills and acted as a brake on monetary flows. 
  Our predecessors are accountable for the -- by 
international standards -- low inflow of foreign investments, 
primarily because they failed to ensure essential political and 
economic stability and because the government's low credibility 
deterred foreign investors. This is reflected in the fact that 
the overall volume of foreign investments reached only Sk10.8 
billion by the end of 1993, which was Sk4.2 billion more than at 
the end of 1992, but, when Czech investors' capital is 
subtracted, the increase represented only Sk3 billion. The 
inflow of foreign capital had a declining tendency in the course 
of 1993. 
<H5>  Economic Intentions and Targets </H5>
  In contrast to the preceding government's program, our 
program proceeds from the longer-term aims of the Slovak 
economy's development. On this basis, during our term of 
office we want to lay the foundations for new dynamizing 
[dynamizujici] elements, regardless of the fact that their 
effects will make themselves felt only later. 
  The government's unequivocal intention is to speed up the 
embarked-upon process of transforming the economy and ownership 
relations, in particular. We will set the process of 
privatization in motion again, with respect to which we will 
return to the tried-and-tested method of coupon privatization, 
which had in the past won citizens' trust. We regard successful 
transformation as the prerequisite for the development of a 
modern and efficient economy that will enable the Slovak 
Republic to join the league of economically advanced countries 
and to raise the living standards of the population. We 
pledge to retain the social tolerability of transformation. We 
will conduct social dialogue to achieve generally acceptable 
solutions in the interest of maintaining social peace. We will 
devote particular attention to the socially weakest strata of 
the population. 
  The government realizes that at the root of the development 
of society lie the initiative and responsibility of every 
individual and every economic and non-economic organization. 
The government's task is to act as the catalyst of this 
initiative. 
<H5>  Points of Departure of Macroeconomic Policy </H5>
  The government considers macroeconomic stability to be one 
of 
the basic features determining the development of the Slovak 
Republic's economy. The attainment of this stability is 
conditional on the implementation of prudent budget, tax, wage, 
price, subsidies, and customs policies. This means 
drawing as close as possible in 1994 to zero-growth of GDP, 
maintaining price growth in the range of 10 to 13 percent, 
keeping unemployment under the 17 percent limit, and meeting the 
commitment [not further specified, referring possibly to the 
commitment to keep budget deficit under 4 percent of GDP as 
recommended by the IMF]) in budget management. 
  In budget policy, the government will focus on closing the 
unfavorable budget management for 1993 and the preceding years. 
It will have to resolve the high deficit of the state 
budget for 1993 bequeathed to it by the previous government. 
  To prevent the situation of 1993 from recurring, the 
government will focus in 1994 on securing revenues for the state 
budget. It will implement measures to mobilize budget 
resources and, in strictly defined cases, reduce budget 
expenditures and will strive, in general, to bring about order 
in finances. It will adopt measures to prevent tax evasion, 
reduce outstanding tax arrears, unblock claims abroad, and 
address the issue of debts stemming from the pre-1993 
period. 
  We will establish conditions for a more extensive 
utilization 
of the financing of development targets from foreign resources. 
At the same time we want to make transparent the existing 
system of obtaining foreign credits and assessing their 
effectiveness. We will therefore tighten the criteria governing 
the assumption of liabilities vis-a-vis foreign partners. We 
consider it essential that every credit taken abroad should 
establish prerequisites for its repayment and strengthen the 
economic position of the Slovak Republic. 
<H5>  Macroeconomic Policy </H5>
  The government will adjust macroeconomic policy with a view 
to attaining its macroeconomic targets. Without bringing about 
a fundamental turnabout in the company sphere, we will not only 
fail to achieve the set macroeconomic targets but the 
unfavorable tendencies will continue to intensify. The 
government's attention will center on speeding up the 
commercialization [komercionalizacia] and transformation of 
state enterprises in terms of ownership in order to finally 
resolve the institutional vacuum, in which companies have 
found themselves in the last four years and to shorten the 
intolerably long pre-privatization agony of companies. With 
respect to commercialized state enterprises, the government will 
make use of the motivating function of managerial contracts and 
will limit its interference to rigid financial control. 
  By its economic policy the government will establish 
prerequisites for eliminating the causes of the intolerable 
growth of company indebtedness and will take specific steps in 
the legislative sphere, and to secure the course of court 
proceedings in commercial matters and bankruptcy proceedings, 
which will help speed up the financial restructuring of 
companies. It will speed up negotiations on obtaining a loan 
for restructuring the company and banking sphere (EFSAL) 
[expanison unknown]. 
  We will orient our efforts also toward improving the 
competitive environment and finalizing the system, and 
intensifying the activity, of institutions charged with 
promoting the development of businesses, such as the National 
Agency for the Support and Development of Small and Medium-Sized 
Businesses, consultancy centers, Slovenska Zarucna Banka [Slovak 
Guarantee Bank], and the like. In this process we will 
cooperate with entrepreneurs's associations and with the Slovak 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  We regard a strong private sector, operating on the 
basis of market principles and private ownership, as the source 
of Slovak economic prosperity. Therefore, we want to 
expeditiously eliminate obstacles and restrictions to the 
development of the private sector in the legislative and 
administrative spheres and help tackle the financial 
prerequisites for the further development of private 
entrepreneurial activities. 
  We will support private activities even in those sectors of 
public services that have until now been the exclusive domain of 
the state. 
  Foreign investment, which should help eliminate the acute 
shortage of capital, will represent one of the dynamizing 
elements of the economy. We want to create a stable and 
favorable entrepreneurial environment that will be attractive 
also for foreign investors and take specific steps to facilitate 
their becoming involved in the economy of the Slovak Republic. 
We will establish conditions to substantially improve and 
increase the flow of information to foreign investors and will 
give support to those, whose entry will accelerate the 
development of the economy. 
<H5>  Privatization </H5>
  One of the most serious causes of the intensification of 
negative tendencies in the development of the economy was the 
slowing down, and virtual halting, of privatization. Lack of 
concept compounded by lack of transparency and exceptionally 
hasty privatization in the closing days of the previous 
government's term of office have brought about loss of 
confidence [in privatization] among citizens. We consider it 
our priority to restore the confidence of citizens and foreign 
investors alike in the process of privatization in Slovakia. In 
this spirit we are taking measures to speed up the privatization 
process in such a way that, by the time the second wave of 
coupon privatization is concluded, more than one-half of all 
property in state ownership should get into private hands. At 
the same time we will establish conditions for effective control 
of privatization by the public. 
  The government will secure the equality of 
privatization methods and the equality of participants in 
privatization. It will consistently attend to making 
privatization transparent and will prevent political 
deformations of this process. In contrast to the preceding 
government, which considered coupon privatization a residual 
method and was deferring its preparation, this government will 
approach it as an equal method and, within the 
framework of its mandate, will also secure the commencement of 
the second wave of coupon privatization. 
  We will speed up the realization of already prepared and 
undisputed privatization projects by means of standard methods. 
We will offer certain enterprises, or their parts, to domestic 
and foreign interested parties who will demonstrate their 
credibility and will submit the most interesting projects, 
interesting not only in financial terms but also from the 
viewpoint of entrepreneurial plans. 
<H5>  Sectoral Policy </H5>
<H5>  Industry, Construction, Trade, and Tourism </H5>
  The government's priority in industry will be, above all, 
raising the ability of Slovak products to compete. We consider 
support for the restructuring and revitalization of industrial 
companies to be the foundation of sectoral policy. We 
will speed up the privatization of arms companies, which was 
kept being delayed thus far, while at the same time securing the 
state's adequate participation so as to be able to preserve the 
strategic interests of defense and security. 
  In the sphere of energy, the government will draw 
up a proposal for the organization, restructuring, and gradual 
privatization of enterprises that are now in state ownership, 
providing for well-considered participation by foreign capital. 
Based on foreign experience, the government will proceed 
particularly circumspectly in the process of transforming and 
privatizing the energy sector in order to preserve the state's 
energy sufficiency. It will prepare regulatory measures to 
prevent unwarranted price increases in this sector. 
  Our main target in the construction industry, apart from 
giving support to small entrepreneurs, will be to establish 
conditions for the utilization of our large-scale capacities to 
build transport infrastructure and complete unfinished 
apartments and energy projects. We will take the necessary 
steps to make possible the export of construction capacities. 
We will speed up negotiations on the completion of the Mochovce 
nuclear power plant. 
  The preceding government did not make use of the dynamizing 
potentials of tourism for the development of the 
Slovak economy. In contrast to the preceding government, we will 
focus on the development of tourism with a view of increasing 
its share in the generation of new jobs, revitalizing individual 
regions, and increasing foreign exchange earnings. 
  We will speed up the privatization of companies engaged in 
tourism, will prepare the institutional framework for tourism 
promotion and a law on tourism, will intensify the promotion of 
Slovakia, and the like. 
<H5>  Transport, Communications, and Public Works </H5>
  In the sector of transport and communications, we will 
replace by pragmatic solutions the previous practice of 
unsuitable interventions and statements, which brought about 
stagnation in those areas and met with unfavorable response 
abroad. 
  The government will draw up and submit to parliament for 
discussion, still during its term of office, a draft amendment 
to the Law on Railroads, a Bill on the Health Insurance of 
Railroad Employees and the Railroad Employees' Health Insurance 
Company, a Bill on Road Transportation, as well as a Bill on 
Telecommunications. 
  It will follow up on all legislative and preparatory work 
and 
all studies and blueprints aimed at the development of 
infrastructure in transportation, postal services and 
communications, and the institution of public works and will 
secure a more distinct progress of all those projects. 
  The need to take care of the citizens' housing 
situation was not fully appreciated in the preceding period. We 
will draw up, and will begin to implement, our own concept of 
housing policy, including the completion of unfinished 
apartments and infrastructure and amenities. We will 
initiate and speed up the launching of privatization of the 
housing stock and an increase of investments in the housing 
economy. We will clarify the legal framework regarding 
expropriation for projects in public interest. 
<H5>  Agriculture </H5>
  In agriculture, the government will orient its activities 
toward meeting the basic strategic targets adopted by the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic. We consider 
agriculture to be one of our priorities. Establishing 
prerequisites for stabilizing agriculture, halting a further 
production decline, securing continuity of agricultural 
production, and ensuring conditions for its qualitative growth 
remain the primary tasks. We want to clarify the 
arrangement of property relations and claims in agricultural 
cooperatives, speed up the transformation of proprietary 
relations with regard to soil, particularly the 
privatization of state farms, and establish conditions for 
agricultural enterprises' faster adaptation to the new 
conditions. 
  Following up on the transformation of proprietary relations, 
we are planning a new organizational arrangement of the forest 
economy. The implementation of the program of remedial 
measures in forests damaged by pollutants will continue by 
drawing on domestic as well as foreign financial resources. 
<H5>  Development of the Financial Sector </H5>
  The government is interested in the formation of a 
competitive commercial banking sector. In the endeavor to 
contribute to this process, we will support measures designed to 
continue the privatization of banks, improve the banks' 
portfolio, and reinforce the banks' capital stock, including 
reinforcement from outside capital resources. One of the aims 
of this support is to significantly raise the level of Slovak 
banks' international acceptance and to integrate them into the 
international banking system as fully fledged members. 
  We will also devote attention to the expansion of 
insurance services mitigating entrepreneurial risks, 
particularly to insuring export credits. We will also give 
consideration to a system of insuring citizens' bank 
deposits and to the formation of credit cooperatives. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Policy </H5>
  Some areas of foreign economic policy remained unresolved in 
the preceding period. Essential measures designed to 
protect the market in the transitional period, as well as 
exceptionally needed export-promoting measures, kept being 
delayed, which caused a further intensification of external 
disequilibrium and economic decline. 
  We will therefore strive, above all, to give finishing 
touches to export-promoting policy and to implement it 
across-the-board in order support the export potentials of 
Slovak companies. In justified cases we will also secure an 
adequate protection of the internal market. 

<H5>    Ecology and Economic Policy </H5>
  In this chapter the government expresses its intentions to 
separate the protection of natural resources from their 
utilization, to distribute resources from the State 
Environmental Fund not only from the viewpoint of the priorities 
of individual districts but Slovakia as a whole, to consolidate 
the Slovak Environmental Agency, and to complete legislation 
related to the environment. 
<H5>  Social Sphere </H5>
  The rate of unemployment reached almost 14.8 percent in 
February 1994, which represents almost 380,000 unemployed 
registered with labor offices. In February 1994 the rate of 
unemployment exceeded 20 percent in 14 districts, with the 
district of Rimavska Sobota reporting a rate of unemployment of 
26.7 percent. The growth of long-term unemployment (the average 
period of registration represented 229 days at the end of 1993), 
as well as the fact that, by the end of 1993, the category of 
young people under 25 represented almost one-third of all 
unemployed, must be regarded as a particularly negative 
phenomenon. 
  Apart from the growth of unemployment, the 
deterioration of the social situation and the living conditions 
of the population in 1993 was also caused by another increase in 
the cost of living, which went up 22.8 percent compared with the 
preceding year, and by a 2.6 percent decline of real 
earnings. Single-parent families, families with several 
children, and pensioners are the worst off. The proportion of 
households with children whose income in 1993 was lower than 1.5 
times the subsistence minimum reached 61.9 percent, with 15.2 
percent of households with children finding themselves below the 
subsistence level. The unfavorable social situation of citizens 
was tackled by means of the provision of welfare payments. A 
total of 239,000 recipients of these payments were registered in 
1993, more than 140,000 of whom were long-term unemployed. 
Welfare payments were collected by 8.6 percent of households 
with dependent children. 
  From the viewpoint of the situation in the sphere of 
employment, the government will reassess, on the basis of a 
thorough analysis of the labor market, the instruments of active 
employment policy, while respecting the demand that financial 
resources be spent rationally and effectively and while 
respecting the situation on regional labor markets. It will 
place particular emphasis on active employment 
policy, on reassessing the provision of material benefits 
also from the viewpoint of the gradual transfer of this care to 
the insurance system, as well as on expanding the 
possibilities for our citizens to assert themselves in the work 
process, and protecting the labor market, by means of 
bilateral contracts with other states. 
  The transformation of the existing systems of pension 
schemes, health insurance, state social payments, and welfare 
payments into systems of social insurance, state social support, 
and social assistance remains the government's basic conceptual 
intention in the sphere of social security. 
  From the viewpoint of topical tasks in the sphere of social 
security, we consider it necessary: 
  -- to tackle the issue of child allowances as the key form 
of 
state transfer payments for families with children, 
  -- to analyze the functionality of the National Insurance 
Company, 
  -- to create legislative foundations for a system of 
supplementary pension insurance, 
  -- to continue to gradually create conditions for humanizing 
the care of physically and mentally severely disabled persons 
and elderly citizens, with particular emphasis on the actual 
guarantee of their rights, 
  -- and to gradually establish conditions for the activity of 
non- state entities in the social sphere. 
<H5>  Health Care </H5>
  The present unfavorable situation in health care results 
from 
the disrupted continuity of the 1992 health care reform and from 
the introduction of some incorrect systemic steps, compounded by 
a drastic cut in financial resources. 
  As of 31 December 1993 health care establishments 
reported unpaid bills of Sk1.8 billion, of which bills for 
medical drugs account for Sk1.2 billion. The remainder is made 
up of bills for energy, fuel, and food supplies and 
reconstruction and modernization projects. 
  Health care has found itself in a critical financial 
situation, as a consequence of which one can also speak about a 
high level of hidden indebtedness (which is estimated at Sk50 
billion). 
  In 1992, 17.1 billion Czechoslovak korunas were spent on the 
operation of health care facilities, in 1993 Sk16.2 billion, 
and, disregarding inflation and the introduction of systemic 
measures, the use of only Sk14.2 billion was projected for 1994. 
  The government's main aim in the sphere of health care will 
be to deal with the financial crisis, which directly threatens 
the provision of health care and slows down the transformation 
process. The following measures are inevitable to ward off an 
imminent collapse: 
  -- to quantify and specify the justified demands of health 
care on the state budget for 1993 and determine the method of 
settling the liabilities of health care facilities, 
  -- to find ways of alleviating the budget deficit in health 
care for 1994, 
  -- to carry out changes in the existing system of payments 
for health services. 
  In the sphere of financing health care and health insurance, 
the government will strive to establish conditions to 
financially secure the provision of basic health care, support 
the development of the Health Insurance Fund, and secure its 
independent operation. 
  The system of assessing the value of health services 
introduced as of 1 October 1993 will have to be replaced by a 
new solution that will be more effective, simpler, less 
demanding administratively, and less costly. The new system 
will have to be prepared in a differentiated way, separately for 
individual types of health care providers. 
  We will continue to privatize health care facilities, 
using publicly controllable criteria. In the course of April we 
will ensure the drafting and publication of conditions for the 
privatization of pharmacies and health spas. Changes in 
ownership must not jeopardize the therapeutic functions of 
natural springs spas. A majority participation by the 
state in the privatization of key spa facilities is 
foreseen. By the end of June 1994 we will prepare 
documents for the privatization of primary health care 
establishments. 
  In connection with the implementation of essential changes 
to 
the existing system of payments for health services, the 
government will establish conditions for a solution to the wage 
conditions of health care employees. 
<H5>  School System, Education, and Science </H5>
  High educational and cultural standards of the population 
represent the basic source of a state's wealth. Advanced 
countries pursue the strategy of growth of investments into the 
sphere of education and science. In defiance of this worldwide 
trend, both the conceptual and the everyday issues concerning 
the development of education, science, and research have been 
neglected in our country of late. 
  The budget of the department of education and science has 
been cut by Sk2.795 billion over the last two years. The 
already low budget for 1994 is further reduced by a debt of 
Sk298 million stemming from the year 1993. The situation 
is so grave that, if education retained all its functions at the 
level of 1993, the budget resources allocated for education and 
science would be exhausted in the 9th month of 1994, even if the 
price level remained constant. The situation is compounded 
by the fact that no legal norms have been drawn up and 
introduced into practice that would make it possible to 
introduce progressive forms of management into schools and 
educational establishments. 
  As a result of the grim situation in the sphere of education 
and science, which is documented, for example, by the breakup of 
kindergartens, school catering, and school accommodation, the 
government will pay particular heed to ensuring a calm 
completion of the 1993/94 school year and preparation of the new 
1994/95 school year. 
  For this reason we consider it unavoidable to write off 
the 1993 debts of schools and educational establishments, to 
adequately amend the state budget for education and science for 
1994, and to reassess the existing structure of revenues and 
expenditures in the department of education. We will 
explore additional sources of revenue at home and abroad. 
  The government regards as one of the decisive tasks the 
formulation of the republic's strategic interests in the sphere 
of education and training and the commencement of work on 
drafting the National Program of Education and 
Training. 
  The government will ensure the drafting of the Concept 
of Developing University Education in the Slovak Republic Until 
the Year 2010 and the transformation of the existing system 
into a system that will flexibly react to the needs of the labor 
market and will be compatible with the system of education in 
the countries of the European Union. Based on experience from 
the implementation of the law on higher educational 
establishments, the government will establish prerequisite for 
the drafting of a new law or for amending the existing law. 
  We want to consistently support the development of science 
and technology in the directions designated as priorities as an 
important prerequisite of economic, social, and cultural growth 
under the conditions of an unfolding market economy. We 
will submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for 
adoption a law on state support for science and technology. 
We will propose the establishment of the Slovak Republic State 
Fund for Science and Technology as well as an independent Slovak 
Republic Grant Agency for Science and Technology, which should 
help preserve and develop the intellectual base of the state and 
prevent academics and researchers from leaving universities and 
research institutes. The government will also ensure a regular 
and consistent process of mutual recognition [akreditacia] of 
universities and the research and development base. 
  Based on a realistic assessment of the present situation in, 
and standard of, physical education and sports, we want to 
establish the necessary institutional, legislative, and economic 
conditions for the development of physical education and sports, 
with emphasis on financing them from central sources through the 
medium of the State Physical Education Fund. By giving 
support to top-performance sports, we will contribute to the 
successful representation of the Slovak Republic in sports. 
  For the needs of public administration and division of 
powers 
between state administration and self-administrative bodies, the 
government will draft an optimal variant of management and 
administration of primary and secondary schools, providing for 
the gradual transfer of some of the powers of central bodies of 
state administration to local state administration and 
self-administrative bodies. 
<H5>  Culture </H5>
  The government will draft a basic concept of 
long-term strategy for developing culture under the conditions 
of the transformation of the economic and social system. 
It will also prepare a basic model of the organizational 
arrangement and financing of culture, a model that will ensure 
functional ties in the emerging market environment. 
  The government's basic aim is to establish legislative 
prerequisites for the transition from the central financing of 
culture toward providing incentives, and introducing 
preferences, for investments in this sphere. At the same time, 
it is necessary to retain the possibility of supporting 
directly, by means of the state-run PRO SLOVAKIA [capitalization 
as published] fund, those areas of culture, in which the market 
instruments do not assert themselves. We will support the 
drafting of an analysis of the functioning of this fund, with 
emphasis on the attainment of the expected targets and its 
position. [sentence as published] 
  We will continue our efforts to finalize the legislative, 
political, and social scope for the functioning of media at the 
level of the European standard. The law on the mass media, now 
in preparation, and the law on economic support for the 
periodical press will lay the groundwork for this. 
  Complicated problems arise from the failure to approve the 
license for the second channel of Slovak Television. This issue 
will have to be resolved as soon as possible. 
<H5>  Ethnic Policy </H5>
  We would like to achieve social consensus that will 
guarantee 
the stability and peaceful coexistence of all citizens of the 
Slovak Republic, regardless of nationality and the color of 
their skin. A prerequisite for this necessary consensus is the 
mutuality of rights and duties, combined with the civic 
principle. The government is prepared to provide all necessary 
guarantees of rights to persons belonging to ethnic minorities. 
On the other hand, it expects the fulfillment of constitutional 
civic duties, which is an important prerequisite for ruling out 
instances of ultra-nationalism, irredentism, and separatism. 
  Instead of confrontation, we will introduce the mechanism of 
permanent dialogue as a method that promotes cooperation and 
seeks consensus in generating and exercising rights of citizens 
belonging to ethnic minorities. 
<H5>  State, Democracy, Law, and Public Order </H5>
  In this extensive chapter the government pledges to continue 
to devolve powers to the community self-administration bodies. 
It will explore the possibilities of introducing the 
institution of the ombudsman. It will strive to eliminate 
shortcomings in state administration resulting from 
procrastination, incompetence, and the like. It will continue 
to implement the concept of stabilizing the judiciary and the 
long-term program of combating crime, particularly organized 
crime and the legalization of income originating from organized 
crime. 

<H5>    Aims and Tasks in Legislation </H5>
  In this chapter the government undertakes to speed up the 
adoption of legislative norms compatible with laws of the 
European Union. It is determined to pass in the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic a law on the conflict of 
interests in the performance of duties, pertaining to 
constitutional officials and higher-level state administration 
officials. It will prepare a law on the obligation to prove the 
origin of financial resources used in privatization. The 
government wants to improve the legislative conditions for the 
functioning of the entrepreneurial and non-profit spheres. 
<H5>  Security and Defense of the State </H5>
  In this chapter the government undertakes to finalize 
conceptual documents pertaining to the Slovak Republic's 
security and defense policy and to submit to the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic a document specifying cooperation 
with NATO. It wants to get ahead with the transformation of the 
army and make a more efficient use of resources. 
<H5>  Foreign Policy </H5>
  The basic principles of foreign policy, approved by the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic when the Slovak Republic 
was founded, do not change with a change in government. The 
present government wants to build on the results achieved 
heretofore, even though it has its own ideas about 
non-confrontational methods and about creating a more positive 
image of Slovakia abroad.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Washington, April 14 (TANJUG) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton has written to leaders of Congress that the United 
States is prepared to respond to U.N. and NATO calls for action 
against Bosnian Serbs in the future as well. 
  Reporting on U.S.-spearheaded NATO raids on Bosnian Serb 
positions around the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde 
on Sunday and Monday, Clinton said that the operation had been 
aimed at protecting international peacekeepers deployed in 
Bosnia's "safe areas". 
  Gorazde, as a U.N.-designated "safe area," should have been 
demilitarized last spring, but has instead been used by the 
Moslems, who have concentrated 10,000 troops there, to launch a 
powerful offensive against the Serbs. 
  When a Serb counter-offensive threatened to crush the Moslem 
onslaught, NATO fighter jets were called in to raid Bosnian Serb 
positions, openly taking the side of the Moslems. 
  "It is not now possible to determine the duration of this 
operation," Clinton said, in what U.S. observers regard as being 
meant to prepare congress and the public for a wider U.S. action 
on the side of the Moslems in Bosnia. 
  Meanwhile, Bosnian Moslem Vice-President Ejup Ganic has 
arrived on a three-day visit to Washington, to put renewed 
pressure on the U.S. Administration to supply military equipment 
and exempt the Moslems from an arms sales embargo which is in 
force against all of former Yugoslavia. 
  Moslem ambassador to the United Nations Muhamed Sacirbej 
said 
on Wednesday that the Moslems would not agree to the ceasefire 
offered by the Serbs on the weekend unless the Serbs around 
Gorazde withdrew to the lines they held on March 30. 
  Sacirbej refuted the statement by U.N. commander in Bosnia- 
Herzegovina General Sir Michael Rose that the Moslems on Tuesday 
attacked Bosnian Serb positions at Gorazde unprovoked, although 
the statement has been confirmed by ranking U.N. officials. 
  In a plucky effort at deceit, Sacirbej said that under U.N. 
Security Council Resolution 836, Moslems have the right to 
defend the "safe areas" at arms. 
  However, the Moslem action is hardly consistent with the 
claim of defence, since they have launched another infantry 
attack from Gorazde on Serb positions, supported by the 
artillery situated in Gorazde town proper.

  [Text] On the morning of 11 April, quoting a communique 
issued at Versoix [former Romanian King Mihai's residence], the 
BBC announced that Mihai I of Hohenzollern and his wife had 
submitted their passports to the Romanian Embassy in Bern to 
obtain an entry visa for their return to Romania to spend the 
Holy Easter Holidays in Timisoara. No other details have been 
provided. 
  The Romanian Embassy in Bern officially confirmed that the 
British passports were submitted on 8 April and mentioned that 
additional instructions from the Romanian Foreign Ministry in 
Bucharest have been requested. The Romanian foreign minister's 
office said that a diplomatic courier is expected to arrive; 
after that officials will be able to examine the precise nature 
of the passports in question. 
  Likewise, the same office noted that additional detail might 
be requested regarding the nature of this visit; namely, whether 
this is a private visit or another type of visit, whether Mihai 
I of Hohenzollern recognizes the Constitution of Romania, and 
other such details. 
  It is noteworthy that the church and local authorities in 
Timisoara reminded the central leadership that some time ago 
they sent an invitation to Mihai I and his wife Ana to visit 
this town because, among other things, Mihai I is also the 
founder of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Timisoara.

<F P=106> [Article by Adrian Ursu: "The Prime Minister Approves of </F>
the Idea of Dismissing Ioan Oancea"] 
  [Text] On the evening of 6 April, during the meeting of 
the Standing Bureau of the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], 
several members of this leading body insistently asked the 
leaders of the party to do all they can to have PUNR Deputy 
Valeriu Tabara appointed to the position of minister of 
agriculture. Answering this request, a PUNR delegation led by 
Ioan Gavra [vice president of the PUNR and of the Chamber of 
Deputies] met yesterday morning with Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu, whom the members of the delegation asked to order the 
dismissal of current Agriculture Minister Ioan Oancea as soon as 
possible. The PUNR's reasons for this request were the data and 
conclusions of the report of the anticorruption commission and 
other indications that the PUNR got hold of in various ways. 
According to Gavra's declarations, the prime minister allegedly 
accepted the accusations formulated by the PUNR as justified. 
The two sides that participated in yesterday's dialogue agreed 
that Oancea's dismissal would be opportune even before the 
report on actions of corruption would be discussed in the 
plenary meeting of the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament. 
  The participants in the meeting of the PUNR Standing Bureau 
also told us that during the Wednesday evening meeting, the 
participants proposed that Senator Viorel Salagean should be 
appointed as leader of the group in charge of reorganizing the 
Bucharest branch of the party. Considering that he declined 
this mission, Cornel Brahas received the respective task. 
Through this appointment -- which might also imply his 
appointment to the position of president of the Bucharest branch 
of the party -- the PUNR leaders wished to contradict rumors 
regarding Brahas' so-called dissidence.

  [Text] Commenting on the proposed amendments to the Small 
Constitution which would limit his powers, President Lech Walesa 
said that he would have to ask for greater control over what 
Sejm deputies are doing. 
  Lech Walesa, who is in Litomysl, said that he does not 
believe that the coalition has serious thoughts about limiting 
presidential rights, but if it makes such an attempt then it 
will bear the consequences. 
  Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski stated that if 
amendments to the Constitution were passed in the Sejm, the 
president would then have to defend the Constitution. 
  A group of Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] deputies who tabled the bill with these 
amendments want the Sejm to have the power to appoint 
ministerial candidates put forward by the prime minister, should 
the president refuse to sign such a nomination. According to 
the bill, the dissolved Sejm would end its term of office only 
on the day of the first sitting of a newly elected parliament. 
The coalition needs a two-thirds majority in the Sejm to pass 
the amendments to the Constitution. To achieve such a majority, 
the SLD and PSL deputies require a dozen or so votes more.

  [Text] Warsaw, 16 Apr -- Today, after his return to Poland 
from the informal summit of the presidents of the Central 
European countries in Litomysl, President Lech Walesa announced 
that he would dissolve parliament if the government coalition 
were to attempt to curb or change his constitutional 
prerogatives. 
  "Let me remind you, the president is guardian of the 
Constitution and if there are matters or changes that are 
necessary, I will support them. However, not every time and not 
all changes -- I will not allow such changes. One must not do 
it at this moment -- I cannot allow this to happen in the 
interest of democracy and in the interest of the role of 
president of the country," the president said. 
  Asked about what excuse he would use to dissolve parliament, 
the president replied: "The same excuse that is being used to 
amend the Constitution. This decision is final. If there is a 
change in the Constitution, if someone dares to do it in this 
manner, he should not kid himself -- I will face the State 
Tribunal but parliament will be dissolved," Lech Walesa said. 
  Commenting on his meeting with the presidents of Austria, 
the 
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Hungary in Litomysl, 
Lech Walesa said that regional cooperation was necessary and 
that it was an outcome of the changes that had taken place in 
Central Europe. He said that such cooperation should be 
discussed and that this will bring results.

  [Text] Warsaw, 17 Apr -- After the return of the 
parliamentarian delegation from Japan on Sunday, Sejm Speaker 
Jozef Oleksy told journalists that he saw no legal possibility 
for the dissolution of parliament by the president. 
  Oleksy described the president's threat to dissolve 
parliament as "harmful" and added that this might cause an 
increase of tension in relations between the coalition and the 
president. Oleksy described the deputies' initiative to 
introduce amendments to the Small Constitution and to limit the 
president's competences as a normal legislative initiative to 
which you should not react by sulking but by having talks about 
it. 
  "I invariably call on the president and the coalition to 
have 
talks," Oleksy said and stressed that as a result of 
divergencies between the government and the president the image 
of Poland on the international arena could be damaged.

<F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Deputies' Initiative Causes a </F>
Coalition-Belvedere War; Constitutional Blackmail"] 
  [Text] After the statement was issued that the deputies of 
the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] want to amend the Small Constitution, Lech Walesa stated 
that if the coalition attempted to restrict his powers, he would 
dissolve the Sejm "in the interest of the role of the president 
which he must fulfill in the state." He stressed that he would 
do this even if he were to be brought before the State Tribunal. 
  Since the information that 16 PSL and SLD deputies proposed 
amendments on 15 April to the Small Constitution (the 
possibility of rejecting a presidential veto in personnel issues 
and prolonging the period of the Sejm's functioning from the 
moment it is dissolved until a new parliament begins working) 
was released, the politicians of the coalition have been saying 
that they do not want a war with the Belvedere. Such statements 
were made both by Jozef Oleksy, who said that meetings and talks 
should be held, and Michal Strak, who commented on this issue as 
the only PSL politician ("The coalition did not and does not 
want a war with the president"). They also recall that for the 
time being it is only an initiative launched by a group of 
deputies and within a week the clubs will take a stance on it. 
Speaker Oleksy said that the amendment bill might be discussed 
by the Sejm at the beginning of May at the soonest. Some (Marek 
Borowski, for instance) believe that it is the president, not 
the coalition, that is heading for a conflict, and they point to 
the fact that it is because of him that the government has not 
had a deputy prime minister and finance minister for a few 
months now. 
  The coalition representatives recall that Lech Walesa 
himself 
started speaking about changes in the Small Constitution -- he 
discussed changing the status of the National Security Council 
and of the Constitutional Tribunal. They also claim (Jozef 
Oleksy and Michal Strak, for instance) that they do not want to 
restrict the president's powers, because he still may or may not 
sign nominations. A novelty would be only the possibility of 
rejecting this veto in a parliamentary ballot, which would 
eliminate a situation in which "a paralysis of the political 
system is a fact." (Jerzy Jaskiernia) 
  In a television program "Minor Skirmishes" on Sunday, 
Aleksander Kwasniewski said that in a dispute between the 
president and the prime minister the Sejm should fulfill the 
role of an arbiter. Lech Falandysz pointed out, however, that 
it would be a judge in its own case because the Sejm is 
dominated by the coalition which has formed this government; he 
stated in addition that the next step of the coalition would be 
nominating its own ministers in the presidential ministries. 
Kwasniewski said that these suspicions were too great. He also 
stated that the coalition would collect two-thirds of votes 
necessary to pass amendments to the Constitution. 
  Coalition politicians (M. Strak, Z.Siemiatkowski, A. 
Kwasniewski) are not concealing the fact that the direct reason 
for the deputies' initiative is the deadlock that developed 
after Lech Walesa rejected the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. 
  The president cannot dissolve the Sejm because the deputies 
want to amend the Small Constitution, claim SLD politicians. 
The same opinions are voiced by Constitutional Professors Piotr 
Winczorek and Stanislaw Gebethner; they recall that the Sejm has 
established the government and passed the budget; therefore, 
there is no reason why it should be dissolved. 
  It is not clear what the behavior of the other deputies' 
clubs would be if there were a ballot on the amendments to the 
Small Constitution. The opinions of politicians of the Labor 
Union and the Democratic Union [UD] are not unequivocal. Even 
though Ryszard Bugaj believes that the president's powers should 
be thought over, he is against any changes in the Constitution 
only because the coalition is going through problems. His party 
colleague Janusz Szymanski is of the opinion that amending the 
Constitution is a necessary step because when the Small 
Constitution was being drafted, the authors counted on 
activities in good faith and in conformity with the law, which 
is not always the case. 
  Tadeusz Mazowiecki of UD believes that the proposal on 
amending the Constitution (which the parliament is entitled to 
do) should not be a reason to threaten to dissolve it; however, 
according to Jan Litynski (UD) the war with the president was 
started by the coalition -- when it tried to restrict his 
powers. UD will not take part in this dispute.

<F P=106> [Article by Robert Krasowski under the "Analysis" rubric: </F>
"Pawlak To Wage a War Against Walesa?"] 
  [Text] The coalition's decision means waging a war against 
the Belvedere. It is also obvious that the coalition had known 
from the very beginning that its initiative will cause precisely 
these kinds of consequences since Walesa announced a long time 
ago that he will respond to attempts to limit his powers by 
dissolving parliament. So why did the coalition decide to take 
the step? 
  There is no simple answer to the question and that is mainly 
because for the first time, the coalition took a joint position 
and that is enough to cause major amazement. Ever since it was 
established, the coalition had to deal with various degrees of 
disputes and for the last three months, it has been in a state 
of permanent crisis. So what could the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] gain by striking at the 
Belvedere together? 
  In SLD's case, the issue is simple. It has become obvious 
for the winner in the 19 September elections, that Poland is 
just not big enough for SLD aspiring to be the first player, and 
Walesa who is getting ready to be reelected. All of the SLD's 
political measures were directly or indirectly torpedoed by the 
Belvedere. Such was the case with the introduction of deputy 
ministers into presidential ministries (recently, the Belvedere 
has made a particularly malicious mockery of the SLD's candidate 
to the Defense Ministry); it was the same case with pushing 
through the electoral law to gmina [small administrative units] 
councils, and also with the neo- popiwek [wage-controlling] 
legislation. 
  Blocking Dariusz Rosati's nomination was the most 
spectacular 
strike by the Belvedere. After that decision, SLD leaders made 
a decision that they cannot conduct a common game with Walesa, 
and they decided to give up trying to come up with another 
candidate. They decided a war with Walesa must take place and 
that they will wage it under the banner of Rosati, no less. 
  At any rate, for a few months now the SLD leadership has 
deliberated on what front to wage this war to prevent society 
from perceiving it as a battle for posts. In the end, the 
leadership made a decision that a campaign for the entry of a 
professional into the government will be socially successful. 
"What are we to do, if the president interferes with our 
day-to-day ruling of the country?" -- this is the kind of 
argument which society must like. 
  This kind of war will surely be supported by the SLD's 
anti-Walesa electorate. What is more, the war will strengthen 
the electorate which is seriously bitter over the lack of 
implementation of the election program. At the same time, the 
SLD is exposing an enemy who is making it impossible to 
implement the promises soon. 
  The coalition's war with the Belvedere is extremely 
beneficial to the SLD also for the reason that it throws Pawlak 
once and for all into the arms of his coalition partner. After 
all, it is thanks to a joint game with the Belvedere that Pawlak 
was successful in marginalizing the SLD's political influence. 
A breaking apart of the Pawlak-Belvedere alliance is -- from 
the SLD's perspective -- not just a guarantee of the coalition's 
durability, but also a prospect for dominating the PSL which in 
the future will be left entirely on its own. 
  There is also a personal element in the fight. It is no 
accident that it was precisely Kwasniewski (along with 
Cimoszewicz) who was trying to push through a constitutional 
amendment during a meeting of the coalition. It is precisely 
Kwasniewski who is the main victim of the Pawlak-Walesa 
alliance. By breaking the arrangement apart, Kwasniewski can 
hope for a reconstruction of his political authority and also 
for delivering a blow to his main political rivals in the 
presidential campaign -- Walesa first of all, and second Pawlak, 
who is condemned to cooperation with the SLD. 
  All this leads to just one thing -- the cards will finally 
go into the hands of the SLD, which for the last few months has 
been watching state politics more than shaping them. And if one 
can defeat Walesa in the war, then the SLD's triumph will be 
complete. Once Walesa is defeated, it will be easy to push him 
out of the political scene. But Pawlak himself must be aware of 
these motives of the SLD leaders. Despite that -- and to the 
leaders' surprise -- the prime minister agreed to a war being 
waged against Walesa. Perhaps Pawlak himself got scared of 
being too dependent on the Belvedere and he came to understand 
that support for the SLD initiative is a precondition for 
maintaining the coalition's coherency. But that still does not 
explain why he spoke so clearly in the SLD's favor. It was not 
so long ago that he himself explained to PSL Sejm deputies that 
he wants to avoid situations where he would be a side in an 
SLD-Walesa dispute. He knows very well that once Walesa turns 
against him, he will be condemned to cooperation with the SLD 
which is stronger in parliament than he is. 
  But it is quite possible that Pawlak's consent is not final 
yet. If it turns out that Walesa regards the attempt to limit 
his powers not as a dispute but as a war, then Pawlak may 
distance himself from the plan to amend the Small Constitution. 
It is no accident that it is a draft coming from Sejm deputies, 
and not from the coalition. So it is possible that SLD will be 
finally left alone in its fight with the president. 
  It is also possible that Pawlak felt offended by the 
rejection of Rosati's candidacy. After all, from a certain 
point in time, Rosati was not just the SLD's candidate but the 
entire coalition's. All society could see, was that the prime 
minister went to the Belvedere with a motion to have Rosati 
nominated, and Walesa refused. 
  The threat to veto the budget must not have been to Pawlak's 
liking, either. After all, it was his government that had 
prepared the budget, and the possibility of vetoing it would be 
a strike primarily against Pawlak himself. It turned out that 
Walesa likes to keep people in suspense and to deliver affronts 
not just to the SLD. 
  It seems that apart from the above, there are just two 
explanations for Pawlak's decision. The first one -- and the 
least likely -- is that Pawlak became convinced that in order to 
win the presidential elections, one must destroy Walesa as soon 
as possible. And since Walesa is a difficult opponent, one must 
begin fighting him now. 
  The other explanation is that Pawlak and the SLD have not 
declared a war yet but they have set an ultimatum. So Pawlak is 
not delivering a strike at Walesa but he is just putting on a 
show intended to be a show of force. If Walesa nominates Rosati 
and if he stops blocking the introduction of coalition deputy 
ministers into the presidential ministries, then the coalition 
will reject the Sejm deputies' draft. Then a war will not take 
place, and all the parties will be able to present their 
decisions as a victory. Pawlak will prove that he is a real 
prime minister who does not allow either the SLD or the 
president to interfere with his prerogatives. The SLD will 
demonstrate that it is not an opponent that anyone can mistreat. 
And Walesa will demonstrate that he places responsibility for 
the country over personal ambitions. 
  But if all it is, is just an ultimatum, then it will have a 
major flaw from the president's standpoint -- he has no 
guarantee that the coalition will not take it as a sign of his 
weakness, and that it will not think of ruling the country 
without Lech Walesa. 
  So if all Pawlak meant was an ultimatum, he managed to wage 
a 
war, anyway.

<F P=106> [Article by Wojciech Zaluska: "You Shall Return; Will </F>
'Solidarity' Support Walesa in Presidential Elections?"] 
  [Text] "The most important thing is to target the 
electorate in the correct manner" -- Lech Walesa keeps saying 
before the presidential elections. As for himself, he is 
targeting "Solidarity" and he has already made it his first 
offer. Professor Zbigniew Religa is the intermediary -- the 
chief of the pro- Belvedere Non-Party Bloc in Support of 
Reforms, wants to put his parliamentary club at the disposal of 
"Solidarity." 
  But first the trade union and the Belvedere must apologize 
to 
one another. 
<H5>  Separation or Divorce? </H5>
  Walesa stopped being interested in "Solidarity" three years 
ago, when he became president. It was easier to fight for power 
along with the trade union, than to be in power with it. The 
issue of file-checking was the ultimate reason behind the 
dispute between the two sides. Walesa brought Olszewski's 
government down and "Solidarity" did not invite him to its 
national congress. The trade union and the Belvedere turned 
their backs on each other. 
  "We are beginning to go separate ways" -- stated 
the president a year ago. 
  But today, he is making gestures aimed at an agreement. He 
recalled that "Solidarity" exists in February, after a big, 
anti- government rally in Warsaw. That was a message that the 
trade union is again gaining strength. 
<H5>  Something in Return for Something Else </H5>
  Walesa needs the trade union again. The elections will be in 
a year and a half, while he continues to be without a "home 
front." There is a political vacuum surrounding the Belvedere. 
The attempt to create a presidential camp along with the right 
wing, backfired. "Solidarity" remains. 
  What can Walesa offer the trade union in return for its 
support? He can offer it what the trade union is missing the 
most -- efficiency. 
<H5>  Walesa Holds the Pen </H5>
  The day 19 September was a day of defeat for the old 
anticommunist opposition. The coalition, consisting of the 
Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party, seemed to 
be made of granite. 
  For six months now, Walesa has been successfully breaking 
the 
granite into pieces. He signed Borowski's resignation and he 
blocked Rosati's nomination. His veto "killed" popiwek [earning 
control legislation]. The trade union was not capable of 
accomplishing that over four years. The president's pen turned 
out a more effective political weapon than protests and strikes 
by "Solidarity." 
  This must impress. And it does. We know from "leaks" that 
Walesa's shares are "going up" in the trade union's National 
Commission. 
<H5>  Everybody or Nobody? </H5>
  But the involvement of "Solidarity" in the presidential 
campaign cannot be determined through a vote. Either the entire 
trade union will support him, or else...it will split. 
  There is no one "Solidarity" "on the Walesa issue." It 
includes both pro-presidential and anti-presidential activists. 
They were both in the crowds that burned Walesa in effigy, and 
among those who expressed their indignation at the burners. 
  That is why a decision on whether or not to support Walesa 
will not be made soon. It is possible that "Solidarity" will 
not be capable of making such a decision at all.

<F P=106> [Report by P.W.R.: "Small Chance of An Alliance Between </F>
`Solidarity' and Walesa"] 
  [Excerpt] "Solidarity" ["S"] Head Marian Krzaklewski said 
that the possibilities of a political maneuver that the union 
can carry out are limited. "S" has nothing left to do but put 
pressure on the authorities. According to him, the president 
should try to achieve successes that would also be the successes 
of the union; however, at the same time he did not say that the 
union would support Walesa in the forthcoming presidential 
elections. 
<H5>  More Demonstrations </H5>
  On 16 April Krzaklewski was a guest at the 9th General 
Congress of the Mazowsze Region Delegates. He told the 
delegates that he could see two possibilities of fighting for 
"S" demands. The first consists of political possibilities. He 
said that the openness of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] would 
be a chance; however, "this party most clearly does not want to 
take advantage of this chance." He added that in the PSL the 
old nomenklatura is gaining an upper hand. According to 
Krzaklewski, another political solution might be cooperation 
with the president. However, according to the "S" chairman, the 
president did not take advantage of the chance to "improve the 
dialogue with the union" before signing the budget. He should 
have held talks with "S" and, before signing the budget, he 
should have submitted conditions to the coalition; the 
conditions could have made it possible to satisfy at least some 
demands. Later on, asked bluntly by one of the delegates 
whether "S" might back Lech Walesa in the presidential 
elections, Krzaklewski said that "as a result of such alliances, 
the union may become dependent and it will depend first of all 
on the president's activities whether the unionists will support 
him." 
  "I personally cannot see the possibility of a political 
alliance; however, this will be decided by the congress," added 
Krzaklewski. 
  Thus, in the present situation the union should count first 
of all on itself in the fight for its demands. The "S" leader 
announced that there would be further pressure exerted on 
authorities; however, there would be fewer strikes, more 
demonstrations and information campaigns. 
<H5>  Wrzodak Attacks Jankowski </H5>
  Zygmunt Wrzodak, radical activist of the Mazovian "S," 
criticized at the congress the activities of the Region's 
Chairman Maciej Jankowski. He said that the strikes, 
manifestations, and pickets were not very successful in the 
region. He asked Jankowski what he had done since the beginning 
of his term and what he was going to do this year. [passage

<F P=106> [Report by Sabina Augustynowicz: "Hopes for Growth; Draft </F>
Economic Program for 1994-1997" -- first paragraph published in 
boldface; passages within slantlines published in italics] 
  [Text] For the first time since 1989, the Central 
Planning Administration [CUP] has prepared a four-year program 
for Poland's social and economic development until the year 
1997. The government's preferential treatment of exporters, 
investors, as well as state protectionism in some branches of 
the economy, are supposed to make the program successful. On 
the other hand, the program's implementation could be impeded by 
the lifting of earning controls in state-owned enterprises. 
  "We have analyzed three versions of the program: the 
warning option, the extensive-development option, and the basic 
option -- which is difficult but implementable" -- said 
Miroslaw Pietrewicz, a minister and CUP's chief. "We 
decided in favor of proposing the third option to the Council of 
Ministers. The decision was determined by the domestic 
situation -- unemployment, obsolete industrial machinery, 
indebtedness by enterprises which last year reached 550 trillion 
zlotys [Z], and the crisis of public finances. Poland's debts 
have reached the level of Z1,400 trillion. To service the debt 
this year, we will need Z112 trillion. On the other hand, we 
have reported an economic growth of some extent, even though it 
is still fragile and uncertain. We are also hopeful concerning 
the economic revival in the West. But generally speaking, the 
starting point for the program's implementation is 
difficult" -- CUP's chief added. 
  The program is based on the assumption of growth in GDP by 
22 
percent over four years, as well as an increase in consumption 
generally by 15 percent, and an increase in investment of around 
40 percent. There is also an assumption of approximately a 
1.5-percent yearly increase in real wages and salaries. 
According to M. Pietrewicz, this kind of growth is dependent 
first of all on a speeding up of the rate of ownership 
transformations and economic modernization. But investments in 
enterprises are linked with the need to save money by those 
enterprises and to devote savings to production capital. 
"It is hard to say whether we will be successful in 
that" -- the minister stated. "Investing money in 
investments is more risky than investing in bonds." 
  The version of the program suggested by CUP requires an 
intensification of exports. So it is based on a widening of 
consumption markets for Polish merchandise beyond the 
traditional markets. But the program also envisages 
difficulties in eliminating the negative foreign-trade balance. 
Modernization of the economy will require an increase in the 
imports of modern technologies. So the state is supposed to 
provide clearly preferential treatment to exporters, for 
instance by providing insurance for risks of credit exports -- 
this according to assurances received from CUP. Apart from 
that, state protectionism will be visible particularly in large 
economic branches such as mining, steelworks, the defense 
industry, and the energy industry. When asked whether state 
intervention and protectionist policies will not deter foreign 
investors -- whose involvement will largely determine the 
program's success -- Minister Halina Wasilewska replied: 
"It is not true that foreign capital invests mainly in 
those areas where there is full liberalization. On the contrary 
-- investors demand outright protectionism, as in the form of 
tax or customs-duties breaks." 
  CUP also makes the success of the proposed program for 
social 
and economic development in Poland dependent on a gradual 
abandonment of earning controls. According to the CUP chief, 
the sudden elimination of such controls would cause equally 
sudden consequences. Italy serves as an example -- over there, 
such a step resulted in a breakdown of the economic situation. 
It is a complicated issue. The controls and popiwek 
[earning-control legislation] should be eliminated, but not yet. 
First, principles of indexation of benefits should be changed, 
enterprises should be commercialized, and the issue of companies 
with a strong, monopoly position on the market, resolved; a 
special commission should also be established which would deal 
with earning issues. Otherwise, the implementation of the 
program proposed by CUP would be very hard. Miroslaw Pietrewicz 
also expressed his hope that thinking along economic lines will 
prevail. 
  If the implementation of the program is successful, then we 
can expect 1997 expenditures on the educational system to be 
similar to those of 1989 (it is the same case with health 
services); we can also expect 1-1.2 percent of GDP to be devoted 
to science, 3 percent to the defense system, as well as a rate 
of unemployment which would not exceed 14 percent of the 
professionally active population of Poland.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw </F>
Kaczmarek by Krzysztof Golata; place and date not given: 
"Capitalists Without Capital"] 
  [Excerpt] [Golata] Do you have allies supporting the 
privatization process now that Minister Borowski has resigned? 
  [Kaczmarek] Many persons want to implement privatization on 
their own. I believe that we must declare war on the belief in 
the healing power of branch holdings which are supposed to cure 
all Polish ailments. Many countries are currently abandoning 
such organizational structures in favor of 
manufacturing-commercial consortia, which minimize the risk of 
the economic activity that is being pursued. 
  [Golata] The industry minister suggests that you share the 
responsibility for the effects of privatization. Does this 
issue concern only responsibility? 
  [Kaczmarek] The crux of the dispute lies in the following: I 
believe that a separate law should be drafted which would define 
the rules of commercialization of state-run enterprises -- I do 
not think that they should be defined in the privatization law 
which is being amended right now. I do not think that we should 
start the discussion with the question of who decides the 
composition of the supervisory boards. First the relations 
between the Treasury and the method of managing the public 
wealth must be defined, and only then should we speak about the 
tools -- privatization and commercialization. We must humbly 
accept that the era of bureaucratic steering of enterprises is 
coming to an end; beginning is the time of constructing systems 
that regulate the functioning of the economy. In other words, 
the point is to specify the rules of the game within the various 
sectors. This is what the branch ministries should deal with, 
not with the fight for bureaucracy's power in the economy. The 
problem of the structure of ownership is of secondary importance. 
  [Golata] Deputy Bogdan Pek criticizes all your decisions; 
Ryszard Bugaj queries the number of enterprises selected for 
participation in the Mass Privatization Program [PPP]. The 
atmosphere over privatization is not very favorable to you. 
  [Kaczmarek] I think that Deputy Pek has already stopped 
criticizing me. The querying of my activities results from the 
fact that at the beginning of my activity I was not able to win 
the trust of the chairman of the Sejm committee. The 
differences of opinions on privatization were primarily a result 
of the different levels of knowledge on ownership 
transformations, in which I have been taking part for quite some 
time now. Nevertheless, I think that emotions have died down 
and a cease fire has gone into effect. Now, the criticism of 
Deputy Bugaj is of a definitely statistical, not substantive 
nature. I would expect a polemic concerning the changes brought 
about in the economy by the process of mass privatization. In my 
opinion, the fewer election campaigns, the better the atmosphere 
over privatization. It has always been so that in ownership 
transformations political capital was made. Now we should start 
making capital without this adjective. 
  [Golata] Do you not get the impression that we are now in a 
waiting period? Employees are waiting for free shares, and 
enterprises are waiting for a magic law that would improve their 
financial condition... 
  [Kaczmarek] I have come across such opinions. In the 
ministry no one is waiting for anything and the privatization 
program is being implemented. In two-thirds of all the 
transformations, decisions are made in voivodships. The PPP is 
in a phase in which it is difficult to expect any spectacular 
successes. I believe that people's expectations concerning the 
distribution of free shares have been aroused too much. 
Therefore, I am not surprised that enterprises and employees 
are waiting for a new privatization law. We are not going to 
force anyone to take part in mass privatization, even though we 
are often attacked for using procedures that are said to be too 
democratic. 
  [Golata] It should be expected that at least 15 percent of 
the free shares of the privatized enterprises will bring about 
the opposition of all those who will not be able to enjoy this 
privilege. 
  [Kaczmarek] I have already been asked such a question: On 
the basis of what norms do I want to divide Poles into two 
categories -- those who work in privatized companies and those 
outside them? I must admit that the pact on enterprise, 
negotiated by the trade unions, does not include any offer for 
the employees of the budget sphere, the people of free 
professions, senior citizens, disabled pensioners, and the 
employees of companies which will not be privatized. I think 
that a dispute over who should be given the shares and who 
should not does not make any sense. Privatization must be a 
result of a well-considered economic decision. 
  [Golata] Giving away shares does not have much to do with 
economics. 
  [Kaczmarek] Some have said not just "a" but also "b" by 
promising 100 million zlotys first, and then 300 million. In a 
country whose society does not have very extensive capital 
resources, such slogans arouse emotions and hopes. One cannot 
go totally "upstream" -- one must give satisfaction also to 
those who are not working in enterprises being privatized. 
  [Golata] They still have the popular privatization and the 
National Investment Funds [NFI]. 
  [Kaczmarek] These assure participation in the privatization 
process to all those who are willing to try it, and they are 
also a form of the state fulfilling its obligations vis-a-vis 
some social groups. 
  [Golata] A post on an NFI supervisory board must be 
profitable since a few thousand people have submitted their 
applications for the position. 
  [Kaczmarek] I am not sure whether these posts will be so 
profitable. Out of 6,800 candidates, about 100 will remain. I 
would like the supervisory boards to include persons with 
experience in the area of so-called financial engineering, as 
well as persons skilled in strategic planning. I know for a 
fact that Poland does not have too many such experts. I am 
first of all eager to have economic practitioners who are 
capable of showing a record of success. 
  [Golata] The privatization program for 1994 provides that 
12.3 trillion zlotys will go into the budget as profit from 
sales of enterprises. So that means we continue to regard 
ownership transformations as a source of providing additional 
resources to the state budget? 
  [Kaczmarek] That is unavoidable. We must keep in mind that 
every transaction means not just an inflow into the budget of a 
sum equal to the price of the sale -- let us not forget taxes 
and customs duties which result from increases in the turnover 
of companies subjected to privatization. 
  [Golata] Looking at privatization from the budget's 
standpoint often leads to accusations about insufficient prices 
of companies being sold. 
  [Kaczmarek] I would like everyone who makes such 
accusations, to be able to listen to negotiations with the given 
strategic investor. On the other hand, I doubt whether we will 
manage to work out clear criteria for evaluating the ownership 
transformations minister's activities. 
  [Golata] Just one unsuccessful privatization -- for instance 
that of Bank Slaski -- may annul 100 ownership transformations 
beneficial to the economy. 
  [Kaczmarek] The lucky part about the whole misfortune of the 
Bank Slaski case, was that the bank was privatized by the 
Finance Ministry. But it was my ministry that was burdened with 
the entire odium. Unfortunately, big social expectations 
regarding privatization are accompanied by a small tolerance for 
mistakes that are made. Of course, you can always say one 
should have predicted a number of situations. But on the other 
hand, compare the first and the most recent agreements on 
capital privatization. There is a huge difference, 
qualitatively speaking. 
  [Golata] An accusation is often levied that the ministry 
sells such companies to foreign capital, which should remain in 
Polish hands. This accusation applies for instance to the 
tobacco industry. 
  [Kaczmarek] The dispute surrounding the tobacco industry is 
more ambition-driven than it is about substance. I am not 
completely convinced as to whose interests the persons defending 
the status quo represent -- is it the interests of state-owned 
companies, or else of foreign companies which have obtained a 
license to build new factories? In a situation where 22 percent 
of the cigarettes come from abroad, it is the importers that 
gain the biggest advantage from the dispute. I will strive to 
have the tobacco industry privatized. 
  Every strategic investor, before he receives his portfolio 
of 
the majority of shares, will have to present an investment 
program and also the fundamentals of his policies vis-a-vis the 
growers. We must be taking care of the state's monopoly in 
Treasury issues, but we will not be striving at a monopoly of 
state property. We are no match for the competition. 
  [Golata] Does the need to maintain a national character also 
apply to other branches? 
  [Kaczmarek] In an increasing number of cases, the argument 
is also raised in talks regarding the oil branch's 
privatization. Unfortunately, a concept for having the branch 
privatized is still missing while time flies very fast. 
Poland's entry into Europe means we will be flooded with 
products made by Western refineries. Not a lot is happening 
regarding the privatization of the telecommunications industry. 
That is strange, when you take into account how highly 
profitable the sector is. 
  [Golata] It seems that you will be successful in meeting one 
goal -- by the end of the year, the number of companies 
registered on the stock market will double. 
  [Kaczmarek] That is not my contribution but just a case of a 
correct forecast. What happened at the stock market in March, 
must cause concern. But it could be that the Polish stock 
market is becoming normal. The fact that private companies are 
interested in joining the stock market, is cause for optimism. 
The prevalence of petty investors who respond nervously to 
changes in the economic situation, is a weakness of the Polish 
capital market. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by "MAW": "Official Optimism; Number of Unemployed </F>
in March Decreased by 19,000"] 
  [Text] "Since October, we have been witnessing a 
decreasing trend in the level of unemployment, and at this point 
I can be more optimistic in hoping that the trend will hold" -- 
said Labor Minister Leszek Miller during a news conference on 13 
April. "The number of people registered at unemployment offices 
was almost 3 million people at the end of March. This 
represents a drop of almost 19,000 people compared with 
February" -- added Deputy Labor Minister Jerzy Szreter. 
  The falling trend in unemployment was reported in 38 
voivodships -- almost 24,000 people in total. On the other 
hand, there was an increase in 11 voivodships in March of this 
year, by a total of 4,300 people. According to the deputy 
minister, the falling trend will hold until the end of 
June, but beginning in July, there will be another increase, due 
to new graduates entering the picture. At the end of 
March, people registered at unemployment offices comprised 16 
percent of the professionally active population. By this time, 
132,000 people were registered -- a drop of 1.4 percent from 
February. On the other hand, almost 152,000 people were crossed 
off the unemployment list, which is an increase of almost 26 
percent of all unemployed people, compared with the previous 
month. Those who were taken off the register accepted permanent 
jobs, interventionist work [not further specified], and public 
works jobs offered by unemployment offices. 
  The highest unemployment rates continue to be in the 
following voivodships: Koszalin, Suwalki, Slupsk, Olsztyn, 
Elblag, Walbrzych, Pila, and Ciechanow. The lowest rates of 
unemployment were reported in the following voivodships: 
Krakow, Warsaw, Poznan, and Katowice. Minister Miller also 
informed journalists that during next week's session by the 
Council of Ministers, he will present a draft of an amended 
Labor Law Code.

<F P=106> [By Jean Michel Stoullig] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, April 16 (AFP) -- An international 
commission of experts will present a 3,300-page report on crimes 
against humanity in the former Yugoslavia, with Serbs 
responsible for most of them, members of the commission said 
Friday [15 April]. 
  The acting deputy prosecutor for the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Australian Graham Blewitt, 
said he hoped the 11 judges of the International Court of 
Justice (ICJ) in The Hague would start to examine the report by 
the end of the year. 
  On Thursday, the General Assembly of the United Nations 
voted 
11 million dollars for the tribunal, set up in November 1993, to 
charge and prosecute all those responsible for crimes against 
humanity in the region. 
  "No one ethnic group or country bears responsibility" and 
violations have been committed by all the belligerents -- Serbs, 
Croats and Moslems in the former Yugoslavia, the retiring head 
of the commission Sherif Bassiouni told reporters Friday. But 
"there is certainly one group in the conflict where a lot more 
violations have been reported than among the other groups," he 
said -- a reference to the Serbs. 
  The commission report will be presented on May 2 to UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and to the prosecutor of 
the tribunal. It documents specific cases of serious violations 
including mass executions, ethnic cleansing, rapes, the setting 
up of concentration camps and torture. 
  But Bassiouni, a U.S. law professor, refused to name both 
the 
suspected authors of the crimes and the number of cases cited, 
though he said a team of 30 women had interviewed over 200 rape 
victims to add to the data already filed. 
  "The events in Opstina Prijedor (northwest Bosnia) since 
April 1992 constitute crimes against humanity and that it would 
probably be possible to establish that genocide has been 
committed there," Bassiouni said Friday. 
  Bosnian Serb militia in Prijedor have frequently been 
accused 
of carrying out murder and ethnic cleansing, mainly against 
Moslems. 
  The commission also said "acts of wanton destruction were 
committed in the Medak pocket in September 1993" by Croatian 
forces against secessionist Serbs in Krajina. According to the 
United Nations, dozens of people were killed in Medak and more 
than 500 buildings destroyed. 
  The tribunal is still attempting to get permission to exhume 
the remains buried in mass graves at Vukovar, on the 
Croatian-Serbian border, where Croatians are believed to have 
been summarily executed at the end of 1991 following its capture 
by the Serbian-led Yugoslav army. 
  Asked about cases underway in Germany and Denmark against 
people charged with crimes against humanity in the former 
Yugoslavia, Blewitt said countries with the "legal competence 
and jurisdictions to do so," should prosecute cases, even if 
they were later transferred to the tribunal. 
  Earlier Friday, Bosnia-Herzegovina filed a legal brief 
Friday 
with the ICJ detailing human rights violations and war crimes 
against Bosnians by the rump Yugoslavia. 
  The ICJ has twice called on both parties to respect the UN 
convention, and asked each side to submit a detailed brief on 
the alleged crimes. 
  The rump Yugoslavia has said that it would file its brief in 
April 1995, which means that a public trial on the matter cannot 
be held before the summer of next year.

<F P=106> [Opening statement by Czech President Vaclav Havel at a news </F>
conference on the results of a meeting of seven Central European 
presidents at Litomysl Castle -- live] 
  [Excerpts] At the beginning of our talks I thanked all our 
guests, the presidents, for accepting this invitation and for 
coming to Litomysl. It appears that all of them were pleased to 
come and that they regard this meeting as meaningful. [passage 
omitted] 
  Our discussion was very intensive, and when it was over it 
seemed to us that it was, in fact, a very short discussion. We 
do not consider it to be the culmination of the meeting but only 
its beginning. We will have many more discussions before 
tomorrow afternoon when we leave. 
  In the conversation we just had, each of the presidents 
delivered his own opening statement in which he contemplated the 
position of the Central European region, above all in connection 
with the processes of European integration. We have arrived at 
the consensus that while we met precisely in this setup, it does 
not mean we are colluding against someone else, or even that we 
consider ourselves better or more advanced than others. We are 
meeting as representatives of countries that feel their mutual 
closeness, not only in geographical terms but also in terms of 
values, cultural traditions, and history. 
  No differences between individual participants appeared in 
the opening statements we gave. It turned out that there was 
complete accord among us as far as the most general topic was 
concerned. So much for the brief opening. The presidents can 
speak for themselves when answering your questions. [passage

spokesman of Slovak President Kovac. 
  [Unidentified spokesman] A Slovak Television editor will ask 
President Kovac a question. 
  [Correspondent, in Slovak] Much has been written about 
Slovakia regarding relations between Slovakia and Hungary in the 
context of Central European countries. From the outside these 
relations might indeed appear rather dramatic, but the reality 
is a little different. What, in your view, is the outlook for 
the new coalition government being able to solve this problem? 
I have in mind the resolution of Slovak-Hungarian relations. 
  [Kovac] As you know, questions of a general nature were 
raised during the discussions so far. This does not mean, 
however, that in this group of states we would underestimate 
questions related to the minorities. As far as relations 
between the Republic of Hungary and the Republic of Slovakia are 
concerned, after the passage of some time, I am able to say 
better times are in the offing. At the same time, it transpires 
that the issue of national minorities, or perhaps the debate -- 
or rather the insufficient debate -- between the Hungarian and 
Slovak Republics on this issue has made it possible to 
exaggerate and dramatize the existing problem. 
  I firmly believe that given our efforts aimed at becoming 
incorporated into the European integration, the issue of 
national minorities in the Central European region will not be 
an issue presenting a problem, and that we will manage to 
successfully resolve it among ourselves, and that by doing so we 
will, at the same time, demonstrate that we are capable of a 
partnership coexistence in the Central European region. We will 
thus secure for ourselves some kind of a passport for entering 
the European integration. [passage omitted] 
  [Moderator] A question for President Kovac from an editor of 
the Bratislava-based PRACA daily. 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] Foreign commentaries voice 
views casting doubt on Slovakia's intention to integrate into 
European economic, democratic, or security structures. As if by 
chance, Slovakia is being left out regarding the Central 
European Initiative. Do you think that there is any 
justification for doing this? 
  [Kovac] On the whole I am not convinced that responsible 
West 
European state officials are intentionally leaving Slovakia out 
as one of the possible candidates for West European integration. 
[passage omitted] 
  The other thing is that the Slovakia's internal policy might 
have provoked a certain lack of confidence as to whether the 
political situation in the Slovak Republic was sufficiently 
stable, whether political entities and governments linked to 
them were a reliable guarantor of what was being declared. I 
used every occasion, also when speaking with the gentlemen 
present here, to stress that the internal instability caused by 
the lack of a clear picture of individual political entities is 
one thing, while the stability of the pluralistic system which 
has been adopted and the Slovak Republic's foreign policy trends 
are a different matter. 
  Following certain changes that have taken place, this issue 
has now been clarified. I believe that all doubts will 
disappear and that our partners will show trust in us and an 
understanding of certain problems we have so far suffered, being 
a new state. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Debate with Presidents Thomas Klestil of Austria, Vaclav </F>
Havel of the Czech Republic, Richard von Weizsaecker of Germany, 
Arpad Goncz of Hungary, Lech Walesa of Poland, Michal Kovac of 
Slovakia, and Milan Kucan of Slovenia in Litomysl, Czech 
Republic; moderated by political analyst Jacques Rupnik -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Rupnik] As far as supranational cooperation is 
concerned, we see that it does not work everywhere. States are 
disappearing or are being created, and it leads in some cases, 
particularly in the Balkans, to a very dangerous situation. For 
the first time since 1945, we have a war in Europe. What does 
it mean to divide states along ethnic criteria, change borders 
by force, and create national states based on ethnic 
homogeneity? President Kucan, this is a question addressed 
straight to you. How did you live through that period of time 
in Yugoslavia? Three years ago did you have an inkling of the 
closeness between the desire for freedom and the possibility of 
war? 
  [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech] 
I think it was not difficult at that time to think of these two 
realities as being close to each other. Initially, it seemed the 
conflict was limited by Yugoslavia itself. It must be forcefully 
declared that what happened in Yugoslavia and what is now 
happening in the Balkans is a defeat of (?Roehmer's) principles. 
I am sure that the defeat in this specific case can become a 
lesson for the whole of Europe. Many mistakes were committed 
here and three of them are exceptionally important. 
  The first is the misunderstanding and the unwillingness to 
understand that Yugoslavia had to disintegrate. It functioned 
only temporarily in the form of a multinational state. 
Yugoslavia could exist only while centralism existed. 
Disintegration was inevitable the moment this ceased. 
  The second mistake was linked to the incorrect 
interpretation 
of this war, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as an internal 
war between ethnic groups, because this does not correspond to 
the basis of this war. 
  The third mistake, connected with the first one, is that 
there was never a real interest in looking into the real essence 
of instability in the Balkans -- and in consequence -- of 
instability in former Yugoslavia. [passage omitted] It is 
necessary to seek the reason for this instability. The reason 
lies in Serbia's very complicated ethnic and especially national 
problem. I suppose the Serbs wish to resolve the national 
question which is, of course, as legitimate as in the case of 
other nations. However, there is a question mark over the forms 
and methods used to solve this question. From the point of view 
of the Paris (?meeting) and [word indistinct] principles this 
method of ethnic cleansing and of forceful border changing is in 
effect a genocidal matter. This is all absolutely inhuman. 
  Everything which is done to solve a problem in isolation, in 
isolation from the basic internal problem of the Balkan region 
-- by which I mean resolving the ethnic questions -- creates an 
acute danger of war. An attempt must be made to stabilize the 
Balkan region on a more permanent basis. [passage omitted on 
past conflicts] 
  I think that what is happening now, as a result of direct 
pressure from Washington and Moscow, is the most important way 
towards a halt to the war. This is enormously important, but 
there is something even more important here, and that is the 
talks with the right partners, which means talks with Belgrade, 
Sarajevo, and Zagreb. This would represent a recognition of the 
real nature of this war. 
  Two years ago, when the war started, it was possible to 
delineate the framework of this war. [passage indistinct] Then, 
of course, Croatia was not involved in this war in Bosnia in the 
way it is today. If the diagnosis was made correctly at that 
time, the price would not have been so high, there would not 
have been 100,000 people dead, 600,000 people expelled, and a 
huge number of people wounded, incapacitated, and damaged by 
other means. This all could happen, but now a real solution of 
the Balkan crisis is at stake. [passage omitted on Klestil 
discussing unacceptability of ethnic cleansing and suggesting 
that agreement between the West and Russia might lead to 
pressure on Belgrade] 
  [Rupnik] Russia is not returning only to the Balkans, but 
also to the near abroad [blizke zahranici]. How do you assess 
this development in Russian policy and what does it mean for 
Central Europe? President Walesa? 
  [Walesa, in Polish with simultaneous translation into Czech] 
Of course after the period of division into two poles, Russia 
and Europe are seeking solutions by means of evolution. The 
time is coming when we should define certain principles and 
points where our minds meet. If we do not do this, then 
Yugoslavia must be considered as a challenge and as a warning. 
Let us imagine the countries of the post-Soviet Union. And 
there [words indistinct] for example, in Latvia, 40 percent 
support Russia's Boris Yeltsin. If something similar happened 
elsewhere, then we would be confronted with a total catastrophe. 
So, it is necessary to mark the danger [bodovat], it is 
necessary to discuss interests and (?human) categories. 
  If we fail to reach such agreements as have been reached in 
Central Europe and Europe overall, if we fail to submit these 
problems jointly and of course assess them, then of course it 
will be an incentive for Russia to settle things in the old way. 
We need here the democratic principles recognized by Europe. 
And in this sense, we have to help Russia in this direction. 
  However, the Russia that puts forth conditions, wanting to 
be a partner, but not a real partner; the meaning of which they 
do not understand.... [pauses] If one is a partner, the same 
principles and conditions should apply and not [word 
indistinct], not a policeman or something undefined. This all 
has to be discussed jointly and certain values have to be 
defended jointly. Then we will avoid the Yugoslav example and 
[word indistinct] with part of Russia. This will be the right 
thing for Russia and a blessing for us all. If we fail to do 
it, certain groups in Russia will take advantage of the 
indecision in parts of Europe. 
  [Rupnik] Mr. President, do you think the Partnership for 
Peace program is the right solution for the security of Central 
Europe and, among other things, its relationship with Russia? 
  [Havel] I think Russia is and always will be, or will be for 
rather a long time, a great Eurasian superpower, a superpower 
which even possesses nuclear weapons. I cannot imagine peace in 
Europe, or in the world, without some kind of relationship based 
on partnership between the West and Russia. Perhaps the 
Partnership for Peace program can serve as a starting point for 
creating that kind of partnership. 
  There is, however, a difference between this and the 
position 
of our states which feel they belong to the West and, because 
they are small, they need certain security guarantees and ties. 
We understand Partnership for Peace both as an opportunity and 
as the beginning of the path towards NATO membership. We cannot 
be merely NATO's partners, we want, indeed we must, be a part of 
it. 
  We are in a completely different position from Russia. I 
think that some of the ideas now emerging in Russian politics 
should be really sharply criticized and denounced. I mean ideas 
to the effect that, somehow, just because Russia is such a big 
state, it kind of owns us and automatically enjoys the right to 
advise us, its closer or more distant neighbors, and tell us 
whom we are or are not allowed to join. This must be rejected 
quite unequivocally. Our countries are particularly sensitive 
to this sort of thing and, simply, we want to be a part of 
something we feel we belong to in the first place. 
  This does not mean that we are against anybody or that we do 
not wish to have a good relationship with Russia. On the 
contrary, let me reiterate that good relations between the West 
and Russia are the necessary prerequisites for virtually 
everything else, for any European integration processes. Don't 
you think that Russia ought not claim superpower status on the 
one hand, while at the same time enjoying the same rights as the 
small Central European countries? Russia really cannot keep 
saying -- Why can you be NATO members but we cannot? Well, this 
is quite absurd, isn't it? [passage omitted on von Weizsaecker 
on the European Union's political and security dimension, 
Partnership for Peace] 
  [Rupnik] President Kucan. 
  [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech] 
I think that what we heard from President Havel was very 
important. The point is that we want more than just a 
partnership. I believe it must be recognized that where we live 
in the world must be taken into account. We want more than just 
a partnership -- namely NATO membership and participation in the 
system of collective security in Europe. From this point of 
view, it is very important that the Partnership for Peace 
program is not concerned with security alone. 
  All participating states are obliged to attain a high level 
of democracy and this gives rise to the question -- How do we 
tackle the issues of the political neutrality of the army, the 
transparency of the armed forces' numbers, and the question of 
the joint functioning of the army and society in the sense that 
there is adequate control over the armed forces. It is indeed 
necessary to ensure complete control over the armed forces. The 
danger, the possibility, that certain armed forces or certain 
countries can be drawn into solving issues concerning all 
citizens still exists. 
  At the time of gaining its independence, Slovenia, too, went 
through a complicated stage. It was necessary to wage a war, 
albeit a short one, and now a rather complicated situation has 
come into being. With all respect for the army, it is necessary 
to establish adequate control over it so democracy can fully 
develop and it is absolutely clear that we respect all the 
values of all citizens, including the issue of the armed forces. 
  [Rupnik] President Goncz, if you please. President Kovac to 
follow. 
  [Goncz, in Hungarian with simultaneous translation into 
Czech] I absolutely agree with Presidents Havel and Kucan. The 
Partnership for Peace program alone is not enough. It is a 
certain step towards peace, it is an important step which makes 
open cooperation, even military, possible. But we perceive the 
issue of peace and partnership in a different way. 
  Apart from the military sphere, there is also the sphere of 
human rights and environment as mentioned by President Walesa a 
while ago. There is also the issue of nuclear power stations. I 
would also like to bring up the issue of security in terms of 
the society. Our country is wrestling with difficult economic 
problems. Headway should be made on the path of modernization 
and if this headway is not made, then we cannot guarantee the 
security of society. To this end it is necessary to understand 
the Partnership in a broader context of European politics. We 
shall be unable to develop our own markets until markets are 
opened to us. On the contrary, our markets will contract and 
while they are contracting, we ourselves will not represent a 
good market either. We want market for market. Europe is 
economically intertwined. So far, Europe has been an 
impenetrable market for us. 
  [Kovac, in Slovak] I think the issue of Central European 
security involves two important processes. These processes 
should run concurrently. One of them has already begun and was 
generated by our interest in NATO membership and by our joining 
the Partnership for Peace program. But what is of equal 
importance is that NATO, Western Europe, and the United States 
of America should cooperate as closely as possible with Russia. 
We realize that overrating some of these processes and 
underrating others might not necessarily result in a feeling of 
security in Central European countries. It might possibly yield 
potential hotbeds for a certain destabilization of the situation 
in Europe. 
  From this point of view we realize that nowadays, to 
consolidate democracy in Russia, it is very important to help 
Russia tackle her economic problems. The other thing I have in 
mind is closely linked to this issue, and that is Ukraine should 
be helped to preserve its sovereignty. 
  All these factors are very important, because apart from our 
gradual rapprochement to NATO, they could give us -- the 
countries stuck in the middle of this region -- a fuller and 
more lasting feeling of security. 
  [Rupnik] Thank you. President Klestil. 
  [Klestil, in German with simultaneous translation into 
Czech] 
It is difficult to answer questions to which we do not have 
specific answers. In 1996, the European Union [EU] is supposed 
to discuss the future of common security and foreign policy. On 
the other hand, we are seeing developments in Russia, Belarus, 
Ukraine, and we do not know in what direction they are going to 
continue. Therefore, it is important to take small steps in the 
West, but we must think about Russia and Ukraine being nuclear 
powers and we must involve them in the process of all European 
security considerations. If we talk about security, about the 
danger people fear, then it concerns nuclear power stations. We 
should set ourselves a long-term aim of creating a nuclear free 
zone in Central Europe. As it is impossible to attain this aim 
from one day to the next, it would be necessary to make a list 
of security measures, measures to deepen trust. They should be 
similar to those on which we agreed yesterday with President 
Havel regarding the Czech Republic and Austria; for example, on 
opening nuclear power stations for inspections, introducing a 
telephone hotline, early warning systems. All this would, in my 
opinion, help to reduce public fear of danger. 
  [Rupnik] The fall of communism presented a challenge to 
Europe as a whole. Some of you have already mentioned security 
integration, or in other words NATO and Partnership for Peace. 
Integration into the EU is also linked to it. How do you see 
this process? Can European integration be enlarged eastward, or 
is there not a danger that the disintegration processes from the 
East might spread westward? After all, this is a game for time. 
How do you see current prospects of economic integration? Does 
the EU meet your expectations? [passage omitted on Walesa 
comparing European integration to the movement of a car; 
Weizsaecker comparing integration of former East Germany into 
West Germany with integration of Central Europe into Western 
Europe; Klestil on the need to show solidarity and patience with 
post-communist countries] 
  [Rupnik] President Kovac, if you please. 
  [Kovac, in Slovak] When expressing our desire to become 
integrated into Europe, we realize this should not be an 
integration that would weaken existing European structures and 
the objective of every integration should be to consolidate 
these structures. In this respect, I think that as far as 
integration into the EU is concerned, the EU has been taking 
positive and accommodating steps. [passage omitted] 
  But from this point of view, it seems to me that the issue 
of 
incorporating into the EU -- in particular into its economic 
part -- is one thing, while incorporating Central European 
countries into the political and security structures is yet 
another. At the same time, the process of economic incorporation 
is a more difficult and more long-term affair. Most of us 
realize that it is not a question of two or three years. But 
during the in-between period, we do not wish to be in some kind 
of vacuum regarding the precise definition of our incorporation. 
That is why I think certain measures should be reassessed in 
this respect. 
  Naturally, the Partnership for Peace amounts to a certain 
testing of our abilities. However, as long as we do not possess 
straightforward criteria and positions on this issue, we will 
still have a very strong feeling of being in danger. That is 
not good, I think, because this process could, in effect, bring 
certain disillusionment among our citizens. At the same time, 
we know the citizens of Central European countries are 
displaying an almost spontaneous will to be incorporated into 
both political and security structures. [passage omitted] 
  [Walesa, in Polish with simultaneous translation into Czech] 
I think we should try to answer another question: Whether the 
integration should be continuous or whether it should be an 
integration in leaps. It has become clear that at present 
continuous integration is probably more suitable. [passage 
omitted] 
  I think we have to consider continuous integration with its 
strategic points outlined. This will be wise and it will 
provide an option of future development for all of us. 
  [Kucan, in Slovene with simultaneous translation into Czech] 
I perceive the question, our dilemma, as a question of whether 
every extension of EU membership -- and that is something 
necessary -- is strengthening its internal qualities. The fact 
is that until the Maastricht Treaty, this was a difficult 
process and now it will be even more difficult. However, 
despite everything, this is the only way to progress. [passage 
omitted] 
  To halt the integration would in practice put an end to the 
existence of the West. However, it is necessary to respect the 
fact that Europe is still divided, to a certain degree. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Statement from the Albanian Foreign Ministry issued in </F>
Tirana on 15 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Concerning the misinterpretations that have come 
from the Greek side on several aspects of the contacts between 
the Albanian and Greek sides on the criminal act by a Greek 
terrorist unit on 10 April at an army recruit training center in 
Peshkepi in the Gjirokaster district, we issue the following 
statement: 
  Among other things, the letter that the Greek foreign 
minister sent to the UN Security Council chairman on 13 April 
1994 claims that the Albanian foreign minister has not yet 
responded to his Greek counterpart's proposal to meet to resolve 
the crisis. It should be stressed that through its ambassador 
in Tirana, the Greek side proposed a meeting between the foreign 
ministers of both countries in Geneva on the occasion of a 
bilateral conference. This was done at a time when the Greek 
official reaction was not at all characterized by a will to 
treat the case at the proper level or with any seriousness or 
analyze the criminal act and discover and convict those 
responsible. The Greek statements did not even see fit to 
express any regret for the victims and their families. 
  Despite this totally unjustifiable position and considering 
that he had no invitation to attend the bilateral activity in 
Geneva, the Albanian foreign minister expressed his readiness to 
meet his Greek counterpart in the most recent bilateral 
activity, that of Crans Montana held in Bucharest, of course, 
after the Greek Government had given an official response. We 
add that this answer arrived yesterday, on 14 April, through the 
Greek ambassador in Tirana. 
  Today, on 15 April 1994, we have informed the Greek side 
that 
the Albanian Government is ready for dialogue. The foreign 
policy of the new democratic Albania has left behind the period 
of communist isolation and it has never closed the way to 
dialogue for resolving all the problems that exist between 
Albania and other countries. Its relations with the Greek state 
do not make any exception from this principle of its policy. 
  Regarding the version contained in the Greek foreign 
minister's letter addressed to the UN Security Council chairman 
that the Albanian authorities were very late in informing the 
Greek side about the act of 10 April 1994, we can refer to the 
refutation by the Public Order Ministry on 13 April. According 
to this, the Greek side was informed at 0500 on the morning of 
10 April by a border guard officer at the Albanian border 
crossing of Kakavije, who went and met a border guard officer on 
the Greek side to inform him about the crime and to ask him to 
help apprehend the criminals. Nevertheless, no offer of 
cooperation came from the Greek side.

  [Text] Provocative acts against Albania are still 
continuing. At about 1200 on 14 April 1994, approximately 150 
Greek soldiers not only approached the official Albanian border 
in the Kakavije region but, after being deployed on the terrace 
of a Greek border post building, carried out surveillance of 
Albanian territory using a camera. At 1300 they withdrew deep 
into their own country. 
  After the 10 April massacre, this action is another 
provocative act leading to a further aggravation of tension and 
military pressure by the Greek side on the Albanian border. 
This provocative act runs counter to the norms of good faith 
defined in international acts that regulate the good neighborly 
relations between states. 
  We were also informed that at 1030 today, about 2 miles into 
our territorial waters, at latitude 40 degrees and longitude 19 
degrees 41 minutes, one of our naval patrol boats in Borshi Bay 
detained a Greek fishing vessel, the Aios Vasilis, captained by 
Petro Xharka, for violating Albanian laws by carrying out 
unlicensed fishing in Albanian waters. 
  In conformity with the rules and legal procedures, this ship 
was accompanied to the port of Sarande and was handed over to 
the relevant authorities for further action. 
  At 1125 today a Greek military patrol vessel was detected 
approaching the Greek fishing boat detained by our naval patrol 
boat. At 1130 this Greek warship stopped at latitude 39 degrees 
38 minutes and longitude 19 degrees 43.5 minutes, about 20.5 
miles into our waters. 
  Considering that the Greek warship violated Albanian rules, 
our patrol boat requested that the warship left Albanian waters 
immediately. At first the Greek P-52 vessel refused to accept 
that it was in Albanian waters. However, later, at about 1230, 
the warship left for Greek waters, where it remained until 1320. 
  This incursion and stay of the Greek patrol boat is another 
provocative action that may cause extremely grave consequences. 
Our navy is seriously committed to defending legality and 
sovereignty in our territorial waters. 
  Under these conditions, the Defense Ministry of the Republic 
of Albania asks the relevant authorities of the Greek Army to 
prevent and avoid such military actions that incite and increase 
tension on the official border of the Republic of Albania and 
further aggravate interstate relations that may lead to 
dangerous consequences.

  [Text] As has been reported, at about 1030 on 15 April, at 
Borshi Bay, Albanian coast guard forces detected and detained 
the Greek ship Aios Vasilios while it was sailing about 2 miles 
into Albanian territorial waters. An hour later a Greek warship 
approached the fishing ship apprehended by our forces. 
  The Albanian torpedo-boat notified the Greek warship of 
having entered Albanian waters and urged it to leave. The Greek 
warship left only after one hour. 
  Concerning this provocation by the Greek side, the Embassy 
of 
the Republic of Albania in Athens sent a note, in the name of 
the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of Albania, to the Foreign 
Ministry of Greece, asking the Greek Government to put an end to 
such actions, which impair the relations between the two 
countries and increase tension, by designating them as a 
continuation of previous Greek provocative actions and of the 
criminal event in Peshkepi in Gjirokaster village on 10 April 
1994. 
  The provocation in our territorial waters does not help but 
prevents the creation of the minimal necessary conditions and 
runs counter to the proposal by the Greek side itself to hold a 
meeting with the working groups of the Public Order Ministries 
of the two countries, the Albanian note ends.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Government of the Republic of Albania </F>
issued in Tirana on 15 April -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Today, on 15 April 1994, the Greek ambassador to 
Tirana presented to the Foreign Ministry Note Verbal No. 435 in 
which he informed the Foreign Ministry of the Republic of 
Albania that, on the basis of the talks held in Tirana during 
the visit of the Greek deputy public order minister on 8 and 9 
March 1994, he proposed that the working groups of the Public 
Order Ministries of both countries hold a meeting in Ioanniana 
on 20 April 1994, as scheduled in the plan. This meeting would 
examine the circumstances of the tragic 10 April incident. 
  The Government of the Republic of Albania agrees to hold the 
meeting scheduled for 20 April and exchange information on the 
terrorist act of 10 April. 
  However, considering the gravity of the Peshkepi massacre 
and 
a number of indisputable facts, such as the arrival from Greece 
and the return there of the terrorist unit, the fact that its 
members were wearing Greek uniforms, the objects found at the 
scene of the crime, the fact that they were Greek-speaking 
people, the military character of the target chosen for the 
attack, the methods used in commiting the crime, the repeated 
character of the military provocations, and many other pieces of 
evidence, the Albanian Government considers that the Greek side 
cannot take part in the assessment of the incident. Thus, the 
government thinks that the assessment of the incident should be 
done by an impartial commission set up by the European Union and 
the CSCE.

<F P=106> [Report by Fatos Baxhaku: "Expulsions Resume"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana -- Tension between Albania and Greece 
continues to rise after the 10 April terrorist assassination in 
the barracks in Peshkepi. Following mutual diplomatic 
recriminations, the two countries have raised the level of alert 
for their troops along the border and the first group of 
expelled Albanian refugees has now arrived in their homeland. 
On 13 April the Greek Defense Ministry ordered the 8th 
Division, which is deployed along the southern Albanian border, 
to maintain the highest possible level of alertness. The 
Albanians have also increased their military alertness on the 
other side of the border. "We have our men and units there and 
we will not allow such terrorist acts to be repeated," said Agim 
Shehu, a high-level Public Order Ministry official in Tirana, at 
a meeting organized with journalists. 
  Meanwhile, the first mass expulsions of Albanian refugees 
from Greece after the verification of the terrorist incident 
have taken place. On 14 April the Greek authorities expelled 
more than 1,500 Albanian refugees. Most of them passed through 
the Kakavije border post, only a few km from the point where the 
innocent victims were killed. 
  The bitter diplomatic war between Tirana and Athens 
continues. The Albanian Foreign Ministry has decided to cut its 
staff in Greece and at the same time has demanded reciprocal 
measures from the Greek side. A note delivered to the Greek 
ambassador in Tirana has demanded the reduction of the number of 
diplomatic staff in Tirana to six. The Greek diplomats must 
leave Albanian territory within 10 days. Robo, first secretary 
of the Albanian Embassy in Athens, and Iacovou, Greek consul in 
Gjirokaster, left their posts yesterday. Tirana made this 
decision on the basis of the lack of a reciprocal agreement on 
the number of necessary diplomatic staff. Thus, contacts between 
Albanian and Greece are reduced to the lowest level since the 
establishment of diplomatic relations in 1971. 
  Albanian experts believe that there is no doubt that special 
Greek forces were the culprits in the massacre at Peshkepi, and 
that the assassination was planned. Two high-level Public Order 
Ministry officials, Shehu and Mucmataj, confirmed this 
conclusion once again, showing journalists material proof that, 
according to them, demonstrated this. "The commandos' behavior, 
the precise selection of the target for their attack, the Greek 
military uniforms, and objects found at the scene of the 
incident all support our conclusion," Shehu said. Athens 
continues to deny this. According to its spokesman Evangelos 
Venizelos, the Greek Government is still awaiting Tirana's 
response to its proposal for the creation of a joint commission 
to investigate the incident. Moreover, Greek Foreign Minister 
Karolos Papoulias has proposed to his Albanian counterpart 
Serreqi a meeting in a neutral country to discuss the 
possibility of settling the crisis between the two countries. 
  In the meantime, an investigation of the Albanian servicemen 
accused of negligence of military responsibilities has also 
begun. According to Mucmataj, three Albanian officers are under 
investigation. An inspector of the Border Police from 
Gjirokaster and two servicemen in the unit where the murders 
took place are to face proceedings, after being released after 
two days' detention. "It is up to the procurator to make further 
decisions," Mucmataj said.

<F P=106> [Statement by the Albanian Journalists League; place and </F>
date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] At 1500 on 12 April the Serbian police at the 
border point of Qafe Morine held Adeleide Filket Timer, chief of 
the Albanian section of the German Radio Deutsche Welle, and the 
radio's correspondent in Tirana, Dr. Apollon Bace, who is a 
member of the Albanian Journalists League, for seven hours. 
They were in Yugoslavia and the German journalist had a special 
reporter's visa. 
  Three persons who arrived from the center interrogated the 
journalists and set them free at midnight, even though Mrs. 
Timer is at an advance stage of pregnancy. The Serbian police 
sequestered all the tapes with interviews of Albanian 
personalities in Kosova and Montenegro, books, even personal 
cards and money. One of the policemen told the reporters: I 
would have sent you to prison if those from the center had not 
released you. 
  The Albanian Journalists League protests this act of 
banditry 
of the Serbian police forces and appeals to international 
organizations to increase the pressure against the Belgrade 
regime to stop the maltreatment of journalists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given: "Citizens Do 
Not Vote on the Basis of Party Suggestions"] 
  [Text] One should not attribute exaggerated importance to 
declarations made during the election campaign, Gyula Horn, 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] chairman, told us. Gyula Horn 
said that the parties winning the elections will be able to form 
a government because there are no big differences between the 
various programs and many people would like to get into power 
and even more people want a change. Speaking about persons, 
Gyula Horn said that they would welcome non-party members Ferenc 
Glatz and Kalman Kulcsar in the government. 
  [Szombathy] Although the comparison of various party 
programs would make it possible to form coalitions, the attitude 
of political forces in the election campaign is weakening the 
chances of agreement. For example, the chairman of the 
Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], a party you called 
unacceptable to the MSZP, called cooperation with the Socialists 
"the kiss of death." Can these contradictions be still bridged? 
  [Horn] One should not attribute exaggerated importance to 
declarations made during the election campaign: One can find a 
wide gap between the promises of the 1990 election campaign and 
the implementation of these promises. There are no major 
differences between the programs of leading political parties: 
Almost without exception, everyone wants to continues 
privatization and agrees with the importance of agriculture. 
The difference lies in who wants to do what in reality. We do 
not react to various declarations; we only reply to blatant 
statements. We treat the accusations in accordance with our 
style prevailing so far, and I only react to unfounded 
accusations. However, it is a particular development that the 
right-wing conservatives and the liberal forces regard the left 
as their main opponent. The probable reason for this is that 
the socialists are regarded as having the biggest chance of 
winning. 
  [Szombathy] However, there is an interesting harmony between 
your opinion and that of [Prime Minister] Peter Boross according 
to which both of you count on a conservative-left-wing 
competition.... 
  [Horn] With the exception of a few hundred people, no one is 
interested in these speculations. Citizens will not vote on the 
basis of party suggestions. I never said that that the liberal 
parties might not have a weight in the 1994 elections although, 
in the long term, I imagine a role similar to that prevailing in 
Western Europe for them. To find the common contact points is 
much more important than this, because people want change, and 
the main goal of this change is to replace the current coalition. 
  [Szombathy] Together with yourself, several MSZP leaders 
expressed their openness toward a coalition made up of the MSZP, 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the Federation of 
Young Democrats [Fidesz]. Do you think that this is 
increasingly strange, given the growing rejection of the Fidesz? 
  [Horn] I would rather say that all this is manifested on the 
part of some Fidesz leaders. I do not attribute particular 
importance to these declarations, because Viktor Orban and his 
followers change their opinions frequently. However, we will 
also stick to our guidelines and ideas after May. Hungary needs 
a predictable political activity; I am sorry for the Fidesz 
because they gave up their earlier rational and calm policy. It 
is difficult to find out why the Fidesz changed their earlier 
popular attitude. 
  [Szombathy] What is your opinion about the chances of 
forming a government? It seems that the current system of 
political parties in Hungary is still pliable and, thus, it is 
no accident that Peter Boross said that the government can still 
function as an executive for a long time and that parliamentary 
cycle shorter than four years cannot be excluded either. 
  [Horn] Every day spent in power is obviously important for 
the present government. It is terrible to think what can still 
happen in the remaining weeks. It is enough to mention that it 
was precisely the KDNP that asked that the privatization be 
stopped. Coalition talks lasted more than five weeks in 1990 
and, presumably, this period of time will not be shorter this 
time either. However, a new government can be formed, and the 
victorious parties will be able to come to an agreement. Many 
people would like to get into the executive power, and even more 
people want to get rid of the present style. Thus, individual 
and social interests are equal. However, there is a danger, 
namely the one predicted by Peter Boross: The new government 
will be facing a very difficult period. Stability will require 
social dialogue and agreement. 
  [Szombathy] The party system has partially lost the 
citizens' confidence since 1990. Do you think that, after the 
current promises, the new government will continue to be faced 
with further loss of confidence? 
  [Horn] The citizens will display confidence and patience if 
professional and honest people form the new government. On our 
part, we would like to see nonparty-affililated experts in the 
next government like Ferenc Glatz or Kalman Kulcsar, people who 
stand comparison with their current colleagues. The MSZP will 
continue to maintain a social dialogue. The new government will 
not have room for maneuver without such a dialogue. 
  [Szombathy] Do you continue to regard yourself as the number 
one target among the opposition politicians? 
  [Horn] Yes, especially among the client journalists of the 
government parties, who are trying to discredit me with every 
possible means. One thing is certain: If we have anything to 
do with the next government, we will not allow any kind of 
government party press around us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Workers Party Chairman Gyula Thurmer by </F>
Lajos Pogonyi; place and date not given: "Thurmer: We Have 
Athenian Democracy Here"] 
  [Text] Is Prime Minister Peter Boross right in saying that 
the country would come to grief by listening to Gyula Horn 
[chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP]? To what can 
we attribute the Workers Party's increasing popularity? We 
interviewed Gyula Thurmer on these issues among others. 
  [Pogonyi] Do you agree with Peter Boross who recently said 
that the country would come to grief if it listened to Gyula 
Horn, namely to his statement that the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF] government has to be replaced? 
  [Thurmer] This poor country came to grief when it elected 
the current government and when the parliamentary parties did 
not force early elections in December 1993. If the country 
listened to Boross, its days would be limited. 
  [Pogonyi] To remain with the prime minister's words, he said 
that the elections would be decided between the MDF and the 
MSZP, and that the liberal parties would be a "natural wastage." 
In your view, what will be at stake at the elections? 
  [Thurmer] It is almost a fact that the Boross government 
will fail at the elections. The real stake is whether the 
consolidation of the capitalist system that was imported from 
the West in 1990 will continue or Hungary will choose a way of 
development in which the millions of workers also find their 
place. 
  [Pogpnyi] In your view, what kind of system do we now have 
in Hungary? 
  [Thurmer] This system mostly reminds me of the democracy of 
Athens. 
  [Pogonyi] In what way? 
  [Thurmer] Five percent had a perfect and pleasant life while 
95 percent of the population were slaves. We would like the 
majority to feel good. 
  [Pogonyi] I think that you are not the only one who says 
this. The question is which party the electors will believe. 
  [Thurmer] I feel that the Socialist Party has a better 
chance to implement this policy and to achieve prosperity for 
the majority. In my view, the liberal parties do not have enough 
strength or consistency to deviate from the model of capitalist 
consolidation. The liberals might not drop out but I am 
convinced that they will not be the ones who determine the 
country's future. All depends on how much courage the MSZP's 
leadership has. 
  [Pogonyi] Courage for what? 
  [Thurmer] Today, one needs courage to govern the country and 
to deviate from the current road. If the MSZP tries to find 
allies from the right then it will sooner or later find itself 
in conflict with ordinary people, many of whom will have voted 
for them, and the party might even get into conflict with its 
own members. 
  [Pogonyi] And if the MSZP seeks allies from the left? 
  [Thurmer] The Workers Party is the main candidate here. In 
this case, the MSZP would have a bigger chance to successfully 
solve society's problems. 
  [Pogonyi] Will the Workers Party have the necessary 5 
percent to get into parliament? You recently predicted 7 to 8 
percent for yourselves. 
  [Thurmer] According to the data of the National Electoral 
Committee, some 1,800 individual parliamentary candidates have 
been registered in the country. Taking an average of 1,000 
nomination slips per candidate, this means some 1.8 million 
slips. The Workers' Party candidates collected much more, a 
multiple of a thousand nomination slips on average. 
  [Pogonyi] You now have 156 individual candidates, in 20 
regional lists. 
  [Thurmer] This means that the Workers' Party collected some 
7 to 9 percent of the nomination slips. We are happy that very 
many young people gave us their nomination slips, and very many 
people said that although they were afraid to do this, however, 
they would certainly vote for us at the elections. If no 
violent acts take place in the country and there is no rough and 
obvious cheating at the elections then the Workers Party will be 
in parliament. 
  [Pogonyi] Personally, to what do you attribute the Workers 
Party's relative advancement? Is nostalgia for the former 
regime so widespread? 
  [Thurmer] People are now judging on the basis of their own 
experiences. Boross is saying it in vain that the economic 
situation is better now than in 1989-1990. It is impossible to 
explain it to 1 million unemployed people that, as a matter of 
fact, they are living in prosperity. People with large 
families, or others, especially the school leavers who are 
without jobs, or the deceived teachers cannot be persuaded to 
believe this. Everyone knows that the Workers Party is not 
responsible for the past four years. If any consistent 
opposition party existed in the past four years then that was 
us. We did not make compromises or pacts, we do not have 
headquarters affairs, and our deputies are not members of boards 
of directors in banks. People can see this and they trust in 
us. Within the party, we have seen an important change of 
generations. I have had a look through the national lists of 
parties. Well, none of them have a 23 years old laborer from 
Csepel or 30 years old nuclear engineer from Paks. Apart from 
the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] the parties are full 
of elderly gentlemen -- although their number is increasing in 
the Fidesz, too. 
  [Pogonyi] What is the opinion of the Workers Party on the 
media's current situation? You have not yet said much about 
this. 
  [Thurmer] We are in favor of the freedom of the press. We 
have sympathy for the 129 dismissed radio journalists, and we 
made this view public, but even the affected people did not 
write about this. They have our sympathy, even though some of 
the dismissed people have not had much sympathy for us in the 
past four years. Today, a real freedom of the press does not 
exist, therefore, it will be very difficult to neutralize four 
years of brainwashing with tulips [symbol of the MDF] in the 
remaining four weeks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Fur, defense minister and chairman of </F>
the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Janos Papp; place and date 
not given: "Many Possible Chances -- Lajos Fur in Nagykovacsi"] 
  [Text] At the campaign meeting of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF] on 12 April, Lajos Fur gave a speech on the 
activities of the Hungarian parliament and Government and on the 
achievements of the MDF. Among other things, he said that the 
government has many times been called a dilettante, mainly by 
the left wing, and at other times it was accused of lack of 
expertise, but the facts prove otherwise. Parliament has 
functioned undisturbed in the past four years and it created 
more than 400 laws. The MDF and its partners were able to 
ensure the country's security and stability and, owing to the 
population's wisdom, calmness and discipline were preserved. It 
is not by chance that, at the end of the four-year governmental 
cycle, the MDF is thanking the Hungarian people for calm and 
cooperation. Lajos Fur spoke about establishing the conditions 
for economic boom, settling the ownership relations in 
agriculture, and finally he said that a healthy national 
self-esteem is needed and, being aware of this, people will 
decide in favor of continuing on the current road. 
  Lajos Fur gave an interview to our correspondent after the 
campaign meeting. 
  [Papp] To what extent does the result of the nomination of 
candidates that ended on 8 April justify the former statements 
according to which the Polish syndrome, where parties belonging 
to the fragmented center and the right wing excluded themselves 
from the possibility of governing, may be repeated in Hungary? 
  [Fur] The Hungarian political forces are not as fragmented 
as they were in Poland. Several outcomes are still possible 
here. The contest will be decided between the left wing and the 
center or center-right forces. I can still see a great chance 
that the some 40 percent of the electors who still have not 
decided whether to vote at all will, in the remaining three to 
four weeks, decide to support the center and right-wing forces, 
rather than the left wing. 
  [Papp] During their discussions with the current socialist 
leaders of the former communist countries, the left-wing 
politicians spend much time talking about the issue of the 
interest representation of Hungarians living beyond the border. 
What are your views on this? 
  [Fur] I could put it this way: Recently, everyone seems to 
have become a very true Hungarian. People who previously spoke 
about Christian regime, preached or screeched about the yokels' 
style of showing one's being a true Hungarian, have now suddenly 
realized that they support the Christian churches, and they 
foster the cause of Hungarians beyond the border; many such 
campaign measures have been included in the propaganda of 
certain parties recently. I hope that the public will remember 
what the same people said about the church, Christianity, and 
the Hungarians a few months ago. They will also hopefully 
remember how our critics voted in Parliament on these issues. 
  [Papp] The Socialists have not named their prime ministerial 
candidate and Prime Minister Peter Boross objected to this a few 
days ago. 
  [Fuir] Yes, there is some mysticism in this issue. The 
former communists and post-communists always adhered to the 
practice that they did not inform anyone about their decision, 
they thought they would make their decisions internally and then 
let the public know later. I am afraid that this is again a 
case of the old reflexes.

  [Text] Gyorgy Csoti, foreign affairs spokesman of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], has held a press briefing 
about the MDF's foreign policy views. Judit Laszlo supplies the 
details. 
  [Laszlo] The MDF welcomes the policy of Slovak Prime 
Minister 
Jozef Moravcik because his government is willing to hold a 
dialogue, Gyorgy Csoti, the party's foreign affairs spokesman, 
said when analyzing Hungarian-Slovak relations. In connection 
with the southern Slav crisis, Gyorgy Csoti said that the 
slowdown in negotiations is alarming. In his view, Russia and 
the West ought to coordinate their activity more closely to 
resolve the crisis. 
  The foreign affairs spokesman called attention to the 
dangerous phenomena of Hungarian party politics, particularly in 
connection with a statement made by Gyula Horn, chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. 
  Gyula Horn met with Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman 
yesterday and then told journalists that in the view of the MSZP 
an agreement is possible concerning the issue of a 
Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty. According to Gyorgy Csoti, 
this suggests that it is the fault of the current Hungarian 
Government that a basic treaty has not so far been signed and 
that an agreement would be possible if the MSZP came to power. 
  For this reason, the MDF, having drawn the general 
conclusions, is of the view that the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] and the MSZP -- presumably in a coordinated manner -- 
are subordinating basic foreign political interests to party 
goals in the election campaign. This conduct seriously harms 
the country's security; it weakens our negotiating positions 
with Slovakia, Romania, and Serbia, and it makes a historical 
reconciliation with our neighbors impossible, the MDF statement 
points out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Pozsgay, chairman of the National </F>
Democratic Federation, by Jozsef Peter; place and date not 
given: "National Consensus Also in the Economy"] 
  [Text] [Peter] In the heat of the election campaign, 
every party offers lower taxes and greater benefits to investors 
and prospective voters. I presume you are doing the same. Is 
there any original idea in the economic program of the National 
Democratic Federation [NDSZ]? 
  [Pozsgay] Our program has two basic elements: One is the 
starting of economic growth, the other is the protection of 
domestic industry and production, and we will also contribute to 
this with protectionist laws if necessary. This is not 
something to hide at all. I visited the United States recently 
and I saw there a protectionist legislature bordering on 
discrimination. I think we also have an original idea on how to 
handle our debts. We are convinced that we are unable to create 
adequate means for economic growth precisely because of the 
large-scale outflow of resources. We do not say that we do not 
want to pay at all; we only say that foreign debt is not a fate, 
but the consequence of a mistaken economic policy. Therefore, 
we want to renegotiate our repayment system. 
  [Peter] According to experts, this is impossible because of 
the structure of our foreign debt. 
  [Pozsgay] We also have experts who claim that the repayment 
conditions are renegotiable and that it is possible to handle 
even such a diversified and funded debt. It is possible to 
convince the creditors to invest their bonds in Hungary. The 
bonds of those who refuse to do this must be sold. This way, we 
could fulfill our repayment obligation while the money would 
stay here and could be used for development. Taking new credits 
is not risky in this system if the creditor is interested in 
domestic investment. 
  [Peter] You mentioned economic revival. How do you envisage 
this? 
  [Pozsgay] First of all, we must find the sources that make 
it possible to start the economic growth, in our view, manpower 
and the joining capital. As I already mentioned, we can get 
capital by restructuring our debt and by targeted capital 
investment, and not one that further increases our debts. All 
this is needed for this well-trained society capable of work to 
be able to work. We think it is a mistaken policy to focus on 
handling unemployment; our goal is to create employment, and 
economic growth is a precondition for this. We also think it is 
important to develop a credit system to support the new 
ventures, a system that would also give a chance for the people 
working in agriculture and food production to survive. 
  [Peter] The NDSZ has a rather original idea on 
privatization. If I recall it correctly, in one of your 
speeches, you mentioned a privatization by referendum. 
  [Pozsgay] My words were probably misunderstood, because I 
spoke of national consensus, and not a referendum and, in my 
opinion, the fate of our national property also belongs here. 
We say that we should convene a national coordination congress 
to deal with the preparation of a new constitution and the 
coordination of public interests regarding the protection of 
national property. As a result, the big national interest 
organizations could come to an agreement, like the state, the 
employers, and the employees in Austria and Spain. Among other 
things, this agreement would deal with the management of our 
national sovereignty; in other words, we must decide what we can 
give away from our independence regained with bitter struggle 
for the benefit of our joining the international integration. 
  [Peter] What is your opinion about the privatization 
practice? 
  [Pozsgay] In my opinion, in working out the concept of 
privatization, a very important element was overlooked, namely 
that we are not talking here simply about the exchange of 
property, but about a change in social structure. Therefore, 
the Hungarian privatization cannot be compared with the British 
one, for example, where privatization is simply a matter of 
rates: When the Labour Party is in power, they nationalize 
property; when the Conservative Party is in power, they engage 
in privatization. They can do that, because all this only 
affect a tiny part of the national property. There has been no 
privatization in Hungary before; we must change a system called 
socialist and of stalinist origin into a market economy: almost 
90 percent of industrial equipment and millions of workers. 
Therefore, in my opinion, corruption is not the biggest mistake 
of the Hungarian privatization, because this is only something 
that accompanies the distribution, something that originates 
from a lack of concept. 
  [Peter] You said in one of your interviews that the party 
that can bring hope to people will win the upcoming elections. 
In your opinion, is the NDSZ capable of doing this? 
  [Pozsgay] Yes, because we offer work to the people. If they 
have work, their living conditions will improve and their fear 
from tomorrow will disappear. Let us not forget that we are 
part of European civilization and people adjust their demands to 
this. If needed, people can give up some of their demands, but 
they will not endure deprivation beyond a certain limit. 
Therefore, we must provide a systematic security to the weak 
strata of the population and to the backward areas. Unless we 
come to our senses, our capital city will soon resemble Mexico, 
while other areas become poor and deserted. 
  [Peter] Regarding its economic program, with what other 
party could the NDSZ cooperate? 
  [Pozsgay] If you allow me, I will not name parties here; 
instead, I will say that we can cooperate with all the parties 
engaged in the protection of domestic production and domestic 
market and which regard domestic bourgeois civilization and the 
necessary modernization as essential. We also think that the 
national feeling is not an obstacle in all this; on the 
contrary, only a nation can create a community. Without a 
community image, we will become a smeared manpower source in 
Europe at most.

  [Excerpts] The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 
has called representatives of its branches to Budapest in 
connection with the election campaign. Katalin Horvath reports. 
  [Horvath] [passage omitted] The representatives of the 
party's branches summed up the party's program in 12 points as 
follows: They are to encourage investments; they are to support 
business enterprises and abolish the minimum tax; they are to 
reduce the burdens of personal income tax; they will create new 
work opportunities since they are to build roads, railways, 
hospitals, and health care institutions; they support young 
people's efforts to build their home as well as families with 
children; they are to increase agricultural subsidies; they are 
to combat middleman trade; they are to reduce the number of 
state offices; they are to step up the struggle against economic 
crime; and they are to pay more attention to public order. 
  The 12 points also include support for health tourism and 
village tourism as well as health protection and health 
education. The KDNP continues to support the churches and as a 
constituent part of the government they would introduce morals 
into the school curriculum.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Popularity of Party List Leaders"] </F>
  [Text] Compared to February, 4 percent more people were 
able to decide in March whom they would welcome as government 
head out of 10 party list leaders. Gyula Horn's advantage 
increased by the same proportion, which is a little higher than 
the incidental fluctuation, while the other changes are within 
the error margin, this can be learned from the latest Median 
public opinion survey that was carried out under MAGYAR HIRLAP's 
commission [between 18 and 23 March on a sample of 1,200 adults]. 
  The electors' knowledge about the main actors in politics is 
increasing. In January hardly any of the surveyed people were 
able to identify the party affiliation of all 10 list leaders, 
while the proportion of the fully informed people increased to 
11 percent by March. Only the knowledge about the party 
affiliation of Zoltan Kiraly [chairman of the Social Democratic 
Party of Hungary, MSZDP] did not increase. More than 700,000 
people (9 percent) learned the name of Gabor Kuncze [list leader 
for the Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] between February and 
March, 5 percent of people learned the name of Tamas Nagy 
[chairman of the Agrarian Federation], and the generally 
well-known politicians also became somewhat better known. All 
this means that the campaign has an effect on people and an 
increasing number of them are paying attention to the political 
actors.

  The popularity order of party list leaders has again been 
rearranged. Out of the 10 list leaders, the popularity of six 
decreased to a lesser or greater extent, especially among those 
people who do not want to vote for the party of the given list 
leader in May, and among those who do not yet have an 
established party preference. Therefore, as knowledge about the 
politicians is increasing, views on them are becoming more 
polarized. 
  The scandal at the radio probably damaged Peter Boross's 
popularity. Two-thirds of people were informed about this case, 
and two-thirds of these people considered the dismissals unjust. 
Among these people, the prime minister's popularity is 14 
points lower than among those who do not have an opinion on this 
event, and 22 percent lower than among people who considered the 
dismissals rightful. The popularity of [Republic Party 
Chairman] Janos Palotas and Zoltan Kiraly has also faded. 
Rather than their popularity benefiting their parties, the fact 
that they entered the election battle heading relatively small 
parties seems to have damaged their prestige.

  With the help of cluster analysis, people who were able to 
asses the majority of politicians can be put into five 
categories. Cluster analysis is a mathematical-statistical 
method that classifies people in such a way that the difference 
should be minimal between those who are in one group on the 
basis of their sympathy for list leaders, while the difference 
between the groups is maximal. The members of the various 
groups differ in their political views and their tastes. People 
in the same group are mainly similar to each other in their 
receptiveness to a political style. 
  People who do not reject any of the politicians are in the 
first group. Even the assessment of Jozsef Torgyan [chairman 
of the Independent Smallholders Party, FKGP] and Istvan Csurka 
[cochairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP] are 
average. These people obviously respect the fame and authority 
of politicians. The proportion of this group in the electorate 
is 25 percent. This type is somewhat more common (30 to 33 
percent) among people living in villages, in the 50 to 59 age 
group, the voters of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], and 
those who do not have established party preferences. The same 
proportion (23 percent) of this group would like to see Horn as 
prime minister as Boross. 
  For the second group, the opposition politicians -- except 
for Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats, 
Fidesz] -- are generally attractive. The popularity of Horn is 
exceptionally high, while the government members are unpopular, 
and Torgyan and Csurka are the two most disagreeable list 
leaders. These people are influenced by left-wing sentiment in 
their views on the politicians and they presumably reject the 
frightening, authoritarian, and extreme attitudes. Their 
proportion is also 25 percent. This way of thinking is somewhat 
more common (30 to 38 percent) among people in Budapest, those 
between the ages of 40 and 49, and university graduates. Some 
52 percent of MSZP supporters and 36 percent of SZDSZ supporters 
are in this group. Sixty percent of these people would welcome 
Horn as prime minister and 16 percent would welcome Kuncze. 
  The popularity marks of Orban, Palotas, and Kuncze are 
higher 
than the average in the third group while the prime minister and 
especially the chairmen of the MIEP and the FKGP are very 
unpopular. These people obviously are open to liberal politics 
and reject the political style based on emotions. Their 
proportion is 22 percent but this is somewhat higher (27 
percent) among people between the ages of 30 and 39 and among 
middle-school graduates. Some 45 percent of Fidesz voters and 
37 percent of SZDSZ voters belong to this group. Similar 
proportions of this group (20 percent each) would like to see 
Horn, Kuncze, Orban, and Palotas as prime minister. 
  For the fourth group, only Boross and Laszlo Surjan 
[chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party, KDNP] are 
acceptable politicians. They respect authority, they are 
pro-government, but they reject the extreme right-wing attitude. 
Their proportion is 17 percent, but one-third of pensioner age 
people can be found here. Forty-seven percent of MDF voters and 
43 percent of KDNP voters belong here. Boross would be welcome 
as prime minister by 45 percent of them and Surjan by 11 percent. 
  Finally, the fifth group consists of people among whom 
Torgyan and Csurka are exceptionally popular, but Boross's and 
Surjan's popularity is also above the average. The majority of 
these people feel antagonistic toward the other list leaders. 
They are obviously influenced by their right-wing attitude in 
assessing the politicians, and they are susceptible to a 
political style that affects the emotions. Their proportion is 
11 percent. Very few people from Budapest or those with higher 
education (3 to 6 percent), while 22 percent of the unemployed 
are in this group. More than half of the FKGP's and MIEP's 
supporters belong here. Torgyan is seen by one-third of them as 
suitable to lead the new government, Boross by one-quarter, 
Surjan by 10 percent, and Csurka by 6 percent.

  [Text] The Press Center of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
[BSP] has announced that Zhan Videnov, chairman of the BSP 
Supreme Council, who is a member of the Consultative Council on 
National Security, has sent a letter to President Zhelyu Zhelev 
in which he sharply protests the fact that the problem of the 
transshipment of the UN Protection Forces equipment has not been 
discussed in the Consultative Council of National Security. 
  The letter points out that the president has once again 
proven his intention to turn the council into a declarative 
organ or a curtain behind which machinations are conducted. 
  Similar actions cannot be described as a manifestation of 
concern with the country's security, the protest letter of Zhan 
Videnov to the president of the Republic points out.

  [Text] During the night of 17 April, an hour earlier than 
scheduled, the UN convoy with military equipment for the Blue 
Helmets in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] arrived from Romania at Ruse central train station. 
  The contradictory information about the transit route 
through 
Bulgarian territory and the hour at which the train will depart 
from Ruse prompted us to contact our reporter in Ruse, Natasha 
Dimitrova. 
  [Begin Dimitrova recording] The UN convoy, which arrived 
yesterday night at Ruse central train station, departed this 
morning at 0148. The reason for the delay in the departure was 
related to 25 wagons being unsealed and the accompanying 
documents missing. 
  According to the Bulgarian railroad authorities, receiving 
the convoy in this form from the Romanian colleagues was 
irregular. After a long dispute and clarifications, the two 
sides signed a protocol and prior to the departure the equipment 
was sealed with Romanian seals. No information about the 
precise amount of missing contents has been published. [end

  [Excerpt] Government sources claimed yesterday that U.S. 
Ambassador William Montgomery has recently been insisting that 
Turkish Blue Helmets be allowed to pass through Bulgaria. 
According to the sources, very heavy pressure has been applied 
to the president and top Bulgarian diplomats. To some of them, 
it was allegedly even hinted that if Sofia gives way, its 
problems in connection with debt negotiations with the Paris and 
Frankfurt Clubs will be solved. 
  U.S. Congress representatives and Turkish Parliament 
deputies 
have reportedly called upon the government and head of state to 
decide to grant a corridor for the Turkish peacekeepers. 
According to their thesis, these troops would not be under the 
Turkish flag but serving in UN units; therefore Bulgaria has no 
grounds not to allow them in. 
  According to the Constitution, only parliament can permit 
the 
passage of foreign troops through Bulgarian territory. William 
Cook, press attache at the U.S. Embassy in Sofia, yesterday 
categorically denied that U.S. official authorities were 
launching an attack on our institutions to pressure them to 
allow the passage of Turkish peacekeeping units. [passage

  [Text] Sofia, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Foreign Ministers 
Stanislav Daskalov of Bulgaria and Vladislav Jovanovic of 
Yugoslavia said in Sofia on Sunday that peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should bring about the lifting of sanctions 
against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) which had affected its 
Bulgarian neighbours and other European countries. 
  Jovanovic, who arrived in Bulgaria from Greece late on 
Saturday, has told TANJUG the talks brought to light a shared 
view that the embargo has been rendered obsolete by developments 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and that it was detrimental to all the 
countries in the region. 
  Jovanovic, who has ended his visit to Sofia and left for 
Belgrade, said that there were no questions outstanding or any 
serious problems between the two friendly countries. 
  Bulgaria and Yugoslavia have a large stock of good will and 
awareness of the importance of the neighbours and the 
inter-relations of their interests and fates, which will allow 
their relations to bloom after the lifting of the sanctions, 
said Jovanovic.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Goran Gotev: "United States, NATO, and </F>
United Nations Have Declared War on the Serbs"] 
  [Text] The United States and NATO have entered into a war 
against the Bosnian Serbs. This time, without the usual 
ultimatum given in such cases, U.S. F-16 planes from the NATO 
base in Aviano dropped three bombs on 10 April about 13 km 
southwest of Gorazde. Yesterday NATO aircraft renewed the air 
strikes. 
  Throughout Sunday the Western media agitated for these 
strikes. Report after report came off the printers that the 
Serbs had already entered Gorazde, that chemical weapons had 
been used, causing about 1,500 deaths, that street fighting was 
going on in the town, and that thousands of patients were 
fleeing in panic to avoid becoming victims of a Serbian 
slaughter. Thus, this time, the world electronic media carried 
out the preliminary "softening up by artillery bombardment." 
When the U.S. Phantoms [as published] carried out their air 
strikes, it was even immediately insinuated that they had been 
approved by the UN secretary general and that Russia had also 
given her consent. Subsequently it turned out that President 
Clinton was unable to answer a question that President Yeltsin 
asked him on the telephone as to whether Butrus-Ghali had 
approved the air strikes against the Serbs. It also 
materialized that Yeltsin had not only not given his consent to 
the strikes, but had demanded an urgent meeting of the UN 
Security Council to discuss the issue. 
  Now it is already clear that the U.S. bombs dropped near 
Gorazde had been planned in advance. This act of war was 
already known about when U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry 
and John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Council of Joint Chiefs 
of Staff were assuring the world that the United States and NATO 
did not plan any intervention around Gorazde. By saying this, 
they simply inflamed the Serbs' ambitions to capture the town, 
because for them it represented an important guarantee, as it 
transformed the Drina River into a Serbian river, instead of a 
border between Bosnia and Serbia. 
  Furthermore, it is no accident that the United States and 
NATO are joining the side of one of the warring parties at the 
moment when no other than the Bosnian Serbs made a comprehensive 
proposal for a lasting and stable peace. However, it transpired 
that the Bosniaks feared that it might lead to the present front 
lines becoming border divisions. 
  Russian special envoy Vitaliy Churkin arrived in Belgrade to 
try to persuade the Serbs to put an end to the war. However, it 
is much more uncertain whether U.S. special envoy Charles Redman 
will persuade the Bosnians to stop counting on warfare and 
international military intervention, especially at a moment when 
this intervention has already begun. 
  As a first emotional reaction, the Bosnian Serbs broke off 
relations with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. It is doubtful 
whether this is a sensible step. Now no one should try to 
pretend to be offended or insulted. It is not the right time 
now for either bad blood or acts of revenge, but the time for 
immediately resuming the negotiations process, with all three 
parties taking part on an equal footing. As the war approaches 
its second anniversary this month, let this not mark the 
beginning of a new war, this time with the participation of the 
16 NATO states.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of Supreme Council of </F>
the Bulgarian Socialist Party, BSP, by Ivan Petrov; place and 
date not given: "BSP Supports a United, Well-Trained Army That 
Is Ready To Fight"] 
  [Excerpts] [Petrov] Mr. Videnov, after the meeting of the 
Consultative Council on National Security, DUMA wrote that 
perhaps "the Army may threaten to rebel because of a purge." Is 
this true? 
  [Videnov] I would not say so. During these last four years 
of change the Bulgarian officers corps has displayed a high 
degree of statesman-like thinking and is not threatening any 
revolt. However, now certain circles that aim to provoke the 
officers corps to extreme acts and bring it into confrontation 
with the institutions of state are yet again undertaking 
ill-considered, chaotic, and perhaps even premeditated acts. We 
must not allow them to get away with this! 
  [Petrov] Nonetheless, tension is rising among the 
servicemen. 
  [Videnov] I completely share their anxiety about the planned 
mass dismissals based on length of service and the PSSD 
[Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy] will do everything 
possible to prevent such a dangerous step, especially as it is 
not difficult to see the political motive behind this, namely to 
remove the so-called military cadres with a communist past by 
causing confrontation between young and "old" officers. If we 
allow this to happen, we may provoke a similar situation in the 
army to that which existed in the twenties, in 1934, and in 
1944. However, I will reiterate that I am firmly convinced that 
"repetitions" will not be permitted and there will be no 
"revolts." 
  [Petrov] Nevertheless, redundancies in the army appear to be 
unavoidable. 
  [Videnov] No one is against them, but they must be made in a 
well-planned manner, within the framework of a process of 
reorganizing the army, not in the form of a "slaughter to the 
last man" under the pretext of lack of money. [passage omitted] 
  [Petrov] However, the ratio between the numbers of command 
staff and the rank and file does make an impression. 
  [Videnov] To the uninformed and prejudiced reader or 
listener, it would seem so. It is not difficult to mislead the 
uninformed citizen. It is true that the numbers of the command 
staff and the rank and file are approximately equal, but this is 
not due to us having too many officers, but because the numbers 
of conscripts are insufficient even to supplement the army's 
peacetime strength of enlisted men. Given that we have decided 
to have a small but high- quality army in peacetime, the second 
condition for guaranteeing our security is to have an adequate 
command staff that can ensure their deployment in time of war 
(if necessary) and provide a competent administration to form 
the basis of a professional army. Everything else is populism 
or pure lies -- I am thinking of the claims made by General 
Lyutskanov of the Reserve that the Turkish General Staff 
consists of barely 500 officers. [passage omitted] 
  [Petrov] Defense Minister Aleksandrov plans not to pay 
monetary compensation to redundant officers, but to give them 
securities instead. 
  [Videnov] First, this is illegal, because they are being 
compulsorily retired, and second, this compensation is granted 
to the officers to meet their essential needs and help them to 
adapt to civilian life. I hope that even Valentin Aleksandrov 
has managed to dispel his illusions of "military caps filled 
with cash." [passage omitted] 
  [Petrov] What, then, is the solution to the present 
situation in the army? 
  [Videnov] We consider the following is necessary. First, 
parliament should pass the law on defense and the armed forces 
as soon as possible. Second, parliament -- perhaps through the 
National Security Commission or the Consultative Council on 
National Security -- should hear what the Defense Ministry and 
the General Staff have to say on the course of the army reform 
and should approve redundancies only within the framework of the 
reorganization of the armed services and after guaranteeing the 
social welfare of the officer corps. Otherwise, we may find 
ourselves in the paradoxical situation of having no senior 
officers in the headquarters at corps level and above and also 
having a shortage of young officers to command the platoons and 
companies. This is a reality, because we will dismiss between 
2,000 and 4,000 men annually, while only 600-800 men will 
graduate from the military schools. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] [Studio announcer] Zoran Lilic, president of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, held talks in Aleksandrovac 
Zupski with the communal leadership. Miroljub Simonovic reports 
from Krusevac. 
  [Begin recording] [Simonovic] By making the decision to 
bomb Serbian positions around Gorazde, the United Nations has 
lost credibility and trust in the mission it is carrying out, 
said President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Zoran Lilic 
in Aleksandrovac today, and added: 
  [Lilic] Because of its irresponsible and unprincipled and I 
would say rash behavior of some of its prominent personalities, 
and under the pressure of those who believe that they can 
realize their interests through force and to the disadvantage of 
others, the United Nations today is directly involved in 
unnecessary destruction and new victims in the area of the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It has become a contradiction to 
itself, and it does not even observe its own documents, not even 
the UN Charter. By making the decision to bomb Serbian 
positions around Gorazde, it has lost all credibility and trust 
in the mission it is carrying out. The only way for the United 
Nations to recover at least partially the role it has lost is to 
proceed immediately with the signing of a peace settlement for 
the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to deploy all its 
forces on the demarcation lines of the conflicts, to protect 
peace impartially, and primarily to enable political 
negotiations. This is what we in the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, the Republic of Serbia, and in the Republic of 
Montenegro have always considered the only right solution and 
the only real way out of the Yugoslav crisis. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Federal Assembly 
Chamber of Citizens today adopted a declaration resolutely 
condemning NATO's armed attacks under UN auspices on the Serbs 
in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which brought about destruction 
and civilian casualties. 
  The declaration was supported by 71 votes, and nine deputies 
abstained. "By launching these armed attacks, the United 
Nations has abandoned its impartial peacemaking role and openly 
sided with the Muslim side in the civil war in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," the declaration states. It also says the 
Federal Assembly expresses concern over the negative 
consequences of the attacks for the attempts to put an end to 
the civil war and find a just political solution in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The document notes that the escalation of the conflict took 
place because the Muslims were using the protected zones, 
Gorazde in particular, to attack Serb positions and because the 
United Nations failed to carry out disarmament within the 
protected zones, something it was duty-bound to do. Nor did the 
United Nations react to the Muslim military operations launched 
from these zones. 
  "In so doing, the United Nations took the risk and 
responsibility for every possible consequence, and they cannot 
be foreseen at the moment. It is a regrettable fact that it is 
precisely the United Nations, which under its charter is 
duty-bound to maintain peace and international security, is 
taking steps to escalate the war and threaten the peace 
process," the declaration says. 
  The Federal Assembly calls on the United Nations to 
immediately stop its aggressive operations against the Serbian 
people, to abandon their double standards applied to 
participants in the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, to 
restart a dialogue leading to the cessation of all military 
activities, and to seek solutions only by political means and 
through negotiations while heeding the interests of all sides. 
  The declaration stresses that the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia will continue its hitherto constructive policy of 
active participation in the peace process, but it cannot be 
indifferent to operations that are armed attacks against the 
Serbian people in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it will 
continue to follow further developments closely. 
  Dissatisfied with the fact that no debate preceded the 
adoption of the declaration, the deputies of the Serbian Radical 
Party and the People's Party of Montenegro walked out of the 
assembly hall.

  [Excerpt] A session of the FRY Assembly Chamber of 
Republics is under way in Belgrade. Vladimir Nikolic reports: 
  [Begin recording] The debate is under way about the text of 
the declaration condemning the air raid on Serbian positions 
around Gorazde by NATO under UN auspices. 
  Deputy Miodrag Vukovic expressed surprise that some media 
presented the declaration adopted at the Citizens' Chamber 
yesterday as the Federal Assembly's declaration and the Chamber 
of Republics is deciding on it only now. Until a document is 
adopted by both Federal Assembly chambers, it has not really 
been adopted, Vukovic said. 
  Deputy Novak Kilbarda is of the opinion that the declaration 
cannot be adopted this way. It is incomprehensible that the 
activities of both chambers are not synchronized when such major 
themes are at stake. Kilbarda has nothing against the 
declaration and wants it to be adopted, but does not agree with 
its text. He wondered why it does not say in the declaration 
that these were the Serbian defense positions and that what was 
involved is the Serbian Republic, and not the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Deputy Ilija Darmanovic criticized the fact that the 
declaration was adopted by the Chamber of Citizens without a 
debate and without anybody having said a thing. In Darmanovic's 
opinion, the text of the declaration is mild and was the reason 
the Serbian Radical Party deputies walked out of the session 
yesterday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Athens, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- The sanctions of the 
international community against the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia have become an obstacle to the restoration of peace 
and stability in the Balkans, FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias concluded 
at their talks in Athens today. 
  At a joint news conference following the official talks, 
Jovanovic said it had been agreed in the talks that sanctions 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had been made 
redundant a long time ago by the huge and important changes that 
had taken place in Bosnia itself and on the territory of former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The two ministers pointed to the negative consequences of 
the 
NATO air strikes against Serb positions in Bosnia and NATO 
siding with the Muslims. This action dealt a heavy blow to the 
peace process and the political process in the region, Jovanovic 
said, adding that now much more time and effort would be 
necessary to put the peace process back on track. 
  The sanctions have been inflicting damage even on those who 
designed and imposed them, Jovanovic said. He stressed there 
was no longer anyone who would be ready to take part in this, 
nor support the anachronism that was created in Bosnia and on 
the territory of former Yugoslavia. 
  Greek Minister Karolos Papoulias, having expressed pleasure 
over meeting Jovanovic again, pointed to the need for firmer 
cooperation between the Balkan countries in resolving the issue 
of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Speaking about sanctions, Papoulias said there was "scope 
for 
actions within the European Union." However, he spoke more 
about cooperation between the Balkan countries in that sphere, 
which, as he said, should take joint action. 
  "In a series of meetings with Bulgarian and Romanian 
colleagues, we agreed we would work together on the problem of 
sanctions," Papoulias said, convinced Hungary and Ukraine would 
join such an action. He said at today's talks they also 
discussed the idea of organizing an inter-Balkan conference on 
cooperation between the states in the Balkan region that would 
take place when peace was reached on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. "We have agreed with Minister Jovanovic to work in 
this direction with the ministers of other Balkan states," 
Papoulias said, listing Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary as first 
partners in connection with the idea. 
  Minister Jovanovic expressed his gratitude to Greece and to 
the Greek nation for the aid given to the Serb people. "This aid 
comes from the very soul, and that makes it even more precious," 
he said, stressing that the Serb and Greek nations were linked 
by ties of friendship that could not be severed. Jovanovic 
particularly expressed his gratitude in connection with an 
action currently taking place in Greece for gathering millions 
of signatures for a petition to suspend sanctions against the 
FRY, which would be sent to UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali. 
  The Yugoslav minister said the policy of peace, dialogue, 
and 
agreement was a permanent orientation of the FRY. That is why 
we are asking the international community to treat us on an 
equal footing. Everything that has been imposed on the Serb 
nation as a form of punishment must be removed to enable 
negotiations on an equal basis. "Talks cannot take place under 
the threat of bombing or under political and economic pressure," 
Jovanovic said. 
  It is expected that Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou 
will receive the Yugoslav foreign minister tomorrow morning.

<F P=106> [From the "Dnevnik 2" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Nikola Sainovic, deputy prime minister of the 
Federal Government, views for Dnevnik the protection of the 
dinar, the increase in production, and the first effects of the 
program for economic recovery. 
  [Begin Sainovic recording] The situation regarding the 
implementation of the program is completely stable. The best 
indication of this that I can present at the moment is that 
production, industrial production in March has increased in 
comparison to February by 21.3 percent. Let me remind you that 
in comparison to January, the production in February increased 
by 12.4 percent. This is [word indistinct] information that 
tells everyone that production is increasing. That is the basic 
reflection of stability. Prices have been stable for some time 
now, and I can also say that the National Bank's activities have 
secured (?funds) for procuring raw materials for the economy, in 
excess of $100 million. This will have a positive effect in the 
coming months. 
  Let me also add that the balance of the foreign currency 
exchange of both citizens and the economy with the National Bank 
and the merchant banks is positive [sentence as heard]. This 
means that foreign currency reserves are increasing, while the 
total activities and complete coordination of the Yugoslav 
National Bank, the Service for Monetary Transactions [Sluzba za 
platni promet], and the federal and republican governments has 
made sure that negative occurrences on the financial market have 
been efficiently suppressed. 
  You can see that in the past week the technology of handling 
ready cash has been altered. This, in turn, has led to a 
decrease of financial scams and an increased return of ready 
cash into the channels of monetary transactions. This 
coordinated activity has decreased the so-called sticung [the 
cut taken by dealers when selling foreign currency on the black 
market]. Some of these people are already behind bars. 
Therefore, this is a simple demonstration of the efficient, 
synchronized activity of all state bodies in maintaining the 
stability of the program. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, April 16 (TANJUG) -- Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev arrived here on Saturday evening for 
talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
  The unscheduled visit of the Russian foreign minister to 
Belgrade was obviously provoked by the deterioration of the 
situation in Bosnia which threatens to annul the frantic 
diplomatic efforts for putting the Bosnian peace process back on 
the rails. 
  Russia is actively participating in the process through its 
special envoy Vitaliy Churkin who is currently in Pale in the 
Bosnian Serb Republic. 
  Before leaving for Belgrade, Kozyrev urged a peaceful 
settlement of the Bosnian crisis and criticized both Moslems and 
Serbs. 
  In a statement to the Russian state television channel 
Ostankino, he said the situation would have been different had 
NATO consulted Russia about the air raids. 
  "Had Russia been consulted, a way to cool the hotheads among 
the Bosnian Serbs might have been found and they would have been 
advised against shelling Gorazde. With our partners, we would 
have probably found a way to warn the other side -- the Moslems 
-- against provoking the Serbs." 
  Kozyrev said the Moslem leadership had been undertaking 
provocative actions and Moslem troops had been opening fire on 
various sections of the front. "We know that and U.N. officials 
have confirmed it too." 
  The Moslems must stop their provocations, the Russian 
foreign 
minister said and added that what was needed was maximum 
restraint rather than a show of heroism on the part of the 
international community. 
  Kozyrev allowed for the application of the strictest 
possible 
measures, including air strikes, to protect U.N. troops on the 
ground. "It is quite a different matter whether and to what 
degree the NATO air raids against Bosnian Serbs had been 
justified and what was their effect," he said and added their 
immediate result was a major acceleration of the situation. 
  Kozyrev also said his deputy, Churkin, was on the spot where 
he was virtually trying to pin the hands of the Serbs and the 
Moslems. He is trying to do the same with the West, but so far 
with little success, he added. 
  The situation is at a turning point, said Kozyrev and added 
that thanks to Russia, prospects had been created for signing 
peace in Bosnia, after which steps should be taken to ease 
sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). 
  "The Serbs should see some kind of prospects opening before 
them," he said. 
  [Belgrade TANJUG in English at 2018 GMT on 16 April 
transmits 
the following message: "Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
received late on Saturday Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev on the latter's surprise arrival in Belgrade. 
  Milosevic and Kozyrev are conferring behind closed doors. 
  Kozyrev made no statement on arrival, but his talks with 
Milosevic are certain to concern the latest situation in war- 
shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina."]

<F P=106> [Slobodan Jankovic report] </F>
  [Excerpt] [Begin recording] [Jankovic] Owing to the 
extremely tense situation around Gorazde, Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrey Kozyrev arrived in Belgrade last night and 
immediately met with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The 
talks lasted two and a half hours, after which the two gave 
statements for the press and answered several questions. The 
essence of what was discussed and agreed upon was first 
disclosed by Serbian President Milosevic. 
  [Milosevic] We had a very good, open talk about, I would 
say, key issues, primarily the crisis in this area. The main 
focus of our talks was on events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I am 
pleased to say that we have a very similar, or I would venture 
to say identical view of many of the aspects of this issue. 
Namely, to put it briefly, this process over there is at a 
critical point from which it could easily escalate into war, but 
could also just as easily take a turn toward lasting peace. 
That is why we believe that a solution comprised of small steps 
and the extinguishing of small fires from point to point is not 
a solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina. This will lead to a state of 
constant crises, where only the geographical name of the crisis 
will change, but it will go on permanently and the war will be 
difficult to stop. 
  That is why we believe that the best approach is to broker a 
general cessation of all hostilities on the territory of the 
entire Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible, but without 
prejudice regarding the political solution. The peaceful 
circumstances would give us a lot more space for reaching a 
final political solution. I am very pleased that Minister 
Kozyrev shares our approach as regards the fact that the issue 
of sanctions is directly connected to achieving peace in Bosnia, 
and that in this respect Russia has a very objective and 
constructive position. In realizing this general approach, we 
certainly need to solve the current problem of Gorazde on these 
same principles. Namely, you are all well aware of the fact 
that the Muslim side has avoided defining the borders of this 
protected zone and that it simply launched a massive offensive 
-- the spring offensive they call it -- from this area. The 
situation became more complex later when this offensive was 
successfully repelled and the Serb forces launched successful 
counter-attacks, and after the intervention -- the 
(?unnecessary) intervention I would say -- from the air. This 
has undoubtedly set back the peace process and has to a certain 
degree compromised the behavior of the UN Protection Force. 
However, we need to find an exit out of this. We suggested 
today in our mutual consultations that the most responsible 
people from the Serbian republic and the United Nations -- those 
that are supposed to help -- should meet as soon as possible. 
They have already agreed to meet tomorrow morning [17 April] in 
order primarily to define the borders of the security zone on 
the basis of the conclusions of a joint commission -- a 
Serb-Muslim-UN commission. This would create conditions for 
cooling the temperature there, therefore, it would constitute 
the extinguishing of a very difficult and tragic focal point, 
but it should be within the context of a general agreement -- 
which we should all strive for -- on the cessation of 
hostilities on the entire front line in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We 
assess that we need to invest all our political influence into 
realizing this and we hope that we shall meet with success.

<F P=106> [Article by Milan Milosevic and Dragoslav Grujic, </F>
Documentation Center: "New and Old Ministers"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Zoran Sokolovic, Minister of Internal Affairs </H5>
  A veteran among the ministers. Born 1938 in the village 
Lepena, Knjazevac Opstina. By nationality Serb. Graduate of the 
School of Agriculture. Employed after graduation in the Vucje 
Agricultural Cooperative as production superintendent, and in 
1964 became the cooperative's director. It was then that he 
ended his agricultural career and began his political career. 
  He was decorated for his effort with the Order of Labor with 
silver garland. 
  Zoran Sokolovic was the principal operative at the Eighth 
Meeting, then the one who took the silk cord to Novi Sad when 
the advocates of autonomy were overthrown, and, finally, 
president of the Assembly in the year when the constitution was 
adopted giving great powers to the president of the republic. 
  On 8 June 1990, when the first meeting was held between the 
government and opposition representatives in the offices of the 
Serbian Republic Executive Council, the government 
representatives were Zoran Sokolovic, Dusan Mihajlovic, and 
Ratko Markovic, while the opposition was represented by Vuk 
Draskovic, Veljko Guberina, Milenko Radic (NRS [People's Radical 
Party]), Djordje Ninkovic (Democratic Party [DS]), Velimir 
Cvetic, Ranka Cicak (SDPJ [Social Democratic Party of 
Yugoslavia]), and Aleksandar Stefanovic (Liberal Party [LS]). 
  It was agreed at the time that in future a "roundtable 
discussion" would be held regularly, every Tuesday, but nothing 
came of that agreement. 
  He has been a deputy in all three convocations of the 
Assembly. 
  In the first convocation of the multiparty Assembly, he was 
the liaison between SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] deputies and 
Milosevic. He was elected minister of internal affairs on 30 May 
1991, following the resignation of Radmilo Bogdanovic (by a 
majority of the votes, nine abstaining). During the debate of 
the Law on Internal Affairs, he responded to the criticism of 
the deputies: "I have a soul and a heart and it pains me to hear 
these charges and insinuations." At a time when countless 
uniformed members of various paramilitary formations were 
roaming over Serbia, Zoran Sokolovic refused to debate this in 
the Assembly, because "neither have there been, nor are there 
now, any paramilitary armed formations whatsoever on the 
territory of the Republic of Serbia." 
  In connection with the June demonstrations and the arrest of 
Vuk Draskovic, Ferenc Cubela (DZVM [Democratic Conference of 
Vojvodina Hungarians]) reminded the deputies of the SPS of the 
television pictures from 5-6 October 1988 and of Mr. Zoran 
Sokolovic with the megaphone, and also of the role he had in 
Novi Sad. Zoran Sokolovic said in response to that: "There is no 
need to explain to anyone what happened in 1988 and what has 
happened now on 1 June, it was witnessed by the entire people 
not only of this Republic of Serbia of ours, but indeed the 
entire world. Accordingly, one cannot be exchanged or compared 
with the other, and I have no further comment." 
  In the debate on the state of security and safety of the 
population, he assured the public that "there are no reasons for 
people to feel hysteria based on fear and insecurity and a 
feeling of being threatened." At almost the same time, the 
republic police occupied the buildings of the federal police. In 
his time as minister, two ministers of the government of Serbia 
have been arrested (Vlajkovic and Mihajlovic), but proceedings 
against them have not been terminated to this day. 
  Finally, a lexical tidbit. The root of the police minister's 
surname is "sokol [falcon]," defined as "a bird of prey which 
aristocrats train and use to hunt with." Perhaps the surname has 
no relation to the character, and it is probably a pure accident 
that at one time the Serbian government included not only Prime 
Minister Sainovic (whose surname comes from the Persian word 
sain, which means "falcon"), but also the police minister had 
etymologically the same surname--a surname connoting that its 
owners have, so to speak, a natural instinct which drives them 
to be obedient to their supreme master and the ability to 
provide him a good catch, which is a topic made to order for 
Milja Vujanovic. 
<H5>  Slobodan Radulovic, Deputy Prime Minister </H5>
  Born 10 January 1943 in prison. His mother Petrana, who was 
in the Partizans, was pregnant when she was imprisoned in the 
casemate on Mamula Island, where she had the baby and gave him 
the symbolic name Slobodan; he spent the first nine months of 
his life in prison. Radulovic came to Belgrade in 1963 and 
enrolled in the School of Economics, where he received his 
degree in 1968. He got his first job in the Belgrade 
Packinghouse. He has been the director of several firms in the 
past and the city minister for the economy. Four years ago, he 
became the head of C Market. Married (his wife Vukica is 
employed in Elektrodistribucija); they have two daughters 
(Jelena and Natasa), and they are both studying economics. Owner 
of a Toyota. Favors the idea that before taking office the 
property of all ministers should be inventoried, "because the 
main benefit of this would be for the government. It is time 
that people left the government without a blemish." 
  He was a deputy in the Serbian Assembly in the second 
convocation (1993). In the last election, he was elected on the 
slate of the DS in the Belgrade electoral unit, he was expelled 
from the DS because he entered the government, and, according to 
Djindjic, he will be asked to give up his office. As the 
director of C Market, during the years of inflation he managed 
to preserve the capital of his firm, among other things by 
leasing the stores and vehicles to employees of C Market. These 
days, he represents himself as "one of the fiercer critics of 
all governments," which is why he "has often experienced 
unpleasantness." He sees the state as a large business firm 
which must make a profit. He says he would have "no dilemma 
about resigning because of things which are irregular." 
<H5>  Radovan Pankov, Minister for Liaison With the Serbs Outside </H5>
Serbia 
  A teacher from the village Tovarisevo, one of the 
beneficiaries of the Eighth Meeting. On the wings of the "yogurt 
revolution" in September 1988, he soared to high posts in the 
party and government. His ascent began on 20 October 1990; at 
the First Conference of the SPS for Vojvodina, he was elected to 
the Main Committee, and then he was Sipovac's rival for the post 
of president. In the 1990 election, he was elected in the first 
round (with 55.72 percent of the vote) in the Backa Palanka II 
and Bac electoral unit, and he obtained the post of vice 
president of the Assembly. He even used that post to help his 
son graduate from high school. 
  That was in late June 1992. Escorted by security, in an 
official car with police plates, Radovan Pankov visited 
Podujevo. His son Misa was with him. According to Deputy Zoran 
Paunovic, Radovan Pankov "came for a working visit to the 
Podujevo region and the economic giant--the Fagar Construction 
Fittings Factory, at the invitation of the opstina leadership." 
During the visit to the business school, Milena Vukotic, a 
teacher, and principal Grujic hastily questioned young Misa and 
found that he was a chip off the old block and issued him a 
diploma from the business school. For the favor which the 
school's principal did for Pankov, Gvozden Grujic received from 
the vice president of the Assembly a promise that he would be 
appointed chief of the Podujevo MUP [Ministry of Internal 
Affairs]. Presumably so that he could deport from Podujevo the 
teachers who objected to this fast-service graduation of young 
Misa. 
  But in addition to his personal worries, Comrade Pankov also 
worries about affairs of state. Informed sources say that during 
this war he has been operating from the background, mainly 
through the so-called National Council for Slavonia, Baranja, 
and Western Srem, whose headquarters were on territory under 
Pankov's control--in Backa Palanka. It is from there, it is 
said, that the "spontaneous uprising" of the people was 
directed, and many people, among them even Vojislav Seselj, talk 
about Pankov's role in supplying weapons to Serbs on the other 
side of the river. 
  Following the election in May, Radovan Pankov was elected to 
the Chamber of the Republics, on the candidates' slate of 
representatives of the Assembly elected by the Assembly of 
Serbia from among the ranks of its deputies. Aside from these 
facts, Pankov's qualifications for the post of minister were 
probably also helped by his assurance that "there would have 
been no Serbia if it had accepted the ultimatums of the CSCE and 
the EC. The advocacy of an independent and self-sufficient 
Serbia by certain opposition parties in Serbia is tantamount to 
capitulation and the courting of an expanded Germany." 
<H5>  Ratomir Vico, Information Minister </H5>
  A returnee to the post of minister. Vico was elected 
minister 
the first time on 31 July 1991 during the "reconstruction" of 
the Bozovic government. After 9 March, he headed Television 
Belgrade. Vico became the truth minister of Serbia after he 
"differentiated" the editorial staffs as the commissar of 
numerous working groups following the triumph of the Milosevic 
faction. At that time, the main curse among Belgrade editors was 
"May God send Vico's working group to visit you." Following a 
short period as minister, Vico returned to Television, which is 
now headed by Milorad Vucelic, and he has been receiving a 
salary as his adviser, and working on the distribution of fuel 
within the firm. 
  The appointment of Vico to be information minister was one 
of 
the principal stumbling blocks within the leadership of the SPS. 
Those who attended say that he was one of the reasons why the 
discussion about the makeup of the cabinet lasted all night. 
Only just before dawn did a directive arrive from on high that 
Vico should be the candidate, and that ended the story about 
Milivoje Pavlevic's successor. 
<H5>  Radoje Djukic, Minister for Business Enterprise </H5>
  Born 24 July 1949 in the village Cecuni, Ivangrad Opstina, 
Montenegro. He is the second member of the Democratic Party 
detached to work in the Marjanovic government. Radoje Djukic 
owns the Djukic Knitwear Mill. Last year, he was elected small 
business manager of the year. A man who has known Marjanovic for 
many years ("it was my good fortune that we exported together"). 
The owner of the knitwear factory worked on exports and imports 
of petroleum and gas from Russia through Italy. He is a member 
of the Executive Committee of New Belgrade Opstina (he 
represents the DS in the opstina Assembly), in the opstina 
government he is chairman of the Committee for Aid to the 
Krajinas, and, from what he himself says, New Belgrade Opstina 
is the only one in the FRY which has solved the problem of aid 
to the krajinas in an institutional way. According to BORBA, he 
made a custom of working lunches with every prime minister, and 
he uses the familiar form of address with Milosevic." 
<H5>  Ratko Markovic, Deputy Prime Minister </H5>
  Born 8 December 1944 in Pozarevac. Author of both 
constitutions in effect today. He began his career as university 
professor in Kragujevac. He got his post as professor at the 
University of Belgrade with the help of his friends in the SK-PJ 
[League of Communists-- Movement for Yugoslavia] (Draskovic), in 
that the authors of a textbook made the gentlemanly gesture of 
consenting to sign him on as an author so that he would fulfill 
the condition for becoming a professor. As an expert on 
federalism (position of the provinces), he took part in debates 
about a "unified Serbia" and then sided politically with 
Milosevic. He has been a judge on the Constitutional Court, and 
now he is a deputy in the Citizens Chamber of the Yugoslav 
Assembly. 
<H5>  Svetozar Krstic, Deputy Prime Minister </H5>
  Law school graduate. Owner of the Krstic Holding Company. He 
began his working career in the small provincial town of Odzaci 
as director of an internal bank, and he entered Serbia's 
political life as a young official among Milosevic's Communists, 
for a time he was on the Politburo of the Central Committee of 
the League of Communists of Serbia, but at the time when the 
Communists were renamed Socialists, Krstic changed teams and 
went over to the ND-PS [New Democracy--Movement for Serbia]. He 
maintained good business relations with those who had been his 
comrades up to that time, as indicated by the fact that he was 
given the post of assistant general director on the team of 
Dragan Tomic (the one from Simpo). During the transformation of 
the Yugoslav economy, he became a private businessman and set up 
his own firm, always in tune with the fashion. When it was 
profitable to open up exchange offices and savings banks, Krstic 
also had one of his own.

  [Text] Unlike the Belgrade authorities, Montenegro will not 
withdraw accreditation from foreign journalists, said 
Information Minister Bozidar Jarebic. He added this action was 
mostly to the detriment of those who withdrew accreditation. 
There are many other ways of reaching agreements with 
journalists. That way Serbia finally showed that isolation was 
its permanent political choice.

  [Text] [Announcer] President of the republic of Kosova 
Dr. Ibrahim Rugova held a news conference in Prishtina today. 
Let us go over to a telephone report by Skender Durmishi: 
  [Durmishi] At today's news conference, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, 
chairman of the republic of Kosova, asked the UN Security 
Council to examine the question of repression in Kosova and to 
demand, through a resolution, an international protectorate 
there. Such a system of international protection, Rugova said, 
would be a reward for the peaceful resistance of the Albanians 
and would at the same time interrupt the intolerable police 
repression in localities and villages of Kosova. 
  Rugova also informed reporters that this week, repression 
and 
other police actions, assuming the dimensions of a campaign, 
have occurred in 23 communes and in hundreds of Kosovar 
villages. As usual, this repression has been accompanied by 
fierce brutality through arrests, destruction, violent 
press-ganging, etc. At the same time, the persecution of 
political activists and local government officials has 
continued. Military movements have been observed in the region 
of Gjakove, Prizren, Peje, and in Han i Elezit. 
  Presenting details and other data on the repression, the 
president of Kosova said that in addition to the already known 
motives, the aim of this repression is to instigate a backlash 
against the violence and provocations among the Albanian 
population, to which the Albanians have not succumbed. 
  Despite the repression, Dr. Rugova pointed out that this 
week 
Kosova is at the center of the international community's 
attention. He greeted all the statements and other reactions, 
demanding prevention of a conflict in Kosova. 
  Supporting the NATO attack on Serbian weapons in Bosnia, Dr. 
Rugova asked for the destruction of the arms, being the main 
cause of wars and tragedies in the region. He again reminded 
reporters that the arms were obtained through the sweat of all 
the peoples of Yugoslavia. Based on an approach with mystical 
elements, as he called it, Rugova stressed that we do not 
exclude the possibility that one day the arms will be turned 
onto the Serbs themselves. 
  In the context of these political observations, Mr. Rugova 
expressed the hope that Russia will manifest the proper 
flexibility on the crisis in former Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, he 
asked Greece for a more mature stance in conformity with the 
rules of good-neighborliness. 
  At the end of the conference, Rugova suggested as a 
preferred 
form for a global and efficient solution the total pacification 
of all the regions in former Yugoslavia because of the serious 
threats for further expansion of the crisis and war in these 
areas. 
  Condemning the demands of Serbian officials to close the 
Soros Foundation and several world news agencies, Mr. Rugova 
considered them as attempts to turn these areas into ghettos 
with elements of an absurd confrontation with the world. He 
thanked the commitment of the Soros Foundation and offered 
further cooperation with this foundation as far as the 
possibilities and the institutions of our system permitted. 
  President Rugova also repeated the demand that, as member of 
the former Yugoslav Federation, Kosova should be granted the 
right to secession, with all the rights and obligations deriving 
from it. He also spoke of more intensive contacts with the UN 
High Commission for Refugees to prevent Serbian attempts to 
colonize Kosova.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Ivan Brozik; </F>
place and date not given: "The Army Will Remain Above Party 
Affairs"] 
  [Text] [Brozik] Following the 8 April talks with your 
Polish counterpart, what do you see as the dominant feature of 
relations? 
  [Kanis] There are two main areas of cooperation -- research 
and cooperation in the production of weapons and arms systems, 
and our moving closer toward NATO within the framework of the 
Partnership for Peace project. After the demise of the Warsaw 
Pact, its former member states spontaneously started to do 
exactly the same things. The system of production sharing, 
which made arms production cheaper and more efficient, fell 
apart, and as a result, everything became more expensive. The 
innovation of the T-72 tank is a case in point. All the former 
Warsaw Pact states are working on it independently. Division of 
labor is necessary to make the innovation of arms equipment 
cheaper. We can cooperate with the Poles in many fields. 
  [Brozik] But cooperation will not remain bilateral or 
confined to the framework of the former Warsaw Pact. 
  [Kanis] Our orientation toward transatlantic and West 
European security structures is an exceptionally serious matter. 
We are confronted by new realities. Partnership for Peace, 
which is a framework project, should be given specific shape in 
so-called presentation documents [prezentacne dokumenty]. This 
requires an exchange of opinions within the framework of the 
Visegrad Four [V-4] group, including about the division of tasks 
within the framework of the project. Cooperation within the V-4 
is connected with this. The Czech Republic and the Hungarian 
Republic give preference to a race for NATO or European Union 
membership. It is apparent that this pursues propaganda aims 
without yielding any benefit for the aforementioned states. 
First it is necessary to demonstrate the ability to form 
integration relations among ourselves and only then is it 
possible to consider integration into Western structures. The 
Poles' idea of the V-4 is that of a grouping with common 
intentions in terms of contents and time. The Polish view is 
very sympathetic to us. It is the idea of a cart with four 
wheels, one of which is Slovakia. 
  [Brozik] The post of defense minister should not be combined 
with membership in any party. Have you not considered 
suspending your membership in the Party of the Democratic Left 
[SDL]? 
  [Kanis] I expected this question, but it is necessary to 
view this matter realistically. I am not a soldier minister. 
Hence, I do not have to meet the criteria that a soldier would 
if he became minister. I am a civilian who has been nominated 
by a "certain" party. Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys is 
also a high level functionary of a political party. The same 
goes for Lajos Fur in Hungary, who is even chairman of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum. A civilian minister must be 
considered differently from a soldier minister. However, the 
Army should self-evidently be above party affairs. This means 
that one must not engage in any political activities on the 
premises of Army barracks. A soldier can be politically engaged 
when he is out of uniform. My membership or nonmembership [of 
the SDL] depends on coalition agreements.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "REPUBLIKA on the Carpet; Deputy Prime </F>
Minister Roman Kovac's Meeting With TA SR Director General"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac 
met with TA SR Director General Dusan Kleiman in Bratislava 
yesterday. The meeting took place on the basis of a decision of 
the Coalition Council, which asked that certain facts be 
clarified regarding property matters of the daily REPUBLIKA and 
the transfer of its registration to a different entity. Dusan 
Kleiman stated that the TA SR did not violate any legal norms 
and did not use any funds from the state budget to publish the 
daily. He considers it intolerable for a news agency to publish 
an opinion-forming [mienkotvorny] daily, but the entire process 
of the daily REPUBLIKA's becoming independent has been slowed 
down by the fact that Republika Ltd., which is ready to assume 
all liabilities of the daily and to take the burden off the TA 
SR, has not yet been registered. 
  "It is an absurd situation when a state agency publishes a 
daily that is full of invectives against the crucial state 
bodies -- the National Council, the president, and the 
government," Roman Kovac told reporters after his meeting with 
Dusan Kleiman. According to his words, the TA SR operates with 
a deficit, caused by the daily REPUBLIKA. Last year, the loss 
amounted to more than 18 million Slovak korunas [Sk]. He said 
that Sk30-35 million had been appropriated from the 1993 state 
budget for the TA SR and this year the subsidy even went up to 
Sk42 million. Apart from this, the news agency has some income 
from its entrepreneurial activity (last year it supposedly 
amounted to Sk95 million). Roman Kovac noted that the TA SR 
operates with a single fund, into which all its financial 
resources flow. It is therefore difficult to say whether the 
loss caused by REPUBLIKA has been offset by korunas from the 
state budget or by profit from the agency's commercial 
activities. 
  The argument that the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA 
should be the TA SR's commercial venture does not hold water, 
according to Roman Kovac, because, under a Slovak Ministry of 
Finance decree, organizations of this type can only engage in 
commercial activities that do not cause losses. This provision 
has not been observed, "which amounts to a violation of a 
legislative norm," Roman Kovac stressed. 
  Asked by reporters whether a change in the post of TA SR 
director general was to be expected, Roman Kovac replied that 
this matter will still have to be considered. He noted that, 
probably today, Dusan Kleiman would submit to him proposals on 
how to deal with the situation that has arisen. According to 
Roman Kovac, the TA SR director general realizes his share of 
responsibility, be it responsibility of economic nature or 
responsibility for the violation of legal regulations. 
"Although it is true that he did not violate them himself, the 
head of an organization must bear the consequences for his deeds 
and is also accountable for his subordinates," Roman Kovac said. 
  Roman Kovac is convinced that the TA SR should operate as an 
independent agency and said that it was unthinkable for it to 
publish an opposition daily. He considers the privatization of 
the daily REPUBLIKA to the full extent, that is, including the 
debts it has run up, to be the most suitable solution to the 
problems surrounding the newspaper. 
  As he went on to say, the orders placed by the government 
with the daily REPUBLIKA in the form of various supplements, 
which needlessly siphoned off resources from the budgets of 
individual ministries, are being abolished and the ministry will 
have to find a new form of maintaining contact with the public, 
for example by means of bulletins and the like.
