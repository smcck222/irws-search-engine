<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Coalition Alternatives"] </F>
  [Text] Cadca -- All Slovak National Party [SNS] District 
Councils in Slovakia have quickly recovered from the departure 
of some members for the National Democratic Party--New 
Alternative. Since the Extraordinary SNS Assembly, which was 
held in Zilina in February, party membership has increased from 
6,000 to approximately 6,700. This was stated by the SNS 
Central Council during a meeting in Cadca on Saturday [9 April]. 
Information on the meeting was provided by SNS Chairman Jan 
Slota and SNS Honorary Chairman Jozef Prokes. 
  The SNS Central Council also considered the possibilities of 
forming a coalition for the upcoming parliamentary elections. 
The proposal was put forward to form a coalition partnership 
with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], but only in 
the event of the formation of pre-election blocs --a left-wing 
bloc, a right-wing bloc, and a national bloc. 
  The SNS Central Council protests against the decision by 
Slovak President Michal Kovac to annul the results of citizens' 
petition for a referendum. The president preferred intrigues to 
a democratic solution to the problem, delegates stated in their 
contributions. 
  The SNS Central Council issued a statement on the political 
situation, which it addressed to the citizens of Slovakia. It 
states, among other things: "A dangerous development has 
occurred on the Slovak political scene. Under the formal cloak 
of democracy, political culture and ethics have been trampled 
underfoot, the regular results of the free elections of 1992 
have been reversed, and power has been seized by political 
entities that were either defeated in the free elections or did 
not even exist at that time. This situation is reminiscent of 
the elections of 1948 when Klement Gottwald usurped power in the 
former Czechoslovak Republic.... 
  "Political purges have been set in motion and an endeavor 
has 
been launched to liquidate the sole opposition daily, REPUBLIKA. 
There is speculation that the September election date might be 
postponed," the statement says. A dirty role is played in this 
process by a greater part of the mass media. 
  The present government's distrust of the Slovak Republic's 
independence is borne out by its downright Milovy-style 
capitulationism [reference to February 1992 draft treaty 
concluded between Czech and Slovak leaders in Milovy on the 
future shape of Czech-Slovak coexistence, which was subsequently 
rejected by Slovak Parliament as capitulationist] in its 
negotiations with the Czech Republic in the Customs Union 
Council, as a result of which the Slovak Republic will incur 
losses of hundreds of millions of korunas. It is borne out by 
the secret agreements between the current government coalition 
and Hungarian political parties that do not conceal their 
irredentism. The SNS emphatically demands the publication of 
these agreements. Citizens of the Slovak Republic have the 
right to get to know their contents. In conclusion, the SNS 
appeals to citizens not to yield to hopelessness and apathy and 
to express their attitude toward the Slovak Republic in the next 
elections. 
  [Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 11 April on page 2 carries a 
600-word interview with SNS Chairman Jan Slota by SMENA reporter 
Marian Hudec entitled "The Party Is Stabilized." In the 
interview, the place and date of which are not given, Slota 
discusses the results of the Cadca meeting of the SNS Central 
Council. He confirms that the district organizations "tend to 
favor" the party's independent ticket for the fall elections and 
that only "in the event of the formation of pre-election blocs" 
would the SNS contest the elections jointly with the HZDS and, 
possibly, the Christian Social Union. Slota also reiterates the 
party's demand for the publication of the agreement concluded 
between the government coalition and the Hungarian political 
parties, saying that "the Slovak nation wants to know for how 
many Judas's silverlings it was concluded." In his concluding 
reply, Slota denies that the SNS leadership would meet with 
Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia, during his expected visit to Slovakia. "We did not 
invite him to Slovakia and do not consider establishing any 
contacts with him," Slota says.]

<F P=106> [Interview with Juraj Molnar, deputy chairman of the Slovak </F>
National Party, by Eva Zelenayova; place and date not given: "I 
Spoke With Zhirinovskiy"] 
  [Excerpts] The World Congress of Slav, Orthodox, and 
Christian Nations was held in Moscow on 3 April. The Slovak 
National Party [SNS] sent Deputy Chairman Juraj Molnar to the 
congress as an observer. His participation in the congress 
triggered an unusually strong and above all negative response in 
the mass media. The fact that the congress was held immediately 
after the conclusion of the Fifth Congress of the Liberal 
Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR], which organized the congress, 
served as a pretext for spreading speculation. 
  [Zelenayova] With what intentions did you depart for Moscow? 
  [Molnar] My visit to Moscow is being commented on with the 
expressed aim of generating certain moods and spreading 
disinformation. Efforts can even be detected to discredit this 
visit and the foreign policy line of our party. Indeed, the 
congress was organized by the LDPR and we have been saying 
openly that we used our participation in the congress to 
unofficially establish contacts with LDPR representatives, which 
undeniably represents a real political force. I went to Moscow 
in order to obtain firsthand information. 
  [Zelenayova] The LDPR is considered to be an extremist 
party. Your contacts with its representatives allow politicians 
and journalists to argue that the SNS has also joined this 
current. 
  [Molnar] Our party also had an observer at the congress of 
the Coexistence Movement, and no one claimed that our 
orientation is pro-Hungarian. Our party has carried out a very 
precise analysis of the developments in Russia. In this 
analysis, we did not evaluate or consider whether the LDPR is a 
positive or a negative phenomenon. We merely considered that it 
represents a real force that must be reckoned with and that can 
influence developments in Central Europe. 
  [Zelenayova] I do not assume that you consider the LDPR a 
real force only because of Zhirinovskiy's strong words. His 
plans to create a Russian empire reaching to the Indian Ocean 
and his reference to Bratislava as the capital of this empire 
have rightly alarmed politicians. 
  [Molnar] The real strength of this party does not lie in 
Zhirinovskiy's vocabulary but in the election results. It has 
entered the Duma as the strongest party. As for Bratislava, it 
is being considered as a possible ideological center of the 
Slavs and not as the capital of a Russian empire. After all, it 
would be absurd for Russia to try to bring together some empire 
and hand over its capital to another nation. At the Moscow 
congress there was talk about creating an association of Slav 
nations and it is in this context that one has to understand the 
reference to Bratislava. It would play a similar role as 
Strasbourg, which fulfills the function of capital for the 
European Union. However, there has never been talk about a new 
state formation. 
  [Zelenayova] Do you consider it conceivable for the Slav 
nations to unite? This is not a new idea. 
  [Molnar] It is interesting that whenever there is talk about 
Slav nations, someone always makes a tremendous fuss about it. 
Slovakia is a member of the Central European Initiative, which 
does not remind anyone of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although 
it occupies the same geographic space. But when there is talk 
of 300 million Slavs, all kinds of noises can immediately be 
heard about links with the former regime and such like. This is 
natural. Were the 300 million Slavs to unite, they would 
constitute a decisive force in Europe and the world. Western 
Europe is naturally afraid of this because it is ethnically 
mixed, being inhabited by Latin nations, Germans, Anglo-Saxons, 
and remnants of the Celts. As for Zhirinovskiy's plans, at the 
congress in Moscow it was said that the unification of the 
nations of Russia [as published] should be brought about by 
nonmilitary means. [passage omitted] 
  While in Moscow, I clearly declared that the Slavs cannot 
unite on the basis of political parties but on the platform of 
governments, which should work out the common, basic idea of 
such a community. I consider the congress as a mere declaration 
of intent, as the first step that should raise this issue and 
give it a topical dimension. [passage omitted] 
  [Zelenayova] Could you tell us what you learned from your 
talks with LDPR representatives? 
  [Molnar] We wanted to find out what their ideas are, because 
their electoral victory is a realistic prospect. I also 
inquired how far the empire under discussion would stretch in 
the west, for example. Would it swallow Slovakia? Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy clearly said that Slovakia is, and will remain, an 
independent state. This was also confirmed by the LDPR deputy 
chairman, and was also published in the press. 
  [Zelenayova] Did you speak with Zhirinovskiy personally? 
  [Molnar] Yes, I had a personal conversation with him. 
  [Zelenayova] What impression did he make on you? 
  [Molnar] It is difficult to form an impression in 10 or 15 
minutes. He definitely does not come across as a radical, 
although one has to admit that he has an emotional mode of 
expression. I consider this a form of the struggle for power. 
Apparently, he does not have access to the media and, 
therefore, opts for this method. Western politicians also used 
to talk about driving the communists beyond the Urals and so on, 
before coming to power. Their vocabulary changed when they came 
to power. But I would not like to evaluate the LDPR; I do not 
know whether its strength will make a positive or negative 
impact. We have only established contacts, because it 
represents a real political force. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Ivan Brozik; </F>
place and date not given: "The Army Will Remain Above Party 
Affairs"] 
  [Text] [Brozik] Following the 8 April talks with your 
Polish counterpart, what do you see as the dominant feature of 
relations? 
  [Kanis] There are two main areas of cooperation -- research 
and cooperation in the production of weapons and arms systems, 
and our moving closer toward NATO within the framework of the 
Partnership for Peace project. After the demise of the Warsaw 
Pact, its former member states spontaneously started to do 
exactly the same things. The system of production sharing, 
which made arms production cheaper and more efficient, fell 
apart, and as a result, everything became more expensive. The 
innovation of the T-72 tank is a case in point. All the former 
Warsaw Pact states are working on it independently. Division of 
labor is necessary to make the innovation of arms equipment 
cheaper. We can cooperate with the Poles in many fields. 
  [Brozik] But cooperation will not remain bilateral or 
confined to the framework of the former Warsaw Pact. 
  [Kanis] Our orientation toward transatlantic and West 
European security structures is an exceptionally serious matter. 
We are confronted by new realities. Partnership for Peace, 
which is a framework project, should be given specific shape in 
so-called presentation documents [prezentacne dokumenty]. This 
requires an exchange of opinions within the framework of the 
Visegrad Four [V-4] group, including about the division of tasks 
within the framework of the project. Cooperation within the V-4 
is connected with this. The Czech Republic and the Hungarian 
Republic give preference to a race for NATO or European Union 
membership. It is apparent that this pursues propaganda aims 
without yielding any benefit for the aforementioned states. 
First it is necessary to demonstrate the ability to form 
integration relations among ourselves and only then is it 
possible to consider integration into Western structures. The 
Poles' idea of the V-4 is that of a grouping with common 
intentions in terms of contents and time. The Polish view is 
very sympathetic to us. It is the idea of a cart with four 
wheels, one of which is Slovakia. 
  [Brozik] The post of defense minister should not be combined 
with membership in any party. Have you not considered 
suspending your membership in the Party of the Democratic Left 
[SDL]? 
  [Kanis] I expected this question, but it is necessary to 
view this matter realistically. I am not a soldier minister. 
Hence, I do not have to meet the criteria that a soldier would 
if he became minister. I am a civilian who has been nominated 
by a "certain" party. Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys is 
also a high level functionary of a political party. The same 
goes for Lajos Fur in Hungary, who is even chairman of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum. A civilian minister must be 
considered differently from a soldier minister. However, the 
Army should self-evidently be above party affairs. This means 
that one must not engage in any political activities on the 
premises of Army barracks. A soldier can be politically engaged 
when he is out of uniform. My membership or nonmembership [of 
the SDL] depends on coalition agreements.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "REPUBLIKA on the Carpet; Deputy Prime </F>
Minister Roman Kovac's Meeting With TA SR Director General"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac 
met with TA SR Director General Dusan Kleiman in Bratislava 
yesterday. The meeting took place on the basis of a decision of 
the Coalition Council, which asked that certain facts be 
clarified regarding property matters of the daily REPUBLIKA and 
the transfer of its registration to a different entity. Dusan 
Kleiman stated that the TA SR did not violate any legal norms 
and did not use any funds from the state budget to publish the 
daily. He considers it intolerable for a news agency to publish 
an opinion-forming [mienkotvorny] daily, but the entire process 
of the daily REPUBLIKA's becoming independent has been slowed 
down by the fact that Republika Ltd., which is ready to assume 
all liabilities of the daily and to take the burden off the TA 
SR, has not yet been registered. 
  "It is an absurd situation when a state agency publishes a 
daily that is full of invectives against the crucial state 
bodies -- the National Council, the president, and the 
government," Roman Kovac told reporters after his meeting with 
Dusan Kleiman. According to his words, the TA SR operates with 
a deficit, caused by the daily REPUBLIKA. Last year, the loss 
amounted to more than 18 million Slovak korunas [Sk]. He said 
that Sk30-35 million had been appropriated from the 1993 state 
budget for the TA SR and this year the subsidy even went up to 
Sk42 million. Apart from this, the news agency has some income 
from its entrepreneurial activity (last year it supposedly 
amounted to Sk95 million). Roman Kovac noted that the TA SR 
operates with a single fund, into which all its financial 
resources flow. It is therefore difficult to say whether the 
loss caused by REPUBLIKA has been offset by korunas from the 
state budget or by profit from the agency's commercial 
activities. 
  The argument that the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA 
should be the TA SR's commercial venture does not hold water, 
according to Roman Kovac, because, under a Slovak Ministry of 
Finance decree, organizations of this type can only engage in 
commercial activities that do not cause losses. This provision 
has not been observed, "which amounts to a violation of a 
legislative norm," Roman Kovac stressed. 
  Asked by reporters whether a change in the post of TA SR 
director general was to be expected, Roman Kovac replied that 
this matter will still have to be considered. He noted that, 
probably today, Dusan Kleiman would submit to him proposals on 
how to deal with the situation that has arisen. According to 
Roman Kovac, the TA SR director general realizes his share of 
responsibility, be it responsibility of economic nature or 
responsibility for the violation of legal regulations. 
"Although it is true that he did not violate them himself, the 
head of an organization must bear the consequences for his deeds 
and is also accountable for his subordinates," Roman Kovac said. 
  Roman Kovac is convinced that the TA SR should operate as an 
independent agency and said that it was unthinkable for it to 
publish an opposition daily. He considers the privatization of 
the daily REPUBLIKA to the full extent, that is, including the 
debts it has run up, to be the most suitable solution to the 
problems surrounding the newspaper. 
  As he went on to say, the orders placed by the government 
with the daily REPUBLIKA in the form of various supplements, 
which needlessly siphoned off resources from the budgets of 
individual ministries, are being abolished and the ministry will 
have to find a new form of maintaining contact with the public, 
for example by means of bulletins and the like.

of 300 million Slavs, all kinds of noises can immediately be 
heard about links with the former regime and such like. This is 
natural. Were the 300 million Slavs to unite, they would 
constitute a decisive force in Europe and the world. Western 
Europe is naturally afraid of this because it is ethnically 
mixed, being inhabited by Latin nations, Germans, Anglo-Saxons, 
and remnants of the Celts. As for Zhirinovskiy's plans, at the 
congress in Moscow it was said that the unification of the 
nations of Russia [as published] should be brought about by 
nonmilitary means. [passage omitted] 
  While in Moscow, I clearly declared that the Slavs cannot 
unite on the basis of political parties but on the platform of 
governments, which should work out the common, basic idea of 
such a community. I consider the congress as a mere declaration 
of intent, as the first step that should raise this issue and 
give it a topical dimension. [passage omitted] 
  [Zelenayova] Could you tell us what you learned from your 
talks with LDPR representatives? 
  [Molnar] We wanted to find out what their ideas are, because 
their electoral victory is a realistic prospect. I also 
inquired how far the empire under discussion would stretch in 
the west, for example. Would it swallow Slovakia? Mr. 
Zhirinovskiy clearly said that Slovakia is, and will remain, an 
independent state. This was also confirmed by the LDPR deputy 
chairman, and was also published in the press. 
  [Zelenayova] Did you speak with Zhirinovskiy personally? 
  [Molnar] Yes, I had a personal conversation with him. 
  [Zelenayova] What impression did he make on you? 
  [Molnar] It is difficult to form an impression in 10 or 15 
minutes. He definitely does not come across as a radical, 
although one has to admit that he has an emotional mode of 
expression. I consider this a form of the struggle for power. 
Apparently, he does not have access to the media and, 
therefore, opts for this method. Western politicians also used 
to talk about driving the communists beyond the Urals and so on, 
before coming to power. Their vocabulary changed when they came 
to power. But I would not like to evaluate the LDPR; I do not 
know whether its strength will make a positive or negative 
impact. We have only established contacts, because it 
represents a real political force. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague, April 16 (TANJUG) -- Zagreb is ready to use 
force if necessary by the end of the year to bring the republic 
of Serb Krajina (RSK) into Croatia, a Croat official has stated. 
  Slavko Degoricija, who headed a Croatian delegation to talks 
with the RSK on normalization of mutual relations, told the 
Czech news agency CTK late on Friday [15 April] that force would 
be used only if the reintegration process were not completed 
within six months. 
  Degoricija said the position of Russia, the European Union 
and the U.N. Security Council was the same -- Krajina's 
reintegration into Croatia must be completed within six months, 
i.e. before the expiry of the U.N. peacekeepers' mandate. The 
reintegration would be carried out in three stages, with the 
first stage focusing on a truce, the second on the economy and 
the third on political issues, he explained. 
  In case the Serb side should not agree, we shall inform the 
Security Council and take adequate steps for the reintegration 
of Krajina, the Croatian official said. 
  The first round of RSK-Croatia talks at the Russian Embassy 
in Zagreb in March was completed successfully. The agreement on 
the cessation of hostilities and troop disengagement which was 
reached on the occasion is being fully honoured. 
  In preparation for the second stage of the talks on 
normalization of relations, RSK officials have insisted with 
international mediators that this should in no way prejudge a 
political solution, especially as the two sides hold 
diametrically opposed views about the political settlement. 
  RSK president Milan Martic ruled out any possibility of 
Krajina forming part of Croatia. 
  The only way to peace is to keep the RSK and Croatia 
(?apart) 
because living toghther is absolutely out of the question, 
Martic told the CTK. 
  He said the RSK was ready to make a compromise, not by 
accepting autonomy within Croatia but by restoring economic and 
other ties. "The basic (?condition) for this is equality between 
the RSK and croatia (?as) two independent states," he was 
categorical. [passage indistinct]

  [Excerpt] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of 
Croatia, today chaired the 40th session of the Presidential 
Council for Defense and National Security, held at the 
Presidential Palace. The council discussed the current 
political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of 
Croatia. The Council also heard a report by Mate Granic, the 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister, after his return 
from Turkey and Greece. 
  Concerning the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it was 
viewed 
that relations between Serbs and Muslims and relations between 
Serbs and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the international 
community are deteriorating once again. 
  The council examined President Tudjman's recent state visit 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina and came to the conclusion that the visit 
would further consolidate the positive orientation of the 
Washington agreement, and also encourage those forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina advocating a peaceful solution to the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In connection with the cease-fire with local Serbs from UN 
protected areas the council reiterated the Croatian leadership's 
position that there can be no resumption of talks with the Serbs 
outside the Republic of Croatia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Franjo Tudjman by unidentified </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina television journalist; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Journalist] Mr. President, I would first like to 
thank you on behalf of Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television 
for being so kind as to set aside some time to grant this -- as 
far as I know -- first interview for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio 
and Television. Your statements have often been misinterpreted, 
you have often been quoted out of context by foreign news 
agencies -- there is a great deal of interest among Sarajevans 
in the answers you will give to the questions I will try to ask 
prior to your announced visit to Sarajevo. 
  Let us start from the beginning, in other words from the 
time 
the Republic of Croatia recognized the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina; let me recall that Croatia was the first to 
do so. The date was 7 April 1992, two years ago. The 
ambassador was appointed that same year, some five or six months 
later. This will be your first visit to Sarajevo -- two years 
after recognition. In the meantime President Izetbegovic has 
visited Croatia quite often. Why is your visit taking place 
now, relatively late in the day? 
  [Tudjman] I would like to ask you why you are asking such a 
question. The reason Mr. Izetbegovic visited Zagreb so often 
was because Croatia has been, so to speak, the Bosnian 
government's mainstay, Bosnia's mainstay in its struggle for 
independence. Generally speaking, Croatia has always extended 
its hospitality -- whenever Mr. Izetbegovic had to travel to the 
West, whenever he had to go somewhere for talks, it was Croatia 
that made it possible [changes thought], for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to organize itself for defense against the aggressor. 
  In such circumstances, the circumstances Bosnia-Herzegovina 
was in, Mr. Izetbegovic neither invited me to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
nor could I have come under such circumstances. The exact date 
of even this prearranged visit cannot be fixed yet, given the 
circumstances. So, those are the reasons why I am visiting 
Bosnia-Herzegovina now. 
  I gladly accepted Mr. Izetbegovic's invitation after the 
signing of the Washington accords, but the answer to your 
question lies in the situation. 
  [Journalist] When he invited you to visit, President 
Izetbegovic stressed that the Republic of Croatia and the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have a good many issues in 
common, or rather questions which should be considered together. 
In your view, what are these issues? 
  [Tudjman] Well, above all the question of the revitalization 
of the Washington agreement, the agreement on a federation 
between the Croatian and Bosniak Muslim nations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and also the question of the creation of a 
confederation between a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. 
These are vital questions which are of vital importance both to 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and to Croatia. 
  [Journalist] So this will be the focus of your talks when 
you 
come to Sarajevo in the next few days? 
  [Tudjman] Certainly. 
  [Journalist] The Croatian ruling party and you personally -- 
at least it is understood this way in Sarajevo, and not only in 
Sarajevo -- interpret the Washington agreement as the 
continuation of your policy. However, I must remind you, again 
from Sarajevo's point of view, that in Bosnia-Herzegovina you 
often stress that President Izetbegovic personally proposed to 
you at one of the Geneva meetings something similar and 
virtually the same as what has now been signed in Washington. I 
have to ask you directly, why at that time in Geneva did you not 
accept these proposals which in Sarajevo they are saying are the 
same, while you have now signed them in Washington? 
  [Tudjman] Because they are not the same proposals. The 
Washington agreement reflects the continuity of Croatian policy 
toward Bosnia-Herzegovina: allow me to remind you and the public 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina of some facts. Croatian policy and I 
personally were in favour of realizing the Cutilheiro proposal 
-- not only Cutilheiro's proposal, but we also took part in 
working out a proposal on a cantonal system for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to resolve the war crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in this way. Croatian policy and I 
personally were also in favor of finding a solution to the war 
crisis, the political crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the basis 
of the Vance-Owen proposal on the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
into provinces. 
  When all this came to nothing -- and when, in opposition to 
the separation of the so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia, the 
idea emerged that the Muslims might be organized as a separate 
republic and as a separate state in the framework of the program 
that emerged in the European conference on the former Yugoslavia 
in Bosnia and also in the framework of the reality which was 
unfurling in Bosnia- Herzegovina, in other words in the 
framework of these ideas of the creation of a union of republics 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Muslim leadership developed the 
idea that it would be better for the Muslims to realize their 
own republic, their own separate state. 
  So to this end, by way of resistance to Serb aggression, and 
in this search for a solution to the crisis of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was also 
created. 
  It was in this context that Mr. Izetbegovic proposed that 
they go for a union between the Srpska republic and a unified 
Muslim-Croat republic. And this is quite different from the 
current agreement on a Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation. In 
contrast to this, I was the one who proposed that there be a 
confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia and also 
the closest cooperation between the republics -- the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim republic. So this 
proposal was also put forward at the Berlin meeting. 
  Europe, Germany, and the world convinced themselves of the 
benefits of this proposal and believed that Croatian policy was 
in favor of solutions which would be acceptable both to the 
Bosniak Muslim people and to the Croatian people, and which 
would have provided prospects for the resolution of the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. So this is something quite different 
from the proposal which you mentioned. However, the vital thing 
is that we did reach agreement in Washington on the creation of 
a Bosniak Muslim-Croatian federation and a confederation with 
Croatia. 
  [Journalist] Mr. President, if you could tell us more -- it 
seems we can never stop dwelling on this problem -- what are 
currently the most burning issues in relations between Croatia 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Tudjman] First of all we should solve certain material 
questions. As you know, Croatia has accommodated several 
hundred thousand refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina of which more 
than half are Muslims, not only Croats. Croatia has had to 
allocate vast sums for the accommodation of those refugees, the 
education of the children, for extending medical care to the 
wounded from Bosnia-Herzegovina. So, we have to solve these 
material questions. However, I should say that -- important as 
they may be -- these questions are nevertheless marginal 
compared to the task of creating conditions for the birth of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and finding the best ways for 
setting up confederal relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
Croatia in terms of the economy, cultural links, and overall 
communal relations in the search for a new international order 
in the region of former Yugoslavia and this part of southeast 
Europe. 
  [Journalist] Mr. President, you mentioned the federation, 
which has been agreed on at least in principle and in writing. 
When could we expect something similar in the case of the 
confederation between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Tudjman] The moment the federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
becomes established and an overall solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina is found. 
  [Journalist] Mr. President, I must apologize for my 
bluntness 
but please answer this -- namely, it often happens that 
statements made by your associates and you yourself are 
construed in Sarajevo as meddling in the internal affairs of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. This particularly applies to your 
insistence on your concern for your compatriots in the 
neighboring country. From the Sarajevan and Bosnia-Herzegovina 
point of view, this sometimes seems like interference in 
internal affairs. I would like to ask you whether, after 
Washington, we in Bosnia-Herzegovina can expect this to become 
confined within acceptable boundaries? 
  [Tudjman] Is what I said about Croatia making it possible 
for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Sarajevo government to organize their 
defense with Croatia's help also meddling in internal affairs? 
Is the fact that we accepted several hundred thousand refugees 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina meddling? Were we interfering when we 
were compelled to extend aid to the Croat population to defend 
itself against Serb aggression? At that time, when the Muslims 
were not yet prepared and when they did not believe the 
Yugo-communist army and Serbia and Montenegro would attack 
Bosnia, our Croats in Bosnia- Herzegovina were prepared 
precisely because they knew what was going on and because 
Croatia helped them defend themselves. 
  And something else -- Croatian territory was threatened from 
the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina which in the beginning was 
not prepared to defend itself from Serbian and Montenegrin and 
Yugo-communist aggression. I am not only referring to the 
immediate vicinity of Dubrovnik but to all of southern Croatia, 
although this especially applies to the regions east of the 
Neretva, around Dubrovnik. So, we had to interfere in order to 
defend the Croatian Republic as well as to extend aid to the 
Croat people who were threatened with genocide, as they truly 
were later on, just like the Muslim people. 
  Therefore, this was no meddling but a result of the crisis 
of 
the former Yugoslavia, the disintegration of the former 
Yugoslavia. What was at issue here was whether or not the whole 
of Bosnia- Herzegovina would be devoured by Greater Serbia. In 
this context we held talks with Mr. Izetbegovic and other Muslim 
leaders. You probably know that in the course of this series of 
talks we signed an agreement on 12 July 1992 in which it was 
said that the joint efforts against Serb aggression call for 
cooperation, including military cooperation in border areas. 
  Since we are discussing this issue and since you formulated 
your question the way you did, I must recall that we in Croatia 
even suggested a direct military alliance at the time. However, 
the Sarajevo government did not agree to a general military 
alliance but only to cooperation in border areas. So, this is 
what it was all about, not meddling. Croatia was extending aid 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina, not only to the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina for their defense against Serb aggression; 
this was also aid to the Muslims to stand on their feet, to 
organize in their opposition to Serb aggression, and all this 
was aimed at creating conditions for the preservation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Journalist] Please let me say that it was precisely the 
creation of, as we in Bosnia-Herzegovina say, the so-called 
Herceg-Bosna that was perceived by the government in Sarajevo 
and the presidency as an intention to partition Bosnia. What is 
your comment? 
  [Tudjman] Your question is again based on the wrong 
premises. 
A little while ago I explained to you that we favored both a 
cantonal and a provincial organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
But when this fell through, in the light of what was going on 
on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the war, when these 
proposals were not accepted by all three sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, then it is understandable that we -- 
contrary to this ambition of the Serbs to isolate themselves as 
a separate republic and contrary, as I said, to the intention, 
the Muslim leadership's considerable intention to create their 
own republic, their own independent Muslim state -- that the 
Croats had to start creating their own republic, Herceg-Bosna. 
The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was created in the 
resistance to Serbian aggression. Had it not been for this 
resistance the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina would have probably, 
as I said, fallen into the hands of Greater Serbia. 
  Hence, this was not a result of Croatia's choice in favor of 
Herceg-Bosna's secession. I will tell you one truth, two 
truths. We signed an agreement with Mr. Izetbegovic on 14 
September 1993 in Geneva and with the Muslim leadership, a 
public agreement on cooperation between the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna and the Muslim republic within the framework of a 
union. We also signed a secret agreement -- which does not have 
to be secret any longer now, given how the situation has evolved 
-- an agreement on a confederation of these republics with 
Croatia. 
  On 16 September, however, two days later, the Muslim 
leadership signed an agreement with the Serbs which, in fact, 
envisaged the break-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina, its carve-up, as 
this agreement stated that in the event of the union being 
carved up, the rights of the present Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
rights of its membership in the United Nations, would be vested 
in a Muslim republic. Consequently, one cannot, there is no 
justification, there are no historical and political reasons for 
ascribing this intention to the Croat people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia's policies, that Croatia has 
favored a break-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina since the beginning [as 
heard]. It was not in Croatia's interest to divide 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  I will even tell you one other thing. Highly responsible 
people from the Muslim leadership have told me: You can annex 
Herceg-Bosna to Croatia, but on condition that central Bosnia 
remains within the framework of the Muslim republic. I refused 
to accept this. I took into consideration the Croatian people 
outside the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna -- the area which had 
then been under direct control [as heard] -- and I believed, for 
strategic reasons, that more deeply-rooted joint interests 
existed than those regarding the annexation of western 
Herzegovina, which had been proposed. 
  All your questions indicate that there is a lack of 
understanding and one-sidedness in the way the Bosnian Muslim 
public was being informed about Croatia's policy from the very 
beginning of the crisis until today. This Croatian policy has 
led to what we have achieved [as heard]. Had it not been for 
the Croat republic of Hereg-Bosna, which also took others into 
consideration -- the leadership of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna included not only people from Herzegovina, but also 
those from central Bosnia and Bosnian Posavina -- we would not 
have saved these areas, the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina would 
not have been possible, and there would not have been an 
agreement on the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and on the 
confederation with Croatia. These are the foundations we should 
bear in mind, and it is this policy that we should build upon, 
and not upon one-sided and false interpretations of the Croatian 
policy. 
  [Journalist] What are real prospects for the full 
implementation of the Washington agreement? 
  [Tudjman] I think the prospects are good because the 
Washington agreement succeeded in coordinating Bosniak Muslim 
and Croat interests in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as the 
interests of Bosniak Muslims and Croats with those of the 
Croatian state. 
  Furthermore, these interests have been adjusted to the 
interests of the western world which did not want to allow the 
realization of Greater Serbian plans to incorporate 
Bosnia-Herzegovina into a Greater Serbia, nor did it allow -- 
and these tendencies existed -- extremist-fundamentalist 
Mujahedin-oriented plans to create an Islamic state in Bosnia 
and in Europe. 
  In this agreement on the Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation 
and on the confederation with Croatia, Croat and Muslim 
interests coincided with the interests of the Western world to 
create the preconditions for a democratic system and for linking 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with Western civilization -- contrary to 
aspirations to create a Greater Serbia and contrary to certain 
extremist notions that a fundamentalist Islamic state could be 
created. These are the guarantees for the implementation of 
this agreement. 
  [Journalist] Mr. President, after Geneva, when you and 
President Izetbegovic signed one of the Geneva agreements, your 
Minister Silajdzic and Minister Granic were set a task to 
implement the agreement. After the Washington agreement, are 
there any concrete tasks of this kind? Are there any concrete 
plans to implement it? 
  [Tudjman] For Christ's sake, the agreement is being 
implemented daily: the POWs have been released, talks are under 
way on the organization of federal power in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
plans exist on how to establish the confederation -- it is clear 
that this is a matter involving serious politicians dealing with 
serious politics and not the ones dealing with policy-mongering, 
who are calling into question this agreement beforehand, not 
taking into consideration the strategic elements. The problem 
of solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina does not only belong 
to Croats and Muslims, or to Croats, Muslims, and Serbs, but 
also to the eastern and the western world. 
  [Journalist] Looking at it from the present perspective, 
after all these evils we lived through together, what if 
anything would you change in your policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Tudjman] I answered this question when answering all your 
previous questions. I would not change anything. I would only 
wish to see that ideas about the necessity of the Bosniak 
Muslim-Croat alliance prevail in the Bosniak Muslim policy and 
that those are eliminated who went as far as claiming that it 
was wrong for the Muslims to enter a federation with the Croats. 
I would also like to see the revival of the traditions of 
Bosniak Muslim leaders -- political and cultural -- who 
advocated the idea that the Muslims had historic ties with the 
Croatian people through their origins and their language. 
Should I perhaps remind you of Safet Bey Basagic [Bosnian 
Muslim poet], I may not be able to quote precisely -- who had 
even predicted what I have just spoken of, that this is not just 
a Croat-Muslim issue, but also the issue of east and west. He 
said in one of his verses, I think: The sounds of my Croatian 
language can unite the east and the west, can be the food of 
both songs and the mind; if I am not mistaken. 
  I would like these people to come to the fore, the people 
who 
would nurture that which both Safet Bey Basagic and many other 
eminent Muslim political and cultural leaders have been 
nurturing. I knew many of them, I was especially fond of Mak 
Dizdar [Bosnian Muslim poet]. The same goes for Croats, for 
people like Franciscan [Bosnian Croat priest and poet] Grga 
Martic who wrote poems and spoke about unity in the interest of 
both Bosniak Muslims and Croats. I will try to remeber what 
Grga Martic said: There is no hope for a home lacking brotherly 
love, and there is no hope for a Bosnia without Croatia. 
Therefore this idea has survived despite everything that 
happened between the Croats and the Muslims in history. Because 
of this division between east and west and because of the 
geopolitical links, there is a need for a federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and for a concept of a confederation. For 
this to be achieved, it is necessary for both Muslims and Croats 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to get used to the idea that this is a 
historic necessity and that today's world needs it, so that they 
could coordinate their actions in this direction and know how to 
overcome all minor details which are different and which we 
discussed in part in this interview. 
  [Journalist] Mr. Tudjman, I would like to thank you and ask 
you one last question: At one of your regular monthly news 
conferences, you said that you would be happy to go to Sarajevo. 
Do you still think you would be going there happily? 
  [Tudjman] I am still happy to go, but I will be going with 
the feeling that in this way I would be implementing the policy 
which I have been conducting right from the beginning. This 
policy has also been advocated by far-sighted people -- both 
Croats and Muslims, as I said. I personally have known Croatian 
politicians who have played an important role not only in the 
political life of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- I am thinking of Dr. 
(Barisa Smojan) or Dr. (Juraj Sute) -- but in Croatian politics 
generally. I have also known Muslim politicians and cultural 
workers. 
  My visit to Sarajevo and Bosnia-Herzegovina will therefore 
be 
the continuation of the tendencies that unless there is a 
resolution of our future as envisaged by the Washington 
agreement, there would be no peaceful life together in this part 
of southeast Europe, and without this no new international order 
would be possible, not only on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia but there would also be no peace in this part of 
Europe. 
  So it is with this sense of the historical necessity of 
implementing this agreement, and life together as envisaged in 
the Washington agreement, that I am going to Sarajevo, in the 
hope that my visit will contribute to the implementation of 
these ideas and subsequently to the overcoming, as soon as 
possible, of not only the political but also the war crisis we 
are faced with at present and which the whole world is concerned 
with, and the whole world is requesting that we do this. 
  [Journalist] Mr. President, thank you for the conversation 
and bon voyage to Sarajevo. 
  [Tudjman] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Borislav Mikelic, prime minister-designate </F>
of the republic of Serbian Krajina, by Zoran Zivkovic in 
Belgrade; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Studio announcer] In the office of the republic 
of Serbian Krajina in Belgrade, Borislav Mikelic, prime minister 
designate of the republic of Serbian Krajina, held consultations 
with representatives of the parliamentary parties pertaining to 
the formation of the government. The consultations were also 
attended by Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian 
Krajina. An agreement was reached on the formation of a 
government of national unity that will be constituted at the 
assembly session scheduled for 20 April in Knin. In the name of 
the Serbian Democratic Party for Krajina [SDS], its president 
Dr. Milan Babic gave his agreement and support to Prime Minister 
Designate Borislav Mikelic for forming a government in which the 
SDS Krajina will be represented in proportion to its 
representation in the parliament. Veljko Vukelic, president of 
the deputy caucus of the SDS for Serbian lands, extended his 
support to this constructive agreement between Mikelic and 
Babic. The composition of the new government of national unity 
of the republic of Serbian Krajina was also established. 
  [Zivkovic] Mr. Mikelic, we have heard that on 20 April, the 
republic of Serbian Krajina will get a government of national 
unity. 
  [Mikelic] Well, yes. As soon as I was nominated prime 
minister designate by President Martic, I joined these, so to 
speak, active talks with the representatives and presidents of 
all the parties in the republic of Serbian Krajina. Of course, 
one of the central issues was the position the Serbian 
Democratic Party, headed by Mr. Babic, would take. 
Incidentally, the SDS has the greatest number of deputies in 
the republican assembly, regarding the part of the parliamentary 
coalition that existed [sentence as heard]. 
  For my part, I also talked to the leadership of the Serbian 
Radical Party [SRS], who, because of certain requests that I 
obviously could not implement -- I even offered a part of their 
membership to join our government -- however, owing to certain 
principled or some other reasons, they remained within the 
framework of their party's position [sentence as heard]. We 
have reached a complete agreement, an integral agreement with 
Mr. Babic, with the representatives of the SDS of the Serbian 
lands and other parties, and I can say that we have already 
reached an agreement on all the ministers in the framework of 
the future government which I will lead. 
  Therefore, along with the program that I will present to the 
assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina on Wednesday, 20 
April, I will also present the composition of the government, 
the cabinet, that is, and I believe that in such agreements, 
[words indistinct] we will achieve the unity which is of extreme 
importance to the Serbian people within the framework of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina at a point when we have signed this 
peace process, when we need to strengthen the Krajina from 
within, when we need to revive production, strengthen the civic 
state, and offer a perspective of our future joint state which 
we will create with the Srpska republic and the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. 
  I am convinced that this composition of the government and 
our agreement will lessen the tensions present on the ground, 
and that the Serbian people in the Krajina [changes thought], 
and that more favorable news will come from the Krajina than has 
been the case in the previous year and in those months when 
there were significant conflicts there.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] The following items on political and 
economic developments in the Republic of Croatia are drawn from 
periodicals published in the Republic. 
<H5>  HSLS Leader in Slavonia on Bosnia, Croatian Policy </H5>
  The founding assembly of the Croatian Social Liberal Party 
[HSLS] municipal branch was held in Semeljci in the presence of 
HSLS members from Djakovo, Trnava, Koritna, and Kesinci in 
eastern Slavonia. The Osijek daily GLAS SLAVONIJE on 17 March 
reports that the assembly was addressed by Ivica Sutalo, a 
delegate in the Croatian Assembly and president of the Djakovo 
HSLS branch, who expressed his "satisfaction" at the founding of 
the first HSLS branch in the eastern part of the Djakovo region. 
Speaking about the current political situation in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sutalo said that HSLS members welcome the 
cease-fire in Bosnia between the Croats and the Muslims, but 
that they are afraid of the rapid conclusion of the agreement on 
confederation, even before Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina have 
been freed from the "Serbian aggressor." 
  "Croats plunged twice, like geese, into the fog of the 
Yugoslav union; a third plunge, after all the victims and 
destruction, could be dangerous," Sutalo warned, adding that 
Croatian official policy during the last four years had been 
"consistent in its inconsistency." "This is why the HSLS, as the 
first opposition party, has the historical duty to present its 
views in a stronger and more precise way and to start examining 
the question of responsibility for the events of the last four 
years," Sutalo concluded according to the daily. 
<H5>  Questions Surrounding Privatization of Brewery </H5>
  The story of the privatization of the Karlovac Pivovara 
[Brewery] and the sale of shares in it point to "irregularities" 
in the work of the Croatian Privatization Fund, according to the 
Zagreb weekly DANAS of 22 March. DANAS reports such 
irregularities were even mentioned by President Franjo Tudjman 
at a recent news conference when he announced some dismissals of 
Fund personnel, "which provoked tumultuous applause from those 
present." The weekly notes that Andronik Luksic, a resident of 
Chile, "who is said to be one of the richest Croats in the 
world," is the buyer of the Croatian Privatization Fund's shares 
of the Karlovac brewery. Luksic, treated as a Croat citizen 
"thanks to a special interpretation" by the Ministry of Finance, 
received a discount of 30 percent of the brewery's valuation 
instead of the 10 percent a noncitizen would have received, so 
that instead of 15.1 million German marks he paid 10.7 million. 
Initially, the Fund opened its meetings on the privatization of 
the brewery to the public, DANAS notes, but after two meetings, 
"precisely as the privatization story was entering its final 
phase," the doors were closed. "It became obvious that some of 
the things discussed were not meant to be heard by everyone, and 
especially not by journalists," DANAS comments. Many things 
about the privatization of the brewery remain unclear, DANAS 
adds, concluding that what took place behind closed doors was 
politically motivated. 
<H5>  Light Metal Factory Privatization Scandal </H5>
  "A big scandal" is about to break out over the privatization 
of the Light Metals Factory [Tvornica Lakih Metala (TLM)] in 
Sibenik, which before the war in Croatia was the largest 
exporter in the Sibenik-Drnis zupanija [parish] and which still 
accounts for almost all of the parish's industrial production. 
The 18 March issue of Zagreb GLOBUS reports that the "warnings 
and cries for help" arriving more and more frequently from the 
Sibenik TLM indicate that the privatization of this enterprise 
could become "Croatia's robbery of the century." After three 
years of "agony," the former aluminum giant, with an annual 
turnover of over $250 million and 5,000 employees, is threatened 
with complete collapse. Officially, TLM's total debt amounts to 
140 million German marks, while its assessed value is 119 
million German marks. 
  Sibenik residents are especially worried about the funds in 
the TLM's foreign trade office, Comal, established in Munich, 
Germany, when all links with the former Yugoslav company, Genex, 
that had conducted TLM's foreign trade, were broken as a result 
of the war. Comal's basic task was to collect from Genex all 
funds that belonged to TLM and to prevent the money from ending 
up in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Between 5 and 7 
million German marks just sit in Comal, outside Croatia, while 
debts to business partners which supply raw materials are being 
repaid slowly or not at all, GLOBUS notes, adding that Sibenik 
residents ask: "Is someone trying to bring the factory to total 
collapse, only to buy it then for next to nothing?" There is no 
interest in the current Privatization Fund offer of 66 million 
German marks, but a situation is being created in which TLM 
could be bought from the state for a maximum of 10 million 
German marks, GLOBUS concludes. 
<H5>  Mate Boban's Life Out of Power </H5>
  Today, when he is no longer president of Herceg-Bosna, when 
documents about abolishing Herceg-Bosna are being signed, and 
when he is no longer even mentioned on Croatian television, Mate 
Boban--now merely the Zagreb Tobacco Factory representative for 
southern Croatia--sits in a Zagreb apartment reading newspapers 
and watching television. According to the 22 March issue of the 
Zagreb weekly DANAS, as he drinks Turkish coffee and smokes 
three packs of cigarettes daily, he cannot stop wondering about 
the turnaround by the journalists who until recently supported 
him, and by the politicians whom "he brought out of anonymity." 
Not only is he no longer invited to luncheons in the 
Presidential Office, but he is not being consulted on the 
Herceg-Bosna negotiations and does not even hear from people who 
constantly used to seek favors from him. 
  Boban is even more disappointed when he appears on the 
street, DANAS says, citing his complaint to a friend: "I cannot 
believe that acquaintances are turning their faces away from me 
and that they are crossing to the other side of the street. 
Everyone has abandoned me." DANAS says that his disappointment 
probably stems from awareness that he is the only politician 
whom Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has had to renounce. 
Everyone else, less important figures, even those who publicly 
opposed the president's views, remain on the team, DANAS notes, 
nevertheless giving Boban credit for the fact that "Croats from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will not accept any kind of federation which 
reduces the rights to which they are entitled as a sovereign 
people." DANAS adds that it is a shame that Boban, through poor 
organizational and personnel moves, tolerance of criminals, and 
"useless" violation of the human rights of the Bosnian Muslims, 
missed his chance to implement a concept of Herceg-Bosna 
acceptable to the West. Neither he nor his generation can 
correct this, but future generations will surely remember it, 
the weekly concludes.

<F P=106> [Report by Ivo Zaloudek: "According to Deputies, We Should </F>
Counter the Potential Threat From Russia by Joining NATO"] 
  [Text] We should counter the potential military threat in 
the event of undemocratic developments in Russia with efforts to 
join NATO as speedily as possible. At this time, however, the 
danger is not imminent. Vladimir Suman (Civic Democratic 
Alliance), chairman of the parliamentary Defense and Security 
Committee, and deputy chairmen Jan Kasal (Christian and 
Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party) and Pavel Tollner 
(Christian Democratic Party) agreed on this answer. 
  "The Czech Republic has satisfied the political conditions 
for joining the Alliance," Suman said and added: "I am 
convinced that if a real threat arose, our army would defend the 
sovereignty of the country. The quality of army morale is a 
different matter, and we will have to do a lot of work in that 
area. Most of the people in the supreme command are doing their 
best in this respect. We do object, however, to some actions of 
the defense minister -- one instance is the practical execution 
of the special assessment [screening] in the army." 
  Jan Kasal said: "I am troubled by the idea that in the mind 
of some Russian politicians, our republic has not ceased to be a 
component of its sphere of influence, but since Ukraine and 
Slovakia are located between us and Russia, it is not necessary 
to see Russia as the direct potential enemy and aim the training 
of the army in this direction. Nevertheless, it would be wrong 
if the Defense Ministry published these matters in a completely 
open manner, and therefore, as I am not a member of the Defense 
and Security Committee, I myself do not have access to any 
details." 
  According to Pavel Tollner, the danger on the part of Russia 
is based, above all, on its economic instability -- one example 
is the issue of "economic" refugees. "The potential military 
threat depends on the development of the political situation in 
Russia, which no one can predict," Tollner said. 
  A deputy of the opposition Czech Social Democratic Party, 
Stanislav Gross, also perceives the danger from Russia as 
potential, and he believes the entry of the Czech Republic into 
NATO is a solution. Left Bloc Chairman Marie Stiborova, on the 
other hand, declared: "If any major and broader based conflict 
arose, neither armies nor arms would help." According to 
Stiborova, we should not join NATO "because if there were 
problems coming from Russia, they would be augmented by the 
expansion of the Alliance as a counterbalance to something else, 
like Russia, for instance."

<F P=106> [Interview with Jiri Pesek, chairman of the Czech section of </F>
the Border Demarcation Commission, by Katerina Perknerova; place 
and date not given: "The Czech-Slovak Border Should Be 
Demarcated by the End of 1995"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Perknerova] What are the main 
problems in the work of the commission? 
  [Pesek] Having studied the administrative border in the 
field, we discovered many instances when it passes through the 
middle of communities, even buildings. 
  [Perknerova] Can you give us an example? 
  [Pesek] Javornik is a specific example, as the border does 
not follow the ridge there but rather a contour line below the 
ridge. Hence, it would be logical to move it to the ridge. That 
was the first instance of a proposed change, although from the 
very beginning the Czech side was aware that the Slovak side 
would have to be compensated for this territorial gain at some 
other place -- it was a matter of some 600 hectares. 
  After talks with the mayors, we came to the conclusion that 
this solution is not feasible, and we narrowed the proposal to 
just the Kasarna recreation area, where tow lifts have been 
built on the Czech side, and around them some 40 private cabins 
and nine resorts owned by Czech proprietors. Moreover, this 
area is accessible only from the Czech side and represents 
approximately 45 hectares for which we have offered to the 
Slovak side compensation in the immediate neighborhood. 
  [Perknerova] Nevertheless, the government of ex-Prime 
Minister Meciar recently decided that the Kasarna region will 
remain the domain of the Slovak Republic. 
  [Pesek] That was a great surprise for me. After the talks 
between the interior ministers of the Czech Republic and the 
Slovak Republic in Piestany, the commission met twice, and the 
end result was that the matter of the Kasarna recreation area 
will be left for the meeting of the prime ministers as the only 
unsolved case. 
  [Perknerova] Any other disputed areas? 
  [Pesek] There were 16 in all. The Velka Javorina transmitter 
was among them, to name just one, and they have been gradually 
settled directly in the field. In all, there are four disputed 
areas left. In addition to the aforementioned Kasarna, the most 
frequently discussed locality is Sidonia as a part of the Czech 
community of Brumov-Bylnice, and the settlement of U Sabotu, 
which belongs to the Javornik community but, at the same time, 
-- with respect to services, health care, education, etc. -- is 
a part of the catchment area of the Slovak community of Vrbovce. 
The best known instance of an unnatural border is the Morava 
River, where it passes through its old dried up bed and zig zags 
around the current stream of the Morava. Both delegations of 
the Demarcation Commission pushed from the very beginning for it 
to be transfered to a channeled bed provided the Czech side 
compensates Slovakia to the tune of 120 hectares. 
  [Perknerova] Do you have any idea regarding the area you 
will 
offer Slovakia for the banks of the Morava River? 
  [Pesek] We have sought a solution by the mayors of the Czech 
border-region communities but, unfortunately, they have not been 
very accommodating, so we opted for the Slovak proposal of 
annexing the U Sabotu settlement to the Slovak Republic. 
Originally, we expected that this change would settle all 120 
hectares but we had to respect the contrary views of the 
citizens of the Javornik and Velka nad Velickou communities. We 
have arrived at a reduction of the considered compensation area 
upon receiving petitions from the citizens of Javornik and Velka 
nad Velickou, which, however, do not have the same weight as the 
views of the U Sabotu citizens whom the change affects most. In 
the final stage, there were 45 hectares at stake and 39 
single-family houses of Slovak citizens from the U Sabotu 
settlement. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes; </F>
place and date not given: "Tension Between the Government and 
Parliament Is Natural"] 
  [Text] [Danes] During the rule of the Civic Forum, discord 
between the government and parliament was a somewhat regular 
phenomenon. However, this situation continues even today. There 
is discord not only between the coalition parties, but also 
between Civic Democratic Party [ODS] ministers and deputies. 
This has become apparent in the recent "compromise" regarding 
the elections to the Senate. What is the reason for this 
discord, and how could it be sorted out? 
  [Klaus] Our discussion about the elections to the Senate was 
definitely not a standard dispute between the government and 
parliament. It was not the natural dispute that can occur in 
any. It would be an absolute mistake to draw fundamental 
conclusions about relations between the government and 
parliament from a declaration made by one ODS deputy at a 
meeting of a group of coalition deputies. At most, we could ask 
whether this deputy acted in compoliance with the decision taken 
by the ODS Executive Council. 
  [Danes] There are other instances of discord between ODS 
ministers and deputies. For example, the Housing Bill presented 
by Dyba's Econhomics Ministry has been thoroughly redrafted by 
parliament (with the participation of ODS deputies). 
  [Klaus] Unlike other, more formal laws, the Housing Law is a 
political issue. Each of us has a certain position on the 
housing problem. This is a classical example of a law that is 
more likely to be changed by the deputies than other laws. I 
would not draw any conclusions from this. 
  [Danes] You do not see any noticeable problems between the 
ODS ministers and, for example, the ODS deputies, do you? 
  [Klaus] Instead of asking about controversy between the 
government and parliament, you should rather ask about 
controversy between the party leadership and some of its members. 
  [Danes] If the classical majority system for the elections 
to the Senate is not approved in parliament, would you be in 
favor of eliminating the Senate from the Constitution? 
  [Klaus] I hope that we will find a solution and that the 
original government draft will pass. This is clear. 
Restitution, the Senate, regional administration -- we are 
tired of speaking about these problems. People who want to find 
a solution different from the one that has been developed, more 
of less through national consensus, are constantly bringing up 
this issues. They force us, again and again, to take a position 
on these issues. We have taken this position so many times. 
Our reaction is abrupt because we have the feeling that they 
are reopening issues that were closed a long time ago.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Suman, chairman of the </F>
parliamentary Defense and Security Committee, by Jiri Hracek; 
place and date not given: "Czech Officers Were Screened by 
Former Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Members"] 
  [Text] Last week, the Defense and Security Committee of the 
Chamber of Deputies discussed the results of the screening of 
the Czech Army officers. The committee assumed a very critical 
stand regarding both the process and the results of the 
screening. We asked Deputy Vladimir Suman (Civic Democratic 
Alliance), chairman of the Defense and Security Committee, for 
an explanation. 
  [Hracek] Sir, during the assessment of the results of the 
screening of the Czech Army officers at the open session of the 
Defense and Security Committee, you have commented rather 
skeptically on the approach used. What led you to this 
criticism? 
  [Suman] You must know that our committee adopted a 
resolution, in which it expresses its dissatisfaction with the 
results of the special screening of the professional soldiers. 
Several serious factors led us to this stand. True, the 
examinations were broadly implemented and included practically 
all professional soldiers. This means that thousands of people 
passed the test. It seemed remarkable to us that of this large 
number, only 60 officers were described as unsuitable for 
service -- that is approximately 0.3 percent of those who passed 
the screening. Another important reason for our dissatisfaction 
was the method of implementing the examination. Our committee 
received information from many places that in numerous units 
people very closely connected with the Ommunist regime were 
appointed to the screening commissions. We know, for instance, 
that in one of the army units the examinations were conducted by 
a former member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia [KSC] 
Auditing Commission and also a former chairman of the Division 
Committee of the KSC. In some instances, these people screened 
professional soldiers who never joined the party. This 
situation led to the refusal by some officers to be screened 
under these circumstances, while others passed the screening but 
left the army in protest against this principle. At a session 
of the committee, Deputy Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party) quoted 
from a letter from these officers. 
  [Hracek] Is there an overall report on the current 
appointments to all leading posts in the army at all levels? 
  [Suman] The Defense and Security Committee requested from 
[Defense] Minister Baudys a list of all people who were, as of 1 
November 1989, agents of counterespionage or military 
counterespionage. The list should include the staff of the KSC 
political instruction apparatus and former military screening 
officers. Each name entry should include the army function 
under the communist regime and the reasons for leaving the army, 
if applicable. We are also interested in whether these people 
work in the army. 
  [Hracek] Are you worried that in case of a crisis, our 
country could be internally threatened by these people who still 
are in the army? 
  [Suman] In a discussion with the defense minister, we 
reached 
the conclusion that the majority of our officers would defend 
the sovereignty of the Czech Republic. Regarding internal 
security, I believe that the economic and political character of 
this state has been decided without any chance of the return of 
the former regime.

<F P=106> [Report by Petr Bakovsky: "The First Czech Fighter Plane </F>
Will Satisfy NATO Standards"] 
  [Text] Aero Vodochody is preparing production of the first 
military aircraft with armaments completely compatible with 
those of the NATO. The aircraft in question is the multipurpose 
light fighter aircraft L-159. A prototype should finished by 
1996. According to the military experts, this will contribute 
to increasing the combat readiness of the Czech Army, and the 
financial savings are not negligible. 
  The subsonic L-159 aircraft, based on the L-59 type, should 
be part of our army within four years. It should carry 
substantially more weaponry in seven holders under the wings. 
If attacked, it is capable of aerial combat, and it will be 
equipped with a stronger engine, the U.S. F-124, and other 
modern systems. The new Czech combat aircraft will be deployed 
at the tactical air bases in Caslav and Namest nad Oslavou. 
  The need for new aircraft results from the transformation of 
our Air Force, which will lead to 250 pilots leaving the force 
and a reduction of military aircraft by more than 30 percent. 
Of the total of 138 aircraft, 77 combat aircraft are being 
eliminated. They are mostly older machines, the elimination of 
which should limit types of aircraft, including the modern 
MiG-29 aircraft, that are not compatible with the NATO 
equipment. Moreover, according to Pavel Strubl, the Air Force 
inspector, operation is very uneconomical because of the small 
numbers involved. 
  Additional purchases are not planned, and therefore until 
the 
reequipment, the Czech Air Force will keep its MiG-21's and 
MiG-23's, while the void in the fighter force will be filled by 
the SU-22 and SU-25 fighter bombers. The lifespan of most of 
these aircraft will expire in the coming years but the Air Force 
intends to keep them in operation until they are replaced. An 
acquisition of modern supersonic aircraft is expected after the 
year 2000.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
made a special statement about the dramatic situation in Gorazde 
for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and Television. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] The problem lies in the fact 
that 
they wished they knew how to impose an embargo, but do not know 
and are refusing to defend us. In other words -- neither will 
you defend yourselves nor will you be able to because we will 
not let you. This is the death sentence pronounced over 
Bosnia-Herzegovina by the international community. We shall 
adamantly insist on this issue these days. Why? Why is 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] here? UNPROFOR means the UN 
Protection Forces, that is what UNPROFOR stands for. Therefore, 
a protection force. And who are they protecting? That is an 
entirely different question. They are not protecting the safe 
havens, they are not even protecting themselves. They are not 
capable of protecting anybody or of bringing order to this part 
of the world. The question arises -- Why are they here? 
  Furthermore, we have heard that there were many casualties 
today, that Gorazde is exposed to heavy artillery and tank 
attacks. We hold the top-ranking UN officials directly 
responsible for the deaths of not only these people in Gorazde 
but for the deaths of 200,000 people. The Security Council had 
voted for an embargo on arms sales to Bosnia-Herzegovina yet 
does not know how to protect it. We are asking ourselves why 
the chetnik offensive on Gorazde -- which has been going on for 
more than two weeks now -- was not checked by air strikes as 
prescribed by Resolutions 824 and 836. What was done was done in 
such a way to in fact encourage those beasts up there on those 
hills, they were encouraged more than impressed after losing one 
or two tanks. We have fighters who destroyed 10 or 12 tanks 
each. Therefore, neither were our fighters impressed nor those 
beasts. All that was to no avail. 
  Unfortunately, the situation is such that UN Envoy Yasushi 
Akashi is expected to arrive any moment from Pale. I really do 
not know why he went there -- everything is clear. What more do 
they have to do to be treated the way they should be treated -- 
as beasts and not as some side in the conflict. They killed 
200,000 innocent people, they destroyed a country, they violated 
every human law imaginable -- not only UN laws but human laws -- 
what else should they do? They attacked UNPROFOR, they attacked 
them in Tuzla. After their generals said they would collect 
children in coffins, what else are they supposed to do so 
someone would react? Unfortunately, I must tell you that I 
received a letter from Mr. Hurd, the British Foreign Secretary, 
in which -- believe it or not -- he calls on the sides in Bosnia 
to refrain from any actions. I have this letter here in my 
pocket. He is in fact calling on us to refrain from any kind of 
action. And this at a moment when Gorazde is bleeding, when 
Brcko is bleeding, when Bihac is bleeding. Incredible but true 
-- our people should know who we are dealing with. [end

  [Text] We have just learned that Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic has sent a letter to the UN Security 
Council [UNSC] chairman. The letter reads: 
  You are aware that the aggressor has been attacking the 
protected zone of Gorazde for 20 days now, using troops and 
military equipment brought from Serbia and Montenegro. The 
aggressor's forces have occupied a large part of the protected 
zone and destroyed and burned down 21 villages around Gorazde. 
Some 230 people have been killed and 800 wounded in the town 
center. Civilian facilities in the centre of Gorazde are being 
destroyed with all available weapons. Tens of thousands of 
people are facing death from shooting or starvation, the letter 
says. 
  It is a fact that the United Nations and its representatives 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina did not use their mandate and powers 
granted to them by UNSC resolutions 824 and 836. As a 
consequence the population which -- through the arms embargo -- 
has been denied the right to self-defense has been left without 
any protection. We therefore consider those who make decisions 
within the UN as being responsible for what has happened, the 
letter says. 
  We demand that the UNSC urgently take appropriate measures 
in 
keeping with Article 7 of the UN Charter, which means to use 
force to stop the attacks by Serb aggressor's forces against 
Gorazde. We repeat that this is an aggression by Serbia and 
Montenegro against the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has 
been going on for two years. We demand the urgent establishment 
of an exclusion zone around Gorazde, from which the aggressor's 
troops and military equipment must withdraw. 
  Mr. President, we are talking about tens of thousands of 
civilians who, together with the rest of the world, expect that 
the peace-keeping forces will fulfill their duty, the letter 
says.

  [Text] Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, today spoke on the phone with U.S. State 
Secretary Warren Christopher. Silajdzic warned Christopher 
about the critical situation in Gorazde. The aggressor has been 
attacking the town center and civilians in Gorazde. News 
reaching the U.S. public is not true. Something needs to be 
done urgently in order to save the lives of the tens of 
thousands of people, Silajdzic said among other things. Talking 
to Christopher, he stressed that reports said there were many 
wounded, and civilians were completely unprotected. According to 
Silajdzic, it is not only the credibility of the United Nations 
and NATO that is at stake, but also the credibility of the world 
democratic order.

<F P=106> [Report by Obren Zerajic from Cajnice] </F>
  [Text] Fighting continues today in the area between Gorazde 
and Cajnice. The command of the Herzegovina Corps stresses that 
the units of the Srpska army are successfully carrying out their 
duties with the aim of enabling the expelled Serbian population 
from the right bank of the Drina River to return home and to 
save around 1,000 Serbs trapped in Gorazde itself. In fighting 
yesterday and overnight, the troops of the Herzegovina Corps 
have captured two important peaks -- Gradina and Jartiste, 
located some five kilometers east of Gorazde. These are the 
positions from which all Muslim attacks toward Cajnice were 
launched in the past 18 days. NATO planes are today again 
overflying the positions of the Serb troops between Gorazde and 
Cajnice. True, they are flying at an altitude over three 
kilometers, but an air raid alarm has been in effect in Cajnice 
since yesterday. The local population is observing the alarm. 
There have been no losses in the ranks of the Herzegovina Corps 
in the past 24 hours.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 16 (AFP) -- Russian special envoy on 
ex- Yugoslavia, Vitaliy Churkin, said Saturday [16 April] 
Bosnian Serb forces had assured him that they did not plan to 
take the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  Speaking here after meeting UN special envoy on 
ex-Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi, Churkin said: "The two very firm assurances I 
think I got from them (the Bosnian Serbs) is that it is not 
their intention to take the town. It is not their intention to 
shell the town." 
  Serb forces were Saturday consolidating their position 
around 
the eastern town, which now shelters around 70,000 people, after 
capturing the last strategic positions in the area Friday.

  [Text] Immediately prior to this broadcast a radio link was 
established with Gorazde, from where we have the news that a 
NATO plane has been hit above Gorazde, that it is in flames and 
that the pilot has bailed out. This was stated to us by Dr. 
Safet Cibo, a doctor in Gorazde hospital. 
  Let us listen to a recording of what Dr. Cibo said: 
  [Begin Cibo recording] They have just hit a NATO plane -- 
flames, the plane is falling, the chetniks are shooting. [end 
recording] 
  And before this we received a report about the current 
situation in Gorazde. 
  Unfortunately we have bad news from Gorazde -- chetnik tanks 
from both sides of the Drina River are already on the town's 
streets. One by one they are firing shells at residential 
buildings. There is no one from whom one could get reliable 
information about the casualties. 
  There is no one who could have envisaged what would happen 
here in the early evening. 
  After the 18-day-long fierce offensive, after several 
hundred 
killed and over 1,000 injured, the chetniks last night attacked 
two [word indistinct]. The assualts were from three directions, 
but they were particulalry intensive from the Jabuka and 
Ustipraca areas. This morning, the attacks were intensified and 
during the afternoon they were continued and accompanied by 
howitzer shelling of the town. 
  There were several infantry attacks on the right bank of the 
Drina. Kopaci was targeted by multiple-rocket launchers, and 
tanks from Ustipraca and from the north and south have been 
constantly in action. [passage indistinct]

  [Text] Naples, Italy, April 16 (AFP) -- NATO Southern 
Command confirmed here late Saturday [16 April] that a British 
Sea Harrier fighter was shot down over the eastern Bosnian 
enclave of Gorazde, but that the alliance had launched no air 
strikes. 
  In a statement issued at 8:00 p.m (1800 GMT), the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation command said the plane and a second 
aircraft were patrolling over Moslem enclave when the downing 
occurred. 
  The Southern Command said the pilot was "reported to be safe 
and not seriously injured after he ejected from his jet while he 
was responding to a (United Nations Protection Force) request 
for close air support in the Gorazde area." 
  The statement added: "The Sea Harrier was flying from the 
(British aircraft) carrier HMS Ark Royal. The pilot of another 
Sea Harrier observed the pilot ejecting from his aircraft and 
parachuting to the ground." 
  NATO added that the two aircraft "were attempting to conduct 
a close air support mission against a tank reported to have been 
firing directly into Gorazde," stressing that no NATO air 
strikes were launched. 
  The statement added: "Information avalaible to this 
headquarters suggests the situation around Gorazde is quiet at 
this time." 
  Earlier Saturday afternoon in Zagreb, a source close to 
UNPROFOR said air strikes were underway at 6:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) 
Saturday around the enclave. 
  But the source later said that the NATO air manoeuvres 
around 
the besieged enclave had been flights providing close air 
support and not bombing raids. 
  The UNPROFOR source, who declined to be named, said no Serb 
target had been destroyed.

  [Text] Cajnice, April 16 (TANJUG) -- NATO planes did not 
bomb Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde on Saturday and the 
Serbs did not down the NATO British plane which was shot out of 
the sky over Gorazde earlier in the day because there was no 
need for the Serbs to activate their anti-aircraft defence, the 
command of the Bosnian Serb Army Herzegovina Corps said in a 
statement. 
  The plane burst into flames and fell between Mt. Grebac and 
the village of Ilovaca, some 15 kilometres west of Gorazde. The 
pilot bailed out and fell at the Baba hill near Vitkovici on the 
left bank of the Drina River, in Moslem-held territory, the 
statement added. 
  The Bosnian Serb command also denied reports that NATO 
planes 
on Saturday destroyed a Serb tank which had allegedly been 
shelling Gorazde. 
  The same source said Bosnian Serb forces were not attacking 
the town and that Moslems in Gorazde were activating explosive 
devices to create the impression with the U.N. troops that the 
town was being shelled by the Serb artillery. 
  The Bosnian Serb command said it had obtained information 
that Moslems in Gorazde were planning an operation which would 
cause massive civilian casualties, similar to the one carried 
out at a Sarajevo downtown market on February 5, and then blame 
it on the Serbs.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 16 Apr (TANJUG) -- President of the 
Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said in Banja Luka today that 
Srpska republic army units had not entered the town of Gorazde 
but that all strategic points around Gorazde are in their 
"hands." 
  "I have spoken with our generals who have an insight into 
the 
situation and they told me that the Muslims have been activating 
remote controlled explosive devices in order to create the 
impression that we are shelling the town," Karadzic said. 
  Karadzic said that new air strikes against the Serbs are 
possible because "despite being aware that Gorazde is a major 
Muslim stronghold, Washington is not satisfied by the degree of 
fear manifested by the Serb side." 
  Karadzic believes that this is the reason why several (UN) 
monitors have been left in Gorazde after the evacuation of 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members, so that they could be 
used as an excuse for air strikes. 
  Karadzic says Gorazde is no kind of "security zone" but is a 
military stronghold. He said the Muslims there have a full 
corps of about 15,000 soldiers, as a result of which the Srpska 
republic (of Bosnia-Herzegovina) was forced to use a full corps 
in order to bring Gorazde under control, he said. 
  "The international community must finally state whether this 
is a protected zone or not," Karadzic believes. Butrus-Ghali 
also spoke about the redefining of Gorazde as a protected zone, 
"from which they are killing our people on a daily basis." 
  According to him, the Muslims were much in favor of the 
latest offensive, which they began from the ostensible "security 
zone of Gorazde," in order to join together a section of 
territory stretching from Sarajevo, via this town, to Sandzak, 
and later they would seek to reestablish the same system as 
before the offensive. [sentence as received] 
  "We, of course, could not permit this, and now all the 
villages on the right bank of the Drina are ours, and here we 
will form a Serb municipality of Gorazde," Karadzic said. 
  Karadzic insists that the way out of the crisis in Gorazde 
is 
either peace or an escalation of the war in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  He confirmed again today that a political communication had 
been established with the UN secretary general's special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi and that their joint action yesterday "prevented 
another world war." 
  "It is fortunate that we were together yesterday when 
General 
Rose asked for the bombing of Gorazde again because we were 
allegedly endangering UNPROFOR members," Karadzic explained. 
  "Rose is very dangerous for Europe because he has disastrous 
assessments based on false reports he receives and then passes 
on." 
  Karadzic confirmed that relations with UNPROFOR are 
suspended 
until further notice, i.e., that there will be no contacts 
between the Srpska republic and UN military representatives. 
  He said that some UNPROFOR monitors had been only 500 meters 
away from the Serb lines near Gorazde without the knowledge of 
the Srpska republic army. 
  "If they are on Muslim positions without our knowledge then 
we consider them to be members of Muslim units and not any kind 
of observers," Karadzic said. 
  In his words, Gorazde is an opportunity for the Muslim 
forces 
to launch heavy offensive operations on other front lines, too, 
by taking advantage of this situation. [sentence as received] 
  "For the Muslims the most important operations have been 
taking place around Gorazde, but they have also mounted 
offensives in Kupres, Srbobran, Teslic, Ozren, and Trebava," 
Karadzic said. "They have even scored some minor successes but 
our army has managed to eradicate all of them." 
  The Srpska republic president also stressed that there are 
no 
hostilities as yet between units of the army of the Srpska 
republic and the Croat Defense Council, except in Posavina, 
where sporadic skirmishes have been taking place most of the 
time anyway. 
  "There is some possibility of `the corridor' being cut by 
some operation from Croatia, in which case we would immediately 
declare our unification with the republic of Serb Krajina," 
Karadzic said. 
  He could not confirm whether NATO forces had occupied Tuzla 
Airport, but he said he had reports that aircraft not belonging 
to UNPROFOR are landing there.

<F P=106> [Interview with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska </F>
republic, by Branislav Bozic in Banja Luka on 16 April -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Bozic] Mr. Karadzic, it was announced in 
Washington today that the Serbian forces had entered Gorazde? 
  [Karadzic] They have not entered Gorazde. I do not know 
what they call Gorazde, but they have not entered the town 
itself. We are restraining ourselves here, but as far as 
strategic points are concerned, almost all of them are in our 
hands. Washington probably needs this [information that the 
Serbs have entered the town] in order to launch a new attack. 
The Muslims are currently activating mines around Gorazde by 
means of remote control, in order to convince the international 
public that we are targeting the town itself. It looks as if UN 
observers, some of whom have been evacuated last night -- I 
ordered a cease-fire which was a complete success on our side 
and the observers were evacuated by helicopter shortly before 
nightfall -- [changes thought] but it seems that they left an 
observer or two behind in order to have cause to attack us in 
case they are shelled. The only reason, the only justification 
for an attack on Serbian positions would be our intentional 
endangering of the lives of their people, which has never been 
the case so far. 
  [Bozic] What is your assessment, will there be more bombings 
of Serbian positions? 
  [Karadzic] We believe that there will be, we believe so 
because they are very dissatisfied with the effects [of the 
earlier air strikes], they are highly dissatisfied with the 
degree of fear among the Serbs. The Serbs are not displaying 
any fear at all. On the contrary, we are very decisive. Both 
the decisiveness and the morale of both our army and the 
leadership are rising. Whenever we are treated unfairly, we 
always draw great moral energy from this. Therefore, we are 
resolved to protect our interests. For us, Gorazde -- even if 
we had taken it, we would have been right -- is not a safe haven 
but a military stronghold. We believe that they have an entire 
corps there, some 15,000 troops. Well, we have an entire corps 
there to keep an eye on them. This corps of ours was supposed 
to go and do its work in factories, but we have to (?keep it in 
position) in order to ensure that the Muslims do not attack us. 
That is unacceptable. The international community must be 
clear on this point. It either is or is not a protected area. 
If it is a protected area, the Muslims must hand over their 
weapons. If they do not hand them over to the United Nations, we 
will force them to hand the weapons over to us. 
  [Bozic] This afternoon you contacted Mr. Akashi by telephone 
from Banja Luka. Can you reveal a few details of this 
conversation? 
  [Karadzic] Well, he again received information that the 
Serbs were fiercely shelling the town center. I contacted my 
generals, and was told -- even by those generals who have a view 
of the town, who can see the town -- that there were explosions 
in the center of the town and that they resemble explosions of 
remotely activated mines, but that the Serbs were certainly not 
shelling the town. Nothing launched by the Serbs was landing on 
the town. Moreover, the generals told me that is was possible 
that this was pressure on the observers, that the observers were 
actually hostages of the Muslims and were forced to send reports 
that were dictated to them.

  [Text] Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman of the Srpska republic 
assembly, in Pale today held long talks with Russian special 
envoy Vitaliy Churkin. Reporter Mirjana Kursmuk talked to 
Chairman Krajisnik. 
  [Begin recording] [Kursmuk] Today you were supposed to meet 
with the UN secretary general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi. 
However, the meeting never took place. Can you tell us what 
really happened? 
  [Krajisnik] Well, we received information that Mr. Akashi 
and Mr. Churkin wished to meet with us. The first meeting was 
set for 1130, and later for 1340. Only Mr. Churkin arrived, and 
not Mr. Akashi. He told us that unforeseen difficulties had 
arisen, and that Mr. Churkin [as heard] was called to return to 
Sarajevo, so that he actually turned back when he was already on 
his way and went back to Sarajevo [sentence as heard]. We 
spent almost the entire day in talks with Mr. Churkin, trying to 
find a solution, because the situation was very dramatic around 
Gorazde itself and on the international level because there was 
constant danger of another air attack. There were several 
unconfirmed reports that our tank had entered the town of 
Gorazde, that it was firing at Gorazde, and that this would be 
reason for a military intervention. Not only support for the UN 
Protection Force in the form of a military strike [as heard], 
but a military intervention which would mean a general attack. 
We managed to dispel this dilemma through constant contact with 
our General Staff and our commanders on the ground, because our 
tank was not in that position. We nevertheless issued orders 
that fire was not to be opened on the town itself. After that, 
pressure eased, and dilemmas regarding our attacks on Gorazde 
were dispelled. We are still in the midst of talks, because 
there is pressure for Serbs to withdraw away from Gorazde, but 
the Serbs cannot withdraw. Moreover, they did not advance in 
the course of the day. That was inaccurate information launched 
by the Muslims. [end recording]

  [Text] Brussels, April 16 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
called for NATO air strikes over the UN-declared "safe haven" of 
Gorazde, a spokesman said here Saturday [16 April], shortly 
after the downing of a NATO jet over the eastern Bosnian Moslem 
enclave. 
  The NATO spokesman said the downed Harrier jump-jet, from 
which the pilot reportedly ejected, was shot down during a 
"non-offensive" operation over the enclave.

<F P=106> [Statement on the situation in Gorazde by Alija Izetbegovic, </F>
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina radio and television on 16 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] As you know, this was the latest statement we made 
prior to the news conference -- the attack continues. We have 
just received a report that [word indistinct] is bombing. But 
we have also received a report that an order has been issued to 
the effect that air strikes should follow. Of course, we may 
again ask ourselves whether this will be the same kind of strike 
as we have seen hitherto. I am afraid that this is what is 
going to take place. 
  As you can see, this agreement in the UN [words indistinct] 
we are talking about one thing, they are talking about another 
-- it is like that deaf telephone game -- we are talking about 
eliminating Serb artillery and chetnik tanks and equipment, 
while they are talking about one chetnik tank. They always talk 
along the lines of there being only one tank, which they are 
looking for and cannot find, and so on. Anyway, as far as I 
know, there is an order to act. 
  What they are going to do, at the moment [words indistinct] 
but what I can say to the people of Gorazde at this really 
critical moment is this: I want to tell them that they are not 
alone, that we have been working throughout all these days and 
nights. Last night we adjourned our meeting at 0200. Today a 
series of meetings...[pauses] We have involved the world in this 
matter, at the moment the entire world is talking about Gorazde. 
Whether this will bring about any success to this town [words 
indistinct] I do not know yet. We talked to President Demirel, 
Turkey's president, an hour ago. [passage indistinct] to save 
the town. 
  What is the most important thing, though, is that we must 
save ourselves in the first place. I would first call on the 
citizens not to succumb to panic. It seems there are elements 
of panic. Various reports, they are coming in every hour, every 
two hours, [words indistinct]. My impression is that there is 
panic in the town. There are cases of combat positions being 
abandoned. We will find out whether this was justified or not. 
  We know that a huge force has been unleashed on Gorazde but 
the town can and must hold out. We were in such a situation 
here [word indistinct]. Two years later we started pushing them 
slowly back. They can take the town with a great deal of 
difficulty. If its defense is organized they cannot take the 
town. They would have to pay dearly for each house. 
Consequently, I would like to call on the people of Gorazde to 
restore their courage [words indistinct]. Let them know that the 
entire world supports them and, first of all, the whole of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina supports them.

<F P=106> [By Victoria Stegic] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- Special UN envoy 
Yasushi Akashi and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic met 
Sunday [17 April] in the Serb stronghold of Pale in a bid to end 
the fighting around the Moslem enclave of Goradze, SRNA news 
agency reported. 
  The meeting, also attended by Russia's special envoy to 
ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin, began at 0830 GMT and was aimed 
at looking into a proposal to review the security zone around 
the besieged enclave, the Bosnian Serb agency said. 
  Churkin in recent days has become a critical player in 
trying 
to resolve the conflict with the United States calling on Russia 
to use its influence with the Serbs to put a stop to an 
escalating crisis that has put UN personnel at risk. 
  Commander Guy Vinet, spokesman for the UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR), earlier had said that the Serbs were still holding 
UN troops in the Sarajevo sector. 
  Their release by 0800 GMT was one of the conditions set by 
UNPROFOR for the resumption of peace talks in Pale. It was 
unclear, however, whether they had been released when the talks 
began. 
  UNPROFOR was also waiting for Serb checkpoints around 
Sarajevo to be reopened to allow its units to go to Gorazde to 
provide a buffer force between Serb and Moslem forces. 
  SRNA quoted the Serb military leadership as saying that 
Moslem units, backed by UN troops stationed in Ugorska, north of 
Sarajevo, had shelled Serb position early Sunday. It said the 
offensive stopped once the Serbs retaliated. 
  The agency added that fighting around Gorazde was continuing 
Sunday and that the Serbs had taken control of "strategic zones" 
north of Gorazde. [passage omitted] 
  The UN Protection Force has drawn up a plan to demilisarise 
the enclave, one of the so-called UN safe areas, which has been 
reduced to the town itself by the ongoing Serb offensive. 
  A multinational force of majority French UN troops with some 
Ukrainians would enforce the plan. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, April 17 (AFP) -- Gorazde is now 
completely submerged in a wave of refugees who have fled Bosnian 
Serb shelling, a UN aid agency spokesman said here Sunday [17 
April]. 
  Peter Kessler, spokesman for the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said 25,000 civilians had 
taken refuge in the eastern Bosnian town since the Serb 
offensive on the Moslem enclave began March 29. 
  Speaking in French, Kessler said: "Gorazde is submerged with 
refugees and there is not a single free square metre of space in 
both public and private buildings in the town." 
  Most of the refugees had arrived since Friday, when the Serb 
offensive intensified, he said. 
  Both Bosnian Serb and Bosnian government media reported that 
the battle for the enclave -- a UN-declared "safe area" -- was 
continuing Sunday, hours after NATO came within seconds of 
launching an air strike there when one of its planes was downed 
by missile fire. 
  Meanwhile in Geneva, the Red Cross announced an emergency 
plan to ferry in fresh aid teams to ease the humanitarian crisis 
in the besieged enclave. 
  The town, which had a population of 37,000 prior to the 
Bosnian war, was now crammed full with more than 60,000 people, 
while Moslem villages outside the city walls had been left 
deserted in the face of the Serb advance, Kessler said. 
  Kessler added that Serb "snipers" had now started firing at 
key locations, including the town's hospital, from frontline 
positions no more than a few hundred metres (yards) from the 
town centre. 
  The snipers were targeting the wounded inside their hospital 
beds Saturday, Kessler said, adding that a doctor was injured 
the same day by a Serb shell which landed around 15 metres from 
the hospital. 
  According to figures released Friday, more than 240 people 
have died and around 1,100 been wounded during the Serb 
offensive. Kessler said Sunday midday that "these figures have 
increased greatly since then." 
  The four-member UNHCR team in the town has taken refuge in a 
bank strongroom and can only venture out after nightfall as Serb 
snipers have Gorazde in their sights throughout the day. 
  The "dramatic humanitarian situation" in Gorazde prompted 
the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Geneva to 
launch an immediate "action plan" on behalf of the enclave. 
  ICRC teams in Belgrade, Pale and Sarajevo "are ready to go 
immediately to Gorazde to bring help to the numerous victims" of 
the shelling, the organisation said in a statement issued 
overnight Saturday. 
  The back-up teams could leave as soon as the necessary 
authorisation had been gained, the statement said. 
  It added that the ICRC was seeking guarantees from the 
warring parties that they would "respect the civilian 
population" and give unrestricted access to aid teams treating 
prisoners and evacuating the wounded, and to road convoys 
bringing in emergency supplies. 
  The ICRC currently has a 12-member team in Gorazde. [passage

  [Excerpt] It is still not known how long Gorazde will live. 
Is it a question of minutes or hours. It is certainly not a 
question of days, as chetnik tank have already entered the town. 
The chaos has begun; horror and hell are in every place [words 
indistinct]. Chetniks are shooting at the people with snipers 
and anti-aircraft weapons. There are many casualties but their 
number is not known in this chaos. Unarmed people are facing 
chetnik tanks. NATO planes are agonizing [words indistinct]. 
The town center of Gorazde has become a real enclosure for 
children, women, and the elderly waiting for the death they have 
already seen. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] The Bosnian Serb leader promised an 
immediate cease-fire in Gorazde following a long meeting with 
the UN'S special envoy. [passage omitted] RDP-1 has learned 
that the city is under heavy fire, tens of thousands of people 
fleeing. There have been more than 1,200 casualties since the 
beginning of the Serb offensive. The Serbs have entered Gorazde 
with combat vehicles, as UN spokesman Manuel Almeida told us. 
  [Begin recording] [Almeida] We were informed by our 
colleagues in Gorazde that the local people had told them that 
the Serbs were entering the city with tanks. [passage omitted] 
We did not see this because we are in shelters as the city is 
being bombarded. Our colleagues are in protected shelters and 
the local people went to see them and tell them. Also, what we 
can see is that the population is in a great panic. This is 
understandable since we estimate that during the offensive of 
the last few days, last two weeks, about 25,000 people have been 
moved within the Gorazde enclave; the great majority seeking 
refuge in the city of Gorazde or in its outskirts. The city 
does not have the conditions to receive so many people, many 
buildings have been destroyed. 
  [Announcer] How many casualties are there? 
  [Almeida] There are about 1,200 people dead or injured.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has sent a letter to UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali about the [word indistinct] 
situation in Gorazde. The letter reads: 
  The news I have received from Gorazde says that the town is 
in agony. For 20 days Karadzic's Serbs and units of the 
Yugoslav army have been attacking the town -- besieged for 10 
months -- with unabated intensity. The strange game, in which 
the obvious things are not seen, loud voices are not heard, and 
mechanisms have become impotent, has also been going on for 20 
days. The so-called protected zone has become the most unsafe 
area in the world. 
  The organization which you head proclaimed the free 
territory 
of Gorazde a UN-protected area almost a year ago. Security 
Council resolutions 824 and 836 refer to this protected zone, 
but they have remained only empty phrases. Neither you nor your 
personnel have done anything, or hardly anything, to use the 
mandate of all those resolutions in order to protect the people 
of Gorazde and the credibility of the United Nations. The 
result is obviously tragic. 
  Mr. Secretary General, my people hold you responsible for 
this situation. This [words indistinct] is bleeding, and there 
is not much room for diplomatic hesitation. If Gorazde falls, I 
think that the feeling of moral responsibility would command you 
to leave the post of UN secretary general. This is the least 
you can do for this (?suffering) people whose two years of 
suffering the world has watched with so much indifference.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb 
Parliamentary Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said on Sunday Serbs 
insisted that a Gorazde ceasefire must be part of a general 
ceasefire for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina and must entail the 
lifting of U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). 
  Speaking for the local radio in Kragujevac, Serbia, 
Krajisnik 
said international mediators were insisting on a separate 
solution for the Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, 
but the Serb side would not agree to any partial arrangements 
but only to a general cessation of hostilities in all of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Krajisnik said that Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin and U.N. 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi had informed the Serb side that the 
Moslems wished to open talks on the problem, which was probably 
a serious offer. He added however that similar agreements 
reached in the past had not been honoured. 
  Commenting on the downing of a British NATO plane over 
Gorazde, Krajisnik said: "The Serbs meant to down (NATO) planes 
only if they flew over their territory" which was not the case 
on Saturday, which means that the Serbs had not fired fire at 
the British plane which any investigation would show [sentence 
as received]. 
  The British aircraft fell in Moslem-controlled territory. 
  The Bosnian Serb command said it had intercepted a message 
from the Moslems in Gorazde to the Moslem command in Sarajevo 
saying that they had downed the plane and were holding the pilot 
who had bailed out. 
  The Bosnian Serb command has repeatedly warned that the 
Moslems in Gorazde, frustrated by the imminent defeat of their 
late March offensive on the surrounding Serb territories, might 
go so far as to down NATO planes to provoke a NATO military 
intervention against Bosnian Serbs.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic said on Sunday an immediate ceasefire for the 
Gorazde area had been agreed upon during his talks with U.N. 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi. 
  "We have agreed on the separation of forces as much as 
possible, maximum restraint from actions and provocations and, 
finally, the maximum effort in the humanitarian sphere," said 
Karadzic after talks with Akashi in Pale, the political and 
military centre of the Bosnian Serb republic. 
  He said U.N. helicopters would evacuate the wounded from 
Gorazde on Monday morning and added: "If we succeed in 
implementing the ceasefire and the separation of forces, we can 
say we are approaching peace in Gorazde." 
  Fighting in the Gorazde area escalated in late March, when 
about 10,000 Moslems from Gorazde -- a U.N.-designated "safe 
haven" which should have been demilitarized last spring -- 
mounted a powerful offensive on the surrounding Serb 
territories. The Serbs responded by launching a 
counteroffensive. 
  When the Moslems were all but defeated, the U.N. stepped in 
and ordered NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions 
around Gorazde, after which the Serbs suspended all relations 
with the U.N. Protection Force.

<F P=106> [Mirjana Kusmuk report from Pale] </F>
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Kusmuk] The meeting between the 
political leadership of the Srpska republic on one side, and UN 
Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi Akashi 
and Russian envoy for former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin on the 
other side, ended in Pale today at 1700 [1500 GMT]. After the 
meeting, president of the Srpska republic Radovan Karadzic said: 
  [Karadzic] I wish to say that today's talks were long. 
Considering the crisis that we are gradually overcoming, it is 
not surprising that they were long and difficult, but in any 
case we have made some progress in overcoming the crisis, 
particularly regarding our relations with the United Nations and 
the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. Today we achieved certain 
progress as regards the position of UNPROFOR members on our 
territory. [Words indistinct] that it has still not reached all 
the headquarters, but it will reach them in any case. As far as 
Gorazde is concerned, the situation is much more complex and 
very difficult to resolve. We have agreed to order an immediate 
cease-fire, a certain disengagement of forces in the conflict -- 
as much as it is possible -- maximal restraint regarding 
activities and provocations, and finally, to do the utmost that 
can be done in the humanitarian field. I believe that UN 
helicopters will fly in in the morning to evacuate the wounded 
and killed. If we manage to implement the cease-fire and 
achieve a certain disengagement of forces, then we can say that 
we are drawing closer to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Kusmuk] Addressing the assembled journalists, Akashi said: 
  [Akashi in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] President Karadzic and I agreed that a cease-fire 
around Gorazde should go into effect immediately and that troops 
would be withdrawn from the town as soon as possible. We agreed 
that all sides should maximally restrain themselves from all 
offensive activities. In the meantime we shall review the talks 
and try to sign an agreement as soon as possible in order to 
stabilize the situation. President Karadzic agreed to an urgent 
evacuation of humanitarian personnel and population from 
Gorazde. UNPROFOR is ready to do so tomorrow morning at 0800. 
  [Kusmuk] At around 1730 in the presidency of the Srpska 
republic, informal talks continued between diplomats and the 
political leadership of the republic. [end recording]

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the Srpska republic [RS], said in Pale this evening 
that an agreement on a cease-fire in the Gorazde area with 
immediate effect has been reached, which indicates a possibility 
of "getting closer to peace" in the region. 
  The RS president also said that the crisis in the relations 
between the RS and the United Nations and the UN Protection 
Force [UNPROFOR] has been "overcome to a certain degree". 
  After several hours of talks with special UN envoy Yasushi 
Akashi, Karadzic told journalists that it has been agreed that: 
An immediate cease-fire be ordered in the Gorazde area, as well 
as "certain separation of the forces, as far as this is 
possible," that maximum restraint be displayed in getting 
involved in any activities and provocation, and that everything 
possible be done in the humanitarian field. 
  Karadzic said that UN helicopters will evacuate the wounded 
from Gorazde as early as tomorrow. 
  "If we succeed in achieving a cease-fire and certain 
separation of the forces we can say that we are on our way to 
peace in Gorazde," the RS president said. 
  According to the current agreement the parties in the 
conflict should withdraw from each other of their own accord, 
which should be a proof of goodwill by both sides, and then -- 
when the conditions are ripe to guarantee safety to UNPROFOR 
members -- some arrangement could be made to include UNPROFOR as 
well. 
  The RS president also said that the crisis in the relations 
with UNPROFOR and the United Nations "is being overcome to a 
certain degree." 
  "Some progress has been achieved today as regards the 
position of UN members in our territory. Everything has been 
done to enable their free movement," Karadzic said. 
  He stressed that this order has not yet reached some command 
posts, "but it will in any case reach them." 
  Yasushi Akashi confirmed that a cease-fire agreement with 
immediate effect in the Gorazde area has been reached. 
  "We have also agreed that the forces have to be separated as 
soon as possible and that everyone should refrain from 
provocation and offensive activities. In the meantime we will 
continue with dialogue in order to reach an agreement which 
would lead to a more stabilized situation," Akashi said. 
  He stressed that Karadzic agreed that an evacuation of the 
wounded from Gorazde will take place at 0800 tomorrow. 
  "I suggested to Karadzic that relations with UNPROFOR be 
normalized," Akashi said, adding that UNPROFOR will remain 
impartial and its task will remain to bring the war to an end 
with the help of all sides in the conflict.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- Serb tanks were 
continuing to fire on the Moslem town of Gorazde, a UN "safe 
haven," a ham operator said Sunday, despite the declaration 
earlier of an immediate ceasefire there by Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic. 
  Shells from Serb tanks, which rolled into the town Sunday 
afternoon, were still raining down on the town said the radio 
operator who contacted Sarajevo around 7:45 p.m. (1745 GMT).

<F P=106> [from the "Picture versus Picture" program] </F>
  [Excerpts] Radovan Karadzic appeared on the news bulletin 
of Pale Television late this evening. He already had an answer 
for the continued fighting in Gorazde this evening. He also 
said something interesting about future cooperation between the 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and the so-called Srpska 
republic. 
  [Begin recording] [Karadzic] Unfortunately, we have not 
managed to establish a cease-fire. Every time we stop firing, 
the Muslim side thinks that is due to our weakness, and launches 
a heavy attack which, of course, takes a toll in life. That is 
very bad tactics. 
  For example, we withdrew our artillery and tanks toward 
Ustipraca and Kopaci, 3 km away from the bridge leading to the 
hospital in Gorazde. However, when we withdrew, the Muslims 
again attacked us on that part of our line, trying to take 
advantage of our withdrawal. Consequently, our tanks returned. 
They are being pulled out now, under the condition that the 
Muslim side does not launch any more attacks. Akashi's warning 
applies to them too. [passage omitted] 
  UNPROFOR cannot deploy forces on the territory of the Srpska 
republic, except where the leadership allows them to, along the 
frontlines, as in Sarajevo. This is a decision passed by our 
people's assembly, and only the assembly can change it. 
  [Pale TV announcer] And what if someone comes upon UNPROFOR 
representatives, for example, somewhere on [Mount] Romanija, 
which has nothing to do with the frontline? 
  [Karadzic] They should not be there because, if they cross 
through the Srpska republic -- we gave them permission to move 
freely through our territory, which is now suspended, but we 
will review that decision -- they have to stick to the route 
granted to them. If they leave the agreed route, we will provide 
UNPROFOR with a military escort, and they will not be allowed to 
go off the agreed route. We have now decided that UNCHR and Red 
Cross convoys are not to be escorted by UNPROFOR, but by our 
army. The UNHCR and the Red Cross have accepted that. Foreign 
military forces will therefore have their movement scaled down 
in our territory. If we allow a convoy to pass through, it will 
have to stick to the route. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] Cajnice, 18 Apr (TANJUG) -- The command of the 
Herzegovina Corps [of the Srpska army] announced this morning 
that, following yesterday's cease-fire on the Gorazde 
battlefield, Serb forces stopped advancing toward Gorazde. 
  However, following a brief lull overnight, the Muslims in 
Gorazde started opening sniper and antiaircraft fire on the Serb 
lines, and the fire is being stepped up. 
  The command of the Serb forces issued sharp warnings that if 
the fire does not stop immediately it will respond with all 
available weapons. [passage omitted] 
  After they captured Biserna hill above Gorazde yesterday, 
the 
Herzegovina Corps' fighters liberated the whole of the right 
bank of the River Drina. The last Muslim soldiers fled 
yesterday afternoon across bridges in Gorazde to the left bank. 
  The Serb forces' frontline is currently in the town itself, 
on the right bank of the River Drina. Serb units yesterday 
advanced considerably from the direction of Kopaci, north of 
Gorazde, and reached the town's suburbs. 
  A considerable chunk of territory on the left bank of the 
Drina was also liberated yesterday. The areas of Jelah, 
Konjbaba, and Sjedokosa are now under Serb control. 
  In addition to the central town area, the Muslims control 
the 
area on the left bank of the River Drina, 7 or 8 kms toward Foca.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic] </F>
  [Text] The residents of Gorazde spent the worst night of 
their lives last night, most of them in the streets as there is 
not enough accommodation for all those who barely managed to 
save their lives from the chetnik attack on the town's suburbs 
and the town itself yesterday. The town hospital also lacks 
accommodation. 
  There is an increasing number of wounded. In this chaos no 
one knows their exact number, nor the number of those killed. 
It is only known that there are very many. Owing to the close 
proximity of the chetniks to the city center, those (?killed) 
cannot be evacuated nor buried, nor is it possible to take the 
wounded to hospital. 
  So, Gorazde is dying by itself in the worst possible pain 
before the very eyes of the entire international public. [Words 
indistinct] is a lie that the UN yesterday sent 336 troops, who 
have allegedly stopped the chetniks in their bloody advance 
toward the center of the town. The purpose of that information 
was only to enable the chetniks to gain time to kill, conquer, 
destroy, and torch in peace. Which they did and are still doing 
in the most brutal way. 
  They are hunting down the (?confused) people with snipers 
from the (?nearby) hills. In the general chaos that reigns in 
[word indistinct] streets, the people do not know what to do nor 
(?where to go). The chetniks have been killing these people with 
bombs, snipers, and antiaircraft weapons. They are killing them 
this morning, too. 
  The chetniks are receiving tacit support from the UN for 
these crimes. Because of these crimes, Mr. Akashi is daily 
going to the criminals in Pale to congratulate them on killing 
children, women, and the elderly. At the same time he is saying 
that the conditions were not ripe for air strikes against the 
murders of these civilians. 
  The situation this morning is the same as yesterday, a shade 
worse, because the town is full, brimming with new refugees who 
have come from the town's closest suburbs. The chetniks are 
continuing to strangle Gorazde. Gorazde's streets are being 
fired on by snipers, and with [M-]84's, anti-aircraft machine 
guns, tanks, and even mortars. The encirclement of the city 
center is becoming tighter and tighter. NATO aircraft are still 
overflying the bloody Gorazde skies, not to help the people of 
Gorazde, but to film the last moments of the life of these 
people.

<F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurotovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] The chetniks have launched an even fiercer offensive 
on this town. The chetniks showered Gorazde with hundreds of 
artillery projectiles this morning. The war hospital in the city 
center is also being targeted. Here is the latest report from 
Gorazde: 
  [Kurtovic] According to the information of the East Bosnian 
Operations Group of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the information organs of the Gorazde 
Security Center, the chetniks have launched a fierce offensive 
aimed at taking Gorazde as a whole. The cries of the tens of 
thousands of people moving in the central part of the town, who 
wait for shells and snipers and who give their lives for the 
sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina, are in vain. Between 0800 
and 1100 alone, thousands of shells landed on the war hospital, 
civilian houses, Luke, Bare, [words indistinct]. In these 
suburbs, the situation is such that it is impossible to transfer 
the wounded (?to) the war hospital. The dead in this town are 
no longer counted by anyone because Gorazde has been left to its 
own defenders, its heroes. Gorazde will endure before the eyes 
of all international institutions. To the Security Council -- 
you should be ashamed of yourself for the thousands of 
causalities in this town. What is the purpose of your existence 
as the largest international organization in saving victims. 
  Gentlemen, all appeals from this town have been in vain. 
Only our correspondents are still reporting, warning you again 
about the extremely critical and dramatic situation in Gorazde. 
Gentlemen, help the residents of Gorazde, which is floating in 
blood, which is being drawn in the pain of the hundreds of 
wounded and killed. Help this town while there are still live 
people in it. 
  This is Mustafa Kurtovic reporting for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Radio and Television from the Press Center of the Gorazde 
District.

  [Text] As a result of the extremely difficult and dramatic 
situation in Gorazde, the residents of this town were addressed 
by Rijad Rastic, president of the Gorazde District, and Esad 
Ohranovic, president of the Executive Council. 
  [Begin Rastic recording] I, Rijad Rasic, president of the 
Gorazde District, appeal to all those who live in Gorazde not to 
cause panic through their behavior, that all those capable of 
fighting to report to their nearest unit, to put old people, 
women and children in safe places to avoid shells, and to avoid 
unnecessary walking around. 
  Check all the information that your receive in several 
places. Do not listen to panic and those who do not think well 
of our people. You finally know [words indistinct] let down. 
The courageous defenders are successfully doing everything to 
save the people from the chetniks. Help our defenders as much 
as you can. God is protecting Gorazde. [end recording] 
  [Begin Ohranovic recording] There is only death in Gorazde. 
There is no one to stop this death and horror. Fighting is 
taking place around the hospital itself. In the past hour, 
hundreds of shells have landed on the town. The hospital, the 
International Red Cross, and collective accommodation are all 
being targeted. We demand once again that a stop be put to 
this. I do not know whether I will have the opportunity to 
repeat this appeal. 
  I appeal to the defenders of Gorazde and the residents of 
Gorazde to devote everything to the service of defense. Do not 
fall for rumors and disinformation. The town must be defended. 
Do not forget the dead and wounded. Do not forget your 
co-fighters without arms and legs. It is better to die than be 
taken into the hands of the enemy alive. Do everything possible 
to prevent the enemy from entering the town and carrying out an 
unprecedented slaughter. I know that we can and want do it. 
[end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] The inferno in Gorazde is growing bigger and 
bigger. The chetniks from the nearby hills are firing more and 
more on the city center. After they directly hit the hospital 
crammed with the wounded with howitzers and tanks this morning, 
the chetniks fired at the windows and walls of this medical 
institution with anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft 
guns from Biserna and (?Mare). 
  Dozens of civilians have been killed on the left bank of the 
Drina River, in the very center of the town. The wounded cannot 
be taken to the medical center where they need urgent medical 
treatment, because the bridges in this town are subjected to 
constant and strong sniper fire. 
  NATO aircraft, which overflew this volcanic crater on 
several 
occasions, could see a real hell in Gorazde. Smoke [words 
indistinct] is everywhere. There is smoke from burning village 
houses that were abandoned yesterday and today by their owners, 
who were fleeing in front of the chetniks to save their lives. 
In Gorazde, in the town itself, there is real chaos, a 
confusion in which no one knows what is going on. Confused 
people with tears in their eyes do not believe what is 
happening. They do not understand that they were handed over to 
the chetniks, that they were sold in the name of some, to them, 
unknown and incomprehensible policy. What they do understand is 
that they are a constant, open target for the chetniks in the 
hills, that the chetniks are constantly killing them, that their 
murders are at the gate of Gorazde, and that they are facing a 
bloody party if they enter the town. 
  The defenders of Gorazde are investing superhuman efforts to 
save the lives of the 60,000 people in this town. Nevertheless, 
the situation here is increasingly dramatic. It has become more 
dramatic with the total blockade of movement through the town 
and with the reinforcement of the chetnik forces on all hills 
around the completely surrounded Gorazde. 
  Life is here no longer counted in hours. Every minute of 
life here represents an exceptional gain. Human life here is 
the cheapest commodity in the world. If they do not get killed 
by bombs, these people face a collective death from starvation 
because humanitarian convoys for Gorazde do not exist at all. 
The last convoy with food arrived in this town on 22 March this 
year. 
  This is Enes Musovic reporting from the Press Center of the 
Gorazde District.

<F P=106> [Interview with Srpska foreign minister Aleksa Buha by </F>
unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "The Whole 
World Does Not Care"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] During the weekend, the Serbs had 
their troops advance further toward Gorazde. UN soldiers 
abandoned the city as untenable. Did you take new NATO attacks 
into account? 
  [Buha] We are at a turning point, either toward peace or 
toward a dramatic escalation of this war. I have the impression 
that NATO is, meanwhile, irritated at its spirit of adventure. 
However, should it continue its bombardments, a world war will 
begin. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Serbia against the rest of the world? 
  [Buha] This might develop into an uncontrollable avalanche. 
We are only a ball in the game of the international community. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] However, it was your decision to fire at the 
UN protection zone of Gorazde. 
  [Buha] Gorazde is not a protection zone for us -- the 
inhabitants were neither disarmed nor have the borders of this 
zone been fixed. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] This is not true. Even Russian President 
Boris Yeltsin accused the Serbs of aggression. 
  [Buha] Gorazde has outskirts with a Serbian population. If 
the Muslims attack them, we will, of course, strike back. These 
are counterattacks. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you prohibit UN General Rose and 
foreign journalists from convincing themselves of the situation 
on the spot? 
  [Buha] We only warned General Rose against the danger. 
Foreign journalists have no business there. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your artillery is also shelling the protection 
zone of Tuzla again. 
  [Buha] Only the airport, which, as agreed upon, may only be 
used for humanitarian help. The packets have to be controlled 
by the Russians. None of these conditions was fulfilled; 
therefore, we bombed it. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Do the Serbs want to oust the blue helmets 
from Bosnia? 
  [Buha] If the United Nations orders further bombardments, 
our people will see to it themselves. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you place more than 200 blue helmets 
as hostages under house arrest? 
  [Buha] It is better that we protect them, instead of leaving 
them to the rage of our people. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic has called for 
the withdrawal of Western mediators from the peace talks on 
Bosnia. Who is to take over this task? 
  [Buha] If the international community withdraws Lord Owen 
and Stoltenberg, we will determine our new, impartial mediators 
-- Russians, Japanese, Chinese, Indians, and -- you will be 
surprised -- Germans. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] I beg your pardon? Which Germans are you 
thinking of? 
  [Buha] Peter Glotz, Hans Modrow, Graf Lambsdorff, retired 
General Schmueckle. I hope very much for an improvement of the 
relations between Germans and Serbs. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Your only hope is currently based on the 
Russians. Did Yeltsin's special envoy Churkin encourage you to 
continue your fight for the independent Serbian state during his 
mediation last week? 
  [Buha] No, just like the whole world, the Russians do not 
care about the price that we have to pay. They only want peace 
quickly. I also do not believe that Yeltsin would risk a war for 
a greater Serbia. However, since the Muslims and Croats were 
able to conclude a federation without us, we have the same right 
to a Serbian state and its international recognition. The 
inclusion of the Srpska republic in Bosnia in this 
Muslim-Croatian federation is completely out of the question.

  [Excerpt] In the organization of the Ministry for 
Information, a Sarajevo-Gorazde radio bridge was established 
today for domestic and foreign reporters. Mediha Colo has 
compiled a report based on the information collected this way. 
  [Colo] The reporters were acquainted with the situation in 
Gorazde this afternoon by Esad Ohranovic, chairman of the 
Gorazde assembly: 
  [Ohranovic] Gorazde is going through the worst day since the 
offensive started. The town is disappearing from the face of 
the earth. I have no words to describe what is happening here 
today. It is impossible to reach the killed and the wounded, so 
we are unable to give the exact number. The Gorazde citizens 
that are still alive are wondering whether they have been 
condemned to death by the international community. One of the 
facts that speak to that effect is that General Rose's monitors 
have fled Gorazde without our knowledge. I believe that this 
fact confirms the full ruthlessness of the international 
community. 
  [Colo] The foreign reporters insisted on speaking with one 
of the representatives of the international institutions that 
have remained in Gorazde, but Esad Ohranovic said: 
  [Ohranovic] They do not want to speak to reporters or the 
international community. They told us that they were forbidden 
to do so. 
  [Colo] One of the reporters' questions referred to today's 
situation in the Gorazde war hospital. 
  [Ohranovic] The hospital is being shelled at the moment from 
three directions, so one cannot really count the number of 
shells landing on the hospital. All the surrounding buildings, 
residential areas are on fire. This must be the worst day from 
the beginning of the offensive. One can no longer count the 
number of shells landing. 
  [Colo] The tanks are in the town, Mr. Ohranovic said. Asked 
how many there were, he said: 
  [Ohranovic] It is hard to say, but there are somewhere 
between 20 to 40 tanks, it depends on the shelling of the town. 
  [Colo] How far away are they from the center? 
  [Ohranovic] Depends, from 500 to 600 meters. 
  [Colo] We know you have been unable to tell us so far, but 
can you say now where the front line is? 
  [Ohranovic] It is in the town itself. From the direction of 
Ustipraca, that is some 100 meters from the petrol station, and 
[words indistinct] from the hospital, and on the right side -- 
you probably know Gorazde -- in the direction of Cajnice, that 
is around the bus station. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Anchor-man Henri Masure] Lieutenant-Colonel Pernod, 
UNPROFOR spokesman is live with us from Sarajevo. Good evening. 
  [Pernod] Good evening. 
  [Masure] Correspondent Francois Cornet repeated a moment ago 
that there are 336 UN soldiers belonging to the intervention 
force who are now ready to go to Gorazde. Why are they not 
going there? 
  [Pernod] Actually, I believe that things are quite simple. 
We do have a detachment from the Sarajevo sector which is to go 
to Gorazde. We are awaiting the order for their departure. 
This order will come only when the negotiations under way are 
over, and I believe that, for the moment, we are ready and 
waiting. Negotiations are under way and I believe that it will 
add to the confusion if I gave information that may not be 
accurate. 
  [Masure] Are 336 men sufficient when we know how strong the 
forces in Gorazde are? There is talk of 7,000 Serb fighters. 
  [Pernod] Listen, anyway, this detachment has been put 
together. We decided that it was amply sufficient to carry out 
the mission that was set at the beginning. It was created to 
carry out a mission of intervention and, for the time being, the 
command has decided that it was enough, given the elements we 
have. 
  [Masure] You are in Sarajevo yourself. UN soldiers have been 
the victims of a whole series of provocations on the part of the 
Serbs recently. Several dozen of them were held, if I may put 
it this way. Is there any sign of detente this evening in your 
difficult relations with the Bosnian Serbs? 
  [Pernod] If you like, tension has indeed stepped up 
dramatically since the air strikes last Sunday and Monday. As 
you know -- and it has been said -- some places where weapons 
are being kept were closed. Our traffic was subjected to major 
hindrances. I can tell you, for example, that this tension has 
decreased dramatically today. For instance, the various points 
for the collection of weapons were resupplied with vehicles by 
road today. As you can see, things are much less tense. I think 
that the situation is less tense because, on the one hand, we 
did not respond to the provocations made on the Serb side, and 
this is mainly thanks to the professional approach and the 
sang-froid of the people on the ground who are behaving in an 
exemplary manner. 
  [Masure] Thank you very much, Lieutenant Colonel Pernod, 
speaking live to us from Sarajevo.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 15 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
have withdrawn from all weapons collection points which they had 
surrounded in the heavy arms exclusion zone around Sarajevo, a 
UN Protection Force spokesman said Friday [15 April]. 
  But UN troops had still not been allowed to go free, 
UNPROFOR's Captain Eric Chaperon said, adding that there was 
still no news of Canadian and French UN troops still being held. 
  Chaperon said tension had lowered in the area, where Bosnian 
Serb forces have harassed UN forces in recent days since NATO 
air strikes against the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  On Thursday the Serb forces tried to seize heavy weapons 
grouped under UNPROFOR control following a February 9 ultimatum 
for them to withdraw from the exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
  Chaperon said Friday that reports indicated there was a 
"relaxed atmosphere" at weapons collection sites after the 
Bosnian Serb withdrawal. He said UN forces were no longer on 
full alert. 
  The Bosnian Serbs, angry at the NATO strikes on Gorazde, had 
been threatening a French battalion at Krivoglavci, to the 
northwest of the Bosnian capital, with a tank. 
  The report came as UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi and 
mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg held face-to-face talks with 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic at his Pale headquarters. 
  The talks, the first since the crisis sparked by the Gorazde 
strikes, were reportedly aimed at discussing a cease-fire.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 15 April carries within 
its regular 42-minute newscast several reports on the combat 
situation in the republic. 
  Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "the 
encirclement around Gorazde is becoming increasingly tighter and 
stronger. Gorazde is literally drowning its own blood, 
suffering, and pain. Crushing everything before them, the 
chetniks are mercilessly advancing on the town. The situation 
in the town is so bad that it cannot get worse. A river of 
surviving refugees from the surrounding villages this morning 
continued to flow into the almost destroyed and overcrowded 
Gorazde." 
  Musovic also says that the "chetniks are at the very gates 
of 
the town. On their way to the town so far, in only 18 days of 
this unprecedented offensive they have killed 208 and wounded 
840 residents of Gorazde. The survivors of Gorazde are warning 
U.S. President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali to take new energetic measures and urgently stop 
the chetnik hordes, which are at the very gates of Gorazde, at 
the last minute. If they do not take urgent measures, it will 
be too late for the residents of this town." 
  According to Brcko correspondents Hamiz Deronjic and Nijaz 
Salihovic, "on the fifth consecutive day of their attacks, the 
enemy is using all available weapons: snipers, machine guns, and 
122-mm and 155-mm howitzers. The aggressor has fired hundreds 
of artillery and tank shells at the positions of the 108th 
Motorized and the 108th Infantry Brcko Brigades. Vranovaca and 
the central part of Odora are being subjected to particularly 
heavy shelling. The situation in Boderiste is the worst. The 
aggressor has been carrying out combined artillery, tank, and 
infantry attacks there since about 0700." 
  Reporting that the army had not suffered any casualties, the 
correspondents report that "at 0850 this morning, the Malutka 
operators of the legendary 108th Motorized Brigade destroyed a 
chetnik tank at [words indistinct], in front of the positions of 
the 108th Infantry Brigade. This is the third tank that the 
aggressor has lost, together with its crew, on the Brcko front 
in the last 24 hours." 
  According to Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic, 
"Karadzic's 
terrorists have not stopped attacking Buzim and the surrounding 
area today. They are shelling civilian houses and the 
defenders. The chetniks have been attacking them since 9 April. 
This (?region) has also been attacked from the other side, from 
behind, by Abdic's betraying falangists, who are fiercely 
attacking Todorovo, [word indistinct], Pecingrad, Krivaja, and 
Liskovac." 
  From Sarajevo a correspondent reports that the "chetniks 
today continued their attacks with small arms in the Sarajevo 
area, which began last night. Provocations took place in 
several locations, where the defense lines of the town came 
under attack. Shots were fired at the very center, Marijin 
Dvor, where an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] vehicle was 
parked, from direction of Sljivik. This resulted in the wounding 
of two civilians at about noon. The passage of the street cars 
was blocked, too." 
  The correspondent concludes his report by saying that the 
"chetniks are preparing to renew artillery attacks on the town. 
They have been seen bringing up heavy weapons, ammunition, and 
troops to almost all the artillery positions around Sarajevo for 
hours. The observers and UNPROFOR appear to be powerless to 
stop this behavior by the aggressor and we therefore warn the 
citizens to take the warnings seriously about precautionary 
measures and self-protection." 
  Gracanica correspondent Ezudin Durakovic reports that the 
"chetniks have been using all their artillery since early this 
morning to attack mainly civilian targets in Lukavica, Malesici, 
Rijeka, and Miricina from the well-known chetnik strongholds of 
Paleznica, (Besanj), Sjemina, Kojica, and Porecina. The enemy 
fired over 200 shells of various calibers within a very short 
period of time. One woman and one child were killed. Six 
others were wounded and the material damage is substantial."

  [Excerpt] An off-duty British soldier serving with the 
United Nations has been shot dead in Sarajevo, the UN said today. 
  A spokesman for the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in the 
Bosnian capital told Reuters the man, who was believed to be in 
civilian clothing, was killed at a checkpoint manned by the 
mainly Muslim Bosnian government army. 
  The incident, which happened early today, is being 
investigated by UNPROFOR and the Bosnian military police. A 
Ministry of Defence spokesman said they were seeking further 
details. 
  According to a BBC report, Bosnian forces manning the 
checkpoint opened fire after the soldier failed to stop. He 
reportedly started to run and was hit in the head. 
  He is the fourth British soldier to die while serving with 
the UN in Bosnia. A British Sea Harrier pilot ejected safely 
after Serb forces shot down the helicopter over the besieged 
town of Gorazde yesterday, and a British SAS man acting as a 
forward observer in the town for UN aircraft was killed and a 
second injured on Friday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- British UN forces 
launched mortars against Bosnian Serb positions for the first 
time Sunday, a UN spokesman said here, hours after a British 
officer was shot dead in Sarajevo in what was believed to be an 
accident. 
  The British troops fired four mortars from a Warrior tank 
and 
three flares after coming under attack at around 4:50 a.m. (0250 
GMT) Sunday, said United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
spokesman Major Rob Annink. 
  The UN peacekeepers' position near Kobilja Glava, around 10 
kilometres (six miles) northwest of the Bosnian capital, was 
targeted by Bosnian Serb machinegun fire and four grenades, 
Annink said. 
  The UN troops had been "very, very vulnerable," caught in a 
"position lower than the position from where they were 
attacked," and hence had fired back, Annink said. 
  The resulting exchange was "very heavy," he said, but added 
that no casualties were reported. 
  Earlier Sunday UNPROFOR reported that a British UN officer 
died of a gunshot to the head late Saturday night while walking 
through Sarajevo in civilian clothes. 
  He was killed after the city's 10:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) curfew 
came into effect as local police checked his identity while he 
was leaving a Sarajevo cafe, UNPROFOR officials said. 
  They identified the officer's body at the city's Kosevo 
hospital. 
  The officials said they believed the death of the officer 
was 
accidental.

  [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim units carried 
out a military operation today, capturing the summit of Mount 
Bjelasnica and the TV relay facility on the summit, the 
information service of the Srpska republic army's main 
headquarters said this evening. 
  ``As we have already informed the public, UN Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] units which were deployed on Mount Igman and 
Mount Bjelasnica have been withdrawing to Hrasnica and Sarajevo 
airport over the last few days, thus violating the cease-fire 
agreement and leaving the area they controlled to Muslim forces, 
the statement says. It adds that some UNPROFOR troops stayed on 
to control certain positions, including the summit of Mount 
Bjelasnica and its TV relay facility. 
  "However, the Muslim forces today carried out a military 
operation and captured the summit of Mount Bjelasnica and the TV 
relay," the statement of the main headquarters of the Srpska 
republic army says. Thus, the area handed over by the Srpska 
republic army to UNPROFOR under the terms of the cease-fire 
agreement has been seized by members of the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina army. This creates conditions for offensive 
operations toward Trnovo and Rogoj, as well as major offensive 
operations to split and capture the Serb-held parts of Sarajevo. 
It is certain that the Muslims and UNPROFOR have used deceit to 
violate the terms of the peace agreement. 
  "Nothing can be said with certainty about the fate of 
UNPROFOR members who stayed on at the summit of Mount Bjelasnica 
until the violent act committed by the Muslims," the statement 
issued by the information service of the main headquarters of 
the Srpska republic army says in conclusion.

  [Text] Zvornik, Bratunac, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim 
military engineers have continued work in the Sarajevo area, 
especially in Sokolje and Mojmilo, in order to get close to the 
Serb defense lines, Srpska republic army [VRS] sources have told 
a TANJUG correspondent. 
  Serb military sources are saying that the pull-out of Muslim 
units and military equipment from Sarajevo has continued via a 
tunnel underneath Sarajevo airport and on board lorries across 
the runway, before the very eyes of UN peacekeepers. 
  The Serb military sources are also saying that, once out of 
Sarajevo, Muslim units are setting off in the direction of 
Hrasnica and Mount Igman in an attempt to link up in force with 
the area around Gorazde. The VRS are foiling all these 
attempts, while Muslim soldiers, who surrendered to the Serb 
side upon leaving Sarajevo, are talking about an "extremely low 
morale among Muslim formations" which are heading toward 
Gorazde, because "a vast majority do not want to take part in 
these senseless actions," the VRS sources explain.

  [Text] The chetniks have continued to violate the 
cease-fire in the Sarajevo region throughout the night and this 
morning. Last night, one shell landed on Dobrinja, one 80-mm 
mortar shell on the (?airport), and five mortar shells on Vis. 
In addition to the usual provocations with small arms and hand 
grenades, the chetniks also carried out a subversive action last 
night, but without much success. One chetnik was (?killed).

  [Text] Zagreb, April 17 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR], struggling to contain Serb-Moslem 
fighting in eastern Bosnia, must now choose either to pull out 
of the former Yugoslav republic or to press for more troops and 
a redefined mandate, a UN spokesman said here Saturday [16 
April]. 
  Michael Williams was speaking to reporters as UN special 
envoy Yasushi Akashi dislcosed in a statement in Sarajevo that 
UN officials had begun an "urgent review" of UNPROFOR operations 
in light of the deteriorating situation in Gorazde. 
  The mainly Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia is a UN-declared 
safe haven but is currently under siege by Bosnian Serb forces. 
  "The Gorazde crisis has brought us to an impasse," Williams 
said. 
  He argued that UNPROFOR had three options before it: "a 
pullout from Bosnia, a completely new role and mandate with far 
greater resources in terms of troops, ... or total compliance 
by Bosnian Serb authorities (with UN orders)." 
  Williams stressed that UNPROFOR's operation had been 
rendered 
"completely inadequate" because of a refusal by Bosnian Serbs to 
cooperate and stressed that UN troops have not been assigned an 
offensive military role. 
  He explained that Akashi is only entitled to authorize the 
limited use of close air support by one or two NATO planes on a 
precise target -- as was the case Saturday when British aircraft 
were ordered to attack a Serb tank in Gorazde. 
  In the event, no strikes took place because of bad weather 
and one of the planes was shot down, its pilot ejecting safely. 
  Williams said Akashi cannot order a general air operation on 
an entire zone, as such authorization must come from UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  There are currently 17 UN military and civilian personnel in 
Gorazde, the UN spokesman said. 
  UNPROFOR strength in all of former Yugoslavia today stands 
at 
30,000 troops, most of whom are serving in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and Croatia. 
  The UN Security Council on March 31 approved an increase of 
3,500 soldiers for UNPROFOR after the United States objected to 
plans to boost force strength by 10,000 men.

<F P=106> [Report by Ahmet Begicevic for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and </F>
Television from Travnik] 
  [Text] A general alert was sounded in Travnik this evening 
because the aggressor fired several tank shells at the town from 
the foothills of Mount Vlasic. 
  A child was wounded by shrapnel and, at the same time, an 
artillery attack was launched on the first defense lines in 
Turbe, a Muslim-held town west of Travnik. 
  At dusk the inhabitants of Travnik witnessed how NATO 
aircraft chased after a Serb plane that had suddenly appeared in 
our country's airspace, flying at a low altitude. According to 
eye-witness accounts, it is most likely that this was a MiG-21 
plane which acrobatically fled toward Banja Luka in panic after 
the NATO planes appeared. Due to low clouds we are not able to 
inform you about the epilogue of this close air encounter, but 
we can say that the (?NATO) air force was active above central 
Bosnia for almost one hour, which is an unusually long period 
and is a sign that something indeed took place in the sky.

  [Text] Brussels, April 15 (AFP) -- Large-scale military 
action by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina seems unlikely unless there is another 
massive Serb atrocity there, a NATO source said here Friday [15 
April]. 
  He was reacting to a series of Serb provocations against the 
UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia since U.S. warplanes 
launched two small attacks on Serb positions outside the Moslem 
enclave of Gorazde last Sunday [10 April] and Monday [11 April]. 
  The public Western response to the Serb provocations has 
been 
low-key, with diplomatic pressure taking precedence over 
military threats. 
  The NATO source said: "I think there is a mood of caution 
and 
hesitancy.... My hope is that there will be a cooling-off 
period.... We on our part are not going to be doing anything to 
escalate the situation." 
  Insisting on being identified only as a NATO source, he 
discounted any quick repetition of a February ultimatum by the 
U.S.-led alliance that Serb artillery around Sarajevo would be 
bombed unless it was withdrawn. 
  The source said such action was unlikely unless there was 
some atrocity which triggered a "welling up of emotion" on the 
scale of the shell which landed on a Sarajevo market-place in 
February and killed 66 people. 
  The atrocity motivated the ultimatum, which is credited with 
forcing the Serbs to relax their artillery siege of Sarajevo, 
and giving impetus to a new U.S.-Russian thrust towards a peace 
settlement in Bosnia which has since stalled. 
  Any more such ultimatums, or attacks beyond surgical strikes 
to protect UN peacekeepers, would need fresh authority from the 
UN Security Council and NATO. 
  Within the UN, Russia is hostile to such an escalation, as 
is 
Greece within NATO. Both countries have traditional links with 
Serbia. 
  The Russian Foreign Ministry criticised this week's U.S. air 
attacks outside Gorazde, saying that they had "considerably 
worsened" the chances for peace and objecting that Moscow had 
not been consulted first. 
  Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said in Moscow Friday 
that he was against Russia signing up to NATO's "Partnership for 
Peace" programme of military cooperation with the former 
communist bloc. 
  NATO had hoped that Moscow would join the partnership this 
month, becoming the 15th country to do so since January. 
  Grachev said "we had the impression that our partners are 
acting behind our back" -- a clear expression of anger at the 
U.S. air attacks. 
  Since February, NATO threats in Bosnia have been restricted 
to warnings that Serb forces threatening the safety of UN 
personnel would be bombed. 
  The U.S. air attacks on Sunday and Monday, the first 
fulfilment of the threat, aimed officially at stopping Serb 
shelling of Gorazde, a UN-protected "safe area," because it 
placed eight UN peacekeepers there in danger. 
  They hit a small command post and four vehicles. The Bosnian 
Serbs said two male nurses had been killed. 
  In response, the Bosnian Serbs swooped on scores of UN 
peacekeepers around Bosnia, keeping them immobile and virtual 
hostages, shooting at some and abducting others. 
  They stepped up the shelling of Gorazde, fired on other 
Moslem areas including the UN-controlled airport at Tuzla, and 
tried to seize two UN-guarded weapons stockpiles at Sarajevo. 
The western response was low-key. 
  But at a meeting of NATO ambassadors here Wednesday, "there 
wasn't a hint" of a Sarajevo-type ultimatum or military action 
beyond carefully-targeted air strikes if UN lives were in 
danger, the NATO source said. 
  He added that the United Nations was relying on a Russian-UN 
diplomatic mission rather than public military threats to defuse 
the crisis. 
  Special Russian envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin, UN 
envoy Yasushi Akashi and UN negotiator Thorvald Stoltenberg were 
meeting together with the Bosnian Serbs on Friday.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Muhamed Secirbegovic, </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina's permanent representative at the United 
Nations, by Reha Atasagun in New York; date not given -- 
recorded, in English with superimposed translation into Turkish] 
  [Text] [Atasagun] Mr. Ambassador, what are the latest 
reports reaching you from Gorazde? 
  [Secirbegovic] The Serbs continue to attack. In the evening 
hours, the situation became more quieter. I believe that the 
Serbs will try to occupy the entire city at dawn. No progress 
has been made in the talks. Every promise the Serbs make will 
be to prevent or at least delay a Western air operation. 
  [Atasagun] Following conflicting reports about an air 
operation, it was understood that the NATO planes did not carry 
out an air strike. Do you think that the United Nations and 
NATO are unwilling to carry out an air strike? 
  [Secirbegovic] There definitely is a reluctance. We learned 
that the UN force asked for air support. NATO did not supply 
it. We were told that weather conditions were unsuitable. 
However, I know that there is reluctance. This stand is the 
result of the extremely nationalistic attitude the Russians have 
recently adopted. I really do not understand the stand of NATO 
and of the Western forces. First, they were defeated by Bosnian 
Serbs and the fascist forces in the Balkans. They were placed 
in an embarrassing situation. 
  [Atasagun -- to viewers] Ambassador Secirbegovic believes 
that an intensive NATO air attack might force the Serbs to 
withdraw. Otherwise, thousands will die and the United Nations 
will entirely lose its credibility. If Gorazde falls, the 
United Nations will not have any role to play in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Then, the Serbs will be able to constantly 
threaten NATO and the United Nations. The ambassador also 
stresses that even if positive steps are taken toward lifting 
the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is too late for 
Gorazde. 
  [Secirbegovic] The Westerners who promised to defend us told 
us that we do not need weapons. Now we are waiting to be 
massacred like a herd of sheep. The UN Security Council must 
convene and ensure that either of these two steps are taken: 
Either the Western countries and NATO will fulfill their 
promises and defend the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina, or the 
Muslims will regain their right to have weapons in order to 
defend themselves and to prevent the recurrence of similar 
developments.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 15 Apr (TANJUG) -- The supreme command of 
the armed forces of the Srpska republic met today in Pale, 
chaired by the supreme commander, Radovan Karadzic. 
  The participants reviewed the current military and political 
situation following the deployment of NATO aircraft on combat 
actions on the side of the Muslims. 
  It was noted that, by resorting to the use of air power and 
other means, certain circles in the West, the United States in 
particular, wish to goad the Srpska republic into concluding 
local and regional agreements and making other concessions. 
This particularly applies to the sectors of the front where the 
Muslims are in an unfavorable military situation and is geared 
toward encouraging the Muslims and creating conditions for 
attaining military and territorial objectives, a statement from 
the office of the president of the Srpska republic says. 
  The supreme command concludes that conditions are not yet 
ripe for the normalization of relations with UNPROFOR's [UN 
Protection Forces] military sector, but that the president of 
the Srpska republic may, if need be, and if he personally deems 
it necessary, maintain contact with UNPROFOR's civilian 
department with the aim of examining possibilities for extending 
the peace process, the statement reads.

    [Editorial Report] Zagreb HTV Television in Serbo-Croatian 
at 2200 GMT on 16 April carries what is identified as a 
rebroadcast of a recorded report from the Bosnian Serb Pale 
Television in Serbo-Croatian on Bosnian Serb Commander General 
Ratko Mladic visiting the Gorazde front. The time and date of 
the original report is not given. 
  Mladic is seen showing a corpse of a Bosnian government 
soldier and scattered uniforms. He says that "a number of 
Alija's soldiers have been killed in this area. They are all 
dressed in American uniforms. We invited them to collect their 
dead but they did not come. Let us go on." 
  Mladic is shown chatting with his soldiers, and the camera 
shows more close-ups of U.S. uniforms. Mladic passes by a 
crater, and pointing to it says, "That is U.S. democracy and 
they want to impose it on the entire world." 
  An unidentified correspondent says, "what you said on many 
occasions before was confirmed today. Traces of U.S. supplies 
to the Muslim army have been found in this area." 
  Mladic answers: "That is nothing new, as you can see all of 
the equipment from parachutes to soldiers' boots is American or 
belonging to the states of the NATO alliance. This confirms that 
NATO has been waging war against us for two and a half years, I 
would say a bit more, because NATO has trained in its countries 
those who attacked Yugoslavia and the Serb nation." 
  The correspondent says that according to some reports, the 
bodies of British Special Air Service, SAS, members who fought 
together with the Muslims are in this area. 
  Mladic says, "Well, I think that we will pass down by the 
village of Jabuka; I can already see our soldiers there. 
Yesterday our soldiers observed a clash there between members 
of that special SAS unit [pauses], their group was probably 
encircled by the Muslims who wanted to take them hostage. As 
far as we know two of them were wounded and two were killed 
there." 
  The correspondent then says that the reports about the 
downing of the French plane are conflicting. Mladic responds, 
saying, "It is a pity you were not here yesterday with your 
cameras to record it. I think we recorded it with our cameras. 
In their despair, trying to provoke an international reaction 
and to get NATO to protect them, the Muslims fired Stinger 
missiles, which were dropped to them earlier with these 
parachutes, targeting NATO aircraft. NATO has had more losses 
than it has admitted."

  [Text] Sarajevo, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- In the northeast 
section of the Sarajevo theater of war this morning, Muslim 
forces attacked Serb positions near the Pretis industrial site 
in Vogosca and the suburbs of Brioni and Ugljesic, Serb military 
sources report. 
  According to the same sources, some 50 antitank shells were 
fired and dozens of hand grenades were hurled. 
  The conflict culminated when UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
troops, stationed at Glavica and Sabanove Kuce, joined the 
Muslim forces, the Serb military forces claim. They say that 
the UNPROFOR and government troops were targeting the Serb 
positions with antiaircraft guns and incendiary ammunition. A 
trench in the central section of the Serb positions in Ugljesic 
was destroyed. 
  The Serb fighters returned fire in retaliation for these 
joint operations, so a lull followed 20 minutes later. 
  The Serbian military forces also report that there were no 
dead or wounded on the Serb side and that the front lines remain 
unchanged.

  [Text] Samac, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- The main headquarters of 
the Srpska republic's army [VRS] and the supreme command of the 
VRS are attaching particular emphasis to the defense of Serb 
Posavina [Serb-held northern corridor along the Sava river] 
following Croat and Muslim threats announcing an all-out 
offensive against this strategically important area, Manojlo 
Milovanovic, the commander of VRS main headquarters, said today. 
  We have decided to concentrate our forces and defend the 
part 
of the Srpska republic between Brcko and Doboj, General 
Milovanovic said. Accompanied by Major General Novica Simic he 
was attending a celebration of the second anniversary of the 
liberation of Samac. 
  After the Washington agreement and the establishment of a 
truce at the border with the republic of Serb Krajina, the 
Croatian Army deployed strong forces between Brod and Brcko, 
Milovanovic said. The Muslim army is also bringing fresh units 
to the front line between Gracanica and Brcko, with an objective 
of breaking through the Serb defense and gaining access to the 
Sava river, which we will not allow at any cost. 
  According to Milovanovic, last night the Croatian forces 
opened heavy fire from their strongholds of Orasje and Zupanja 
on the Serb positions and villages between Samac and Brcko. 
  We are now warning them that we will respond to any future 
attacks with full force against military targets in the Republic 
of Croatia, Milovanovic stressed.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Zvornik, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Moslems are continuing 
their days-old all-out offensive on Bosnian Serb territories, 
but its imminent collapse is a foregone conclusion, as it has 
been checked on many sectors, TANJUG learns from Bosnian Serb 
Army circles on Sunday. 
  Bosnian Serb Army sources estimate that the Moslem 
leadership 
is endeavouring, wherever possible, to provoke the Serb Army's 
reaction to its attacks, in order to heighten tensions and press 
on with the media demonisation of the Serbs. 
  The Moslems are trying, with the help of the foreign 
propaganda machine, to blame their actions against U.N. 
peacekeepers and NATO on the Serbs and provoke an anti-Serb 
reaction from the international public which should eventually 
lead to further air strikes against the Bosnian Serb Republic. 
  This is why a British NATO plane was downed over the eastern 
Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde on Saturday and this is why 
the plane carrying U.N. Commander for Former Yugoslavia General 
Bertrand de Lapresle came under fire from Moslem positions in 
Sarajevo, Serb Army sources say. 
  They explain that Moslem attacks and provocations intensify 
on most fronts when NATO planes are buzzing overhead, with 
small-arms, mortars and anti-aircraft guns in full play. 
  The Bosnian Serb Army is refraining as much as possible from 
reacting, but makes it clear that whoever should attack the 
Bosnian Serb Republic would be treated as an enemy. 
  Serb Army circles expect the imminent crushing of the Moslem 
offensive to be followed by a regrouping of the Moslem forces 
and fresh attacks on some other fronts. 
  The circles indicate it is high time the Moslem side 
accepted 
the offer of the Bosnian Serb military and political leadership 
for establishing a lasting and total cessation of hostilities 
throughout the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and turning to 
the peace process and a quest for political solutions.

<F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Miljenko Karakic, including </F>
recorded comments by Ivan Bender, president of Herceg-Bosna's 
chamber of deputies, Herceg-Bosna defense minister Vladimir 
Soljic, and Colonel General Ante Rose, Bosnian Croat Army 
commander] 
  [Excerpts] [Karakic] The Serb army shelled several 
residential buildings in Usora last night. Several civilians 
were wounded and fresh material damage was caused. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Karakic] [video shows damaged houses and Croat soldiers 
with 
weapons] All this shows that the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
not over. Senior officials of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna stressed this today at a ceremony of oath-taking by 
the First Guards' Brigade of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] 
in Capljina, southern Bosnia. 
  [Bender] Since you know very well what is going on in 
Gorazde, in Posavina in northern Bosnia, and our Usora, we must 
keep that in mind at all times. You are the people who will 
stand with us on the bulwark of our homeland, and we must always 
think of those who have given all they had, who have given their 
lives. 
  [Soljic] We will fight for the Croats to have the right to 
decide for themselves on their future. If we create a joint 
army, that army will be formed so that one nation can never use 
it against the other, as it happened with the so-called Yugoslav 
People's Army. There is a lot of talk about the end of the war 
and demobilization. Unfortunately, an end to the war is not in 
sight yet, and therefore, we cannot speak about a large-scale 
demobilization. We will use the cease-fire to consolidate (?our 
forces) and divide the burden of the war more equally. 
  [Roso] You have heard enough wise words and phrases. There 
is one eternal truth: The war will never be over for us. I will 
repeat it once again if someone does not understand Croatian 
well: The war is not over. This much about the future. 
  Personally, I congratulate you today. I will place one thing 
upon your conscience. Bow only before the memory of this oath 
and before our dead. Do not entrust Croat weapons into anyone's 
hands. Thank you very much. 
  [Karakic] The oath-taking ceremony in Capljina was attended 
by many guests from the military and political ranks of 
Herzeg-Bosna, and by relatives of the Croat patriot Ante Bruno 
Busic after whom the HVO's First Guards' Brigade has been named.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 16 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
released Saturday [16 April] an American journalist working for 
a British newspaper, after detaining him for 24 hours as he 
tried to comply with an order to leave Serb-held sectors of the 
war-torn ex-Yugoslav republic. 
  Michael Montgomery, who works for the London-based DAILY 
TELEGRAPH, was stopped by Serb forces at Zvornik, in eastern 
Bosnia, as he attempted leave Bosnia. 
  The Serbs have banned all American journalists or those 
working for U.S. networks and publications from reporting in 
Serb-controlled regions of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  "I was on my way out of the (self-declared Bosnian) Serb 
republic following the Bosnian Serb authorities' decision to 
expel all American journalists from their territories," he told 
AFP after his release. 
  "I was arrested at Zvornik along with a woman who works at 
the (Bosnian Serb) information ministry. At first I was kept in 
a military barracks and interogated for half an hour by an 
officer who did not give his name," Montgomery said. 
  "He explained that I was to be held. They offered me the 
choice between staying in the barracks or transfering to a 
hotel, which I accepted," he added. 
  "I was not mistreated," he added. 
  Montgomery was kept under armed guard at the hotel until his 
release around midday (1000 GMT). 
  Meanwhile French newspaper LE MONDE became the latest victim 
of the Yugoslav authorities' action against Belgrade-based 
foreign correspondents since Wednesday, the daily's managers 
said in Paris Saturday. 
  LE MONDE'S Belgrade correspondent Florence Hartmann, 
currently reporting in Sarajevo, was stripped of her 
accreditation by Yugoslav authorities on Friday.

  [Text] Three persons have been killed and 10 injured in 
Serb attacks on Brcko. Over 3,000 shells have landed on the 
defense positions of the Brcko municipality, the political 
department of the 108th Croat Defense Council [HVO] Infantry 
Brigade has reported. The Serbs have been using howitzers, 
tanks, multiple rocket-launchers, and mortars, while a number of 
commando groups have attempted to break through. These attempts 
have been successfully foiled. 
  An HVO advance party has reported that the Serb formations 
are again concentrating in several locations, while intelligence 
officers have said that a group of the so-called Bijeljina 
Panthers, a criminal formation that has taken part in some dozen 
massacres in northeast Bosnia, has arrived in Brcko.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>
  [Text] Karadzic's fascists have been attacking the Bihac 
region since last night. The strongest attacks were again 
launched on Buzim and the surrounding area. They are being 
subjected to constant artillery and tank fire. The chetniks 
intermittently shelled the suburbs of Cazin. They also shelled 
indiscriminately the positions of the defenders of the 
Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau and Grabez, as well as the free 
territory of Bosanska Krupa and the defenders' positions. 
  Last night, the chetniks attacked the positions of the 
fighters in the zone of operations of the General Staff of the 
Croatian Defense Council in this region, especially the 
Pljesevica part of the front. 
  The paramilitary formations of the Kladusa traitors, in 
collaboration with the chetniks from the so-called Serbian 
autonomous region of Krajina, continued to pursue their shameful 
aims last night. They launched attacks from the regions of 
Todorovo, Trzac, Liskovac, and Krivaja. They also carried out 
the strongest attacks on Buzim last night. In addition to 
Todorovo, they shelled Varoska Rijeka and other places. 
  The engineering works were stepped up on all lines in the 
so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina yesterday. The 
chetniks are rapidly bringing heavy arms and are grouping new 
forces. 
  An appeal was again sent from the Bihac region to the 
international community, the state Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to urgently deploy UN forces on the border 
between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia to prevent new attacks 
and aggression from the territory of another state on this UN 
protected zone. 
  This is Mirza Sadikovic reporting for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Radio and Television.

<F P=106> [Article by Lj.S.: "Needles Drill Phantoms"] </F>
  [Text] The latest series of NATO air strikes (by F-16 and 
F-18 aircraft) against Serbian positions around Gorazde was 
probably yet another practical test of the potential of the 
newest generation of U.S. Air Force equipment. 
  According to available data, U.S. fighter bombers carried 
out 
selective strikes against Serbian positions using modern laser 
guided bombs. Their activity, accompanied by casualties, was 
this time carried out under almost test conditions, like on a 
test range since the army of the Srpska republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina air defense did not respond. It did not try 
to prevent the two NATO air strikes. 
<H5>  Two Sorts of Markers </H5>
  As long as the military strategists of the Srpska republic 
of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina do not assess that an open conflict with the 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and NATO is inevitable, no other 
Serbian reaction can be expected. If it comes to an open 
conflict, the destruction would be far more extensive, but NATO 
and UNPROFOR would have to count on casualties and technical 
damage, too. 
  One of the air strikes, in which the laser marking of 
targets 
was used, can be seen on the diagram. Before an aircraft with 
laser- guided bombs reaches the target area, it is necessary to 
mark the target (an armored vehicle) with a laser from another 
aircraft flying at a very high altitude. Another possibility is 
to mark the target using a ground marker, provided, however, 
that there is good visibility. In this case this could have 
been done by UNPROFOR military observers if they had the 
equipment necessary for laser marking. After the target has 
been marked, either from the air or from the ground, it can 
easily be hit by a laser bomb or missile. 
  As far as the present generation of markers is concerned, 
there are certain reservations in the world about their 
operational efficiency. Aircraft which carry target markers 
have to fly at dangerously high altitudes until the strike 
aircraft have dropped the bombs and left the target area. On 
the other hand, a marker on the ground can be very easily 
detected. 
  In case of Gorazde, the action by the F-16 and F-18 aircraft 
was not at all interrupted. If conflicts between the 
peacekeeping forces and Serbian soldiers continue, it will be 
necessary to activate the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
air defense. Western intelligence circles certainly know what 
equipment the Serbian air defense has, just as they know that 
this system has not been employed so far to attack NATO aviation. 
  It can be claimed without exaggerated self-confidence that 
the aircraft that marked the Serbian targets on the ground with 
lasers (if this option was used) could have been destroyed by 
the ground- to-ground missile systems "Volhol," "Neva," or 
"Drina." It is known that aircraft flying at high altitudes can 
very easily be shot down. The aircraft that carried out the 
strike could probably have been hit, too. The United States 
knows that the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 
possesses portable antiaircraft missiles (Stinger, Arrow, and 
Needle), which have proved to be very successful in shooting 
down low-flying targets. 
<H5>  Once Activated -- No Return </H5>
  Soldiers fire these missiles, which have a range of 
approximately 3,000 meters, from the shoulder. They have an 
automatic infra-red guidance system, which enables them to hit 
their target with a 90-percent certainty. It must also be 
considered that it is never the case that only one missile is 
used. "The Needle" is the modified version of the Russian 
"Arrow" rocket with built-in sensors for avoiding the infra-red 
flares that the aircraft releases behind itself in order to 
"deceive" the missile. 
  The Serbian army of Bosnia-Herzegovina has large quantities 
of portable antiaircraft missiles, and according to some 
information the missile system of the air defense troops has 
been enhanced lately. The United States knows where the active 
missile and radar centers in the Srpska republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are situated. They also know that there are 
"passive" systems at unknown locations that can be discovered 
only when they are activated. Therefore it would be good if 
they were never activated because in such a case there would be 
no return.

  [Text] Five days after the terrorist attack of the Greek 
commando unit against a military objective within our territory, 
during which two of our officers were killed and three wounded, 
this unprecedented event continues to be at the center of 
domestic and foreign mass media reports. The People's Assembly 
discussed this criminal act again today. In today's 
proceedings, in the name of the government, Foreign Minister 
Alfred Serreqi presented a report concerning the Albanian-Greek 
relations in the light of the present crisis. Our reporter, 
present at today's session, has prepared the following report: 
  The 10 April tragic event continues to be at the center of 
our public's attention. After the official pronouncement and 
that of the various political forces, associations, etc. at 
today's People's Assembly session, in the name of the government 
Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi spoke about Albanian-Greek 
relations in light of the recent events. In his speech to the 
deputies he said: 
  [Begin Serreqi recording] As I will shortly summarize, the 
course of Albanian-Greek relations, as neighboring countries and 
peoples and as the most ancient peoples in the region, shows 
that the general framework of interstate relations is at first 
view characterized by several zig-zags and oscillations. In its 
essence, it has, however, some constants and several conditions 
that should be accepted and objectively and realistically 
assessed. On the basis of mutual efforts and reciprocal 
interest and respect, efforts should be made to smooth out these 
zig-zags, and if possible to eliminate them. 
  I should first assert that Albania has put an end to 
isolation once and for all -- the isolation of its policy and 
the Don Quixotism of the policy of drop dead toward the whole 
world. Albania is simultaneously liberated from that illusory 
naivete so that we will ensure a continuous and permanent 
assistance from everyone, without a justification and motivation. 
  What are those circumstances that have conditioned and still 
condition Albanian-Greek relations? 
  I would say that first, it is the reality of present 
Albania, 
of an Albania that has taken the road of democracy, an Albania 
that is already passing the transition successfully and is 
accomplishing the market economy. 
  Second, it is the internal Greek reality, of which I hope 
that you have been informed. 
  Third, it is the fact that we are neighboring countries, and 
between neighboring countries relations of neighborliness are, 
of course, liberated from the illusion of good unconditional 
neighborliness. Of course there are problems, however, between 
neighbors and these problems should be overcome. 
  I want to stress that there is a very important thesis, 
i.e., 
the stance toward the crisis in former Yugoslavia which, despite 
the actual elements, is taking proportions almost similar to a 
Balkan crisis. In connection with this, I want to differentiate 
what is the stance toward the great all-national Albanian 
problem. 
  Finally, I should take into consideration the circumstances 
that Greece is the only Balkan country, member of the European 
Union, which is not running successfully the presidency for its 
six-month period. Greece is a NATO member -- even this is a 
circumstance that should be considered. There is also another 
very important circumstance -- the admission of the early 
Albanians in Greece and the admission of the Greek minority in 
Albania. 
  Of course, the policy of a state, its philosophy toward the 
minority, and the democratic dimension of a society can turn a 
minority into a communication bridge that eases relations, but 
simultaneously can turn it into a Trojan Horse or a factor that 
aggravates them. 
  There is also another problem. It is the Cam problem, which 
is put forward by the diplomacy of the democratic government and 
which should not be ignored. There exists another circumstance 
which has influenced, though not little, the Albanian-Greek 
relations -- the mentality, technocratic philosophy, and the 
influence of the Greek church in the entire policy of the Greek 
state, the Greek Government, and the attempts to infringe the 
autocephaly of the Albanian Church. 
  At the same time, there are circles and mentalities which 
are not liberated from historically known prejudices of the 
Greek policy, such as expansionism and the North Epirus claims. 
We are all informed that certain circles, which can by no means 
be believed when they claim to be completely unsupported or only 
partly supported by the Greek Government, follow a policy with a 
[word indistinct] tendency in that sphere that they consider to 
be their area. 
  In connection with this, it is not at all difficult to make 
an analysis how the assistance is spread. Not only in the 
humanitarian aspect, but also concerning the activity of the 
economic assistance and the Greek business in Albania, we will 
observe a geography that does not conform to those criteria and 
priorities that our country possesses for the northeastern 
areas, as the areas with the most difficult situations and the 
most backward areas from the economic point of view. 
  It is clear to all that the Greek side has not had a 
demarcation line and a clear attitude between economic 
cooperation with Albania and the efforts to exploit this with a 
[word indistinct] tendency. In connection with this, I want to 
stress that Albania, as I first said, is not at all against 
cooperation and harmony in all fields. However, from now on, as 
Albania has always considered this, but from now on more 
clearly, Albania will separate what is called a cooperation with 
the one that is called Hellenism. 
  Another element that should be considered is the presence of 
the Albanian economic emigrants in Greece. No one from us here 
wants Albanian-Greek relations to bring economic consequences to 
the Albanian families. On this occasion, I want to avail myself 
of the opportunity to thank the generosity of the Greek people 
who have welcomed the Albanian emigrants at this difficult 
period of transition and in a way have eased those economic 
difficulties that our country was encountering during this 
period. 
  At the same time, I want to make clear that the Albanian 
economic emigration is not at all a source of the increase of 
crime in Greece, a claim which has been several times put 
forward by the Greek side. I want to remind you that if we make 
an analysis of the Greek emigrants in other countries, we will 
recollect that at its peak, the Greek emigrants in the United 
States have the responsibility for the highest crime rate in the 
United States, as the Italian emigrants kept it at the time of 
its highest peak in Italy. 
  Thus, if we consider all these conditions and factors that 
condition Albanian-Greek relations, we would say that in the 
relations between Albania and Greece, there has been a constant 
that, if at first looks like a zig-zag -- sometimes very good 
and sometimes very aggravated relations --, this is an illusory 
conclusion. There is a dimension that is connected to the 
internal situations, there is a dimension that is connected to 
bilateral relations, there is a dimension that is related to the 
regional situation, and there is a dimension that is more widely 
connected to our whole continent. 
  First, I want to stress once again that, as we all know, the 
unprecedented terroristic act that occurred on 10 April can be 
blamed on the Greek Government. I do not consider it as 
lightning that strikes in a cloudless sky, but as part of the 
wave of previous events. I want to stress that all the Albanian 
political forces in general have agreed with the way the event 
has been treated. Perhaps there may be a difference in approving 
or not the reactions of the Albanian Government and in the 
degree of responsibility of the Greek Government. 
  The thing that strikes you most is the reaction or 
non-reaction of the Greek Government, the fact of not taking the 
responsibility, the absence of cooperation needed to throw light 
on the event, something that may have been partly corrected 
after the reactions of the Albanian Government, reactions that 
are already known. I hope there is no need to discuss it any 
longer. 
  What are the recent events? The recent event is the proposal 
that came through the diplomatic channel from the Greek 
Government to cooperate in a joint commission that will 
investigate and examine the event in detail, and a proposal for 
a meeting between the foreign ministers in a neutral country or 
at a multilateral activity. 
  Concerning these two proposals, because as I mentioned 
above, the policy of closing has finished for us, we are for 
dialogue and for overcoming the difficulties, considering that a 
tension in the south will highly aggravate the situation in the 
region. 
  Concerning these two proposals, the Albanian Government has 
answered positively, both for the joint investigation of the 
event and a possible meeting between foreign ministers. I have 
proposed a meeting in Bucharest on the occasion of the activity 
of Crans Montana, where I am invited and I will attend. 
  Regarding the international reaction, you know that the 
whole 
problem is up for discussion at the Security Council and it will 
be examined at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers. 
The case is put forward in the CSCE structures and the High 
Commission for Human Rights. Generally speaking and in a clear 
way, it results that the act has been condemned, the 
responsibility of the Greek Government has come out clearly, and 
the stance of the Albanian Government has been approved. 
  In conclusion, I judge that we should have no complexes and 
debasements, as the country's sovereignty, the fate of 
democracy, reform, European integrity and above all the grand 
pan-Albanian problem cannot pass through any capital of the 
world, cannot pass through any party in the world, whatever and 
wherever it can be, even less through Athens and through PASOK 
[Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement]. They are more than ever in 
the hand of the Albanian democratic sovereign state and of the

  [Text] The decision of the National Assembly to allow the 
passage of the UN convoy to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] prompted the following statement 
of Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president of the 
Republic: 
  [Begin Stoyanov recording] In connection with the numerous 
queries as to whether there is a change in Bulgaria's position 
toward the conflict in former Yugoslavia I must state the 
following: 
  The president of the Republic of Bulgaria supports the 
decision of the National Assembly to allow a one-time 
transshipment of UN property and equipment through our territory 
for the Blue Helmets in the independent and sovereign Republic 
of Macedonia. 
  It is well-known that our country has good-neighborly 
relations with Macedonia, which is not a participant in the 
military conflict. 
  This is a prudent decision that conforms to Bulgaria's 
national interests and the measures for security in the Balkans 
and to ending the war in former Yugoslavia. 
  Bulgaria supports the efforts of the United Nations, NATO, 
and the European Union to settle the conflict peacefully and 
establish peace in the Balkans. 
  The decision of the National Assembly does not contradict 
the 
basic principles of Bulgaria's Balkan policy, to which our 
country has firmly adhered since the beginning of the war, 
according to which Bulgaria, as a neighboring country, should 
not commit itself in any manner in the conflict. 
  Bulgaria insisted and continues to insist that all Balkan 
countries, Yugoslavia's neighbors, strictly adhere to this 
principle. Therefore Bulgaria opposes sending Blue Helmets from 
Turkey or any other Balkan on neighboring country of former 
Yugoslavia. 
  This is the essence of the special message that President 
Zhelev sent one month ago to Butrus-Ghali, UN general secretary. 
  The equipment the United Nations sends to the Blue Helmets 
in 
Macedonia has a preventive and deterrent purpose. It is a 
barrier against the eventual spread of the conflict in the 
direction of Macedonia. This corresponds to our national 
interests, because Macedonia's security means security for 
Bulgaria. 
  As far as the party games and speculations are concerned 
about some corridor through which Turkish Blue Helmets will pass 
through Bulgaria, I am authorized to state most categorically 
that no one has requested or discussed such a possibility. No 
such commitment has been assumed. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic has proposed on the basis of today's 
consultations that top-ranking Bosnian Serb Republic officials, 
as well as representatives of the United Nations and of those 
nations that are expected to help, should meet and discuss ways 
to define the security zone around Gorazde. 
  Milosevic said in a statement for the press following a two 
and a half-hour talk with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev, who unexpectedly arrived in Belgrade this evening, that 
the meeting on Gorazde would be held tomorrow morning and that 
the boundaries of the security zone would be determined in 
accordance with conclusions reached by a mixed commission 
composed of the representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, the 
Muslims, and the UN. 
  Milosevic assessed this evening's talks with Kozyrev as very 
open. According to him, the talks were devoted to key issues 
pertaining to the crisis in the region, with special emphasis on 
the events in Bosnia. 
  "I am pleased that we have very close, I would say 
identical, 
views on many aspects of this question," the Serbian president 
stressed. 
  Speaking about the situation in Bosnia, Milosevic said: "The 
peace process in Bosnia is at a critical point, from where it 
could very easily escalate into war, but it could also very 
easily shift towards a final peace." 
  "We believe that solutions involving small steps and the 
extinguishing of small fires is not a solution for Bosnia", 
Milosevic said, and added: "If things are tackled in this way we 
will constantly have a crisis in which only the geographical 
name would change, and the war would in this case be difficult 
to stop." 
  According to Milosevic, the best solution for the Bosnian 
conflict would be to reach a comprehensive agreement on the 
cessation of all hostilities on the entire territory of Bosnia- 
Herzegovina as soon as possible, without prejudging a political 
solution, and then to negotiate a final settlement in conditions 
of peace. 
  "I am very pleased to note that Russian Foreign Minister 
Andrey Kozyrev shares our view that the issue of sanctions is 
directly linked to the establishment of peace in Bosnia and that 
Russia has a very objective and constructive approach in this 
regard," Milosevic said. 
  Speaking about Gorazde, Milosevic said that the problem of 
that city should be resolved in conformity with the same 
principles that govern the global implementation of the project. 
  "The Muslim side has avoided defining the border of the 
security zone and has from this area launched a big -- as they 
called it -- spring offensive. Later a very complicated 
situation came about after the collapse of this offensive and 
the successful counterattack by Serb forces, but also after the 
unfortunate intervention from the air. This has undoubtedly put 
back the peace process and to a certain extent compromised the 
behavior of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]." 
  Milosevic said that defining the borders of the safe zone 
of Gorazde would create the conditions for things to cool off 
there, and that this would be the "extinguishing of a very 
difficult and tragic hot spot, but in the context of a general 
agreement on a cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  "We will invest all our political influence to see that this 
is achieved and we hope that we will are successful in this," 
Milosevic said. 
  Kozyrev agreed with Milosevic that the talks were very 
constructive and said he was leaving Belgrade "much more 
convinced that we shall achieve progress in the peace process." 
  Kozyrev underlined in a talk with reporters that President 
Milosevic was involved in the efforts to revive the peace talks 
and added: "I am an optimist in this respect." 
  Speaking about ways to resolve the Bosnian conflict, Kozyrev 
said that the European Union's plan remains on the table and 
that the United States, Russia, and the European Union were 
endeavoring to achieve peace on the basis of it. 
  The Russian foreign minister confirmed that there had also 
been discussion this evening of the sanctions and said: "We 
considered the question of sanctions, and Ambassador Churkin 
prior to this set out the Russian Federation's standpoint on 
this. If we are partners in the peace process with the European 
Union and the United States, this partnership must be in the 
determining of the borders, as well as in relation to the 
question of the suspension of sanctions. The Russian standpoint 
must be considered both in the European Union and in the United 
States. The road to peace is the road to the lifting of 
sanctions". 
  At the end, Kozyrev advocated that UNPROFOR representatives 
be sent to Gorazde and that the blockade of the Blue Helmets 
should be lifted "wherever and however they are being held." 
Thus, he said, the intervention from the air has proved to be 
ineffectual. 
  During this evening's talks, it was assessed that the NATO 
air strikes against Serb positions on 10 and 11 April caused an 
exacerbation of the situation and brought into question the 
efforts to establish a full cessation of hostilities in this 
area. In this context, note was made in particular of the 
danger of such acts undermining the peace efforts directed 
towards the normalization of the situation and the creation of 
the necessary conditions for the resumption of the negotiating 
process. In this, Russia was directly and actively involved 
and, in the assessment of President Milosevic, participated in a 
constructive way. 
  Taking into account that the peace process has found itself 
at a point where an escalation of the war and the establishment 
of peace were equally possible, Milosevic and Kozyrev agreed 
that forces should be joined in order to achive peace. It was 
noted that peace was undoubtedly in everybody's interest and 
that the only road to the establishment of a final peace in 
these regions led through the cessation of all hostilities. 
  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic expressed his 
conviction 
that Russia's peace initiative and the efforts made to implement 
an overall cessation of hostilities would prevail over the war 
option, and that the United Nations bore the responsibility to 
exercise an unbiased approach to all the sides in the conflict. 
  This evening's talks were also attended by Russian 
Ambassador 
in Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
correspondent Jaroslav Reznik; place and date not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Reznik] The government's 
policy statement has been adopted, following a marathon 
discussion in the National Council of the Slovak Republic. A 
big part of it concerns economic issues. What are the specific 
steps the government is to take in this sphere in the near 
future? What problems do you perceive as priorities? Is it at 
all possible to tackle Slovakia's current very complicated 
economic situation without breaking a very fragile social peace? 
  [Moravcik] Our cabinet has already taken certain steps. It 
is 
very important that all the measures taken by the cabinet are 
taken in the interest of strengthening fiscal discipline and 
stabilizing our budget. [passage omitted] Other steps are aimed 
at those abroad; we hold talks with our foreign partners to 
create better conditions for foreign investors to come here. 
The other sphere where we want to make the cabinet's activities 
more dynamic is the sphere of privatization. [passage omitted] 
Another aspect concerns social peace -- we hold very intensive 
talks with our partners on a new general agreement. I can say 
that our partners have shown a very positive, constructive 
attitude. I am convinced that we will succeed in securing and 
preserving social peace. 
  [Reznic] The Matica Slovenska leadership held a session in 
Cadca and adopted a statement calling on political entities 
represented in the government of the Slovak Republic to explain 
the participation in the coalition talks of ethnic Hungarian 
parties and movements -- despite the fact that they are not 
represented in the coalition government. What is your view on 
this problem? 
  [Moravcik] I have had an opportunity to discuss this problem 
with the Matica Slovenska officials. It is included in our 
coalition agreement -- Hungarian political parties support the 
government's policy statement and they have expressed their 
support by their vote, too. [passage omitted] There is nothing 
else, no other document the content of which would be different 
from the government's policy statement. According to our 
coalition agreement, the representatives of the ethnic Hungarian 
political parties are being invited to our talks -- that is, 
they have an opportunity to express their view. I think that, 
given the fact that they support the government's policy 
statement, there is justification to inviting them to 
participate in talks. [passage omitted] 
  [Reznic] Another fundamental sphere is the sphere of foreign 
relations. [passage omitted] 
  [Moravcik] One of the conditions for our integration into 
the 
European Union, and possibly into other political and security 
systems in the Euro-Atlantic sphere, is stability in Central 
Europe. We must secure stability in Central Europe and we have 
certain outstanding issues in this sphere, above all as regards 
our relations with the Hungarian Republic. The problem is 
similarly perceived in Hungary, and thus we would like to use 
this period to progress a little with the tackling of this 
problem. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Serb forces in Baranja, in east Croatia, have taken 
part of the heavy weapons which were under the control of the UN 
Protection Force, according to Belgian military spokesman 
Colonel (Fredi Van Weg). 
  A group of 520 Belgian soldiers is deployed in Baranja, 
which 
has been under Serb occupation for two years. In early April, 
Croatia agreed on a cease-fire with the rebel Serbs and, under 
the agreement, the Serbs placed their heavy weapons under UN 
control in six warehouses. 
  The fact that a certain number of weapons have been stolen 
should be condemned, because this will have a negative impact on 
the peace process which has taken off well, Colonel (Van Weg) 
said.

  [Excerpt] We have just received another report from 
Gorazde. In addition to fierce attacks on Gorazde, its unarmed 
civilians and brave defenders of the town, the chetniks have 
also been attacking the UN military observers in the town. UN 
military observers were attacked by the chetniks at about 1700 
in the Jabuka Sedlo mountain pass area while they were 
inspecting the demarcation lines in the area. According to 
unconfirmed reports, the chetniks killed one UN monitor and 
seriously wounded a translator in this perfidious assassination.

  [Text] Zagreb, April 15 (AFP) -- Bosnian Moslems started a 
massive exodus from outlying districts in the Serb-besieged 
Moslem enclave of Gorazde on Friday [15 April] to seek shelter 
within the town, UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said. 
  "The situation is extremely tense" said Kessler, adding that 
he expected the situation in the eastern enclave to deteriorate. 
  The exodus from northern and northeastern districts started 
around 3:30 P.M. (1330 GMT) and was still going on at 7 P.M., 
Kessler added.

<F P=106> [Article by Alexandru Schendrea and Iulian Chifu: "King </F>
Mihai I Reiterates His Intention To Return to His Homeland, but 
Only in his Capacity as Monarch"] 
  [Text] In an interview for the Russian daily IZVESTIYA on 
9 April, King Mihai I affirms that the Romanian Government is 
afraid of his justified demands to the country's throne, and 
said that, in 1947, the Communists resorted to threats and 
forced him to abdicate. "I believe that the current Bucharest 
regime does not feel confident" said the king, and invoked as 
arguments in support of this statement the numerous lies that 
were invented about him. Among other things, King Mihai 
mentioned that on Christmas Eve, the Romanian Television Station 
scheduled a documentary on the prime minister's Press Bureau in 
which he, the king, is accused of having betrayed the country, 
accusations that according to His Majesty are simple 
fabrications. The king reasserted his intention to return to 
his homeland only in his capacity as king and showed willingness 
"to serve the country faithfully and to help it regain the place 
it used to hold in Europe before the Communists came to power." 
  In accordance with the declarations of His Majesty King 
Mihai, Princess Margaret will become his successor to the throne.

  [Text] The Press Bureau of His Majesty King Mihai is 
empowered to issue the following communique: 
  In accordance with the news published by EVENIMENTUL ZILEI 
on 
13 April, we note that His Majesty King Mihai has never held a 
dialogue with any representative of the Russian daily IZVESTIYA 
on the issue of the current fate of Romania, the future of the 
royal family, or on any other issue. 
  Note of the editorial office: 
  Indeed, King Mihai I has not granted an interview to 
IZVESTIYA. It was a reproduction of an interview granted by His 
Majesty to the Swiss daily "24 HOURS." 
  The way in which IZVESTYIA presented this interview has 
caused some confusion.

<F P=106> [Document published on 9 April 1994 by the Democratic </F>
Convention of Romania: "Manifesto for the Salvation of Romania"] 
  [Text] Romania can still be rescued from the crisis into 
which it has been pushed by an incapable and corrupt government. 
  We have discovered that the principal enemy of the country 
is 
the current political power itself. We consider ourselves 
entitled to fight, using all legal and democratic means, to 
salvage our nation. 
  To that end the Democratic Convention of Romania proposes a 
number of simple and efficient measures: 
  1. A severe and righteous justice should put an end to 
plundering and corruption and punish all those who have become 
rich in unlawful ways. 
  2. Local authorities should be granted the resources and 
legal framework needed to administer our everyday life 
successfully. At least 18 percent of the taxes we pay should be 
allocated directly to local administration bodies so they can 
use the money in the interest and under the control of the 
citizens. 
  3. The villagers' farms should be strengthened by granting 
them inexpensive loans to buy seeds, fertilizers, and 
agricultural machines. By such measures the well-being of both 
the farmers and the country is ensured. Agricultural taxes 
should be immediately discontinued, while the handing out of 
land ownership certificates should be ended within six months, 
the land property bill should be improved, and abuse and 
injustice eliminated. 
  4. Jobs should be ensured by making investments and by 
privatization. Taxes should be reduced to stimulate private 
business. There is an absolute need for political credibility 
and a simple and flexible legal framework to encourage 
investments. 
  5. The youth of this country should find their place in 
society, which should ensure them living quarters and access to 
jobs. The current parliament session should urgently pass the 
education bill in accordance with the recommendations of the 
Council of Europe and ensure funds at least three time larger 
than the current funds for that domain, so that we can reach the 
level attained in neighboring countries. 
  6. Real protection of the unemployed and the socially 
disadvantaged should be ensured. 
  7. Budget resources should be ensured for health and culture 
so as to salvage the biological and spiritual being of our 
nation. 
  8. The defense of the country should be strengthened by 
ensuring the dignity, training, and equipment of the armed 
forces, integrating them within Euro-Atlantic structures and 
halting the drift toward other spheres of influence. 
  All the aforementioned measures are at hand; by implementing 
them Romania could be salvaged from poverty and despair. 
Romania must be saved NOW! [capitalization as published]

<F P=106> [Interview with Emil Constantinescu, president of the </F>
Democratic Convention of Romania, by Constantin Lupu; place and 
date not given: "We Are Not Opposition for the Sake of 
Opposition"] 
  [Text] [Lupu] A document by the Romanian Foundation for 
Democracy [FRD] and the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] 
entitled "Romania 1989-1994" was released a few days ago. What 
is the purpose of this document? 
  [Constantinescu] The document is the result of a long study 
carried out by the Foundation's experts exclusively on the basis 
of official data supplied by the National Statistics Commission. 
By referring to that data, the document drew up suggestive 
charts on the main components of our economic and social life, 
such as unemployment, inflation, production, and trade (both 
domestic and foreign). Along with the public presentation of 
this image, we are also presenting the CDR's solutions for 
taking Romania out of the crisis and promoting the country's 
recovery. 
  [Lupu] Why now? 
  [Constantinescu] After enduring the last stage of the 
communist dictatorship and after this transition period, which, 
in our opinion, should now draw to an end, we would like to see 
these documents -- on what has happened and what should happen 
-- become the subject of a dialogue between responsible 
political forces, a dialogue which should be adequately covered 
by the press. At this point, I would like to digress a little 
from your question and tell you at the very beginning that I am 
particularly interested in striking up a relationship with the 
readers of ADEVARUL daily. I am not saying this to incur their 
liking, which is a common political trick. I say it as a steady 
reader of your newspaper, which addresses not an important 
category of the electorate, but an important category of 
citizens of the country. I have no doubts that a large 
proportion of ADEVARUL readers did not and do not share the 
ideas that I am promoting on behalf of the CDR. But, as I said 
during my election campaign, I am more interested in those who 
do not vote for us. I realize that one can never convince 
everybody. There must be people with other opinions, as well. 
If we had come to power, the existence of an opposition would 
have been as necessary as ever, since the opposition represents 
the interests of the citizens toward any administration. I am 
convinced that now is the time for a dialogue where facts -- not 
words -- count. 
  [Lupu] A short while ago you launched a "Manifesto for the 
Salvation of Romania," as a basis for future discussions with 
the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Nevertheless, the 
signals that you received from those quarters have not been all 
that positive so far. Does the manifesto or the latest document 
represent a last offer made by the opposition to the ruling 
party? 
  [Constantinescu] No offer should be the last one and no 
dialogue should be the last one, either. Politics is important 
for the very reason that its role is to turn chaotic and violent 
confrontations into exchanges of ideas. 
  [Lupu] Nevertheless, it seems that the negotiations 
conducted by the CDR parliamentary parties with the PDSR have 
only led to minor results. What are your plans for the 
forthcoming period? 
  [Constantinescu] Unfortunately -- why not be open about it? 
-- we have noticed that for the past four months the PDSR has 
used us to counter the claims of its allied parties situated 
even further to the left of the political spectrum and to offer 
a false image of dialogue for both internal and external 
consumption. I do not see any further point in prolonging this 
incorrect and inefficient political game. 
  [Lupu] What is the Convention doing about it? What will it 
decide at the next meeting of the CDR Council? 
  [Constantinescu] Next week, we will be holding a meeting of 
the CDR Council. Speculations have been made, particularly in 
the press, to the extent that we will raise the issue of 
launching an election campaign. But this campaign is not a goal 
in itself. It should only be a means for a positive change in 
people's lives. What we now see as the current power's behavior 
is a reaction to the latest public opinion polls, which, 
regardless of nuances, have primarily emphasized that the CDR is 
ahead as far as the people's trust is concerned, thus turning 
our movement into the primary political force in the country. 
Then, according to the views of the participants in these 
public opinion polls, a CDR government has now edged into first 
place (with 35 percent), followed by a CDR- Democratic Party 
[PD]-PDSR government second, and a monocolor government like the 
current one third (with only 14 percent). Nowhere in the world 
can you have a viable government when all the opinion polls 
indicate that the level of distrust exceeds 70 percent! 
  [Lupu] On the basis of the data in these polls, we conclude 
that, if elections were to be held now and these results were 
achieved, then the CDR and the PD would find themselves in 
today's situation of the PDSR and its current allies. 
Therefore, the basic aspects of the problem would not change 
and the parliamentary blockage would remain. How would you 
proceed in such a situation? 
  [Constantinescu] Indeed, this is the direction indicated 
by all recent opinion polls. In all seriousness, though, I must 
say that elections are not carried out by opinion polls. We 
must take into consideration the huge means of influencing and 
organization available to the current power, primarily their 
ability to present themselves as a party-state. They are using, 
to a greater or lesser extent, the force of the state for the 
benefit of the party. However, if the blockage generated by the 
government's immobility persists on the key issues of reform, 
then the situation will further deteriorate and public support 
for the current opposition will grow. 
  [Lupu] Do you hope that you will exceed the 51 percent that 
the opinion polls credit you with? 
  [Constantinescu] Yes, so as to create a clearer majority 
that I believe the country needs so much. At the same time, I 
would like to clarify further a point linked to the 
parliamentary blockage, as you called it and as the rulers also 
call it. Well, there is no such thing as a parliamentary 
blockage! It only appears in the excuses of the current power, 
which wants to pass their only failures into the opposition's 
court. When the current parliamentary majority wants to pass a 
law, it does so, as the case of the Law on Agricultural Income 
Tax clearly shows. The opposition strongly opposed that law and 
even left Parliament's hall. However, the law was passed. Of 
course, the opposition can do something about it all, and it did 
so. For instance, these are the tactics that we adopted in the 
case of this law: The opposition seriously participated in the 
debates of the parliamentary commissions, thus managing to 
diminish the negative impact of this law by reducing the size of 
the stipulated taxes. If the initial form presented by the 
government is compared with the latest version, one can see the 
improvement. Therefore, if we did not exactly manage to block 
the government's draft law, we did manage at least to dilute it. 
On this occasion, people may notice that Parliament is not to 
be blamed for everything that does not work. Similarly, they 
may realize that Parliament's achievements are also due to the 
opposition's efforts.

That He Wants To Come to Romania"] 
  [Text] Our special correspondent in Strasbourg, during the 
proceedings of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of 
Europe, obtained an exclusive interview for EVENIMENTUL ZILEI 
with Russian ultranationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the 
man who troubled the waters of the current parliamentary session 
of the European forum. 
  "It was not I who said that the Romanians are Italian 
Gypsies, but a friend of mine in Bulgaria. I do not know what 
Romania is, but I intend to go there. There are certain actions 
of Romania against Moldova, which is a Russian land. Romania 
has to eliminate its territorial problems. You have problems 
with Moldova, Bulgaria, and Hungary and you have no army, which 
is very bad for you. We want to have our own sphere of influence 
in Eastern Europe, that is in the former socialist area, 
including Poland and Budapest," Vladimir Zhirinovskiy told us. 
  "Iliescu was friends with Ceausescu. For you, Nicolae 
Ceausescu was very good, people loved him, and you were happy 
with the old regime," the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party 
of Russia added, basing his affirmations on movies he has seen. 
  The Russian leader also said that "Iliescu is exactly like 
Gorbachev" and that he is expecting an invitation to visit 
Romania.

<F P=106> [Communique of the Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party </F>
dated 10 April: "The Romanians' Will To Be Together Remains 
Intact"] 
  [Text] The Executive Bureau of the Democratic Party has 
learned with deep concern and profound distress about both the 
decision of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova to resume, 
in a substantial way, the country's integration within the CIS 
-- the successor to the USSR -- and the Chisinau officials' 
declarations, which are contrary to the ideals and national 
aspirations of the Romanians living on both banks of the Prut 
River. 
  The Democratic Party has never doubted for a minute that the 
imperial spirit from the East would be abandoned soon and 
easily, but it kept hoping that despite the numerous hardships 
of the current times the Romanians living in Bessarabia would 
prove capable of turning to good account the advantages offered 
by the new international situation to definitely unchain 
themselves and return, in one form or other, to the cultural, 
economic, and political space of their historic homeland. 
Unfortunately, the decision passed by the Parliament of the 
Republic of Moldova runs counter to the course of history and 
can gravely and dramatically delay the accomplishment of the 
Romanian national ideal of reunification. 
  At the same time we reject with indignation all assertions 
that the post-December [1989] Romania never granted assistance 
to the Republic of Moldova. At least during the Roman and 
Stolojan governments, the assistance that was granted was 
continuous and substantial, it came from all our hearts, despite 
the fact that it meant a significant sacrifice for the 
population of our country. However, it is also true that a 
certain feeling of having been abandoned, which is experienced 
by the Romanians in Bessarabia, is the fault of the current 
government, as well as Romania's Presidency, which failed to use 
the favorable circumstances created after the 1989 December 
revolution and to show the evidence of patriotic courage and 
political resoluteness that would have been needed for the 
reunification of the country. 
  We are certain that the will of the Romanians living on both 
banks of the Prut River to be together remains intact, as this 
guarantees that sooner or later the country that was violently 
torn away from us and submitted to dictatorship will be a WHOLE 
[preceding word published in capitals] again, to the benefit of 
the prosperity of the Romanian nation and stability in Europe.

  [Text] On the initiative of Professor Virgil Magureanu, 
director of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI], the 
leadership of that institution had a meeting today with 
editors-in-chief, directors, and general directors of press 
organizations, radio and television, and the Romanian Press 
Agency, during which they addressed issues related to current 
relations between the SRI and the media and the more fluid and 
open circulation of information, both in the interest of the 
public readership and national security. 
  After the conclusion of the meeting, Virgil Magureanu 
granted 
a brief interview to Gheorghe Verman, director of the 
Information, Journalism, and Sports Department of Radio Romania, 
in which Magureanu assessed that it had been a useful 
conversation during which everyone was able to very openly state 
their opinions. There were also some slightly biased accents, 
but, on the whole, the expressed opinions were objective and not 
acrimonious, Magureanu stated. 
  Answering a question as to whether openness and the security 
of the state are compatible, the head of the SRI assessed that 
within certain limits they are compatible, adding that openness 
should refer primarily to the already final results of actions 
designed to protect national security. It would also be 
necessary, Magureanu said, for the illegal monopoly of one or 
the other party -- that is, the SRI or the media -- over 
national security information to be dissolved so that cases can 
be solved more rapidly through correct cooperation. 
  Asked to comment on cooperation so far, especially on the 
current cooperation between the SRI and the "Romania 
Actualitati" [Current Events] program, Prof. Magureanu 
appreciated, above all, our radio's optimal objectivity with 
respect to the image of the institution he leads. That image is 
sometimes good, sometimes bad, changing with time, Magureanu 
added. 
  At the end of the interview Magureanu stated that he is 
quite 
optimistic on relations between the SRI and the press and that 
he believes that the institution he is leading has a great deal 
of things to do before it obtains the necessary trust of those 
who should be its partners. He concluded by saying that such 
relations are not necessarily identical to those among equal 
partners.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Arpad Goncz by Gyorgy Jozsef </F>
Farkas; place and date not given: "Agreement on Evaluating 
Central Europe"] 
  [Text] The meeting of seven presidents in Litomysl focused 
on the situation of the region and provided an opportunity for 
bilateral meetings. In the framework of these bilateral 
meetings, Slovak President Kovac told Arpad Goncz that 
Bratislava wished to solve the problem of family names, among 
other things. Arpad Goncz expressed his opinions about the 
results and lessons of the Litomysl meeting in an interview to 
NEPSZABADSAG. 
  [Farkas] Mr Goncz! Many international forums offer 
themselves to exchange of views today. What justifies the 
Litomysl-type meetings? 
  [Goncz] I think that this type of meeting, like a typical 
discussion forum, has its own role to play. In our region and, 
the way I see it, all over Europe, the function of state 
president is beginning to shift into some kind of a moral role, 
and such a meeting capable of clarifying many issues is 
important precisely in this respect. I would say that the 
presidents carry and express the values and opinions of their 
people. For example, we experienced a surprising agreement on 
evaluating the role of regionalism, and I can say the same thing 
about the borders. There are people who talked about 
Maastricht-type borders and others preferred the creation of 
connecting borders. These two things practically mean the same 
thing, namely to stop the separating role of the borders. 
  [Farkas] In addition to the presidents' moral role, has the 
spiritual weight described by President Havel also been asserted 
in the meeting? 
  [Goncz] There are no two identical countries in Europe, but 
the regions can, nevertheless, be clearly discernible. Although 
it is more difficult to precisely delineate Hungary's Western 
borders, but it is easier to find its Eastern border: It lies 
somewhere along the line of the Orthodox religion. It is 
characteristic of Central Europe that the seeds of the system of 
Western institutions can be found in every country, and the 
characters of these societies also resemble the others. Our 
experiences, that are simultaneously related to the West and the 
East, are connecting us. We can say that, even if not in the 
actual sense of the word, spiritually we understand each other's 
language. 
  [Farkas] If this is the case, for how longer do we have to 
convince the other half of Europe that we belong there? 
  [Goncz] This does not depend entirely on us. The West puts 
forward a system of requirements that are partly political and 
partly economic. Regarding the latter, it is possible that, at 
a given moment, they may change this into a secondary 
requirement if their interests dictate this. Economic interests 
and interdependence can best be expressed by the principle of 
markets for markets. If we get a market there, in exchange we 
can offer them the Central European market that is still open 
and is in their immediate vicinity. When modernization starts 
here and we also find markets for these products, our import 
ability will also increase, and problems and tensions in this 
part of Europe can decrease along with the increase in the 
mobility of products. 
  This requires long-term planning but, in times of recession, 
private economy is engaged in providing day-to-day answers for 
the time being. The way I see it, there is always full 
agreement at the top, but daily interests are increasingly 
emerging the more we get to the bottom. 
  Therefore, it would be important for this way of thinking to 
seep through from the top and reach some kind of general level; 
in other words, everyone should accept the necessary and 
unavoidable steps. This can be achieved through slow and careful 
work, but also with a change in international circumstances that 
might make it necessary for the Central European countries to 
join the Western structures overnight. 
  [Farkas] The German president, who celebrated his 74th 
birthday at the meeting and will soon step down from his 
position he filled for 10 years, received the most attention 
among the seven presidents present in Litomysl. How did you 
decide on your common present given to the German president, 
namely a map of Europe with borders that have been not valid for 
a long time? 
  [Goncz] I only learned about the decision to give this 
present before my departure, and I found this idea very 
ingenious. The idea obviously originated from Vaclav Havel, who 
is known for the well-chosen symbolic means to give quite firm 
signals. Weizsacker was very moved to be celebrated by us, but 
no one questions the prestige gained in his long activity, a 
prestige with which he became a sort of "father figure" and a 
model figure as president in our region. 
  [Farkas] Has some kind of "Litomysl spirit" emerged in the 
meeting that was clearly held in a good mood, a spirit that can 
be remembered and used in the future? 
  [Goncz] We can call it that way if this covers the fact that 
seven presidents discuss things together and understand each 
other in friendship, but we better call this a Central European 
spirit. The whole meeting had some kind of signal value: The 
seven presidents here focused on regionalism. There were people 
among us who represented a member of the European Union, like 
Germany, and countries that have reached the threshold of the 
European Union, like Austria; several countries have associate 
membership in the European Union; Slovenia has not yet reached 
that point, but it definitely belongs there. The idea of 
broadening the circle of members also emerged, because this is 
not a closed format, just like Central Europe itself, something 
that everyone knows what it is but no one can really define. 
  [Farkas] On the first day of the meeting, you announced 
that you invited your fellow presidents to a similar discussion 
in Hungary next year. Have a concrete place and time of the new 
meeting been already set? 
  [Goncz] There is still no answer regarding the place; as for 
the time, I can only say that it will be held sometime between 
the end of May and the end of June. I hope that we will also be 
able to have a similar exchange of views there, just like in 
Litomysl now, a place where we sought understanding, not 
agreements, while we were talking about a lot of things. This 
was the essence of this whole meeting: Our subjects of 
discussions should not be limited, no protocol should be 
prepared about them, but we should clarify for ourselves and for 
each other what would be good for all of us and what we 
presidents can do to promote all this.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza 
Jeszenszky has dealt with southern Slav developments, among 
other things, during his visit to County Baranya. Csaba 
Belenessy reports: 
  [Belenessy] On the occasion of his 15 April visit to 
Budapest, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel confirmed that Germany 
considered it very important for Hungary to become a member of 
the European Union [EU] and NATO as soon as possible, said Geza 
Jeszenszky. He added, however, that because of Russian 
concerns, his German counterpart was more cautious in the matter 
of accession to NATO. In the view of the Hungarian foreign 
minister, these concerns are unfounded because NATO is of a 
defensive nature; it is not directed against anyone. What is 
more, if it expands to more remote eastern areas, the borders of 
freedom and well-being in Europe will extend further, and this 
could have a very beneficial effect on Russia's security and 
economic revival. 
  In his address Geza Jeszenszky paid particular attention to 
the Balkan crisis. He said that Hungary could be proud of the 
fact that, among the Yugoslav successor states, it has very good 
relations with Slovenia and the friendly Hungarian-Croatian 
relationship, which has its roots in the historical past, has 
been restored. 
  He stressed that Hungarian foreign policy had not taken 
hostile steps against Serbia; on the contrary, it had chosen the 
best possible path. This is recognized by Belgrade too, since 
January; as a result, the hatchet has been buried. [passage 
omitted] 
  One of the basic conditions of a just resolution of the 
Yugoslav crisis, Geza Jeszenszky emphasized, is that Croatian 
Baranja [under Serb control] should be freed from the rule of 
foreign armed men who settled there and that those who had been 
driven away should be able to return there. Referring to this, 
Geza Jeszenszky mentioned not only the Croatians and the 
Hungarians, but also those Serbs who, before the war, had 
constituted 23 percent of the population.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Democratic Federation Cochairman </F>
Zoltan Biro by Lajos Pogonyi; place and date not given: "One 
Should Also Pay Attention to the Pope!"] 
  [Text] Will the party reach the 5 percent necessary to 
make it into parliament? Can the third way, romantic 
anticapitalism, be sympathetic at the turn of the century? Why 
does it seem that the National Democratic Federation [NDSZ] is a 
"two-person" party? These were some of the questions we asked 
NDSZ Cochairman Zoltan Biro. 
  [Pogonyi] The NDSZ policy is often criticized for having 
many elements of romantic anticapitalism. The question arises: 
Is such a policy plausible and sympathetic at the turn of the 
century? 
  [Biro] Honesty is only rarely rewarding in politics. 
  [Pogonyi] In your view, what is honesty in politics? 
  [Biro] If one tries to coordinate the principle and the 
practice and if one tries to remain consistent. I do not like 
the expression "third way" because it can be misunderstood and 
misinterpreted. It is true that history made this impossible in 
1947-1948. However, time did not justify those who made this 
impossible; instead, what they called socialism has collapsed. 
I have the same opinion about capitalism. 
  [Pogonyi] It seems, however, that capitalism has not 
collapsed.... 
  [Biro] It really functions in welfare societies. If, 
however, the slightest danger emerges in connection with 
welfare, panic can immediately be felt and confidence in 
democracy begins to crumble. It itself, capitalism has not yet 
cured anything. It is increasingly irresponsible to speak about 
socialism and capitalism in the world. The world has failed to 
justify either of them. A lot of things prove the crisis of 
capitalism. 
  [Pogonyi] Do you think of being accused of social demagogy? 
When unemployment is high, it is rewarding to criticize 
capitalism. 
  [Biro] It was also rewarding to criticize socialism. We had 
a lot of experience in this respect during the change in the 
regime. Today, it is not so useful to criticize capitalism, 
because there are many people who believe in it blindly. 
However, they should listen to Pope John Paul II, who does not 
have many good words about capitalism either. You should also 
listen to the pope! It is a big experiment to create democracy 
under deteriorating economic conditions. 
  [Pogonyi] Is there still time for experiments? You are the 
ones who often mention the fact that this country has had enough 
of experiments. 
  [Biro] One should not engage in experiments, but we are not 
the ones who dictate this. We only said that we needed a change 
in the regime and that a democratic system was more humane that 
a non- democratic one. 
  [Pogonyi] Others have also said that. 
  [Biro] Yes, but we also mean this. 
  [Pogonyi] As for people having enough of all this, you used 
to say that what is going on in Parliament is mostly a circus. 
Nevertheless, the NDSZ also wants to make into Parliament. 
  [Biro] We do not have a bad opinion about parliament in 
general. Parliament is essential in democracy. 
  [Pogonyi] Is it a necessary evil? 
  [Biro] I would not say that either. The level of maturity 
is the point here, the maturity of democratic institutions, of 
the parliament, and of the parties. This parliament is still 
immature. Our main problem is how to create more mature 
institutions as soon as possible in a transitional period. This 
needs patience. Things should not be hastened, but they can 
affect history. The NDSZ was created in order to make into 
Parliament. 
  [Pogonyi] Will the party have the necessary 5 percent? 
  [Biro] I hope so. Gathering the nomination slips is a 
problem for a lot of parties. This is bankruptcy. 
  [Pogonyi] You travel around the country a lot. What do you 
see? Which parties have a good chance? Many people think that 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] might become overconfident 
and this could be fatal for the party. 
  [Biro] People in many places think that the MSZP might be 
such a big winner that it will be alone in Parliament and will 
be forced to form a government alone. I regard such a 
development as an unfortunate one. The problem is that, if the 
MSZP proves to be unable to carry out rapid and efficient 
changes, anti-communist feelings will emerge again. This would 
be painful for the MSZP and also for the activity of the entire 
Parliament. 
  [Pogonyi] In the view of the NDSZ, what government would be 
an ideal one? 
  [Biro] This is a personal opinion, and not the opinion of 
the my party: A center-right-center-left-center government 
would be desirable. 
  [Pogonyi] Is this not a little too much ? 
  [Biro] No. The transitional period requires this. 
  [Pogonyi] Too many parties would suppress each other. 
  [Biro] Not necessarily. There are many examples all over 
the world of right-wing and left-wing parties governing together. 
  [Pogonyi] Has the NDSZ prepared itself for a government 
role? 
  [Biro] It is easy to give an arrogant answer to this and say 
yes. Preparation depends on the type of people a party can 
gather around itself. 
  [Pogonyi] It seems that your experts do not appear in public 
too often. Why? 
  [Biro] We have many good experts. The question is whether 
the party is led by good politicians. 
  [Pogonyi] It seems that the NDSZ is a two-or three-person 
party. You and Imre Pozsgay, or the other way round, and Kata 
Beke. Did you develop the party this way deliberately? 
  [Biro] No, this was not something deliberate. There are 
people who also say that Pozsgay is flirting with the 
center-right and I am flirting with the center-left. Of course, 
this is not so. Becoming a politician is a natural process. 
Think of whom the public knew among the Christian Democrats or 
the Federation of Young Democrats at the beginning of the change 
in the regime.

<F P=106> [Interview with Republic Party Chairman Janos Palotas by </F>
Attila Zsoldos; place and date not given: "Extremists Do Not 
Stand a Chance"] 
  [Text] The Republic Party set out the goal to have a 
candidate in every electoral district. However, only 84 
candidates succeeded in gathering the nomination slips necessary 
to run in the elections. We asked Republic Party Chairman Janos 
Palotas about his party's election chances. 
  [Palotai] Making it into parliament basically depends on the 
number of lists, namely the number of places in which voters can 
vote for a party. From this point of view, the Republic Party 
has achieved good results, because it set up 17 district lists. 
It can be voted in in 164 districts out of 176 districts, or 
more than 90 percent of the country. 
  [Zsoldos] In other words, the party is hopeful. 
  [Palotas] Absolutely. We have the chance now to exceed the 
5 percent threshold. Looking at it from this viewpoint, our 
achievement is not worse than what we expected. However, it is 
worse from the viewpoint that the party fared slightly worse 
than expected in individual districts. However, I am not 
pessimistic. I think that, as a party formed one year before 
the elections, we tried the impossible when we set out the goal 
to have candidates in every district. We presented candidates 
everywhere, and more than 50 percent of these candidates 
survived. Originally, we counted on the success of about 80 
percent of them. Given the fact that we started from zero and 
we are the only party among our competitors that does not get 
budget support, these results cannot be regarded as a failure. 
  [Zsoldos] In the parliamentary debate on the electoral law, 
you supported the proposal to increase the threshold to 5 
percent. Have you changed your position? 
  [Palotas] My opinion has not changed. Those who submitted 
the proposal and the leading speakers of various parties 
justified this increase by claiming that this would avoid the 
exaggerated proliferation of parliamentary parties and, 
subsequently, a decreased efficiency of parliamentary activity. 
In my address, I called this a crude mistake. I nevertheless 
supported the proposal because I thought it would increase the 
chances of keeping the lists of extremist forces out of 
parliament. In my opinion, for example, the Workers Party, or 
Torgyan's Smallholders Party, or the Hungarian Justice and Life 
Party [MIEP] have no chance at all of winning in individual 
districts. 
  [Zsoldos] However, the Workers Party and Torgyan's 
smallholders have more than 150 candidates, and have been able 
to present lists everywhere. Nor can the MIEP be written off 
easily with its 10 district lists. Does all this upset your 
plans? 
  [Palotas] I was very glad to see all the three parties 
running after the candidate nomination. In my opinion, the 
extremists are supported by only 6-7 percent of the voters. The 
aforementioned three parties represent an approximately 
identical power. Given the fact that they share this narrow 
support, there are good chances that none of these parties will 
reach the 5-percent threshold. They do not stand a chance in 
individual districts either, because their candidates should get 
the majority votes to win, and there is not a single electoral 
district in Hungary with a majority for extremist parties. 
  [Zsoldos] For an outsider, it seemed that the Republic Party 
was left out of the alliance of liberal parties because of 
pressure exercised by the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz]. Did you have to carry out a strategy modification 
because of this? 
  [Palotas] This is only the appearance. However, there is a 
little truth in this, namely that Fidesz would indeed not have 
welcomed it if the Republic Party had joined the liberal bloc. 
Fidesz made this clear to the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
in the course of negotiations held behind closed doors. As far 
as I know, the SZDSZ did not share the Fidesz position; the 
SZDSZ has good enough relations with us to say that no liberal 
bloc would emerge if this was the condition. Therefore, there 
would have been no obstacle for our party to join the liberal 
bloc. But we did not even consider the possibility. 
  [Zsoldos] Why not? 
  [Palotas] One of the basic principles of our program is that 
the Republic Party cannot commit itself to any ideology before 
the elections. 
  [Zsoldos] In other words, you did not want to join the bloc. 
  [Palotas] Not at all. When it leaked out from the secret 
negotiations that a tension emerged in connection with the 
Republic Party, I let the SZDSZ know that they should sign the 
agreement because we did not even consider the possibility of 
joining the bloc. If we had joined, two-thirds of our members 
would have immediately left the party. One of the essential 
elements of our organization was that people with leftist, 
Christian, and liberal commitment can freely join our party if 
they limit their ideology to private affairs. 
  [Zsoldos] Where would you place the Republic Party on the 
current Hungarian political scene? 
  [Palotas] Just like the American Democratic, conservative, 
and Republican Parties, the Hungarian Republic Party cannot be 
placed on the main line of this scene. If you asked the 
politicians of the aforementioned party whether they are 
liberals or social democrats, they would not understand the 
question. 
  [Zsoldos] This is most probably true, but the current 
Hungarian political scene is divided into 
conservative-Christian, liberal, and social democratic trends. 
One cannot disregard this fact. 
  [Palotas] That is true, but someone has to undo this, and 
our role and possibilities in this are not bad at all today. 
The global tendency today is that ideological issues are 
constantly forced back into the private sphere. However, 
ideological blocs have emerged in Hungary. However, this does 
not matter, because none of the parties will be able to form a 
government alone. The next government coalition can only emerge 
through forced compromises, and this gives a big opportunity to 
make sure that ideology stays at the level of party politics and 
does not become part of the government program. This is a great 
opportunity for the Republic Party.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Lezsak, executive chairman of the </F>
Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Janos Papp in Budapest; date not 
given: "Sandor Lezsak on the MDF, Politics, Press"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Papp] What are the chances 
for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in the elections? 
  [Lezsak] A third of our candidates have a real chance to 
make it into parliament, and a few candidates might also get in 
from the next third. According to my estimates, more than 60 
individual MDF candidates will receive the voters' confidence, 
and they will be strengthened by the candidates successful on 
the lists. I have confidence in the election success of the MDF 
because, in the preparation for the campaign, our candidates 
visited many households and made contact with people; we set up 
the election offices, and we will slowly catch up with the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] in organization. 
  [Papp] Some people claim that the MDF started its campaign 
too modestly. This is a tough and dirty struggle, and other 
parties carry out their campaign in this way. Why is the MDF so 
withdrawn? 
  [Lezsak] The MDF does not agree with a styleless struggle; 
both our leadership and our members clearly declared this at the 
very beginning. Our election posters do not irritate anyone, 
and we thank the citizens for their confidence and calm of four 
years, because the voters also contributed to Hungary being the 
most stable country in the region. The opposition parties will 
also realize sooner or later that all that glitters is not gold, 
and I mean by this that it is not sure that the foreign campaign 
experts employed by them are aware of the Hungarian reality. In 
fact, the final election results will tell which party has the 
real experts. [passage omitted] 
  [Papp] According to the political signs, it may happen that 
no party will form a coalition with the MSZP, if they get into a 
position to form a government. What happens in that case? 
  [Lezsak] New parliamentary elections will probably be 
called, but today no one can even forecast the results of the 
elections in May; nor can anyone say for sure which party will 
be the final victor. The MDF has huge resources. Take some 40 
percent of the voters: These people are watching domestic 
political developments with silent passivity. Their votes could 
be decisive and, therefore, the MDF also hopes to get a lot of 
votes from this group, because every person of goodwill knows 
that the MDF has carried out predictable political activity over 
the past four years, and the party's program is a guarantee that 
we will continue the policy begun by the late Jozsef Antall. 
  [Papp] Let us suppose that, contrary to all expectations, 
the MDF does not have the success that you envisage. Will this 
lead to personal consequences? 
  [Lezsak] Our chances of winning are increasing and, no 
doubt, the MDF will play a determining role in the new Hungarian 
parliament and Government. However, if things turn out 
differently, this will not be the end of the world, because a 
process of internal cleansing would start and, as a result, we 
would really have the opportunity to get to know the people. It 
is more than probable that many careerists would turn their 
backs on us and would try to get close to other parties. This 
would not be anything special, because this is also part of 
life. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Agrarian Federation Chairman Tamas Nagy by </F>
Ildiko Csuhaj; place and date not given: "All the Conditions 
Are There for Success"] 
  [Text] In the election series starting today, the leaders 
of parties that have submitted a national list are interviewed 
on their parties' program points and concepts. We asked 
Agrarian Federation Chairman Tamas Nagy about his party's image, 
its relations with the liberal parties, and how this party would 
treat the crisis of the Hungarian villages and agriculture if it 
became a force in government. 
  [Nagy] The past three or four years have been characterized 
by an unpredictable and often ill-considered amount of economic 
ideas. Only 18 percent of the world's land can be used for 
agricultural production, and good results can only be achieved 
on 9 percent of that. About 72 percent of Hungary's land 
belongs to this 9 percent. We have trained professionals. It is 
important to have a five-year agricultural-orientation plan and 
to make sure that government activity is a service activity. 
The accelerated compensation process should mean that the lands 
have been allocated and their transcription into the land 
registry is carried out. This is one of the major messages of 
the Agrarian Federation. 
  [Csuhaj] You have been calling yourself a bourgeois agrarian 
party lately. What does this mean? 
  [Nagy] It is important not to mystify the concept of 
burgher. We do not say that if one wants to be a burgher, one 
should leave his village and his profession; instead, we say 
that the village should participate in everyday life at a higher 
level. The middle-peasant class was already building bathrooms 
in their houses before the war, although there was not yet water 
in them; they were preparing, however, a more comfortable life 
for the next generation. In Germany, the word "peasant" means 
builder. In Hungary, this word has a different meaning, and we 
should break with this meaning! The first step is to have a 
political interest representation. In 1947, the Smallholders' 
Party received a historic opportunity, and this opportunity is 
here again today. Therefore, the Agrarian Federation does not 
want to represent a village elite. Our goal is to build a party 
between 1994-1998, a party that represents this concept, because 
a greater percentage of Hungarian citizens are connected to this 
concept. 
  [Csuhaj] Your party succeeded in presenting 20 territorial 
lists and 134 candidates. Have your support and position in the 
liberal bloc changed as a result? 
  [Nagy] The Agrarian Federation has increased in value. 
According to the opinion polls, 40 percent of our supporters 
voted for the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] in 1990, and 
almost 17 percent voted for the Smallholders' Party. We have a 
good chance of making it into Parliament. We are working now on 
making sure that the program of the liberal parties becomes 
known to the public during the campaign. 
  [Csuhaj] In addition to the well-known liberal parties, can 
you also think of other parties as potential partners? Such 
signals have emerged, partly about the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP], and partly about the MDF. 
  [Nagy] The MSZP alone can muster considerable power, but the 
liberal bloc together is stronger than the MSZP, and is stronger 
than the MDF and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 
together. Until the second round of the elections, the question 
is not who will ally with whom if we separate. We are still far 
from coalition talks. Four parties have agreed to work together 
to succeed in the elections. 
  [Csuhaj] Your party also calls itself a pragmatic program 
party and an ideology-free party within the liberal bloc, 
although the village people whom it mainly represents are mostly 
conservative. 
  [Nagy] It is quite easy to understand the image of the 
Agrarian Federation. We think that our effort for a change in 
the economic system is the main guideline of our program. We 
stress that the Agrarian Federation is a fresh force in 
politics; it was created by experts engaged in politics. There 
are five [number as published] issues to which we pay particular 
attention: villages, backward areas, agriculture, tourism, 
environmental protection, and intellectual resources. These are 
five breakthrough points that give our party a clear image. 
Ours is a party that does not argue and does not make a clamor; 
instead, it is engaged in real things.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Robert Pick, adjutant, state </F>
secretary, and head of the president's military office, by 
Zoltan Vereckei; place and date not given: "No One Threatens 
Hungary Militarily -- Robert Pick on the Yugoslav Crisis, Arms 
Race, Professional Army"] 
  [Text] Bombing raids rarely advance peace processes, 
because every action brings a reaction. However, these raids 
are useful for changing the balance of power and, indirectly, 
promoting agreements -- Colonel Robert Pick, adjutant, state 
secretary, and head of the president's military office, told us. 
Robert Pick spoke about the Yugoslav crisis and Hungary's 
security policy, and also said that the arms reduction talks in 
Vienna are no longer timely. 
<H5>  They Failed to Avoid Conflicts </H5>
  [Vereckei] In your opinion, the aim of the UN intervention 
was to shift the balance in favor of the Bosnians. 
  [Pick] No, the actions carried out by the NATO aircraft were 
hardly big enough to have any serious effect on the balance of 
forces in Bosnia. However, the possibility is theoretically 
open; it is true, however, that there are many unforeseeable 
difficulties hindering a larger action of this kind. 
  [Vereckei] Many people claim that a timely and more firm 
position on the part of the West could have prevented the 
escalation of this crisis. 
  [Pick] I am convinced that the conflict would not have 
developed thus far if the United Nations had taken the necessary 
steps at the appropriate time. As is well known, the United 
Nations also has the task of avoiding conflicts, keeping peace, 
and creating peace. However, they failed to prevent the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I find this to be a basic 
mistake and, although there is no peace, there are peace-keeping 
forces present. What is needed in the region is the 
establishment of peace, but this requires more troops. In my 
opinion, the establishment of peace with the help of armed 
forces is theoretically unclear as well: It is difficult to 
speak of the establishment of peace in a place where the United 
Nations appears as a third party in the conflict. It is unclear 
on whose side it can do that and with what means. 
  [Vereckei] While both the United Nations and the United 
States are trying to show determination in continuing the armed 
intervention, Russia is opposing this for many reasons. Under 
these circumstances, how determined can the United Nations 
really be? 
  [Pick] Precisely to the extent shown by the events of recent 
years and the UN security decisions. I do not think that a new 
Security Council resolution can go beyond the current tasks, all 
the more so because the Russian side would probably veto every 
such initiative. 
  [Vereckei] The AWACS debate in Hungary repeatedly flared up 
along with the air raids. It was still possible to explain the 
role of the AWACS aircraft flying in Hungarian airspace at the 
time of the downing of the Galebs, because the AWACS were only 
carrying out their task of supervising the flying ban. However, 
in the course of their latest actions, the NATO combat aircraft 
attacked ground targets in Bosnia while the reconnaissance 
aircraft were flying in Hungarian airspace. In this context, 
how can we evaluate Prime Minister Peter Boross' request that 
the AWACS aircraft leave Hungary's airspace during combat 
actions? 
  [Pick] I would remind the readers that earlier, at the first 
instance involving AWACS aircraft, Jozsef Antall wrote a letter 
to NATO in which he asked the following: If a change takes 
place in the activity of the AWACS aircraft, a change that 
exceeds the framework allowed by the Hungarian Parliament, NATO 
officials should take into consideration the fact that the 
Hungarian Parliament has to discuss this issue again. I think 
that the latest event is only the continuation of previous 
events. 
<H5>  Avoiding Air Raids in Peace Time </H5>
  [Vereckei] Obviously, Hungary's security policy situation is 
affected not only by the Yugoslav crisis, but also by every 
change taking place in our region. The recent elections in 
Ukraine ended with the victory of the pro-Russian leftist 
forces, and the voices of Russian extremists dreaming of an 
empire are becoming increasingly loud in Russia. Could all this 
represent any threat to Hungary in the foreseeable future? 
  [Pick] I am convinced that, at the moment, Hungary does not 
face any military danger. Yeltsin and the Russian Government 
have repeatedly pointed out that Russia has no aggressive 
intentions toward other countries. Therefore, the extremists do 
not represent official policy; besides, such political groups 
can also be found in other countries. At the same time, one can 
clearly see that Russia wants to continue to be a big power 
factor, and it reacts sensitively to any attempt to belittle 
this role. 
  [Vereckei] Contrary to the Vienna armed forces reduction 
agreement, Russia does not want to disarm its troops withdrawn 
from Europe; instead, Russia would send them to the Caucasus. 
Would this mean the end of the Vienna quotas? 
  [Pick] An agreement lasts as long as the balance of forces 
remains as it was at the time of the signature. This balance of 
forces has changed considerably since then: The Soviet Union 
has disintegrated and the CSFR has separated into two countries. 
If it wishes, Russia can exceed the agreements and no one can 
stop it. 
  [Vereckei] It seems increasingly certain that, in exchange 
for the outstanding Russian debt, Hungary will receive the S-300 
missiles. Although these missiles are clearly defensive 
weapons, even the MiG-29 aircraft caused concern in our region. 
Can you envisage an arms race in this region started by Hungary? 
  [Pick] If someone wants to arm himself, he will always find 
a proper excuse. Naturally, a race needs several players. 
However, no one should forget that Hungary was the only country 
to suffer an air-raid in peacetime. It is the task of the 
MiG-29 aircraft and the S-300 missiles to avoid the repetition 
of such an event. 
<H5>  Military Service Could Be Reduced </H5>
  [Vereckei] Parliamentary elections will be held in Hungary 
in a few weeks. In your opinion, could the basic elements of 
Hungary's security policy and its Army organization change 
considerably in the case of a change in government? 
  [Pick] I do not think that any essential change could take 
place. The political parties represented in parliament have 
repeatedly expressed a unity of views on major security policy 
issues. As for the Army structure, this is a scientific issue. 
The army has so far been organized within certain perimeters 
and such conditions that determine the army's organization will 
continue to exist in the future. 
  [Vereckei] One of the key issues in the debate on the Army 
was whether the parties want a professional army or one based on 
compulsory conscription. What is your position on this? 
  [Pick] The Hungarian Army cannot be reorganized into a 
professional army in the near future. Theoretically, a 
professional army always serves interventionist goals, but 
defense is a matter for the entire nation. From a military 
viewpoint, it is absolutely clear that a professional army 
cannot train the number of reserves needed to fulfill the 
requirements of adequate defense, enable the restoration of the 
original situation, and make the aggressor give up the desire 
for further attacks. At the same time, because of the shortened 
period of service and the complex military equipment, the number 
of professional soldiers needs to be increased. I would 
particularly mention the officers corps here, where the 
shortening of military service led to serious consequences. 
Disciplinary and court proceedings prove what it means when 
there is not enough time to train officers: They do not learn 
how to treat people. However, I can envisage a further decrease 
in the military service time, but this should be accompanied by 
a modernization of the training and mobilization system. 
  [Vereckei] Looking at the past four years, what was it like 
to work with the Defense Ministry and the army? 
  [Pick] Essentially, we can almost call these relations 
cloudless. 
  [Vereckei] Did you also see the taxi drivers' blockade in 
these terms? At that time, the possibility of using the Army 
also arose. 
  [Pick] No, the taxi drivers' blockade was a political issue 
and, therefore, it could not cause a conflict between the 
ministry and the president's military office. 
  [Vereckei] Other problems? 
  [Pick] Occasional professional differences of view, but 
these differences are natural within a good working relationship.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Konstantin Subchev: "States or Corridor?"] </F>
  [Text] The old joke -- "every rumor becomes a reality" -- 
has again proved its correctness. After repeated denials of 
government and presidential spokesmen that the United States and 
NATO were applying pressure on Bulgaria to agree to opening 
corridors for the "Blue Helmets" on their way to Sarajevo, it 
was eventually requested by [U.S.] Ambassador Montgomery. 
  Now Bulgaria is about to make a move in the diplomatic chess 
game. Its future existence as a sovereign state depends on this 
move. 
  Every involvement in an international conflict begins in 
such 
an innocuous manner. Along the same route in 1914-15 military 
equipment for Turkey was transported by Germany and 
Austro-Hungary through the territories of the still neutral 
Romania and Bulgaria. In addition we received a loan from 
"Diskontogesellschaft," a small territorial concession from 
Turkey, and... we ended up in 1919 with Neuilly. 
  Now history seems to be repeating itself not as a farce but 
as a new drama. This is so because if we give in to pressure, 
after NATO military equipment we will have to make the next 
logical step and allow Turkish "blue helmets" through our 
country on their way to Bosnia. Against the background of 
increasing pro-Turkish and Islamic propaganda in the mixed 
population regions in Bulgaria this would be like pouring oil on 
a fire. 
  In its modern history, Bulgaria has suffered much from 
shortsighted or simply corrupt politicians. Today the issue of 
Bulgaria being dragged into an escalating military conflict in 
former Yugoslavia is again on the agenda. This would mean only 
one thing -- a new Balkan war. 
  Montgomery's demand poses a test for our statesmen -- will 
they find the courage to sustain the principled policy of total 
noninterference in the conflict, or again jump on the bandwagon 
of the one that appears to be strong at the moment. Whether 
Bulgaria will remain a state or will become a "corridor" for 
everyone who cares to cross the country depends on the answer. 
  For us Bulgarians, only one bitter consolation will be left: 
Namely, that whoever took us as an ally or as a Vilayet [Turkish 
province] did not prosper too much....

<F P=106> [Commentary by Krasimir Tomov: "Corridor of War"] </F>
  [Text] The spectacle of government and parliament that was 
staged over the UN corridor for transporting military equipment 
for the U.S. "Blue Helmets" in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] was as touching as a soap opera. 
For all more or less informed observers it was clear that U.S. 
Ambassador William Montgomery did not waste his time during the 
days preceding the decision, and that the decision to allow the 
armored carriers to cross Bulgaria has practically been made. 
Certain sums of U.S. dollars, no more than pennies compared 
with what we lose from the Yugoslav embargo, entered the safes 
of the Bulgarian National Bank in the last two days. 
Apparently, this golden dew was a weighty argument for some 
people, even though very soon this miserable pittance will be 
returned to its original owners, without leaving a trace in the 
Bulgarian economy and finances. 
  Our multicolored parliament made an effort to utilize the 
case that it was served by the UN general secretary and his 
tacit representative in Bulgaria, Mr. Montgomery, to stage a new 
exercise in political demagogy. All the tales were told on the 
morning of 16 April. Even Mr. Savov [chairman of the Union of 
Democratic Forces parliamentary faction] was defending from the 
rostrum of parliament an employee of the U.S. Embassy. Only one 
thing remained unsaid: From where and through what channels did 
Butrus-Ghali's request for the transportation corridor come to 
Bulgaria? Through our representative at the United Nations? 
Through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Was the request sent 
straight to the government, or was it really conveyed only 
through the U.S. ambassador? 
  This directly returns us to a statement that a Russian 
politician made some 10 days ago that the international 
organization has become a branch of the U.S. State Department. 
  Indeed, Montgomery came to our country with a clearly 
announced agenda. Usually the heads of sovereign states refuse 
to accept the credentials of diplomats who come with such an 
agenda. When this did not happen to the gentleman in question, 
he obviously began to expand the range of his activity. He is 
no longer working to found ethnic parties and to pass the 
relevant constitutional amendments, (such parties exist despite 
what our Constitution says about it), but rather directly to 
turn Bulgaria into a side to the existing conflict and budding 
conflicts. 
  This is actually what Montgomery is being paid for. 
  However, it is not clear what the Bulgarian National 
Assembly 
are being paid for by the taxpayers. They are so carried away 
in their efforts to turn our country's face toward Europe, which 
they have actually replaced with the United States, that they 
forgot our country's other end. 
  Of course, there always is the possibility that they could 
not care less. In this case we recommend that they read "The 
Life and Suffering of Sinner Sofroniy" by Sofroniy Vrachanski 
[describing the plight of the Bulgarian people under Turkish 
rule in the second half of the 18th century]. 
  To return to the UN request. The basic argument is that 
Bulgaria is the only state that has a border with Macedonia that 
is convenient for the transportation of military equipment for 
the U.S. "Blue Helmets" in Macedonia. A brief glance at the map 
shows that the Greek-Macedonian border is no less convenient, 
and that the military equipment could be transported to Greece 
by sea. However, even though the Greeks are NATO members, they 
refuse to do this. They suspect that behind the armored carriers 
of the UN convoy there is Antalya smoke and also that particular 
article of the Macedonian Constitution that claims territories 
now outside Macedonia's borders. Perhaps the Greeks crossed the 
borders of prudence with their rallies and economic blockades, 
but the Bulgarian politicians must be aware of our history and 
remember how in 1912-13 (after the victory over Turkey) that 
particular territory [Macedonia], created by the Berlin 
Congress, was divided among Greece, Serbia, and Bulgaria. 
Whether it was just or not is another question, but even if we 
start singing again "Allies-Robbers" [patriotic song of the 
Balkan wars], the banal fact remains that this particular 
article of the Macedonian Constitution also applies to the Pirin 
region. Let us remember that Ambassador Montgomery specifically 
promised the Senate commission to work for the establishment of 
a Macedonian party in Bulgaria. 
  All the rest -- for example, the international commitments 
officially assumed by our country -- is empty talk. Nowhere in 
those commitments is it said that we should allow any troops, 
arms, or military equipment through Bulgarian territory. 
  The truth is that the UN could transport those wretched 20 
or 
so vehicles with a few short flights of Hercules aircraft. This 
would be hardly more expensive than, for example, that senseless 
military action in Somalia. And let us not forget that Bulgaria 
also participates in the financing of the United Nations, in 
accordance with its modest means. 
  The truth is that the establishment of a precedent was 
sought. Now it exists. After the armored carriers of the U.S. 
"Blue Helmets" there will come the tanks of the Turkish "Blue 
Helmets." And afterward why not Turkish battalions? Such things 
have happened in history, but apparently it does not exist for 
politicians. 
  Thus the corridor of war already exists. May God and 
Montgomery save us!

<F P=106> [Interview with Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Valentin </F>
Karabashev by Svetlana Krusteva; place and date not given: 
"Government Should Work Much More as a Team"] 
  [Excerpts] [Krusteva] Mr. Karabashev, when interviewed in 
the hospital, Professor Berov explained that he had appointed 
Matinchev as his successor because during that period you had 
foreign trips planned. What changes would you make to the 
present government if you were able to? 
  [Karabashev] In principle, especially at the present 
juncture, a government should be much more of a team. I would 
increase the degree of team work. Team spirit is enhanced when 
the views of the individual ministers on the main issues are 
closely similar. Naturally, arguments must occur from time to 
time, but nonetheless as far as economic policy is concerned, 
ministers should not have radically opposed views. A cabinet is 
not a parliament, it is a government that has to work as a team. 
  [Krusteva] Journalists have stated that the most important 
recent piece of news was Dr. Zhelev's statement in which he 
withdrew his confidence in the government. The president 
motivated this decision by leveling accusations against the 
cabinet. Which of his charges do you accept and which do you 
not? 
  [Karabashev] I would prefer not to analyze what the 
president said. As a citizen of the country and as president, 
he is fully entitled to make his own assessment of the 
government's work. It is another matter whether his confidence 
or lack of confidence has ethical or political grounds, but his 
statement has no particular importance as far as it concerns the 
cabinet's future, which depends solely on parliament. 
  I believe that the president was largely incorrect on 
privatization. In fact, Ms. Indzhova has invested and is 
investing great efforts in speeding up the privatization 
process. I am trying to help her within my powers, because she 
is in fact the one who under the law is able to implement the 
privatization. The numerous attacks against me claiming that 
this process is not proceeding fast enough show that these 
critics have not read the Privatization Act. 
  As deputy prime minister, I have no direct functions 
concerning privatization, I cannot make any decisions, nor can I 
carry them out. This is the task of the individual ministers 
and, first and foremost, the Privatization Agency. As minister 
of trade, I think that I am fulfilling my functions. Mine is 
the only ministry that fulfilled its privatization program in 
1993, and it will fulfill it in 1994 as well. [passage omitted] 
  [Krusteva] Your party's leader, Prof. Nikolay Vasilev, has 
stated that you are the only member of the cabinet who is trying 
to carry through the privatization. Who is stopping you from 
doing this? 
  [Karabashev] Krustyu Petkov asked me the same question. I 
have mentioned before the factors that are hindering me, 
including personal ones. Now I would like to give a very 
concrete example, something that I have not done until now, and 
which I am telling your newspaper for the first time. You 
probably recall the big arguments about the "Karabashev" and 
"Berov" privatization models during the summer of 1993, more 
than eight months ago. If the so-called "Karabashev" model had 
been adopted, the situation would be very different now. My 
project provided for a specific number of enterprises to be 
included in investment funds of holdings before the changes, and 
a dispute arose about the name. The management of these 
holdings was to be placed on a financial and economic basis, to 
make them much more independent of the state. After the first 
results of the activities of the holding companies had been 
reported -- which would be now, in April 1994, by passing the 
law one could then go ahead with privatizing these funds or 
holding companies. However, this was not done. Instead, we 
adopted a compromise version, and now, even if the Privatization 
Act is amended, this program, which will take a long time to 
complete, will be launched only as of now. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Petya Vladimirova: "Parliament Holds Key"] </F>
  [Text] In addition to being a test for our medicine, the 
new illness of our prime minister will also be a test for the 
Bulgarian politicians. More precisely, it will provide the last 
opportunity to assess their real stature. It will highlight 
their sense of responsibility toward the state in the near 
future. It will clearly show their concern for our national 
fate, regardless of their verbal declarations and oaths. Their 
morals will become obvious and we will finally see whether they 
still have a certain responsibility to "the voters," or whether 
they have really sunk in the mire of their insurmountable 
selfishness and corporate-party greed. 
  If the suspicion about Professor Berov's illness is 
confirmed, it would mean that he will be absent for at least six 
months. This means that our state will find itself in the 
paradoxical situation in which it is led by a government without 
a leader, who is the only one authorized to adopt strategic 
decisions. The reshuffle planned for a long time by the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and the other parliamentary 
groups will fail to materialize. Indeed, the differences in the 
concealed goals of those parliamentary groups are so great that 
even if the prime minister was healthy this reshuffle could not 
have been carried out without the powerful partner from the left 
making his preferences known. 
  The reshuffle will fail to materialize because it is immoral 
to pressurize a sick prime minister to "repair" his cabinet 
under the dictation of politicians who are pursuing their own or 
their parties' interests. However, according to Ahmed Dogan, 
the "prime minister had the willingness to rule," and it is 
expected of him that he will show this willingness by accepting 
the ideas of personnel changes that will be submitted to him 
while he lies in his hospital bed. The BSP intends to discuss 
the situation. One should not wonder if the new situation that 
emerged would serve the BSP better than the situation of having 
a healthy prime minister. This way his deputy, Matinchev, will 
remain as acting prime minister very conveniently for a long 
period of time. On 13 April he clearly stated that Professor 
Berov should rest, and that he should leave the governing to him 
and his colleagues. Since the Constitution does not provide a 
solution, what Matinchev said could become Bulgaria's reality in 
the next few months. 
  If our politicians have preserved in themselves at least a 
small measure of responsibility and statesmanship the parliament 
should pass a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet because of 
the new circumstances rather than providing it with the straw of 
the international agreements, used to justify its staying in 
power. 
  If Prime Minister Berov is really concerned with the 
efficient ruling of the country, he must resign and thus prove 
that he is the master of his own will. 
  The rest is merely irresponsibility at the expense of the 
people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Nikolay Vasilev, chairman of the </F>
Alternative Social Liberal Party, ASP, by Lyubimka Naydenova of 
the Balkan Agency; place and date not given: "ASP Will Withdraw 
From Government Unless Privatization Starts"] 
  [Text] [Naydenova] Professor Vasilev, at the last meeting 
of the ASP [Alternative Social Liberal Party] Executive Council, 
did you discuss possible cabinet changes? Did anyone propose 
that Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev should replace 
Prof. Berov? 
  [Vasilev] The ASP Executive Council discussed actions that 
the government in its present form should undertake to speed up 
privatization -- which is the sole condition for the cabinet's 
survival. We give the cabinet one last chance to sign the new 
agreement with the international financial institutions. This 
can happen before the beginning of June, but only if the process 
of privatization is really started. The measures we are 
recommending to the ministerial team will enable it to save its 
own skin. Unfortunately, the people in Bulgaria who know how to 
govern receive no support to do just this. We do not envisage a 
cabinet reshuffle, and have not proposed anyone for prime 
minister. At the very least, it is improper to do this before 
Prof. Berov has completely restored his state of health. 
However, we set the present cabinet team one emphatic 
condition: Either it should elucidate what powers the ministers 
have for launching the privatization, or we will bear no 
responsibility for the failure of the government's program. 
They must untie Valentin Karabashev's hands to permit him to 
act within his delegated sphere of responsibility, or else we 
will withdraw our representatives from this cabinet. 
  [Naydenova] Why do the ASP experts think that the 
privatization process has failed to move from its stalemate 
position, given that parliament recently passed the 
Privatization Act and that, at the very outset when it was 
formed, the government stated its firm intention to apply this 
law. 
  [Vasilev] The law is a matter with which our own party team 
has been concerned, and it is not a bad basis for real actions. 
It needs to be amended, but can operate even in its present 
form. The launch of privatization is being postponed because 
real economic groupings (not the ones that occupy the front 
pages of the newspapers) are not yet ready to take part in it, 
so they are delaying the process by all possible means. To this 
one must add the lack of readiness on the part of the labor 
collectives in the enterprises that are likely to be privatized, 
as well as the vast bureaucratic administration that is being 
deliberately maintained and makes the process much more 
difficult. The ASP believes that the mass and market 
privatizations should be launched simultaneously, but one cannot 
expect any quick results from the former during the next few 
months, or even the next few years. 
  [Naydenova] Do you think that the cabinet can work as a team 
in its present form? 
  [Vasilev] Unfortunately, the formula according to which the 
government was formed was incorrect from the very outset. At 
the beginning of its term in office, there were perhaps some 
faint signs of team action, but since the middle of last year 
the confrontation between the different tendencies within the 
cabinet have become quite evident. The cabinet's work has 
stalled. The ASP cannot be responsible for the fact that its 
representatives in the cabinet are prevented from doing their 
jobs. We cannot assume responsibility for the actions and 
inaction of Matinchev, for example. The country needs a 
government of political responsibility.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Mincho Minchev, chairman of the "Marxist </F>
Platform" Ideological Union in the Bulgarian Socialist Party, by 
Magdalina Andonova; place and date not given: "We Oppose the 
Uncritical Acceptance of Social Democracy"] 
  [Excerpts] [Andonova] On the basis of its contents, the 
draft program of your ideological union is described as the most 
leftist one in comparison with the other draft programs. Do you 
oppose the draft program of the Strategic Center led by 
Aleksandur Lilov? 
  [Minchev] It is true that our draft of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] program could be described as the most 
leftist one of all those submitted. However, this does not mean 
that it is supported only by the leftist periphery of the party. 
On the contrary, we are convinced that it is closest to the 
understandings of the majority of Socialists. 
  Nevertheless, we think that the document of the Strategic 
Center is the basic one. With its openness to most different 
ideas it could unite the party at present and preserve it as a 
whole. Our draft is not an alternative but rather a correction 
to the "Lilov" draft. [passage omitted] 
  [Andonova] Are you trying to save Marxism from oblivion, or 
have you discovered new elements of this teaching? 
  [Minchev] Marxism does not need to be saved. It has not 
been forgotten by any serious political scientist in the West. 
Without the Marxist methodology it is impossible to analyze the 
contemporary social processes or forecast the future. 
  [Andonova] Very briefly, what are the basic tenets of your 
draft program for the BSP? 
  [Minchev] First -- overcoming the social crisis and ensuring 
a new national upsurge in Bulgaria are unthinkable without 
restoring socialism. 
  Second -- For this we do not merely need an alliance of the 
left and center parties, but rather to win the support of a 
great part of the working people in Bulgaria. 
  Third -- We must turn the BSP into a modern Marxist party, 
which takes into consideration the changes that have taken place 
in the world and the new social realities, without relinquishing 
the basic goal -- implementing the civilized socialist plan of 
social development. 
  [Andonova] To what will you never agree regarding the 
positions of your opponents in the party? 
  [Minchev] Those are the people who propose to turn the BSP 
into a typical social democratic party with all its attributes 
(which have been rejected by the time). The changes that took 
place in Europe and the world after 1989 were an expression not 
only of the crisis of the Communist Parties, but also of the 
crisis of the social democratic parties. I find it strange that 
there are people in the BSP who think that since "the fall of 
communism" the parties of the social democratic type have 
triumphed. This is not true! Those parties are also in the 
middle of a great crisis! 
  We oppose the uncritical and total acceptance of the parties 
of the social democratic type as a model for the change in the 
BSP simply because parties of this type are frozen in their 
development at the 1951 level, when the Stockholm Declaration of 
the Socialist International was adopted. 
  Since then the world has changed beyond recognition. During 
this period there was real socialism in the East European 
countries and it is political infantilism to ignore this fact. 
  Something new must be sought. We could find it only if we 
move forward and continue our struggle.

<F P=106> [Article by Alvin Hazizaj: "Change in the Concept of </F>
Murder"] 
  [Text] The Justice Ministry has just given internal 
approval in principle to the draft of the new penal code. This 
draft code has been prepared by a group of lawyers known as the 
Codification Directorate. The completion of the draft civil 
code has been followed by the draft penal code, which will soon 
go to the government for approval and subsequently to the 
Albanian parliament. Before this draft code goes to the 
government, it has been sent for discussion, by order of 
Minister Cela, to the Higher Appeal Court, the 
procurator-general, the Public Order Ministry, and the Tirana 
Law Faculty. The aim is to sound out the views of specialists 
in the field and to apply as closely as possible the Law on 
Basic Human Rights and Freedoms and all the international acts 
that Albania has signed. 
  This draft code has gone to pains to preserve the categories 
of the existing Penal Code, which came into effect in 1977 and 
led to serious consequences in the unfair conviction of a huge 
number of Albanians. However, the group preparing it has tried 
to change some things. For instance, the old code was divided 
into chapters, but now we have headings. The new idea of 
sections has also been added. The old code had 250 articles in 
all, whereas the new one has been able to provide for a series 
of crimes that were unknown under the old order. 
  The draft penal code is divided into two parts, one general 
and one particular. The general part describes the basic 
principles of Albanian penal justice, in which one is struck by 
the inclusion of the punishments of iife imprisonment and fines. 
This latter is a new notion in criminal justice, as far as 
crimes are concerned. The code provides for fines of between 
5,000 and 1 million leks for crimes and between 1,000 and 
100,000 leks for misdemeanors. The general part includes 73 
articles assembled under eight headings, compared to the 42 
articles of the existing code. 
  As for the part on the particulars of the code, it must be 
said that the group has been at great pains to include all the 
different varieties of crime that have occurred in recent years 
and which are expected to occur in the future. 
  This part begins with the heading on crimes against human 
life and concludes with crimes affecting free elections and the 
democratic electoral system. The 254 articles are assembled 
under 10 headings, with many special sections. Under the first 
heading of this part, which deals with crimes against human 
life, one is struck by the new division of murder into 
premeditated murder and wilful murder. This is a new notion 
that was not present in the previous code, but the new code does 
not explain the distinction between these two. 
  In another section, the age of 14 remains the limit for the 
notion of acts of indecency. Despite the changes that have 
taken place in Albania, and are still occurring, not all of them 
have found a place in this draft code. For instance, 
homosexuality continues to be prosecuted as an act of indecency, 
at a time when many European states allow homosexuals to marry 
freely. There are special articles forbidding pornography, 
including the creation of conditions for pornography and the 
import, publication, and sale of pornographic material. 
  A new section has been opened to cover crimes against 
freedom 
of religion. We now find three articles defending what the 1976 
Constitution and other laws forbade. There are also new kinds 
of crime and special sections in the area of bankruptcy and 
crimes against the environment. 
  What is most striking in this draft code is the special 
protection given to state personalities. Thus Heading 8 covers 
"crimes aimed against the authority of the state." The chairmen 
of the parliament and government and the president himself are 
named as the highest authorities. Thus Articles 169-170 state 
that "Insulting the president of the Republic is punishable by 
two years' imprisonment or a fine, and an insult in public by 
between six months' and three years' imprisonment. Slander 
against the president is punishable by three to five years' 
inprisonment. There is thus special protection for the figure 
of the head of state. [no concluding quotation marks as 
published] 
  Thus it is hoped that the new draft penal code, completed on 
10 March 1994, will soon pass to the government for approval and 
thence to the parliament. There only remains the final word 
from the specialists of the institutions to whom the draft has 
been passed. Its approval as soon as possible is of pressing 
urgency.

<F P=106> [Article by Emin Barci: "The Banking System -- Time for </F>
Changes"] 
  [Text] I was prompted to write this article by a 
conversation with an angry businessman who was being put through 
a rigmarole in the hall of the Tirana bank. He was trying to 
pay a duty of several million leks to the customs office of 
another district. He possessed the money, but was in a fix. 
The problem was that this money was on deposit in foreign 
currency. This created two problems: If he paid through his 
account, he would have to incur a severe loss because the bank 
used one exchange rate and the customs duty calculated on the 
basis of another used on the parallel market. The second problem 
arose as a result of trying to solve the first. He tried to 
withdraw the required sum in foreign currency, but was faced 
with the fact that he could not withdraw more than $5,000 a day. 
The entire sum that he was required to pay would take weeks. 
  This is only one of the many problems one encounters in the 
banking system today. One very serious weakness is the failure 
to use classic banking documents that the world has used for 
centuries. One of these is the check. Checks are not used for 
foreign currency withdrawals. They are replaced by a standard 
white form called a "foreign currency withdrawal request" that 
records the sum and is signed and stamped by the applicant. 
There is of course no question of such documents as bank 
guarantees, internal letters of credit, etc. The existence of 
bank guarantees or internal letters of credit would greatly 
accelerate the movement of money. There would no longer be any 
need for people to carry briefcases full of money, which often 
leads to the murder of businessmen: Instead, the briefcase 
could contain a single piece of paper that becomes valid when 
the seller and purchaser come to an agreement. Moreover, the 
existence of such documents, in cases where the purchaser 
receives the goods before paying, gives the seller security and 
stops him bothering the purchaser. The existence of such 
documents would greatly ease the work of customs and tax 
offices. Such a practice would then lead to money that has 
accumulated in pockets and bags being put on deposit, which 
would improve control over the money supply and develop credit 
policy. 
  Let us consider the latter for a moment. There is 
dissatisfaction on both sides over this. Clients complain that 
credit is still very tight, and that obtaining a loan involves a 
great deal of time, bureaucracy, and, why not, in many cases 
bribes. Meanwhile, the banks for their part also complain of 
irregularities on the part of borrowers, who fail to observe 
repayment schedules or do not pay the loan back at all. The 
banks' complaints extend to the courts, which fail to repossess 
properties mortgaged by borrowers. 
  Deposits now earn 20 percent interest a year, compared with 
32 percept last year. This 12 percent fall is explained by the 
decline in inflation. However, both ordinary people and 
businessmen think differently. They think that, in comparison 
with one year ago, one can buy fewer goods and services with the 
same amount of money. For ordinary people, this means higher, 
not lower inflation. Bank specialists have a different opinion. 
They argue that an interest rate of 32 percent was artificial 
and was forced on them in order to attract money to the bank. 
Once this aim was achieved, the problem was how to pay this 
rate of interest. The main way to do so was by granting credit. 
However, at a time when there was little domestic investment, 
this credit was only short-term, and part of it was never 
returned. Under such circumstances, the simplest response was 
to lower the level of interest on deposits. However, the main 
problem with interest rates is that they are artificial and are 
of an administrative nature. As long as securities genuinely 
tied to a real estate market do not exist one cannot talk about 
the cost of money or, as a result, of a real interest rate that 
responds to supply and demand for the lek. 
  The final point concerns bank secrecy, which is one of the 
most vital elements for the existence and growth of the banking 
system. There are suspicions that the state administration 
interferes in our banking system through the State Control 
Commission, the Financial Police, the National Intelligence 
Service, and the Investigator's Office. Perhaps a special law 
should be drafted for this, clearly laying down the 
circumstances under which deposits can be inspected. These 
occasions, like the organs so authorized, should be as few and 
serious as possible.

  [Text] Luxembourg, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The Ministerial 
Council of the European Union (E.U.) on Monday appealed for a 
ceasefire in and around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The E.U. condemns the Bosnian Serbs' continuing attacks on 
Gorazde, assessing this as a U.N. Security Council resolution 
violation, and urges an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in 
Gorazde and around it, a statement released by the council said, 
and that Serb forces which are threatening the security of 
Gorazde withdraw. This will enable the deployment of U.N. 
troops in the town itself between the two warring sides, said 
the statement. 
  The Bosnian Serb authorities reported on Monday that Serb 
forces would remain outside the 3-km zone on the left bank of 
the Drina near Gorazde and were willing to agree to the 
immediate deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops 
there. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources have said that Moslem forces 
on 
the front around Gorazde renewed attacks on Serb positions early 
on Monday morning, firing from mortars placed in the center of 
the town, and heavy machine-guns located in the high-rise 
residence of the UNPROFOR. 
  Bosnian Serb Assembly President Momilo Krajisnik on Monday 
denied claims that Serb forces were shelling Gorazde and trying 
to take the town, underscoring that the Serb side had ceased all 
military activities around Gorazde. 
  Gorazde was to have been demilitarized long ago as a U.N. 
designated "safe haven," but, instead of demilitarization, more 
than 10,000 Moslem troops concentrated in this enclave and 
launched a heavy offensive on Serb territories in late March. 
The Bosnian Serb army strongly answered the attacks. 
  The Ministerial Council statement set out that a ceasefire 
agreement on Gorazde should be closely followed by a general 
ceasefire agreement for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would 
again be an opening to talks on a political solution. 
  The E.U. calls on all those nations which promised 
additional 
forces to secure their arrival in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as 
possible. 
  The E.U. ministers also called on greater diplomatic efforts 
by the international community, including the U.N., E.U., U.S. 
and Russia, to step up diplomatic actions to secure the 
convergence of their initiatives and lead as soon as possible to 
talks between the three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- 
Moslems, Serbs and Croats. 
  The statement said that all captured U.N. staff should be 
released immediately, and that unlimited and unhindered freedom 
of movement should be enabled in agreement with U.N. 
resolutions. Humanitarian efforts and free passage through Serb 
territory for humanitarian convoys for Gorazde and elswehere in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina must be renewed, it was underscored. The 
Bosnian Serb authorities said on Monday that they would 
guarantee freedom of movement to all humanitarian workers in its 
entire territory and police units will escort all convoys for 
their security. 
  The E.U. called on all its members who are also members of 
the U.N. Security Council, to support the adoption, without 
delay, of a resolution in support of the listed objectives.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Martin Danes; </F>
place and date not given: "Intermediate Steps Toward European 
Union Membership Should Be Economic"] 
  [Text] [Danes] Hungary formally applied to join the 
European Union [EU] a few days ago. Poland followed Hungary's 
suit on Friday [8 April]. Why is the Czech Republic not 
planning to take such a step? The results of economic 
transformation in the Czech Republic are comparable, to say the 
least, with the results of these two countries.... 
  [Klaus] I know well that there is no opportunity, 
possibility, or room in the EU today to deal seriously with 
those applications. In my opinion, these applications will 
simply lie around. The Community has made it repeatedly clear 
that the very first possibility to even start considering such a 
move would be after the EU's general conference in 1996. 
Therefore, I see no reason for us to engage in some hasty 
activities precisely at this moment. 
  [Danes] One of the arguments used by Hungarian politicians 
[for applying now] is that they are interested in so-called 
partial membership, the possible establishment of which is 
indicated by some voices coming from the EU. Such partial 
membership should include only the political dimension. What is 
your view regarding the issue of partial membership? 
  [Klaus] I repeat that, in contrast to some other 
politicians, including Czech politicians, I am in favor of some 
intermediary steps leading to membership. I believe that a 
certain vacuum between associate membership and full membership 
will have to be filled by some new initiatives. Nevertheless, I 
do not share the view appearing in those proposals that these 
initiatives should be political and security-oriented first and 
only then economic. I think, in fact, that it should be 
precisely the other way around. 
  [Danes] The first round of the second wave of coupon 
privatization begins on Monday [11 April]. Although no dates 
have been fixed thus far, do you think that the whole process, 
up to the issuance of shares to the participants, will be 
shorter than in the case of the first wave? 
  [Klaus] I think so. All participants have become trained in 
some practices, and even the method of calculation, the 
algorithms, the manner of issuance of shares, and the like have 
changed somewhat. I therefore believe that the whole process 
could be cut short. Although I am not going to argue about 
hours, days, or weeks, I am convinced that everything should be 
definitely over before this year is out.

  [Text] Prague--A feasible time for us to join NATO would 
be after 1996, when the first stage of the transformation of our 
Army is completed. This is what Vladimir Suman, chairman of the 
Defense and Security Committee, told the CESKY DENIK 
correspondent after meeting [NATO representatives] Loic Bouvard 
and Peter Corterier. Furthermore, according to him, it is in 
NATO's interest that a country with our strategic location and 
economic stability become a member. Suman said that the NATO 
representatives' assessment of our republic was unequivocally 
favorable. Only Partnership for Peace will test our specific 
military ability to cooperate with the NATO armies and the 
possibility of joining this structure. In his opinion, the 
security development in Europe may electrify the situation.

the Movement of Retired People for Social Security decided to 
transform itself into a political party--Pensioners for Social 
Securities. This change will not reportedly have any impact on 
the political line and the party's decision to fight on behalf

<F P=106> [Article by Antonin Jilecek: "The Development of the Czech </F>
Republic's Economy in February 1994"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of 1994, there was a slight 
recovery in construction output and in several industrial 
sectors. The Czech Republic's overall industrial production 
fell by 3 percent in February and 1.6 percent in the 
January/February period, compared with the same periods in 1993. 
Output in small enterprises with up to 24 employees increased 
by 23.7 percent within two months, while, in other enterprises, 
it declined by 3.9 percent. The output of the paper industry, 
printing, and publishing companies increased by 15.3 percent, of 
the coke plants and the refinery industry 9.6 percent, of the 
chemical and pharmaceutical industry 3.3 percent, and of the 
food and spice industry 3 percent. 
  The number of employees declined by 5.5 percent in January 
and February against the same period a year ago. The average 
monthly wage reached 5,899 korunas [Kc], 11.1 percent higher in 
this period. 
  Construction output increased by 3.3 percent in February 
1993 
and by 7.7 percent since the beginning of the year, compared 
with the same period last year. The increment in construction 
output this year has been secured by companies with 25 or more 
employees. The number of employees increased by 1.3 percent in 
February, compared with the same period last year. Their 
average monthly wage reached Kc6,371, an increase of 11.8 
percent. 
  The volume of goods transported by the railroads has 
increased by 14.8 percent since the beginning of the year, 
compared with the January-to-February 1993 period. Bus 
transportation increased by 4.5 percent and river transportation 
by 4.8 percent, but the number of passengers continued to 
decline. 
  Compared with the January-to-February 1993 period, the 
number 
of slaughter poultry declined by 30.7 percent, slaughter cattle 
by 6.3 percent, milk by 7 percent, and eggs by 8 percent. The 
sale of slaughter pigs increased by 3.6 percent. 
  Owing to the increase in prices for animal products, prices 
for agricultural products increased by 1 percent overall in 
February 1993, compared with February 1994. 
  The price increase in February was minimal (0.2 percent 
against January), and food prices fell by 0.2 percent. In the 
service sector, the price of water and sewage disposal increased 
by 0.7 percent. Compared with February 1993, prices were 
generally up 10.3 percent. Prices for services rose 19.5 
percent, nonfood products 11.6 percent, public catering 6 
percent, and food 4.5 percent. 
  According to preliminary results, the overall volume of 
exports (in prices including cost, insurance, and freight to the 
borders of the buyer) rose by Kc51.1 billion, 6.6 percent higher 
than in the same period last year. Exports to Slovakia declined 
by 15.5 percent. Exports to European Free Trade Association 
countries and developing countries, in particular, have 
increased. 
  Imports in the first two months reached Kc50.2 billion and 
were 26.4 percent higher than in the same period last year. 
Imports from Slovakia fell by 3.1 percent. 
  In two months, the trade balance showed a surplus of Kc0.9 
billion, and Kc1.4 billion with Slovakia.

  [Text] Serbian forces have detained two more UN military 
observers from Indonesia serving in Sarajevo. This brings to six 
the total number of Indonesian military observers detained by 
the Serbs. 
  A press release issued by the Indonesian Armed Forces 
headquarters in Jakarta said the six Indonesian observers are 
Major (Didi Sumardi), Major (Muhiddin), Major (Toto Sudarto), 
Major (Dwi Istianto), Major (B. Irawan), and Captain (Suryawan). 
They are in good condition but are not allowed to leave their 
post. 
  In addition to the Indonesian officers, UN observers from 
Bangladesh, the Netherlands, and Jordan have also been detained 
by the Serbs. Efforts to free them are now being made by the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander and UN officials by 
holding talks with the Serbian and Russian officials.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- Serb forces Sunday [17 
April] released 19 UN peacekeepers who had been held hostage for 
three days at a barracks at Ilijas, north of here, a UN 
spokesman said in the Bosnian capital. 
  The peacekeepers were freed at 1:35 p.m. (1135 GMT), said 
Major Eric Chaperon. 
  The troops, 16 Canadian peacekeepers and three military 
observers of unspecified nationality, were due to return to 
their post at Cifluk, 19 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of 
Sarajevo, Chaperon said. 
  They had been deployed there to monitor seven Serb mortar 
and 
two anti-aircraft cannons. 
  The batteries had been retained in Cifluk in violation of 
the 
February accord under which Bosnian Serbs agreed to withdraw all 
heavy weapons from a 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone 
around the Bosnian capital under threat of North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation air strikes. 
  Bosnian Serb forces still detained or blocked Sunday 
hundreds 
of United Nations peacekeepers in several Serb-held sectors of 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Almond: "We Came To Keep Peace, Not Fight a </F>
War, Says Rose"] 
  [Text] "You do not fight a war in white vehicles," said the 
UN Commander in Bosnia, Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, yesterday as he 
considered his possible responses to the situation in Gorazde. 
  "I do not believe we are in the business of going to war in 
order to create conditions of peace. And I don't think either 
the world or the contributing nations would accept that." 
  With Gorazde "on the edge of a major humanitarian disaster", 
as he told BBC Radio 4, and with the Serbs pouring shells into 
the town at the rate of one every 20 seconds, Gen Rose has few 
options -- short of "going to war" -- to stop the Serbs doing 
what they want. 
  The pressures on him are immense. Bringing to the job the 
authority and background to take a more robust approach to 
delivering aid he succeeded far beyond expectations, both in 
brokering a ceasefire between Croats and Muslims and in forcing 
the removal of Serb guns around Sarajevo. 
  But the pressures that defeated his three predecessors were 
always present and are currently defeating him. White-painted 
vehicles cannot be used for combat. 
  His main problem has been to distinguish between the UN 
Security Council resolution that created a "safe area" around 
Gorazde and other enclaves and one that calls for the protection 
of UN personnel if they come under attack. He indicated 
yesterday he remains torn between the two. 
  "I am responsible for the lives of 15,500 young men and 
women 
here who have been sent here as peacekeepers, not to fight a 
war," he said in Sarajevo. "My responsibility is to them as much 
as it is to the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The threat of air strikes succeeded around the safe haven of 
Sarajevo, but Gorazde required close air support operations that 
were quite different. 
  Instead of the precision strike aircraft that Nato had 
planned to use in operations against artillery and command 
bunkers around Sarajevo, Gen Rose could only call on available 
"cab rank" close air support aircraft to attack opportunity 
targets around Gorazde. 
  The Serbs had the advantage of time and place in their 
attacks: the Nato pilots were handicapped by bad weather, and by 
rules of engagement that require positive visual identification 
of specific tanks or guns threatening UN personnel directly. 
  American pressures to make no distinction between defending 
UN personnel and protecting safe areas -- as stated by Mr Warren 
Christopher, Secretary of State, a week ago -- appeared to 
confuse the UN. 
  While officials at the Nato air headquarters in Italy 
pressed 
for a wide-scale bombing campaign to stop Serb tanks, Gen Rose 
was pressed by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN Secretary-General's 
special representative, to use close air support strikes only 
when absolutely necessary. 
  Mr Akashi won. Gen Rose was reminded that he is a UN officer 
on a peace-making mission. The resulting close air support 
actions were too little and too late. 
  While properly prepared air strikes could still check the 
Serbs, largely with American aircraft, Gen Rose knows that the 
Bosnian Serbs still have more than 100 UN hostages, with 
opportunities for grabbing others, and that he has very little 
hope of getting more troops to reinforce his peacemaking 
efforts. 
  Yesterday, he could only hope that the Serbs will be 
merciful 
in their victory at Gorazde. 
  "I very much hope the situation will slowly return to 
normality, that we can prevent a humanitarian disaster around 
Gorazde and we can then go back to what we're supposed to be 
doing here and that is helping to return this country to peace 
and normality," he said. 
  Deflated and without his usual bounce, Gen Rose sounded 
bitter at the duplicity and treachery of the Bosnian Serb 
leadership. 
  ``It is a very sad day for the world when peace-keeping is 
used as a cover for the prosecution of war aims in such a 
blatant fashion. The assurances that were given repeatedly 
during the peace talks over the last week to people like Mr 
Akashi, and indeed to Mr Churkin (the Russian envoy) have been 
totally ignored. 
  "We now arrive at a very very sad situation indeed. However, 
you do have to put that against our overall mandate here in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is obviously a force for peace. And if 
you look at what has been achieved in central Bosnia and in and 
around Sarajevo you will find that life is slowly returning to 
normal." 
  His options to help Gorazde now are limited to trying to get 
medical help to the town. But even in that Gen Rose said he 
depended on the agreement of the Serbs to let casualty 
evacuation convoys in. The Serbs, he said, did not advise it 
"for the moment," and he admitted it may be another day or two 
before they do.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 18 (AFP) -- Serb forces pounded 
away at Gorazde Monday, ignoring their latest ceasefire 
announcement, the Red Cross and UN officials said. 
  The UN peacekeeping force here reported tank, artillery and 
sniper fire on the mainly Moslem town in eastern Bosnia. 
  Earlier in the day the United Nations said the Bosnian Serbs 
had agreed to an immediate ceasefire, the second in two days. 
Sunday's truce was ignored as well.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] The situation in Gorazde is extremely critical and 
dramatic. After Karadzic's fascists literally razed to the 
ground all the villages on the outskirts of town and massacred 
and burnt hundreds of people in the villages around Gorazde, 
this morning they launched a fierce onslaught from the direction 
of Foca on (Osana) and Ilovaca. Thousands of fascists are 
moving from the direction of the Praca River valley toward 
Orahovice and Zorovici. Over 50 new tanks are on the move as 
are thousands of artillery pieces. A fierce Chetnik offensive 
has been launched from the direction of (?Deseva) toward 
(?Ranje) and Ostro. 
  Dozens of the most destructive shells are landing in the 
town's center every minute. There are dozens of massacred, 
heavily wounded lying in the streets. No one can help them as 
the entire town is under heavy artillery and sniper fire. About 
700 wounded in the war hospital have been left to die since 
there is a lack of even the most basic of medicines. There are 
also no bandages. 
  At the moment of filing this report, we received the 
information that the aggressor has fired chemical agents at the 
war hospital. 
  The town of Gorazde is dying despite all the appeals and 
warnings of these people sent to domestic, European, and 
international institutions. According to the latest 
information, dozens of thousands of new refugees are heading for 
the town center. The aggressor is firing at them with mortars 
and tanks. Your correspondent from this town has no words to 
describe the horror in this area. 
  The members of our army are still courageously resisting the 
onslaught of the fascists, but the question is how long they 
will be able to endure. It is a question of hours before 
Gorazde becomes the next Vukovar.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] This morning hand-to-hand fighting is under way on 
the right bank of the Drina River. The Chetniks are also 
situated on the left side of Gorazde, at the gates to the town 
center, with a number of tanks and strong infantry forces. So 
the Chetnik occupation of Gorazde is coming to a very painful 
and tragic close for these people. An entire town and its 
people -- who were fed lies about living in a Security Council 
protected area -- is being wiped from the face of the earth, 
left to the mercy of Chetniks. 
  This morning the Chetniks are targeting the hospital area 
with chemical agents. 
  Yesterday, overnight, and this morning the mass slaughter of 
civilians on the left bank of the Drina River is continuing, not 
with knives but with shrapnel. Overnight alone thousands of 
shells were fired from Jabuka and [word indistinct] at the town 
center on both banks of the Drina River. Dozens of apartments 
were blown apart and there were many civilian casualties. The 
shells rained down only a few meters away from the headquarters 
of the UN monitors. 
  This morning six tanks and hundreds of Chetniks are 
attacking 
Gorazde from the direction of (Osanica). The attacks have also 
started on Ilovaca, Zorovici, and Bare. People are fleeing from 
these villages toward the town. And while 60,000 people are 
crowding the town center on the left bank of the Drina River, 
the Chetniks are looting and burning all the villages that have 
been emptied. Yesterday dozens of trucks arrived in Kopaci, 5 
km from Gorazde, from Priboj and other towns in Serbia and 
Montenegro, and looting is under way on a massive scale. This 
was supervised yesterday by the two brothers in crime, war 
criminals Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. They also 
toured the premises of the wire factory and [word indistinct] in 
Kopaci, which they managed to capture with the full support of 
the UN, together with the residential area [words indistinct]. 
  The mass slaughter of these people is to happen today as the 
Chetniks have already this morning activated their bloody 
artillery on the surrounding hills. The shells are again 
killing, and who knows for how long it will continue to claim 
victims among the women, children, old folk, and all those 
caught in this tiny crowded space. 
  Finally it must be made clear to the world that these 
innocent victims and the full tragedy of the people of Gorazde 
are their shame.

  [Text] According to the latest report from Gorazde, 
following last night's relative lull, this morning at about 0400 
Karadzic's Serbs launched fresh attacks on this town. Here is a 
report from Gorazde. 
  [Correspondent Fahrudin Brkic] [passage indistinct] in the 
southeast part did not stop for a single moment. There was no 
respite either in an unprecedented exodus of people from their 
burning villages. [placenames indistinct] villages were put to 
the torch by the chetniks yesterday. The aggressor's infantry 
attacks were accompanied by artillery that pounded the entire 
town and its outlying suburbs until 0200 this morning. 
  Following a brief lull, these operations resumed at about 
0400. On the 20th day of the offensive against Gorazde [word

  [Text] Cajnice, 18 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces have not 
respected the cease-fire agreement for one moment at the Gorazde 
front. Since early this morning they have been attacking the 
Serb positions and using all available infantry and artillery 
weapons, the command of the [Srpska] Herzegovina Corps said 
today. 
  The fiercest Muslim attacks have been launched from the Baba 
and Kik hills about 5-6 km southwest of Gorazde on the left bank 
of the Drina. The attacks are aimed at the villages of Bachci 
and Lalete. 
  According to the command of the Herzegovina Corps, it is 
obvious that the Muslims are trying to break through along the 
Drina toward the Foca area. In this way they want to draw in 
the Serb units in the area in order to relieve the right bank of 
the Drina and regain the territories lost on Saturday and Sunday. 
  Serb positions on Biserna hill above Gorazde on the right 
bank of the Drina were fiercely targeted from the town today. 
The heaviest fire is coming from a five-story building in the 
town center where the United Nations has been accommodated. UN 
representatives are on the fifth floor of the building, while 
the Muslims have deployed a heavy machinegun on the fourth floor 
and an antiaircraft gun on the third floor. 
  Heavy fire can be heard from the area around the bus 
station. 
Muslims are targeting Serb positions with 82-mm mortars deployed 
behind the UN Protection Force building. 
  According to Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic from the command of 
the Herzegovina Corps, the Serb forces are responding only when 
they have to protect themselves. He claims that the Muslims 
razed 400 houses in the Serb village of Sopotnica, which was 
liberated yesterday.

  [Excerpts] Cajnice, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic army 
positions on the right bank of the Drina River have been under 
fierce Muslim fire from Gorazde since yesterday, despite the 
cease-fire agreement signed by Radovan Karadzic and Yasushi 
Akashi two days ago, the command of the Herzegovina Corps 
reports. [passage omitted] 
  Serb military sources point out that all residential 
buildings in Gorazde, including the buildings of international 
humanitarian organizations, are in fact fortresses from which 
fire is being directed toward Serb positions. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 17 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs agreed 
Sunday to the deployment of a 336-member international buffer 
force in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, UN spokesman Major Dacre 
Halloway said Sunday. 
  He said the agreement was reached earlier between UN special 
envoy Yasushi Akashi and Serb authorities meeting in nearby 
Pale, stronghold of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. 
  Under it, the multinational force -- more than half of whose 
members are French -- will be allowed to move around freely in 
Gorazde and helicopters will be able to fly to, in, and around 
the enclave, the spokesman said. 
  Deployment of the force was one of the conditions Akashi set 
earlier for resuming peace negotiations in Pale. 
  The force, composed of 170 Frenchmen, 66 Ukrainians, 50 
Egyptians and 50 British, has been on alert at Sarajevo airport 
since Friday, ready to leave within two hours' notice of the 
signing of an agreement. 
  The Ukrainian troops are to take up position on the hills 
overlooking Gorazde, to the southeast. 
  Halloway said the French would leave first for Gorazde, 
travelling by road, and would be escorted by Bosnian Serb forces.

  [Text] Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina April 18 (A.A.) -- 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic on Monday said 
that his country has been betrayed by the United Nations, adding 
there is nothing to be done "as they (United Nations) do not 
want to do anything. The West is afraid of Russia." 
  Silajdzic said the problem lies in the fear of the West of 
Russia which wants a "greater fascist Serbia." 
  He said NATO can do whatever the United Nations wants, but 
the United Nations is not doing anything. 
  "It is a vicious circle," Silajdzic said. "A scenario to 
kill 
Gorazde and give it to the Serbs." 
  Silajdzic said Bosnia is alone against the world, but 
expressed belief Turkey is doing its best, adding he is 
constantly in contact with President Suleyman Demirel and 
Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  On the latest developments in Gorazde, he said he contacted 
the town half an hour ago and that the West has shown the green 
light to kill the city and its inhabitants. 
  "It is proof that the West will not do anything to help and 
will not lift the arms embargo," he said. 
  He said according to latest information from Gorazde, Serbs 
are burning everything in the town and there is a massacre going 
on. 
  Silajdzic also said that the Serbs want to take the 
defenseless city after forcing UN observers and any other UN 
officials out of Gorazde.

<F P=106> [Address by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija </F>
Izetbegovic to rally in Sarajevo on 18 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] Dear citizens of Sarajevo [crowd chants: Bosnia, 
interrupting him] Dear citizens of Sarajevo, we have gathered 
here to express our solidarity with the citizens of Gorazde, and 
to tell them that they are not alone. We have been following 
their struggle, and living through every hour and minute of 
theirs. 
  We are also here for another reason, to express our defiance 
and to say that the violence and deceit will not pass [crowd 
cheers], to utter a large No to violence and deceit, and of 
course to tell them that we are not afraid of them. Those of 
you who came here have shown that you are not afraid of them. 
Those who stayed at home are obviously afraid. [crowd chants: 
Let us go on Gorazde, Bosnia] 
  This is not the time for long speeches. Even if we had come 
here in total silence, even if this gathering had come in 
silence, that would have still been an eternal expression and a 
message. 
  They have obviously decided to go for all or nothing. We 
will also go for all or nothing. [crowd cheers] This is a 
battle between good and evil, and for that reason in this battle 
for all or nothing we will get all. They will be left with 
nothing. [crowd chants] 
  Dear citizens, it must now be clear to everyone that Gorazde 
is the victim of a conspiracy. Here are the Chetniks with their 
steel, and there is the deceitful world, or better said, that 
part of the deceitful world that is hypocritical and has 
hypocritical justice. Gorazde is the victim of that. [crowd 
chants] 
  And let me tell you something: It is not the fault of the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], it is not the fault of their 
soldiers, it is not the fault of their officers. It is the 
fault of the leadership of the United Nations. They too are 
being killed here, imprisoned, abused. They are following their 
orders. It is not their fault, you have to know that. It is 
the leadership that is to be blamed, the head is guilty, and you 
know what the name of that head is over there. [crowd chants: 
Ghali, murderer!] Instead of mobilizing the world against evil, 
against this ominous evil that has come down on Bosnia, they are 
paralyzing the UN mechanism. They are paralyzing and 
demobilizing, and instead of action they think up excuses. They 
are constantly coming up with excuses for not acting. Gorazde 
is the victim of this, our people in the entire eastern Bosnia 
are the victim of this, Bosnia is the victim of this. [crowd 
chants] 
  I will tell you one other thing: It is not the fault of the 
Serbs, it is the fault of the Chetniks. The Chetniks are 
guilty. Make that distinction! Make that distinction for the 
good of Bosnia-Herzegovina! You have to separate the wheat from 
the chaff! Make the distinction between the wheat and the chaff! 
Those who are among us today, those who have been with us for 
two years, the Serbs who have been with us for two years on the 
free territory, in the state, and Sarajevo, they are our 
fellow-fighters against that evil. It is unfortunate that there 
is more chaff than wheat, but we will not be blind. We will 
always separate the chaff from the wheat. Those in the hills are 
the chaff! [crowd chants] 
  And finally, we have learned the lesson, they have rammed 
the 
lesson home. The lesson is very brief: We must be strong. We 
must be strong! Pass this knowledge to our children. Tell them 
that they have to be good and honorable, but that they must be 
strong. This world respects nothing but strength. The world 
respects many things, but strength, it seems, the most. We will 
be strong. Teach your children that. And we will save Gorazde! 
[crowd chants]

  [Text] Novi Sad, 18 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the assembly of the Srpska republic, today said 
that the Serbs were disappointed with the fact that the 
situation in Gorazde had not calmed down following yesterday's 
talks with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi. 
  We expected the situation to calm down. Instead, the Muslims 
are making every effort to improve their military positions and 
to depict themselves as victims in order to provoke military 
intervention, Krajisnik told Novi Sad radio. 
  He said that the Muslim side did not want a cease-fire, nor 
does it want a cease-fire across the entire territory of former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina [as received]. He said that the Srpska 
republic is attempting in every possible way to present the 
truth to the world and prove that the Muslim side has brought 
about the latest crisis around Gorazde. 
  We have, Krajisnik stressed, ceased all military activity 
around Gorazde. The foreign media are, however, spreading lies 
and claims that a large number of shells are still being fired 
on Gorazde from Serb positions and that the Serb forces are 
allegedly trying to occupy the town. 
  Krajisnik said that this was not true, stressing that the 
Serb forces were on the right bank of the Drina and that they 
did not want to cross onto the left bank, as envisaged under the 
agreement [not further specified].

  [Text] [Unidentified announcer] The situation in Gorazde is 
extremely difficult. The fighting is going on both on the right 
bank of the River Drina and on the Ustipraca side of town. This 
was the first information we received from Esad Ohranovic, the 
president of the Gorazde district executive council, who 
answered questions by domestic and foreign journalists through 
the radio-bridge with Gorazde this evening. Mr. Ohranovic goes 
on to say: 
  [Ohranovic] ``The part of town on the right bank is being 
shelled particularly heavily. This is where the hospital and 
refugee accommodation are located. What we know now is that 26 
have been killed and 71 wounded during the day, I mean between 
0800 and now. The figures are not final. 
  ``The hospital has been hit by at least 10 shells. All 
personnel and the wounded are in the cellars -- so the wounded 
are being treated in poor conditions. The situation is 
extremely alarming, particularly at the hospital.'' 
  [Announcer] Have the defense lines been moved, and where are 
the Chetnik tanks now -- this was the next question Mr. 
Ohranovic was asked. 
  [Ohranovic] ``The defense lines have not been moved today. 
The town is being shelled from tanks, howitzers, and mortars, 
and this from all three directions. Some residential buildings 
and the hospital are being targeted from three directions. It 
is extremely difficult. One cannot see this part of town, on 
the right bank, for the smoke and fire. The education center, 
the department store, and three blocks of residential buildings 
are now burning. 
  ``From where I am now we can see three tanks, at a distance 
of about 1,500 meters. I am now in the part of town closer to 
Cajnice [southern part]. Earlier today I spoke from the area 
closer to Ustipraca [north east]. The situation there is 
unchanged.'' 
  [Announcer] How far are the Chetnik tanks from the hospital? 
  [Ohranovic] "About 1,000 meters." 
  [Announcer] And the aggressor's soldiers? 
  [Ohranovic] "Between 200 and 300 meters." 
  [Announcer] The Serb-Montenegrin aggressor also launched 
infantry attacks today? 
  [Ohranovic] "Four infantry attacks were launched during the 
day. They were mainly repulsed." 
  [Announcer] The residents of Gorazde and the refugees are 
under constant artillery and sniper fire, with no roof above 
their heads. 
  [Ohranovic] ``A lot of people, in particular on the left 
bank, have nowhere to go. Fifteen minutes ago I was at the UN 
offices. They are having problems now, because the people are 
trying to squeeze into their buildings, looking for protection. 
Believe me, that is a big problem. 
  ``Houses that have been burned down are full of people. The 
street is like a cauldron. The situation is extremely 
difficult, caused by the withdrawal of people before the 
attack.'' 
  [Announcer] Water and electricity? 
  [Ohranovic] "The last convoy arrived in Gorazde on 22 March. 
All Gorazde water wells are on the right bank, where the 
shelling is the heaviest. You can imagine what the situation is 
like. The people on the streets have fled their houses, 
carrying perhaps an armful of supplies." 
  [Announcer] How many foreigners are there in Gorazde? 
  [Ohranovic] ``There are four members of the UN team, two 
UNHCR officers, two members of the Medecins Sans Frontieres 
[MSF], and two members of the International Red Cross [IRC] 
team. They are still here, but have announced their departure. 
  ``The IRC center was shelled several times today. Four 
people were wounded.'' 
  [Announcer] Enemy propaganda tried to launch another lie 
today, that two MSF members had been arrested. 
  [Ohranovic] "This is a lie. I had some coffee with these 
people some 15 minutes ago. It is very unfortunate for us that 
the only anesthetist in Gorazde has been seriously injured and 
cannot work. He was wounded at work, has been pulled out of the 
hospital and is currently with the UN team. Our hospital does 
not have an anesthetist at all, people who have no previous 
experience are doing his work." 
  [Announcer] Are the Chetniks withdrawing? 
  [Ohranovic] "Not for the time being. What they are saying -- 
that they have withdrawn -- is a downright lie."

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Nikola Koljevic, vice president of </F>
the Srpska republic, by Zivojin Jerotijevic and Dragan Colovic 
-- live] 
  [Text] [Jerotijevic] We have vice president of the Srpska 
republic Professor Dr. Nikola Koljevic on our direct telephone 
line. Good day! 
  [Koljevic] Good day! 
  [Jerotijevic] Professor Koljevic, I will not ask you 
anything as we have here our expert, foreign affairs' 
commentator Dragan Colovic. 
  [Colovic] Good day from me, Mr. Koljevic. 
  [Koljevic] Good day, Mr. Colovic. 
  [Colovic] How do you view the latest development of the 
situation around Gorazde? 
  [Koljevic] I believe that after today's meeting that we have 
had in Pale, that is, after yesterday's meeting with Mr. Akashi, 
to be precise, this dilemma of which our Foreign Minister Buha 
spoke is nevertheless verging more to the side of peace than to 
the possible side of escalation. Namely, after yesterday's 
meeting with Mr. Akashi and the appeal that he issued on that 
occasion, our authorities decided to immediately implement or 
assist in the implementation of the following measures as sign 
of goodwill: We agreed that the Serbian forces would stay 
outside the 3-km zone on the left bank of the river at Gorazde 
and that we would agree to an as speedy as possible deployment 
of UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] troops on the left bank in 
order to restore peace there as quickly as possible. Namely, it 
is well known that there have been more attacks from the Muslim 
side after we had agreed to instantaneous peace yesterday. 
Yesterday, we also agreed on medical assistance and evacuation 
by helicopters. Unfortunately, the Muslim side did not accept 
this evacuation this morning for political reasons, so it seems, 
because they wanted to dramatize the situation in Gorazde in the 
media. However, we did agree on this and it is important that 
the international public is aware of this -- the assistance and 
evacuation from Gorazde and other settlements -- as well as all 
humanitarian organizations, primarily the Red Cross. 
  We also agreed that the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
[UNHCR], the Red Cross, the Medicins sans Frontieres, and the 
Handicap International should resume humanitarian convoys as 
soon as possible, that all humanitarian workers be guaranteed 
free movement throughout the territory of the Srpska republic, 
and that our republics' police units would accompany these 
convoys to safeguard their safety. This was agreed and I 
believe that these are the signals that, above all, show the 
improvement of the relations between the UN civilian sector and 
our authorities, prove that there is goodwill on the Serbian 
side to stop all other activities, and above all ensure correct 
information about Gorazde, where plenty of disinformation has 
been coming from. Therefore the presence of UNPROFOR on the 
left bank of Gorazde could be a major step toward peace in 
Gorazde and later also toward proliferation of peace if the 
Muslim side would be willing for this in other areas. 
  [Colovic] Yes, Mr. Koljevic. The implementation of this 
agreement will definitely depend on the behavior and reactions 
of the Muslim side. Are there any indications regarding this? 
  [Koljevic] You know that for any agreement at least two, and 
for many agreements such as ours, three our four sides are 
needed. For the time being we have no indication [words 
indistinct] that these helicopters have been rejected this 
morning, however, I believe that it is now up to the agencies of 
the international community, primarily the Red Cross and the 
UNHCR, and we shall see whether they will succeed and be 
accepted. The only question remaining now is whether the Muslim 
side would accept them on their territory, too. 
  [Colovic] There have been reports that Vitaliy Churkin, 
special envoy of the Russian President Yeltsin, is returning to 
Moscow. How do you interpret this, bearing in mind everything 
that this mediator has done and accomplished over the last few 
days in pacifying this dramatic situation. 
  [Koljevic] Well, I do not know the precise reasons for his 
return to Moscow, however, I presume that he was recalled for 
consultations in order to accomplish as soon as possible not 
merely this transitional solution for Gorazde, but also an 
agreement that would guarantee a general end to hostilities, and 
to obtain the Russian position toward this document, which we 
need most urgently if we do not want the war to really escalate. 
  [Colovic] I shall read you a REUTER report. Namely, in 
Zagreb, Churkin said, as REUTER quotes, that the defense of 
Gorazde has broken down and the town, as it is quoted, continues 
to be under Serbian siege. The only thing demanded from the 
Serbs is to stop the attacks on Gorazde but, unfortunately, they 
are not in a position to do so, Churkin said and added that a 
solution could be found if the world would agree to the 
abolition of sanctions against Serbia. As he said, the 
principles of the abolition of sanctions are important for the 
Serbs. How do you comment on this? 
  [Koljevic] I believe that this, especially the second part 
referring to the sanctions, is very accurate. We cannot embark 
on any further negotiations before the issue of sanctions, and 
not only their abolition, is accepted and also specified. Well, 
because things are changing by the hour, I believe that we have 
demonstrated out goodwill by agreeing to UNPROFOR presence on 
the left bank of Gorazde and the start of demilitarization. 
Therefore, this is slightly different today then it was 
yesterday when he was here. 
  [Colovic] Mr. Koljevic, you have said that the things are 
changing by the hour. I, therefore, ask you what steps can be 
expected from the Serbian side in the next few hours? 
  [Koljevic] In the next few hours we will try -- we will 
remain in contact with the UNPROFOR civilian sector -- to secure 
as speedy as possible a realization of this agreement, and then 
we will strive to improve other liaisons with UNPROFOR. For 
instance, the Ukrainian battalion in Zepa needs to be replaced 
and this would be a sign of goodwill. Namely, they need 
logistical support and we must resolve this in the afternoon. 
Naturally, we must inform all our agencies to carry out 
preparations for the continuation of the humanitarian work as 
early as possible. 
  Tomorrow morning at approximately 1000 we shall see when the 
deployment of UNPROFOR forces, as the most important issue, will 
be possible. 
  [Colovic] Does this mean that a change will occur in the 
liaison with the military section of UNPROFOR? 
  [Koljevic] Well, probably it will occur, however, it cannot 
happen immediately. We must... [pauses] for the time being we 
only have the authority of our supreme command to communicate 
via the civilian sector, however, numerous issues, even the 
military ones, can be resolved through the civilian sector. 
  [Colovic] At the end, Mr. Koljevic, let me ask you, what do 
you expect in the Gorazde sector, what further development of 
the situation? 
  [Koljevic] I do not know whether even those who are 
currently in the direct vicinity of Gorazde could give a precise 
answer to your question. However, judging by our information 
here we expect the abatement of the situation, unless 
significant propaganda military provocations by the Muslim side 
take place in Gorazde. In such a case it would be very 
difficult to restore peace in Gorazde, for which we were willing. 
  [Colovic] Yes, and the aforementioned agreement with special 
envoy of the UN Secretary General Akashi, too. Mr. Koljevic, 
thank you very much. 
  [Koljevic] Thank you, too.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Lukic, prime minister of the Srpska </F>
republic of Bosnia, by Fausto Beloslavo in Pale on 16 April: 
"Rest Assured, We Will Protect the Bosnians"] 
  [Text] Pale -- Vladimir Lukic used to be an engineer, 
lived in Sarajevo, and once worked for the United Nations for 
six months. Then the war upset everything and people changed 
careers. Now 61-year-old Vladimir is the prime minister of the 
Srpska republic of Bosnia, whose armed forces control 70 percent 
of the martyrized former republic of Yugoslavia. He agreed to 
grant L'INDIPENDENTE an exclusive interview in his office, where 
several telephones with numerous science-fiction-like lines -- a 
symbol of power in this region -- occupied a conspicuous 
place. 
  [Beloslavo] Today (yesterday for the reader -- 
L'INDIPENDENTE 
editor's note) your militias have entered Gorazde after several 
months of siege, in open defiance of the UN resolutions which 
declared the enclave a "safe area"... 
  [Lukic] We do not consider Gorazde a United 
Nations-protected 
area, because it was never demilitarized. There are some 12,000 
to 15,000 Muslim soldiers over there. What we are involved in 
is merely a counteroffensive. Our generals have asked the 
Bosnians to surrender, telling them that their lives will be 
spared. We want no more massacres. 
  [Beloslavo] What will now happen, following NATO's air 
raids? 
  [Lukic] If the attacks continue, the Balkans will explode, 
but I would rather not even think of such a possibility. This 
is not like the Gulf War. This conflict is different from, and 
worse than, previous ones. There are many dangerous weapons in 
Europe, some of which are under control, whereas others are 
not... 
  [Beloslavo] Are you referring to ultranationalist Russian 
leader Zhirinovskiy's threats? 
  [Lukic] We cannot take his statements too seriously, but we 
are not underestimating them either. 
  [Beloslavo] What do you think of Italy's role in making its 
bases available for NATO's attacks on your positions? 
  [Lukic] Your country took part in the aggression against 
Serbia, but I see no reason why we should prolong this conflict. 
We respect your minority in the former Yugoslavia, and some 
Italians are fighting by our side... 
  [Beloslavo] Italians? Do you mean those trained in Krajina? 
  [Lukic] I am not speaking only of the Garibaldi Battalion, 
but of many who lived and worked in Trieste or other Italian 
towns, and who have returned to fight where they were born. 
  [Beloslavo] So, no missiles will be launched against Italy? 
  [Lukic] If it were not for the bases, we would not even send 
a carrier pigeon in your direction, you would have nothing to 
fear. But you know very well that there are hardly any nations 
by now that do not have aircraft or missiles which can be used 
against neighboring countries, without distance being any 
problem. 
  [Beloslavo] Is it true that you also bear the Vatican a 
grudge? 
  [Lukic] We have made our criticism known for the Vatican's 
support of sanctions against Serbia, and also for having favored 
the former Yugoslavia's dissolution in several ways. Recently 
we have received a number of different signals, which make us 
hope that relations will improve. 
  [Beloslavo] Are you asking for the head of UN troops 
commander in Bosnia General Rose? 
  [Lukic] It is true that we can no longer sit at the same 
negotiating table as the person who ordered the air attacks. 
  [Beloslavo] Are therefore hopes of peace becoming flimsier? 
  [Lukic] The result of the adventure attempted by the United 
States, which aimed to create a Croatian-Muslim federation in 
Bosnia excluding the Serbs, was to eventually pave the way for 
NATO's aggression. In such a situation, we cannot talk of peace.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 18 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
withdrew seven of its liaison officers from the besieged eastern 
Bosnian enclave of Gorazde Monday but left five unarmed military 
observers behind, General Michael Rose, the UN ground commander 
in Bosnia, said. 
  Rose said the liaison officers were pulled out of the Moslem 
enclave at dawn because their equipment was not usable. He did 
not elaborate on what he meant by that. 
  Earlier in Zagreb, a French military source reported that 
the 
UN had pulled all of its personnel from Gorazde overnight Sunday 
as the Serbs intensified their shelling of the town where some 
60,000 people are trapped. 
  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva said four of 
its representatives also remain in the enclave.

  [Text] Banja Luka, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The army of the 
Bosnian Serb republic on Monday repulsed a strong combined 
Moslem attack on Brcko in the north of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb army sources said 
in a statement. 
  More than 100 artillery shells were fired on Bosnian Serb 
positions in the area. 
  The Serb side repulsed a Moslem infantry attack, in which it 
suffered no casualties, and the Moslems then continued to open 
artillery and machine-gun fire on Serb positions, the statement 
said. 
  The attack proves correct the increasingly frequent reports 
about concentration of Bosnian Moslem and Croat forces towards 
Serb positions in the valley of the river Sava, where they are 
planning to cut the only land corridor between the Serb Krajina 
regions in the west and the federal republic of Yugoslavia in 
the east.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 18 April carries in its 
regular 30-minute newscast several reports on the fighting in 
the republic. Reception is fair. 
  Updating the situation in Gorazde, Enes Musovic says that 
"the early evening hours bring only continuation of the agony, 
chaos and hell. The Chetniks are intensifying their murderous 
attacks. They are about to enter the town." He says that 
"while NATO planes continue their futile flights high above 
Gorazde, the aggressor is continuing the slaughter of civilians. 
The Chetniks have fired dozens of thousands of shells today 
alone, and it is a miracle that anybody is still left alive 
here." 
  In his report from Brcko, Hamiz Deronjic says that 
"throughout the day, Chetniks have been shelling the defense 
positions and civilian targets from several artillery 
strongholds. The enemy has been pounding Djukici, Vranovaca, 
Boderiste, and the central part of the Brcko defense with 
mortars and recoilless guns. A B-1 hill cannon [as heard] has 
been firing from Cadjavac at Vranovaca and Omerbegovaca." He 
says that "the general alarm was sounded twice today, at 1200 
[1000 GMT] and 1600, thus marking the periods of the heaviest 
shelling of the free Brcko territory, which has been exposed all 
day to fire from the Chetnik 120-mm and 155-mm howitzers." 
  The Teocak Press Center reports that "this morning howitzer 
and tank shells, and mortars fired from the Chetnik stronghold 
of (?Dzemad), Priboj, (Dusanovo Brdo), and Lokanj landed today 
on the villages of (Snjeznica), Jasikovac, (Bivalici), and Stari 
Teocak. Several people were wounded." 
  The 206th Chivalrous Zvornik Brigade reports that "since the 
early morning hours, tanks, howitzers, and mortars of all 
calibers have been used to indiscriminately pound Sapna, 
Kobilice, Vitinice, Zaseok, Nezuk, and Kodus. Over 150 
destructive shells landed on the free Zvornik territory, but 
miraculously there were no casualties." 
  Jasmin Puskarevic reports from the "free territory 
Doboj-East" that "in the operative zone of the 109th Doboj 
Brigade the aggressor has been continuously shelling the defense 
lines and the civilian targets in the area of Lukavica, Rijeka, 
and Klokotnica. Several civilians were wounded in these 
attacks." He says that "one interesting thing is that the 
Chetniks have recently been firing Russian-made 57-mm missiles." 
  Reporting from Gracanica, Izudin Durakovic says that "early 
this morning the Serb aggressor launched a fierce artillery 
attack on the defense positions of the 109th Doboj Brigade, and 
the civilian targets of Klokotnica, Lukavica, (Sanic Rijeka), 
and Hodzici. The attacks continued during the day. The 
Chetniks attempted several infantry breakthroughs in the region 
of Mujanov Mezar, but without much success." As for Gracanica, 
he says that "the Chetniks fired with tanks, howitzers, and 
cannons at the defense positions of the 111th Gracanica Brigade; 
then they pounded Lukavica, and (Lukavica Rijeka) with 
artillery." 
  Smajl Terzic reports from the operative zone of the 7-South 
Operative Group that "this afternoon new armored-mechanized 
units were spotted in the region of (?Smajevac), which indicates 
that the aggressor is preparing new artillery and infantry 
attacks. One should add this: Today the enemy continuously 
pounded Jelah, Tesanjka, Matuzici, and Alibegovci for five 
hours, and there are dozens of casualties." 
  As for Sarajevo, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 1st Corps Press 
Center reports that "a sniper from Faletic is firing at 
Grusulje, and an antiaircraft machine gun is firing from Gradina 
at Hodivode."

<F P=106> [Asim Gruhonjic commentary] </F>
  [Text] We should repeat aloud and remember well the brutal 
reality expressed in the words of Reis ul ulema Mustafa Ceric 
yesterday. He said that the world had legalized the public 
crime committed against us, the Bosniak Muslims, and only 
because we are preserving our Islamic Bosniak identity and 
because we are defending our homeland. 
  What we must do now can be found only in ourselves and 
around 
us, and we must finally understand that. Let us repeat: No 
United States, no England, no France is going to help us unless 
we help ourselves. The brave Gorazde people must know that help 
is not forthcoming. The world does not give a damn about our 
suffering and our cries. Everything that we have achieved so 
far has been achieved with our own strength and the courage of 
our fighters. That is the only way in which Gorazde can and must 
be defended. Now Gorazde needs iron discipline and 
decisiveness. Everything must be subjugated to the defense of 
the town, without which there is no life. 
  Let us remember: We do not face an ordinary enemy. We are 
facing a criminal movement that has been launched to destroy us, 
to annihilate us. The world is watching that. Our country will 
have to be more decisive and more determined in mobilizing all 
those who can and must help. We must particularly be decisive 
toward the part of the younger people who have managed to avoid 
[words indistinct]. Every working place has to be examined 
through the effects of the work, and where the effects are not 
good, we have to place people where they can and must contribute 
the most. We are in a brutal defensive war in which our defeat 
means our death. We have to remove decisively all those 
incompetent from places of authority. That is why any 
broadcasting of the thoughts and statements by prominent world 
leaders has also to be subjugated to that aim only, and avoid 
everything that sows illusions and feeds idle hope. One of 
these is the recent statement by the foreign minister of Russia, 
the country that is in essence anti-Bosniak, the country that 
has been aiding Milosevic's fascist conquering policy. Can 
these people wish us well? Whether this indifference of the 
world is the result of the accord reached by the world powers, 
there is no point in guessing. We have no use for empty talk. 
There is no point in blaming the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR], since we know that the UNPROFOR headquarters are 
somewhere far away, in Washington, New York, or London. 
  The only correct solution is to mobilize everything we have, 
all our forces in the struggle for liberation. All those who 
play games with the fate of their people and their state, and 
behave [word indistinct] or in a self-centered way, they have to 
be removed from their posts. Betrayal and the call on betrayal 
must be punished severely. What do you think England did in 
World War II? Will we finally come to our senses? 
  As for Gorazde, let us repeat, it will endure for as long as 
it finds the strength to adjust to the imposed brutal situation. 
The situation in Gorazde is literally in the hands of the 
citizens of Gorazde. The republic will continue to work -- and 
work even harder -- on waking at least a bit the 
conscientiousness of the world. One however should not have any 
illusions here. Everything is in our hands and the hands of the 
Lord.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Gojko Beric: "Has-Been General"] </F>
  [Text] Where is General Ratko Mladic, the greatest murderer 
in the history of Bosnia? It is common knowledge that he is 
always at the scene of the most fierce shelling of Bosnian 
besieged towns. Consequently, he could now be somewhere near 
Gorazde. However, General Mladic no longer takes part in any 
negotiations. He cannot be seen on SRNA either, where he used 
to appear every couple of days playing the role of the main 
military strategist -- the one to approve every move. He was 
the crucial man when the self-styled Serbian assembly decided to 
reject the Geneva peace accord, when Milosevic, Cosic, and 
Mitsotakis returned from Pale and suffered a severe loss of face. 
  The last media promotion of the Chetnik general in Belgrade 
was more than a month ago in NIN. In a long interview for this 
weekly magazine, he presented his vision of the war in Bosnia 
and said General Kukanjac was to blame for the failure in the 
operation of seizing Sarajevo. Mladic has not appeared in 
public since then. Several days ago, a Belgrade RFI 
correspondent reported that there were rumors about Mladic's 
dismissal, but that Karadzic still did not dare do it, for his 
most famous general "still has a good reputation on the front 
lines." 
  A certain mysteriousness regarding the position of Mladic on 
Karadzic's hierarchical ranking is a choice bit of dirt for 
masters of speculative journalism. However, all things 
considered, this could be a matter for serious analysts as well. 
General Ratko Mladic is a war criminal -- that is a fact. The 
Helsinki Watch, leading international organization for 
monitoring the state of human rights, also holds that view. But 
that is not the reason behind Mladic's possible sinking, for 
Radovan Karadzic is also on the list of war criminals of the 
Helsinki Watch. The underlying cause of his conflict with 
Mladic is something completely different. 
  Last summer, after the Igman operation, Mladic was at his 
peak. He intended to conquer Sarajevo and wanted to become a 
Serb Napoleon, so Milosevic's generals feared him. Even 
Karadzic feared him, but could not even dream of depriving 
himself of his services. After the battle for Teocak, where he 
was heavily defeated, Mladic's military glory started to fade. 
He did not do too well in the offensive against Olovo either, 
and was forced to withdraw from almost 20 km long front line 
near Maglaj. Mladic then set out to conquer Bihac, but did not 
manage to improve his rating there. Karadzic used the series of 
Mladic's failures -- surely not without Milosevic's blessing -- 
to move the pugnacious general as far away from himself as 
possible. 
  Their final act of revenge is yet to come. For the time 
being, the conflict is just one of the signals that the Pale 
brethren are not even remotely as unanimous as they used to be. 
They ran out of cheap human material for continuing the war. 
True to its fascization of Serb patriotism, SRNA has recently 
broadcast a scene of recruitment of 18-year-olds. We saw 
confused and nervous young men whom Karadzic intended to send to 
war. And 13- or 14-year-olds will go next. Watching the program 
on SRNA, we were reminded of the famous picture of Hitler 
pinching the cheeks of German boys sending them to their deaths 
in the suburbs of Berlin, just a few days before he committed 
suicide in his bunker.

  [Text] Washington, April 18 (TANJUG) -- Washington is 
viewing with confusion and uncertainty the developments in 
war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly around the 
eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
  The White House is awaiting the outcome of Russia's 
diplomatic effort to effect a ceasefire around Gorazde, while 
sending confused signals about its determination to keep up its 
military pressure on the Serbs and the priority it attaches to 
political dialogue. 
  President Bill Clinton on Sunday indirectly intimated that 
the United States would be willing to do an about-face in its 
current policy towards the Serbs, which has been signaled also 
by THE WASHINGTON POST. Quoting high-ranking sources in the 
administration, the daily said that the United States was 
prepared to consider lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) as an incentive to the Bosnian Serbs to 
agree to a ceasefire in Bosnia. 
  On Sunday, Clinton discussed the Yugoslav crisis with 
Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin, as did Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher with his Russian opposite number Andrey Kozyrev. 
  Information available at this time suggests that Kozyrev 
asked Washington to agree that the Bosnian ceasefire deal 
include a provision on a phased lifting of the anti-Yugoslav 
sanctions, with Christopher agreeing, albeit reluctantly, that 
the Serbs needed to be stimulated in some way. 
  Meanwhile, Washington is in a ferment with speculation about 
what the United States should do in a situation where it is 
largely considered that the current policy of limited military 
pressure on the Serbs has been defeated and that the Serbs have 
humiliated the United States, NATO and the United Nations. 
  The advocates of an intervention are strongly on the 
offensive, the most rabid of them being former secretary of 
state and ambassador in Belgrade Lawrence Eagleburger, who has 
told the C.B.S. network that, if Clinton has crossed the Rubicon 
and used force, he should now follow through with massive 
bombings of targets not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also deep 
inside Serbia. 
  The campaign has been actively joined by Bosnian Moslem 
Vice-President Ejup Ganic, who has made several television 
appearances for local networks in which he called for a massive 
air raid on Serb targets and demanded that Clinton immediately 
send arms to the Moslems in Bosnia. 
  Appearing in a television show with Ganic, Congressman Lee 
Hamilton poured cold water on both demands, explaining that the 
United States could not unilaterally exempt the Moslems from the 
arms sales embargo which has been in force against all of former 
Yugoslavia since late 1991, as that would in effect constitute 
an invitation for an escalation of war, and that a massive 
intervention was not envisaged in the mandate of the United 
Nations.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry on Monday summoned the charge d'affaires at the French 
Embassy in Belgrade and strongly protested over a terrorist 
assault on the Yugoslav cultural centre in Paris and demanded 
that the French Government take urgent and energetic measures 
against its perpetrators. 
  It also demanded that the French Government secure and 
guarantee conditions for normal and safe work of the Yugoslav 
cultural centre, duly punish the perpetrators and prevent 
similar incidents against Yugoslav diplomatic and other offices 
in France from happening in the future. 
  A group of French citizens and Moslem extremists, headed by 
notorious activists from Paris' political demimonde, stormed the 
Yugoslav cultural centre on Monday, threw out the personnel, 
vandalised the premises and occupied the premises. 
  Police and the authorities reacted to the situation with 
less 
than desirable alacrity, allowing the vandals to use the centre 
for brutal anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav propaganda. 
  The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry conveyed to the French charge 
d'affaires its bitter resentment at the escalation of vandal 
attacks on Yugoslav offices in the city which boasts of being 
the world's cultural capital. 
  Yugoslavia insisted that everything, including the property 
of the cultural centre, should be restored to the status quo 
ante. 
  Special concern was expressed at the fact that the incident 
had happened despite warnings from the Yugoslav side that 
something of the kind might be in the offing and demands for 
adequate measures to be taken to protect the Yugoslav offices. 
  Belgrade explained that assaults of this kind were 
encouraged 
by an unprecedented systematic anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav 
campaign in the French media. 
  The French diplomat expressed regret at the incident and 
said 
he would convey this in his (?note) to his government. 
  The Yugoslav charge d'affaires in Paris too lodged a protest 
with the French Foreign Ministry on Monday over the deplorable 
incident.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski by </F>
correspondent E.K.; place and date not given: "A Historic Step 
Forward"] 
  [Text] [E.K.] You headed the Macedonian [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] delegation at the 
negotiations in New York last year, from the end of February 
until 8 April as the acting foreign minister, and you 
participated in the final activities before the admission of our 
country to the United Nations. What was the greatest 
characteristic of that period, I would say, of important 
meetings and discussions? 
  [Crvenkovski] The main characteristic of the days preceding 
the admission of the Republic of Macedonia to the United Nations 
was the attempt of Greece to prevent it at the last minute. 
That was the reason for the prolongation in handing their 
letter. All possible manipulations were used in order to 
prevent our admission at the last minute. Greece is handing, 
Greece is not handing the letter, it is handing it with a 
signature, without.... After that the Athens Government made 
attempts to postpone the procedure as long as possible with the 
UN General Assembly, now that it could not prevent the 
admission. They insisted that the General Assembly review the 
admission of Macedonia at a regular session. 
  The main activity of the Macedonian delegation in New York 
those last 10 days was to "get" the UN General Assembly, and to 
fulfill the admission to the United Nations as soon as possible, 
that is immediately, which was finally carried out. The 
attempted postponement was, as a matter of fact, due to the fact 
that the Greek side became aware that, with the admission of 
Macedonia to the United Nations, the whole situation had 
drastically changed. They hoped time would help them and they 
hoped the whole situation could be essentially changed. Because 
if Macedonia had not become a member of the United Nations, it 
would be likewise in other international institutions within the 
UN system, without which it is impossible for a state to 
function. These are institutions, like telecommunications, 
transport, financial transactions, registration of vehicles, 
registration of aircraft, a whole complex of relations which 
make possible the communication of a state in the world by 
becoming a member of those organizations. If there is not a 
normal communication in the world, then there comes a total 
economic collapse in a country, with all the relevant 
consequences. 
  That was the basis on which Greece constructed its strategy. 
They wanted either to prevent or postpone it as much as 
possible, and our vital interest was to regulate our membership 
as soon as possible, in order to make possible all the aspects 
of a normal international living, and to make the state function. 
  [E.K.] Which were the states that helped us most in those 
activities, negotiations, and persuasions for easing the 
pressures of Greece before the membership of our country in the 
world community, and who were the diplomats you had the most 
frequent contacts with? 
  [Crvenkovski] Well, the most profound influence was 
certainly of the three countries which proposed the resolution 
on the admission of our state to the United Nations, three 
countries of the European Community, which are Great Britain, 
France, and Spain, which was then also one of the 15 members of 
the Security Council. It is true that nothing would have been 
accomplished without the help of the five permanent members of 
the Security Council. 
  [E.K.] What was the situation like with the so-called 
sponsors of the resolution on the admission of Macedonia to the 
United Nations? 
  [Crvenkovski] If I am not mistaken, Macedonia formally had 
only 67 sponsors. What was of extreme importance was the great 
number of the members. It was also important that this number 
was reached in practically 24 hours. Normally, the period 
required for providing sponsors for a resolution on admission of 
a country to the United Nations lasts 15, 30, or 60 days. The 
ambassadors of these countries were practically standing in line 
for 24 hours to sign the resolution on our sponsorship. I here 
have to point out that we had the great support of the Slovenian 
mission to the United Nations, which was the main sponsor, and 
which did almost all the technical job in gathering other 
members. 
  [E.K.] The importance of the admission of Macedonia to the 
United Nations is apparent. What happened and what has changed 
in the international life of Macedonia a year later? 
  [Crvenkovski] As a direct consequence of the membership in 
the United Nations, we became members of all its specialized 
agencies. There are 26 such agencies, and each one of them is of 
vital importance for the functioning of a state. We have 
accomplished a full membership in 26 agencies, and what is left 
is only to regulate relations with GATT. There we have observer 
status, and we still have not regulated our membership because 
the negotiations with GATT need a long process of difficult 
negotiations, step by step, on all forms of non-customs measures 
of protection, something that cannot normally be expected to be 
solved in less than a year of negotiation. The problem is not 
of a political, but of a technical nature. 
  Just after our membership in the United Nations there 
followed a process of membership to many state organizations, 
institutions, cultural, sports, and scientific international 
associations. It was all urged after the admission of Macedonia 
to the United Nations. In the meantime the process of bilateral 
recognition was carried out with a great number of countries, as 
well as of establishing diplomatic relations. The Republic of 
Macedonia has established full diplomatic relations with 30 
countries, and 30 to 40 more countries have formally recognized 
our Republic. Our passports have been accepted by almost the 
whole world, with the exception of two neighboring countries. 
This is evidently a situation totally different from what we 
had before the admission of our country to the United Nations. 
  [E.K.] What does the admission of Macedonia to the world 
organization mean for the political and security plan in 
relation to the Bucharest agreement of 1913? 
  [Crvenkovski] The very act of admission to the United 
Nations is a de facto confirmation of the independence of the 
relevant state. After that moment the state becomes a full 
subject in international relations. It bears all the other 
international legal consequences following the act of 
recognition. 
  Until then, until Macedonia entered the United Nations, 
almost all speculations concerning its future were possible. 
The moment we became an equal UN member the speculations 
stopped. Beside the practical aspects that I have here noted, 
membership in the specialized agencies of the world organization 
represents a significant moment when the sovereignty of a state 
is really completed. 
  [E.K.] The problem in the relations with Greece existed even 
before the Macedonian membership in the United Nations, and it 
is still there. What are the essential changes in the 
negotiating status for overcoming the disputed issues between 
the two countries? 
  [Crvenkovski] First of all, I would like to call not upon 
our assessment, but upon the assessment of the Greek side. 
During the recent discussions in the Greek parliament, Greek 
Prime Minister Papandreou evaluated the admission of Macedonia 
to the United Nations as one of the biggest errors of Greek 
diplomacy. I do not know how truly it is an error of the Greek 
diplomacy, speaking in long terms, but the claim proves that the 
other side is totally aware of the enormous importance of that 
act. First of all because since 8 April last year there has 
existed a relationship of equal partners in the negotiations. 
In spite of the fact that the other side is making desperate 
attempts and various problems, including the embargo against us, 
and in spite of all the hot statements, it is a fact that the 
other side, by starting the process of negotiations, 
demonstrated it negotiated with a sovereign country. After our 
admission to the United Nations, it became an equal process 
between two states in dispute. Until the moment of entering the 
United Nations, there was the problem of a state that proclaimed 
independence, not yet realized. After our membership in the 
United Nations that question was canceled from the agenda, and 
if you review the whole development of the total relationship of 
the international organizations toward the Republic of Macedonia 
during the past 12 months, as well as the bilateral relationship 
of a number of countries, and the relationship of the world's 
public, you will see that after the admission the whole 
treatment has radically changed. The disposition of the world's 
opinion, of all the leading world's magazines and dailies, as 
well as television stations, is evident, expressed in the 
interest of the public for the maintenance of the integrity of 
an independent state, a member of the world organization. 
Before that, that was not the case. Normally, there were 
various interests, although there was a certain level of support 
with the world's public, though of a totally different quality.

<F P=106> [Report by D.C.: "We Need a More Efficient Economy"] </F>
  [Text] Ohrid, 16 April -- "Our economy is undeniably in a 
difficult situation. However, we must recall that the reason for 
that does not come from a year ago, but has its roots 10 years 
back, when we had a system that could not match the model of the 
western economy. It does not mean that we have to succumb to 
apathy and hopelessness now, but we have to restructure the 
economy and find a way out." This is what the Prime Minister of 
the Macedonian Republic [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] stated in Ohrid today at his meeting with 
Ohrid businessmen, when they discussed the current economic 
situation and the Stabilization program of the Republic of 
Macedonia. 
  "It is very important," the Macedonian Prime Minister 
recalled, ``to state the reasons for such a situation. First of 
all, the Macedonian economy was designed for a market of 22 
million people, and this no longer exists. The economic 
blockades gave rise to great expenditures, such as for 
transport. We estimate that we have incurred more than $3 
billion of damage over the past three years. We have no 
illusions that anyone will give us that money as a gift, because 
there are a lot of interests in the world, and little justice. 
  "In these conditions," Branko Crvenkovski said, ``we were 
exposed to great pressure, whether to wait for better times or 
apply the reforms. We decided to do the latter, although we are 
aware we shall have to pay the costs. Our stabilization program 
was assessed positively by famous international institutions, 
but we must understand that it will not give the expected 
results unless we make structural changes, because we need an 
efficient economy. I mean here transformation of the state 
companies, changes in the banking system, and so on. 
  "We had to start this process, because we had no other 
choice. It hurts, it costs, but I wonder whether we have to 
undertake measures similar to those of our northern neighbor, 
and pay a high price for returning to the reforms. I want to 
remind you that our inflation is below the expected level, the 
exchange rate is stable, our businessmen can plan in a more 
tranquil manner. At this moment, my special concern is the fall 
of productivity and the proper use of capacities in the economy. 
Many companies have the problem of disposing of their goods, 
which means they will have to look for new markets." 
  Branko Crvenkovski also talked about the huge effects 
suffered in Macedonia by the Greek blockade, and he mentioned 
that Greece was under great international pressure, suffering 
attendant damage, nevertheless he pointed out that this did not 
imply that we would be able to use Thessaloniki harbor. "If 
there is any logic, that should happen, but it seems that this 
does not apply to these territories," Macedonian Prime Minister 
Branko Crvenkovski said. 
  The President of the Chamber of Commerce Dusan Petrevski 
also 
spoke on some economic problems at the Ohrid meeting, while 
Minister Jane Miljovski spoke about the transformation of state 
companies and privatization.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Trade: State-Owned Companies Facing </F>
Bankruptcy"] 
  [Text] Up to 95 percent of the state-owned trade companies 
are expected to go bankrupt soon. The reason for this is the 
rapid development of the private trade which finds it easier to 
evade paying tax and customs. If the legal trade calculated 
25-50 percent fiscal dues in its retail prices, it would not be 
able to sell its products, unlike those who fully or partially 
avoid the dues. 
  The money in circulation in the field of trade is 
insufficient and their structure is unfavorable. The largest 
part goes to short-term demand (over 50 percent), the supplies 
are approximately 30 percent, and the funds only seven percent. 
[sentence as received] 
  The non-liquidity of the companies is enormous. By the end 
of February, 991 companies with 9,856 employees had debts, while 
578 companies had their accounts blocked for more than 60 days, 
which automatically fulfills the obligation to initiate 
bankruptcy proceedings. 
  Concerning the wages, 26.4 percent of the employees in this 
sphere have not received wages since December 1993, and this 
average is 15.4 index points above the average for the entire 
economy. The retail trade, in terms of wages, received 21 
percent less money that the average in the economy.

<F P=106> [Commentary by S. Georgievski, "Rating Issue One -- 1994: </F>
Popularity Among People"] 
  [Editorial Report] The 18 March edition of the Skopje 
weekly PULS reports the results of a popularity poll conducted 
during 11-15 March in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
(FYROM) by the Data Press Agency exclusively for PULS. The 
survey provides the first indication of public response to 
leadership changes in the largest Albanian party and is the 
first poll reported since Greece imposed a blockade on 
Macedonia's southern border. 
<H5>  Methodology </H5>
  The survey was conducted by telephone, using a sample of 300 
names chosen from the telephone book, a method which virtually 
eliminated respondents from rural areas (less than 4 percent of 
the sample). According to the polling organization Data Press, 
the respondents are representative of the population in terms of 
sex, age, and educational background. Seventy-five percent of 
the respondents are Macedonian, 19 percent are Albanian, 3.33 
percent are Serbian, 0.33 percent are Turkish, and 2.33 percent 
are from other ethnic groups. While three-fourths of the 
respondents claimed no political affiliation, the rest were 
members of or were sympathetic to a range of political parties: 
12 percent for the Party for Democratic Prosperity and People's 
Democratic Party (two ethnic Albanian parties that are part of 
the governing coalition), 4.67 percent for the Social Democratic 
Alliance of Macedonia (the main party in the governing 
coalition), 2.67 percent for the Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian 
National Unity (or VMRO-DPMNE, an opposition party with the 
largest number of seats in the country's parliament), another 2 
percent for the Liberal Party (a member of the governing 
coalition), and the remaining four percent distributed among the 
55 other parties in Macedonia. Data Press's sample includes: 
20.67 percent unemployed, 42 percent employed in the state 
sector, 10.33 percent working in the private sector, 2.33 
percent students over age 18, and 24.67 percent retired. The 
margin of error for this survey was not given. 
<H5>  Highlights </H5>
  Only five politicians received 50 percent or better approval 
ratings: President Kiro Gligorov (85.63 percent), Assembly 
Chairman Stojan Andov (62 percent), Foreign Minister Stevo 
Crvenkovski (about 60 percent), Interior Minister Ljubomir 
Frckovski (51.67 percent), and Prime Minister Branko Crvenkovski 
(about 51 percent). Gligorov and the two Crvenkovskis have 
maintained their popularity relatively unchanged since a similar 
poll published by PULS in December 1993. Among the more notable 
changes for other politicians were: 
  --the continuing decline in popularity of Democratic Party 
leader Petar Gosev, whose ratings were 52 percent in September 
1993, 49.53 percent in December 1993, and 41.67 percent in the 
most recent poll; 
  --Minister of Defense Vlado Popovski's growing popularity 
from 18 percent in March 1993 to 35 percent in December 1993 and 
48 percent in March. 
  --the increasing prominence of Todor Petrov, an independent 
parliamentarian and notable critic of the government, who was 
not even mentioned in the December 1993 poll but who is now 
viewed favorably by almost half of the survey sample. [See FBIS 
Foreign Media Note 94-028, 25 February, for details of the 
earlier PULS polls and an earlier poll conducted by the "BriMa" 
polling organization, apparently using dissimilar methods.] PULS 
also noted that, despite the VMRO-DPMNE's negative appraisal of 
the government's foreign policy, 75 percent of VMRO-DPMNE 
supporters still viewed Foreign Minister Crvenkovski favorably. 
<H5>  The Ethnic Factor </H5>
  In a popularity ranking of political leaders, ethnicity 
proved to be the most salient factor. Albanian leaders scored 
high among Albanian respondents and low among non-Albanians, as 
for example happened to Djeladin [Xheladin] Murati, the leader 
of one faction of the Albanian Party for Democratic Prosperity, 
who received 94.74 percent approval from Albanian respondents, 
but only a 10.22 percent positive rating from non-Albanians. The 
ethnic factor is also significant in the case of the Macedonian 
nationalist VMRO-DPMNE representatives. For example, the 
approval/disapproval ratings for VMRO-DPMNE leader Ljupco 
Georgievski by ethnicity of the respondents are: Macedonians 
20.89/66.67; Albanians 3.51/91.23; Serbs 20/70; Turks 0/100; and 
other ethnic groups 28.57/57.14. 
  The poll also points to ethnicity as a factor in the ratings 
of Macedonia's president. Only 42.11 percent of Albanians 
surveyed gave Gligorov a positive rating, compared to 96 percent 
of the Macedonians, and nearly 100 percent of the Serbs, Turks, 
and other ethnic groups. Similarly, Stojan Andov received 
approval/disapproval ratings of 22.81/54.39 among Albanians.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ljupco Trpevski, minister without </F>
portfolio, by Vasko Eftov and M. Bozinovska; place and date not 
given: "Strong Measures Lead to Strong Currencies"] 
  [Text] The final verification of the agreement between the 
Macedonian Government [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] and the World Bank will take place in the next 
two to three days. It should result in an $80 million loan. This 
will complete talks, which have lasted more than a month, by a 
Macedonian team headed by Dr. Ljupco Trpevski, minister without 
portfolio. 
  [VECER] Mr. Trpevski, last Tuesday the board of directors of 
the World Bank accepted a structural adjustment program drafted 
by the Macedonian Government. What are the initial impressions 
concerning the possible results? 
  [Trpevski] Last Tuesday, the World Bank Directors approved 
the development policy letter relative to the structural 
adaptation program, as agreed upon in the final months of last 
year with the World Bank. The International Development Agency 
approved a loan of $40 million and the World Bank approved a 
loan of $40 million. It is expected that some time around 14 
February the agreements will be signed and that we shall start 
to repay first all of the $107 million owed, so that we may 
subsequently use the loans. We have already drafted 
documentation submitted to the World Bank for an immediate loan 
of $30 million from the IDA [International Development Agency] 
from imports for the past four months. The balance of up to $80 
million will be received subsequently with a monthly submission 
of import documents. The first $30 million will be used to 
settle the old debt while the balance will go to increasing 
foreign currency reserves and meeting current commitments to the 
World Bank and to the other so-called privileged international 
financial institutions. 
<H5>  Precise Figures </H5>
  [VECER] A number of figures have been mentioned on the 
amount 
of loans we need, totaling $200 million. Is it possible now, 
after the adoption of the program by the boards of directors of 
the International Monetary Fund and the Bank, to cite a specific 
figure of the dollar sum on which we could safely rely? 
  [Trpevski] We can rely on a loan of $80 million from the 
World Bank. Furthermore, we have secured a loan of $35 million 
from the International Monetary Fund, $17.5 million of which 
will be used to repay the amount owed to the bank. The remaining 
$17.5 million will be received toward the middle of the year, 
based on our meeting the stipulations agreed upon with the Fund. 
  [VECER] Therefore, let us mention precise figures: as a 
result of this program we could expect $80 million from the Bank 
and the balance of $50 million if we regularly supply 
documentation on imports, and $17.5 million from the Fund. 
Therefore, at best, we can safely rely on obtaining $97.5 
million. The specially stipulated conditions will have to be met 
for us to obtain the balance of up to $200 million. 
  [Trpevski] This will depend on the way we implement the 
program. It will determine obtaining the remaining $17.5 million 
from the Fund. In the next few months, we shall resume talks 
with the World Bank on a loan for structural adaptation, for $60 
million. Meanwhile, a very positive initiative was launched, 
involving us. We were recently informed of it through a variety 
of channels: a Japanese Government's decision to put together an 
economic package for Macedonia, a substantial share of which 
will be planned jointly with the World Bank, which will 
participate as a co-financier. The World Bank will collect the 
funds which will be subsequently lent to us. Now one of the main 
sources for investments in Macedonia by the World Bank will be 
Japan. 
  [VECER] Let us look at the other loans. To begin with, is it 
necessary to initial a new standby arrangement and obtain the 
second half of the loans from the World Bank, or else will the 
implementation of the present program suffice? 
  [Trpevski] No, we shall initiate talks about a standby 
arrangement but this is not strictly related to the balance of 
the loans. Actually, from our point of view, we would be 
interested in signing a standby or ISAF [expansion unknown] 
arrangement, providing that it is kept, for we know that the STF 
[system transformational loan] arrangement is a preliminary for 
a standby arrangement. Even with the signing of a standby 
arrangement we appear as a country pursuing a stable economic 
policy. 
  [VECER] To sum it up: Does it mean that the standby 
arrangement is not a prerequisite for obtaining the balance of 
the loan from the World Bank? 
  [Trpevski] It is not. The loan depends on whether we meet 
the 
conditions stipulated for the first half of the year. 
  [VECER] Shall we be able to meet these conditions? Inflation 
has already substantially exceeded the projections by something 
like 15 percent. 
  [Trpevski] Inflation is not a parameter. In terms of the 
dynamics of inflation we must apply the other parameters, such 
as wages. 
  [VECER] The second condition is that the privatization must 
yield results. Naturally, when it is a question of obtaining the 
second loan of $60 million, a certain share will be used to 
improve the situation of the banks. However, in the 
privatization area something is obstructing developments. 
  [Trpevski] It is accurate that one of the conditions set by 
the World Bank is that we must show privatization results. I 
believe that there will be no problems, for, based on what we 
have agreed upon, this year essentially the enterprises should 
submit plans for privatization, and the privatization achieved 
so far must be checked. With the control and the approval of the 
privatization carried out so far, certain results will become 
immediately apparent. 
  [VECER] However, circles close to the government have 
indicated that the content of the Privatization Law does not 
meet the full approval of the World Bank. 
  [Trpevski] The World Bank rated the concept most highly. Its 
main remark is that privatization is developing slowly and that 
the bank believes that it must be faster and more extensive. 
<H5>  A New Arrangement </H5>
  [VECER] The signing of a standby arrangement depends to a 
certain extent on the timing--from the second half of this year 
to the start of the next. What is the basis for the government's 
optimism that it would be able to meet the stricter requirements 
earmarked with such an arrangement, if it can be reached prior 
to the elections? 
  [Trpevski] The optimism is essentially based on the fact 
that 
in terms of the conditions we have agreed upon with the Fund for 
concluding an STF arrangement there will be no major difference 
between it and the conditions stipulated in the standby 
arrangement. 
  [VECER] Does the government consider the STF arrangement 
much 
more liberal? 
  [Trpevski] This seems to be the case, based on the 
agreements 
concluded by the Fund with other countries. Meanwhile, we have 
agreed with the Fund on a framework which is much stricter than 
the usual standards, so that we should not expect the standby 
arrangement to stipulate conditions much more difficult than the 
present ones. The difference lies in the consequences of the 
nonfulfillment of the STF or the standby arrangement. In terms 
of the standby arrangement, the Fund is stricter: the agreement 
becomes invalid if the conditions are not met. 
  [VECER] In such a case, would it be politically wise for the 
government to make a standby arrangement before the elections? 
  [Trpevski] It seems to me that the main talks will be held 
during the period of elections. My job is to work on concluding 
the arrangement and let those involved in the political aspects 
determine whether this is wise or not. 
  [VECER] The question inevitably arises whether the 
government 
needs the loans which, with an STF arrangement, will lead to 
concessions that go beyond the usual standards applicable in the 
case of such arrangements. 
  [Trpevski] Generally speaking, these are not concessions. 
They express the belief of the government about the economy, to 
the effect that this is the best way for resolving the situation 
in which we find ourselves, bearing in mind the interests of the 
state and not narrow party interests. The state interest is for 
this country to have a stable economy, for that is the only way 
in which it could participate in international affairs. 
  [VECER] What about the interests of the economy? 
  [Trpevski] They should be the same. It is in the interest of 
the economy to work under conditions of stability and there can 
be no stable conditions if inflation is high. 
  [VECER] You said that we had rejected selective loans to 
finance agriculture, without any pressure on the part of the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The budget will 
reduce its financing of agriculture and this entire burden is 
now being shifted to the banks, which are as yet to improve 
their situation. To what extent would they be able to do so, and 
how much would go to agriculture? 
  [Trpevski] Let us be clear about one thing, to begin with. 
The worst solution is to finance any kind of production by 
printing more money. In most countries, agriculture is given 
some protection. However, all such protection is based on real 
sources. Only thus could we have a healthy noninflationary 
economy. If we agree on this point, I think that there would be 
no problems and we should not raise the question of whether we 
should have selective loans or not. This would mean that such 
selective loans could be abandoned and ensure support from 
budget funds. 
  [VECER] Will there be less budget support? 
  [Trpevski] It is the same as last year's. 
  [VECER] Is this a suitable time for such an operation? 
  [Trpevski] If we wait, tomorrow will be more difficult. 
Postponing this step for the future has brought us to a 
dead-end, and we can no longer go on like this. 
  [VECER] Does such an impasse force us to borrow more to be 
able to repay the old loans? 
  [Trpevski] Yes. In the eyes of the international financing 
institutions we must be viewed as paying old debts regularly. It 
is only thus that we can improve our chances in holding 
discussions with the other two creditors: the Paris and London 
Clubs, in order to settle our debts to them. Such conditions 
must be met before we sit down to talk with the Paris Club. We 
are not in a position to impose upon them our own conditions. To 
begin with, we must have an arrangement with the Fund. The 
second condition is to solve problems related to repaying the 
amounts we owe to these privileged international financial 
institutions. We are doing this. There is also another condition 
that has as yet not been settled (it was settled by Slovenia and 
Croatia). It is the matter of $3 billion of the so-called 
nonallocated share of the debt of former Yugoslavia, so that our 
share would be the one agreed upon according to the quotas 
assigned by the International Monetary Fund. As a government, we 
have not stated our position, but we must do so quickly, for 
without this there will be no talks. 
<H5>  False Dilemmas </H5>
  [VECER] Does this not indicate that, once again, the economy 
will be burdened with new loans? 
  [Trpevski] Let us clear up this issue. We owe the World Bank 
$107 million, which we must repay if we wish to obtain new 
funds. Currently we are repaying this debt in such a way that 
$25 or $30 million will be paid by someone else (the donors). 
This means that in the worst case we would be owing less to the 
bank. Second, one share of the debt, let us say the loan from 
the International Development Agency, is interest-free and we 
repay debts which are interest-bearing so that, if nothing else 
were to happen, at least the interest on the debt has been paid. 
Another share of the loan is repaid from loans granted by the 
Fund and the World Bank under the same or somewhat better 
conditions than we had in the past. 
  [VECER] However, there is a stipulation according to which 
we 
have substantially exceeded the level of indebtedness. 
  [Trpevski] With the conclusion of the arrangement with the 
Fund and settling our obligations to the World Bank and the 
other privileged institutions, as well as membership in the 
International Development Agency, we are engaged in talks with 
the Paris and London Clubs with a view to finding a way to 
reduce our indebtedness. They may agree to this. This is a way 
to relieve the economy. Chances are good that as a result of our 
steps the indebtedness coefficient will be lowered. 
  [VECER] Is it a standard option for IDA members to expect a 
lowering of their indebtedness between 35 and 50 percent in the 
course of their talks with the Paris and London Clubs? 
  [Trpevski] At this point I cannot be more specific. I will 
insist on the need to appoint an expert team for the talks. In 
general, this is not a question of any kind of party 
involvement, for if such were to be the case I would give up. 
  [VECER] When should we expect such talks to begin? 
  [Trpevski] The moment we clear the problems with the World 
Bank and reach an agreement within the government concerning the 
third problem, which is assuming a share of the unallocated 
debt. At that point we shall be prepared to begin the talks, 
above all with the Paris Club. 
  [VECER] What is the latest plan for repaying the $107 
million 
owed to the World Bank? 
  [Trpevski] This is based on the funds supplied by the 
donors, 
estimated at about $25 million. However, the final answer will 
be known by the 14th of this month. For example, Turkey has 
indicated that the $1 million it has pledged will be given to us 
somewhat later. That is why we shall have to use more of the 
funds coming from the Soros Loan. 
  [VECER] The use of the Soros Loan is probably a forced step, 
for the government believed that this option is much more costly 
than the use of foreign currency reserves. 
  [Trpevski] Yes, this option is more costly. However, we have 
already transferred $24 million from the currency reserves, $25 
million from donors, $17.5 million from the Fund, $30 million 
from the IDA and between $11 and $15 million from Soros. 
  [VECER] In the system of repaying our debts, the Netherlands 
is playing a rather sensitive leading role. However, it is 
unclear why, let us say, the European Union was so strict and 
did not allow the FARE [expansion unknown] and the EKO 
[expansion unknown] funds to be used to pay a share of the debt? 
  [Trpevski] In my view, there are three reasons. First, 
bureaucracy is not slow only in Macedonia but virtually 
throughout the world, which also means the European Union. The 
second reason is the budget problems which are affecting all 
members of the European Union, above all due to the deep 
recession. In this case we should also take into consideration 
the influence of our southern neighbor. 
  [VECER] Finally, are you getting ready to be the first 
Macedonian representative to the International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank? 
  [Trpevski] The Macedonian quota is so small that we can have 
no representative at the Fund or the World Bank. For example, in 
our World Bank group the executive director comes from the 
Netherlands, and his deputy from Romania; the representative in 
the Fund is from Ukraine.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jozef Janto: "U.S. Confusion and the </F>
Integration of Europe"] 
  [Text] One of the architects of the Partnership for Peace, 
Deputy Secretary of State Talbott, said at a meeting in our 
capital on Tuesday [12 April] that Slovakia was not in a 
security vacuum. He was reacting to our fears, and those of 
Polish representatives, in particular (he had been to Warsaw the 
day before), that our countries are in the so-called gray 
zone--that is, in a security vacuum between West and East, and 
are almost defenseless. At the same time, he pointed to the 
project for prospective NATO membership, which has been joined 
by 17 East European countries, including former USSR republics. 
Russia, it is a well known fact, is considering joining the 
Partnership for Peace plan. However, if we set Talbott's 
assurances against the most recent statements by U.S. 
politicians and NATO representatives, according to which the 
Partnership for Peace does not provide direct guarantees for 
NATO to come to the aid of countries under threat, we have here, 
to put it mildly, a contradiction. 
  Let us theorize. Despite the nervous statements by Hungarian 
chauvinists, the current situation in Central Europe does not 
give rise to worries about a possible confrontation. However, 
emotions are volatile, and, for two years now, we have seen 
merciless combat operations a few hundred kilometers south of 
our country. Not everything is without problems in the CIS, 
either. 
  We can put this question in a different and a more specific 
way: Does the leading NATO country, the United States, have a 
firm foreign policy on Europe? Talbott said in Bratislava that 
Europe must integrate in terms of the economy and security and 
that the current situation was the most proper for it. Such a 
situation arises once in a hundred years (on this occasion, he 
appreciated our policy and orientation toward European 
integration). We ask this question because the foreign policy 
of the United States--on former Yugoslavia, for example, about 
which no one doubts that it belongs to Europe and not to the 
Islamic world--does not confirm this. U.S. generals said last 
week that they would not intervene in Bosnia. This encouraged 
the Serbs, but they were attacked by U.S. fighter planes on 
Sunday [10 April] and Monday [11 April]. The Muslims, who are 
the most active in the combat, are calling for more U.S. planes 
and even for ground forces. The Americans have some 15,000 
troops in former Yugoslavia (in the UN peacekeeping forces), 
which is about 9,000 fewer then the number of "advisers" in 
Vietnam in 1965. Confusion in U.S. foreign policy also affects 
Moscow's position--not only President Yeltsin's but also that of 
the right and the left opposition, which are shouting that the 
United States did not consult with Russia on the bombing and 
that they reserve for themselves the right to be informed in the 
future. 
  There is no better idea than the unification of Europe. It 
must be said, however, that people have wanted for a long time, 
but there was always someone to put a monkey wrench in the 
works. The Balkans are the biggest monkey wrench now. It is 
precisely in the Balkans that the situation should be sorted out 
in a peaceful manner. But not to the detriment of the Serbs or 
even the Croats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Jana </F>
Pankovcinova and Robert Kotian on 12 April; place not given: 
"Risks of Previous Political Developments Have Not Been 
Overcome"] 
  [Text] [SME] What made you devote such a large part of 
your speech to internal party affairs of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] while presenting the Slovak 
Government Policy Statement [to the Slovak parliament on 12 
April]? 
  [Moravcik] What happened in the HZDS went beyond the 
framework of internal party affairs, in my opinion. I tried to 
explain this in my speech. I believe it is important for 
citizens to understand this and for them to understand also the 
logic of current developments. I think that the risks of 
certain developments we witnessed here have still not been 
overcome. 
  [SME] Your former party colleagues have accused you and the 
government of having personally participated in the policies of 
the HZDS and the former government. Was their criticism voiced 
in the parliamentary debate warranted? 
  [Moravcik] My leaving the HZDS was the logical culmination 
of a string of events. The HZDS took a different course than we 
intended when formulating its program. For this reason, I 
believe that what I did was unavoidable. 
  [SME] On what did you base the assertion in your speech 
today that the HZDS has been misleading its voters since 1992 
and that it has lost some of its voters? 
  [Moravcik] The HZDS electoral program submitted to voters 
two years ago was diametrically opposed to the reality of HZDS 
policy. The program was to a large degree liberal, while the 
practical policy of the HZDS leans toward extremism. There is a 
clear discrepancy here. 
  [SME] How important is the approval of the government's 
Policy Statement from the viewpoint of the IMF mission and its 
approval of a loan for the Slovak Republic? 
  [Moravcik] The Policy Statement lays down principles that 
have been agreed to by IMF and World Bank experts. They 
consider this program positive from the viewpoint of the further 
economic transformation of the Slovak Republic so that its 
approval will facilitate further talks. 
  [SME] Are you confident that your government will obtain the 
required confidence from the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic? 
  [Moravcik] I assume that we will find sufficient support in 
parliament.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 14 April 
on page 2 carries a 600-word TA SR report entitled "Personnel 
Changes Contemplated." The report deals with a meeting of the 
Coalition Council on 13 April, which discussed the situation in 
the mass media and hinted at possible changes in the TA SR 
management. Bratislava REPUBLIKA and Bratislava SLOVENSKY 
DENNIK in Slovak on 15 April both publish reactions by TA SR 
Director General Dusan Kleiman to his possible removal from 
office. 
  The Bratislava PRAVDA report on the 13 April meeting of the 
Coalition Council quotes Vladimir Miskovsky, chairman of the 
National Democratic Party-New Alternative [NDS-NA] Club of 
Deputies, as having said that, at the meeting, "the coalition 
partners considered whether the present TA SR management 
provides sufficient guarantees that the problems of the agency, 
particularly those associated with the publication of the daily 
REPUBLIKA, will be resolved." Miskovsky notes that, while his 
party insists on the replacement of the TA SR management, "the 
position of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] is more 
restrained," which "slows down the solution to this problem." 
The report continues: "Asked whether the name of the candidate 
for the post of TA SR director general is known, Vladimir 
Miskovsky said that the candidate will be nominated by the 
political grouping around Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and that 
the NDS has already expressed its almost definitive agreement 
with this candidate. The Christian Democratic Movement, too, 
has expressed its preliminary agreement, and only the SDL has 
asked for time to think the matter over." Miskovsky reportedly 
did not want to disclose the candidate's name. 
  Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 15 April on page 3 carries 
a 250-word unattributed report entitled "Liquidation of an 
Inconvenient Daily." According to the report, TA SR Director 
General Dusan Kleiman denied any "violation of legal regulations 
in the management of TA SR property" and argued that the true 
motives for the plans to recall him are "to silence the daily 
REPUBLIKA and to retaliate, for political reasons, against the 
TA SR management." In his opinion, the present methods are the 
same as "those our generation experienced at the beginning of 
normalization [reference to period after crushing of Prague 
Spring reform movement by Warsaw Pact troops in 1968], when the 
first thing the normalizers did was liquidate inconvenient 
newspapers and inconvenient journalists." He stresses that "the 
planned intervention against the management of the agency 
demonstrates also before foreign countries the dependence of the 
mass media on the government and the encroachment upon the right 
to freedom of speech by those in power." 
  Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 14 April on page 2 
carries a 500-word ARTERIA-STA-signed report entitled "Revenge 
for the Publication of REPUBLIKA." In the report, Dusan Kleiman 
reiterates that he would regard his possible removal from office 
as "politically motivated." He also affirms the TA SR 
management's efforts to transfer the publishing rights for 
REPUBLIKA to a private entity, in view of REPUBLIKA's gradual 
transformation into an "opinion-forming daily." In this 
context, the report notes: "According to Kleiman, the problem of 
REPUBLIKA dwells in its debt of 18 million korunas [Sk]. The 
entities with which the TA SR has been having talks about 
REPUBLIKA--the Slovak Heritage Foundation, Danubiaprint, and 
some financial institutions--are ready, according to Kleiman, to 
pay for the daily's name, the value of which has been put at 
Sk13.225 million and to take over about Sk7 million of 
REPUBLIKA's debt. No entity is ready, as he said, to take over 
REPUBLIKA for the price of its name, if it has to cover its Sk18 
million debt at the same time, because, in that case, it would 
be impossible to guarantee its profits for a number of years to 
come."

  [Text] Bratislava -- Provisions in the sphere of arms, 
supplies of materials and equipment, and services for the armed 
forces were the central issues discussed by delegations of the 
Slovak and Ukrainian Ministries of Defense in Bratislava 
yesterday. Possibilities of cooperation between military repair 
plants were also discussed. As regards technical provisions, 
the Slovak side expressed interest in, for example, purchasing 
spare parts for tanks, infantry combat vehicles, and radar 
systems. The Slovak Army also needs special fuel for missiles, 
lubricants for the air force, and other special supplies that 
used to be manufactured in the states of the former USSR. The 
two sides agreed to work out lists of offers that they will 
reassess under their own conditions. At their next meeting, 
they will discuss specific requirements and proposals on the 
basis of the two armies' potentials.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Zelenetskiy, commercial counselor at </F>
the Russian Embassy in Bratislava, by Lubo Rabay; place and date 
not given: "Deficits Are Not All the Same; Is Our Balance of 
Trade With Russia Really That Awful?"] 
  [Excerpt] According to Slovak statistics, Slovak imports 
from Russia reached approximately $1.25 billion (41.2 billion 
korunas) last year. In the same period, Slovakia exported to 
Russia industrial products worth only $260 million--that is, 
less than 8.6 billion korunas [Sk]. A comparison of these two 
figures produces a frightening Slovak trade deficit of over Sk32 
billion. Is the deficit really so awful? Yuriy V. Zelenetskiy, 
economic counselor at the Embassy of the Russian Federation to 
the Slovak Republic, has a somewhat different view of the data. 
  [Rabay] You are supposed to have claimed that Slovakia's 
actual trade deficit is several times lower than the official 
statistics suggest. How is that possible? 
  [Zelenetskiy] The problem lies in the statistical method. 
We are of the opinion that, for the sake of objectivity, 
Slovak-Russian and Russian-Slovak trade relations should be 
assessed within the framework of the balance of payments rather 
than that of the trade balance. Only in this way will we arrive 
at an objective picture. 
  [Rabay] Does the balance of trade perhaps not include 
payment relations? 
  [Zelenetskiy] Miraculously, it does not. The balance of 
trade is based only on so-called customs statistics, which only 
register the physical movement of merchandise across borders. 
It does not include a whole range of commercial services that 
Slovakia provides to Russia on Slovak territory, and other facts. 
  [Rabay] But can something that never leaves our country be 
called an export? 
  [Zelenetskiy] Customs statistics do not permit that. It is 
possible using the balance of payments, however. According to 
the customs statistics, Slovakia really exported only about $260 
million worth of merchandise to Russia last year. However, 
during the same period, the Slovak gas industry provided Russia 
with approximately $340 million worth of services in the transit 
of natural gas to West Europe. Russia paid for these services 
in kind--in gas deliveries (according to the bilateral 
agreement, Russia supplied us in this way with 3.7 billion cubic 
meters of natural gas, which is two-thirds of Slovakia's annual 
consumption--editor's note). In the customs statistics, this 
volume figures as an import because the gas was physically 
imported. From the viewpoint of the balance of payments, 
however, this can hardly be qualified other than as $340 million 
worth of exports by the Slovak gas industry to Russia. If you 
included just this sum in the mutual balance of trade, the ratio 
in Slovakia's disfavor would change from five to one to two to 
one. 
  [Rabay] Looking at it from this angle, however, even the 
rest of the gas that Slovakia imports from Russia, as 
compensation for deliveries of capital goods in the 1980's, 
looks more like exports than imports. 
  [Zelenetskiy] Exactly. This concerns deliveries as a 
compensation for past credits, according to the Yamburg 
Agreement. Slovakia does not have to pay for this gas, the 
annual value of which is between $120 and $150 million. This 
sum must again be added to Slovak exports. These exports had 
actually been effected in the past, and the gas supplied to 
Slovakia today is only a repayment of credit in kind. From the 
viewpoint of the balance of trade, last year's $110 million 
worth of deliveries of Russian special equipment belong to the 
same category because a part of former Czechoslovakia's claims 
[in Russia] that fell due to Slovakia was repaid by them. As 
you see, Slovakia's actual trade deficit has shrunk again--to 
approximately $400 million. 
  [Rabay] We have not yet discussed oil purchases.... 
  [Zelenetskiy] The volume of oil supplied by Russia exceeds 
Slovakia's need for oil products. According to unofficial data, 
Slovnaft [Slovakia's sole oil refinery] exports about 40 percent 
of its output, for which it receives foreign exchange, with 
which it pays for the oil. And there is yet another aspect. 
Crude oil that we export to the Czech Republic is being handed 
over to the Czech partner at the Ukrainian-Slovak border. The 
Czech partner pays Slovakia for the transit of this oil across 
the territory of Slovakia, and, once again, this agreement is 
advantageous for Slovakia. Therefore, if we wanted 
realistically to assess Slovakia's trade deficit last year with 
Russia, we would arrive at a sum of only $200 to $250 million.

  [Text] The Republic of Croatia is deeply concerned over the 
developments in eastern Bosnia, particularly around Gorazde and 
other safety zones in that part of our neighboring country, Mate 
Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign 
affairs, has told HINA. 
  The developments in eastern Bosnia, i.e., the looming 
humanitarian catastrophe in Gorazde, undoubtedly represent a 
violation of all UN Security Council resolutions regarding the 
status of that area and require a very clear, unequivocal, and 
effective response by the international community as its 
credibility is at stake, Minister Granic says. 
  Apart from witnessing the tragedy of Gorazde, we are also 
witnessing several very worrying developments clearly directed 
against the attainment of peace in the republics of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina: In Baranja, repeated cases of seizure of 
heavy weapons which had been placed under UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] control in accordance with the so-called Zagreb 
agreement; threats by Serb General Manojlo Milovanovic that 
units of Karadzic's army of the Srpska republic will attack 
targets on the territory of the Republic of Croatia by all 
available means, including missiles; the continuation of ethnic 
cleansing in Prijedor and Banja Luka; the continuation of the 
Serb offensives against Brcko, Orasje, Usora, Bihac, and Tuzla; 
the arrest of a dozen UNPROFOR members; and the closure of 
humanitarian corridors in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It is therefore necessary, Minister Granic said, that at 
this 
moment the international community should not only continue and 
persist in relaunching negotiations in good faith and in 
searching for a generally acceptable and permanent political 
solution, but also in every separate case, it should use all 
legal means, including all the forms of the use of force, as 
laid down by the UN Security Council, to express its consistent 
resolve not to allow the violation of international norms and UN 
resolutions and also of the defined principles and the framework 
for the resolution of the crisis in this part of Europe.

  [Text] Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic received 
today Veljko Knezevic, head of the Zagreb-based Bureau of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who delivered a letter of 
introduction from Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje Kontic. 
  Valentic stressed that the Croatian Government was aware of 
its historic responsibility, stressing that all problems in 
former Yugoslavia could be solved only through negotiations. 
Valentic stressed that there is no alternative to negotiations, 
through which a settlement in the interest of both Croatia and 
Yugoslavia and of the Croatian and the Serb nations ought to be 
attained. He added that the return of refugees was of 
particular importance to Croatia. 
  We should proceed step by step in negotiations. A final 
settlement cannot be reached immediately, Valentic said, 
recalling that Croatia would never agree to ceding any part of 
its territory. The Croatian prime minister also stressed that 
his government would help the work of the Bureau of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb to a maximum degree. 
  Knezevic said that the opening of the Bureau of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in Zagreb and the Office of the Republic 
of Croatia in Belgrade was an initial step in the normalization 
of relations. He also expressed the hope that Croatian Foreign 
Minister Mate Granic and his Yugoslav counterpart Zeljko Simic 
would meet soon. 
  In response, Valentic said that certain conditions would 
have 
to be created first, one of which was the reopening of the 
Zagreb-Belgrade highway. Granic would travel to Belgrade on 
this highway. He asked Knezevic to use his influence through the 
Yugoslav Government so that the Serbs in Knin would continue 
talks with Croatian Government representatives. The Croatian 
prime minister reiterated a firm view that negotiations could be 
held only on the territory of the Republic of Croatia and 
nowhere else. 
  The head of the Bureau of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
in Croatia expressed his pleasure over the way he was received 
in Zagreb and over the working conditions, adding that the 
public in his country was very interested in the gradual 
normalization of relations with Croatia. Knezevic relayed his 
government's stance that Yugoslavia had no territorial claims to 
any part of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
outside the present-day Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He also 
added that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would agree with 
all the solutions achieved in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia on 
the basis of negotiations and in a peaceful way.

<F P=106> [Report by Djordje Gajdosevic] </F>
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Gajdosevic] An agreement on 
separation and creation of a buffer zone between the republic of 
Serbian Krajina [RSK] and Croatia in the part of the territory 
controlled by the Slavonija-Baranja Corps has been signed on the 
premises of UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in Nemetin today. 
The UNPROFOR representatives have established that heavy arms 
had been withdrawn to the appropriate distance and that there 
were no obstacles to the functioning of the agreement signed in 
Zagreb. 
  [Dusan Loncar, general in the Serbian army of the Krajina] 
In a military and tactical sense, by withdrawing to a distance 
of 1.5 km in some places, we have primarily safeguarded the 
safety of our residents, so that nobody within the reach of the 
infantry arms would be endangered, which does not mean that a 
sort of demobilization is starting now. On the contrary. The 
basic stance of all officers and members of the 
Slavonija-Baranja Corps is that we must continue strengthening 
our combat readiness. 
  [Gajdosevic] The UNPROFOR representatives did not hide their 
satisfaction over the signing of the agreement, emphasizing that 
their task is not over yet. 
  [Vim Van Dyke, commander of Sector East, in English with 
superimposed translation] UNPROFOR in the Sector East is ready 
to help the sides in the implementation of the agreement. 
  [Gajdosevic] The representatives of the Serbian army of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina emphasized that the village of 
Mirkovici is mostly under the control of the army of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina. 
  [Vojislav Stojkovic, colonel in the Serbian Army of Krajina] 
One of the most difficult and most controversial points in the 
zone of responsibility of the Slavonija-Baranja Corps was 
precisely Mirkovici. I think that through these talks we have 
succeeded to resolve this issue and, therefore, the separating 
line will not be such as drawn in Annex D of the cease-fire 
agreement, signed in Zagreb on 29 March, but will be 
considerably more favorable for the residents of Mirkovci. 
  [Gajdosevic] The Serbian village of Karadzicevo has ended up 
in the so-called security zone. However, it is emphasized here 
that the Serbian people will be safe. Beside UNPROFOR, 75 of 
our policemen will take care of them, while the army of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina will be 1 km away. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 18 Feb (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, 
president of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], in an interview 
for today's NIN weekly, stated that he "is not opposed to the 
normalization of relations between the Republic of Croatia and 
Yugoslavia." 
  Martic has nothing against "the normalization of relations 
between the republic of Serb Krajina and the Republic of Croatia 
in the foreseeable future," either. 
  For the normalization of relations between Krajina and 
Croatia, Martic stressed, it is necessary to establish permanent 
peace; to this end Croatia should stop its continuous attacks on 
the republic of Serb Krajina. "It has to give up resolving its 
frustrations by force," he said. 
  He said that he is "a pessimist when it comes to the present 
political leadership of Croatia and their real intentions." 
  Martic stressed that Veljko Knezevic, head of the Yugoslav 
bureau in Zagreb, has "connections with Krajina only through 
relatives," and that "if this mission brings about transition 
from the war option to the political option, we in Krajina will 
welcome it." 
  The president of the republic of Serb Krajina stresses that 
he does not believe in the serious intentions of official 
Croatian policy, the aim of which, as far as the opening of the 
Yugoslav bureau in Zagreb is concerned, according to Martic, is 
to "create a picture in the Croatian public that Krajina will in 
that way be reintegrated into Croatia." 
  According to Martic, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
"in 
the light of his past achievements and what he has done for the 
Serb people," is the number one person for the post of president 
of all the Serbs, once all Serb lands unite. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Borislav Mikelic, prime minister-designate </F>
of the republic of Serbian Krajina, by Zivojin Jerotijevic; in 
Belgrade -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Jerotijevic] Mr. Mikelic, since we know that 
you are in a hurry tell us briefly what solutions do you have in 
store as prime minister-designate? 
  [Mikelic] After three months, since the second round of 
elections in the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and a little 
over a month since I have been appointed the prime 
minister-designate of the republic of Serbian Krajina, now on 
the eve of the assembly session which will take place on 20 
April, we have found possibilities to form the government of 
national unity for which I have been striving from the very 
beginning. I must say that really a lot of effort and patience 
has been invested to coordinate views. [passage omitted] 
  I am glad that Dr. Babic has risen above the signing of the 
parliamentary coalition and agreed to the formation of the 
government of national unity. This means that he has placed the 
national interest and the interest of the people above the 
advantages of a parliamentary coalition. We have coordinated 
the approach toward the formation of the government of national 
unity entirely, be it regarding the ministries or personnel 
fine-tuning. What is probably the most important for the 
listeners of Radio Belgrade and Argument Vise [Argument More] 
program is that I have accomplished full accord on all issues 
with [word indistinct] Krajina, that is to say, Dr. Milan Babic. 
[passage omitted] 
  To point out some of the names, I can say that Dr. Milan 
Babic will be foreign minister, Ilija Price interior minister, 
and Dr. Rade Tanjga defense minister, while Dr. Branko Petrovic 
will be economics minister. [Words indistinct] for me to 
enumerate them here. 
  [Jerotijevic] In any case, thanks a lot. The listeners of 
Argument Vise program had the opportunity to hear the first, at 
least, of some of the names of ministers, that is to say, the 
names of the ministers that seem to be the most important. Have 
a good trip, Mr. Mikelic. 
  [Mikelic] Thank you!

<F P=106> [Article by Karlo Jeger: "The Confederation Will Be a Balkan </F>
Superpower: It Will Build Ships, Manufacture Guns, Tanks, and 
Aircraft!"] 
  [Text] The joint military industry of the confederation of 
the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
will surpass the Serbian one in a matter of five years! 
  The formidable military potential of the former Yugoslav 
People's Army [JNA] is what gave the Serbian conquest its main 
strength. However, the Serbs also had supremacy because of the 
military industry in areas under Serb control. 
  On the other hand, after the outbreak of Croat-Muslim 
conflicts, parts of the military industry that remained under 
the control of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army were scattered and dissociated, severed 
from sources of energy and raw materials. Just how much the 
Serbs fear the possibility of these potentials being linked into 
a unified technological process is evident from the fact that 
they, after the first hints of Croat-Muslim unification, carried 
out an air raid on the largest gun factory in the former 
Yugoslavia -- Bratstvo in Novi Travnik. 
<H5>  Overhaul of Supersonic Aircraft </H5>
  At the same time, the Bosnian-Croatian agreement opens the 
possibility of launching an enviable military industry. 
  Prior to the war, Croatia had almost no military industry 
with the exception of shipbuilding. Here we need to mention the 
Skorpik Repair Plant in Sibenik, the well-known large shipyards 
in Split, Rijeka, Pula, and the Shipbuilding Institute 
[Brodarski institut]. Although it will not be possible to 
manufacture a missile launcher or submarine in the near future, 
it will nevertheless be possible to manufacture smaller vessels. 
Although very little is known and virtually nothing is said in 
the public about this topic, it has nevertheless been announced 
that Croatia has long since mastered the manufacture of weapons 
in garages and workshops. 
  According to officially published data, the manufacture of 
small arms includes the industrial manufacture of hand guns (PHP 
-- Prvi hrvatski pistolj [the first Croatian hand gun] similar 
to the Walther), sniper rifles (12.7 mm, 7.9 mm, and a third 
variant of NATO caliber), and machine guns, copies of the 
Israeli Uzi. The Pleter, Sokac, and Zagi were experimental 
projects. A superior variant of the Kalashnikov, similar to the 
Israeli 7.62 mm (?Ghalib), is also manufactured. Moreover, also 
in production are several types of mines and explosives, mortars 
of all calibers with the appropriate and even very advanced 
shells, recoilless guns and shells, as well as light portable 
antiaircraft systems. 
  The achieved level of production guarantees the successful 
mastering of the manufacture of other infantry automatic and 
semi-automatic weapons. Hand grenades are also manufactured.... 
  Infantry land mines [lezece mine] (20 types) are also being 
produced. 
  The repair of supersonic aircraft and engines has been 
revived very quickly. The same applies to the repair of guns 
and howitzers. 
  However, the largest, already installed and internationally 
renowned munitions plants of the possible future confederation 
are in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The HVO in Vitez controls perhaps the largest European plant 
manufacturing gunpowder, jet fuel [raketno gorivo], and 
explosives. The Osa project, for which the problem was jet 
fuel, has become a reality after the liberation of Vitez. The 
production of high-quality jet fuel for all types and calibers 
of multiple rocket launchers, gunpowder for all types of 
artillery, and all types of explosives can resume immediately in 
the untouched factory halls of the Vitez plant. Even prior to 
the Croat-Muslim conflicts, the production of gunpowder for 
infantry weapons had been mastered in Vitez.... The 
installation for the production of jet fuel for long-range Orkan 
missiles alone has the capacity of 2,000 pieces per year. 
<H5>  A Plant Worth $1 Billion </H5>
  When the HVO took over the plant, some 4,000 finished 
missile 
charges, which should have been shipped to Iraq, were still in 
the warehouse! 
  The value of the Vitez plant is estimated to be $1 billion. 
Moreover, conserved within the plant perimeter, as a war 
reserve, is a completely usable older version of a technology 
line for the production of gunpowder, which can be assembled 
quickly. 
  It is certain that the Serbs will not be able to achieve the 
technological level of the Vitez plant for a very long time. 
  The HVO also controls the former Soko aircraft plant in 
Mostar. Although the Serbs have rescued a part of the equipment, 
with certain investments the plant could be renewed, if not for 
the manufacture of whole aircraft, then for at least the 
manufacture of parts for large international companies and 
high-quality repair of aircraft. In addition to that, large 
amounts of parts from which aircraft could be assembled have 
remained in warehouses throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina (in 
Busovaca, near Tuzla....). Moreover, there is a significant 
amount of missiles in storage in Bosnia-Herzegovina that the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army could not use. They are air-to-surface 
missiles (Munja RZ-57). 
  The largest plant for the manufacture of guns and multiple 
rocket launchers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia is in 
Novi Travnik, under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. 
The RAK-12, a copy of the Plamen, is manufactured in Croatia. 
Apart from repairs of all types of artillery, the Novi Travnik 
plant used to manufacture guns and howitzers of all calibers, 
from the 75-mm hill gun to the 155-mm howitzer. In preparation 
for the manufacture of Kolos, equipment was installed for the 
manufacture of 203-mm gun barrels. All types of mortars and 
mortar shells were also manufactured. It needs to be said that 
the manufacture of barrels is very important, since they are 
being mercilessly used, and it is known they become worn down 
through wear and tear. Mortars and mortar shells are 
manufactured in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Tesanj. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army also controls a large repair 
plant for infantry weapons. 
  The Slavko Rodic plant from Bugojno, currently under Serb 
attack, manufactures all types of detonators, both for artillery 
and aircraft weaponry. Although the Serbs have also developed a 
plant for manufacturing detonators in Valjevo, they do not have 
the capacity for manufacturing the most modern radio detonators. 
Orkan missiles, which landed on Jastrebarsko [village in the 
vicinity of Zagreb], were equipped with the poorer variant of 
electronic detonators manufactured in Krusik in Valjevo, unlike 
the ones manufactured in Slavko Rodic in Bugojno. 
<H5>  Ammunition for NATO </H5>
  In Konjic, in the vicinity of the underground command 
headquarters built for the former Presidency of the Socialist 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the JNA General Staff, dug 
deep into the ground is the Igman plant, which manufactures 
ammunition. The technology of the plant is superior to that of 
its twin, the Prvi Partizan Munitions Plant in Uzice, and it has 
the capacity to manufacture several million pieces per month. 
The fact that this plant used to manufacture ammunition for 
NATO speaks for its quality. It manufactures all types of 
ammunition up to 12.7-mm caliber. By using old shells, the 
ironworks in Zenica has begun manufacturing ammunition of 105-mm 
and 122-mm caliber.... There is a possibility that, by using 
barrels from the one-time JNA warehouses, the Muslims in Novi 
Travnik have managed to manufacture a Kalashnikov. 
  In Gorazde, there is a plant that manufactures cartridges, 
the only significant segment of the military industry that did 
not have a twin in Serbia. In Vitkovici near Gorazde, there is 
a chemical plant that manufactures substances for the 
manufacture of explosives. 
  If to this we add the former assembly line for assembling 
tanks in Slavonski Brod, the potential of the future confederal 
military industry will be enviable! 
  The Zenica ironworks can manufacture tin for armor and can 
manufacture the cupola, while the engine can be bought. 
However, it is even more important that it can produce fast 
armored vehicles.... 
<H5>  All the Plants in Serbia </H5>
  A significant amount of documents of the UNIS Institute for 
special purposes production has remained in Sarajevo under the 
control of the Bosniaks and Croats. Unfortunately, the Serbs 
completely destroyed the Zrak plant in Sarajevo, which 
specialized in the manufacture of sights. 
  The military industry of the former JNA was designed in such 
a way that it could produce arms and all the material necessary 
for the "national defense," completely independently and in 
total isolation. Almost all the plants of the military industry 
were located in the central mountain areas of the former joint 
country. Such distribution was justified by the strategic needs 
of conducting a national defense war, but at the same time 
Serbia became completely independent and autonomous in 
manufacturing arms, whereas the other republics were put in a 
position of technological and productional dependence on each 
other. 
  For example, plastic ramps for rocket launchers and engines 
were manufactured at Kamnik in Slovenia, the gunpowder came from 
Vitez, sights from Sarajevo, rockets from Vogosce.... The final 
assembly was done in Prilep in Macedonia. 
  The explosives plant Slobodan Princip-Seljo in Vitez had 
developed a technology for manufacturing plastic explosives, but 
then the entire plant was trasferred to Ivangrad in Montenegro. 
Until 1992, its integral capacity exceeded the requirments of 
the rump "Yugoslavia" by four times. At the same time, the 
former federal army built parallel plants on the territory of 
Serbia and Montenegro wherever it was possible. 
  For example, the "twin" of the Vitez Gunpowder and 
Explosives 
Plant was the Prva iskra plant in Barici in Serbia; the twin of 
the aircraft plant Soko in Mostar is Utva in Pancevo; the Slavko 
Rodic detonator plant in Bugojno has a twin in Krusik in 
Valjevo; the Konjic ammunition plant's twin is Prvi partizan in 
Uzice; the pyrotechnics plant in Gorazde has two twins: Krusik 
in Valjevo and Sloboda in Cacak. The FAMOS engine plant in 
Sarajevo also had two twins: the Engine Industry [Industrija 
motora] in Rakovica near Belgrade and FAP in Priboj. 
  The Zrak plant in Sarajevo, which manufactured sights, had a 
twin in the Teleoptik plant in Belgrade. 
  The Military Medical Academy [VMA] in Banjica [Belgrade 
district] dealt with all aspects of military medicine -- 
development of medical care, surgery in war, and protection from 
nuclear, chemical, and biological arms. 
  All these institutions were equipped with the most 
sophisticated equipment and technology. The centrifuge at 
Batajnica [military airport near Belgrade], for studying pilots' 
behavior under extremely hard flight conditions, alone cost over 
$1 million. 
  Prototypes manufactured under license, as well as those 
manufactured in industrial plants at home, and imported weapons, 
were also tested near Belgrade -- in the Air Force Center for 
Experiments [Vazduhoplovni opitni centar] in Batajnica, and the 
Infantry Center for Experiments [Opitni centar kopnene vojske] 
in Nikinci in Srijem. Moreover, there was a Technical Center 
for Experiments [Tehnicki opitni centar] on Prevlaka, from which 
the Serbs managed to withdraw the equipment and transfer it to 
the Montenegrin side. 
<H5>  The Supersonic Aircraft -- Out of the Question! </H5>
  The restructuring of the military-industrial complex of the 
remainder of Yugoslavia began in the summer of 1992. However, 
despite being almost fully equipped in terms of technology, the 
Serbs still have not managed to renew the manufacture of all 
types of weaponry. 
  The manufacture of the Orao [Eagle] aircraft has been cut 
short and is no longer mentioned. There can be no question of 
developing the new supersonic aircraft. That task proved to be 
too hard even for the entire military industry of the former 
Yugoslavia, and it is too hard for the present Serbian industry. 
  The manufacture of Gazelle SA-341/24L helicopters also has 
not been revived, that used to be manufactured on French license 
in Mostar. Informed sources claim that the Serbs cannot even 
master the overhaul of a MiG-21, which used to be done in Velika 
Gorica, despite the fact that they have taken with them the 
greater part of the machinery and special tools, completed new 
assembly halls in Pancevo that measure three kilometers, and 
constructed a new runway adjacent to the plant.... 
  Almost all of the internationally renowned engineers and 
craftsmen from Soko, who, apart from fulfilling the requirements 
of the former army also worked for major international aircraft 
corporations like Boeing, Airbus, Dornier.... have remained 
behind in Mostar. The same happened in the case of the Velika 
Gorica Repair Plant [Remontni zavod]. 
  On the other hand, the greatest achievement of the Utva 
[Wild 
Duck] aircraft plant in Pancevo was the manufacture of light 
propeller planes Utva-75. The serial production of the 
propeller- powered Lasta [Swallow] training aircraft never even 
got off the ground in Pancevo. Moreover, there can be no talk 
of an independent serial production of jet planes for as long as 
the sanctions are in place. 
  The Serbs did not even try to revive production for navy 
requirements. Even the existing vessels in Boka are under a 
thick layer of rust. 
<H5>  Vessels Under Thick Layers of Rust </H5>
  In addition to the plants for infantry requirements that 
were 
already on their territory prior to the outbreak of war, the 
Serbs have managed to replace the plants they lost in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The majority of the Serbian military 
industry is located along the East and West Morava Rivers, and 
in Belgrade, while another part is in Bosnia under the control 
of Karadzic's forces. 
  The Crvena Zastava Institute [Zavodi Crvena zastava] from 
Kragujevac is the strongest point of the Serbian military 
industry. All types of infantry weapons and antiaircraft guns up 
to 40-mm caliber are manufactured there. The latest of their 
products are the 9-mm hand gun (the production of which has been 
transferred to the SARID 13 plant in Smederevo), a 12.7-mm 
sniper rifle, and a 40-mm infantry grenade launcher. 
  Also manufactured there is the Kragujevac automatic rifle, 
fashioned on license after the Russian AK-47, which the Croatian 
soldiers have named "ciganka" [gypsy]. 
  Krusik from Valjevo manufactures all types of light 
armor-piercing missile systems, and the licensed guided 
armor-piercing missiles AT-2 and AT-3. They are also planning 
to manufacture an AT-4. Prior to the war, they also 
manufactured Strela-2M, a light portable antiaircraft system, 
and preparations were underway for the licensed production of 
the Igla, another light antiaircraft system. 
  Moreover, guided 128 mm air-to-surface Munja missiles and 
57-mm BR-1 missiles are manufactured in Valjevo. 
<H5>  The Serbs Have Run Out of Money! </H5>
  According to unconfirmed information, rockets for the 
Plamen, 
Oganj, and Orkan multiple rocket launchers are also manufactured 
in Valjevo. 
  All types of infantry ammunition is manufactured in the Prvi 
Partizan plant in Lucani near Cacak, while gunpowder for 
infantry ammunition is produced in the Milan Blagojevic plant. 
The main manufacturer of jet fuel is Prva Iskra from Baric. 
  The strongest Serbian munitions plant in Bosnia is in the 
UNIS complex in Vogosca, where all types and calibers of 
artillery ammunition are produced. 
  According to foreign sources, the Serbs have managed to 
revive the production and repair of 100-mm and 125-mm tank guns, 
and repair of all other types of artillery pieces. 
  In a recent brief statement issued by the Supreme Council of 
National Defense, it was stated that the army would only finance 
priority projects that are of vital significance for the defense 
of the country, and salaries and pensions of officers. All 
investments and new projects will be discontinued. The recent 
strike of the workers from the Crvena zastava plant implies that 
Milosevic's promise that the Kragujevac plant would work, if 
need be, in three shifts, is going to be very difficult to 
fulfill. 
  Toward the end of 1993, the entire Serbian industrial 
production dropped to some 30 percent of its pre-war level. 
Half of this production was military production for the purpose 
of keeping the conquered territories in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Pitiful salaries, insufficient for even bare survival, have 
led to a massive departure of the highly qualified cadres, who 
primarily moved overseas. The people with a technical education 
were joined by experts from numerous military technical 
institutes and plants. 
  The second important point is a standstill in the 
development 
of almost finished projects, and an end of investments into new 
weapons' technology. Serbia simply no longer has any money for 
this. 
  The substantial military-technical documentation, stored in 
Belgrade, will simply become outdated. The immense knowledge in 
the field of production of arms and military hardware, paid for 
with the money from all the republics of the former Yugoslavia, 
will become completely useless.

<F P=106> [Article by Damir Jurisic: "Moles, Agents, and Provocateurs"] </F>
  [Text] Is the Republic of Croatia facing early elections, 
as Tihomil Radja, vice president of the HSS [Croatian Peasant 
Party], has asserted in VECERNJI LIST? This is a question which 
has another two more important ones in the background: Who in 
the government is thinking of organizing those elections and to 
what purpose? Aside from that, Radja's assertion about a 
"mentor" from the government who ordered a split in the HSS is 
the finale of these 12 months since the election, during which 
most of Croatia's parliamentary parties--from the HSP [Croatian 
Rights Party], DA [Dalmatian Action], SDH [Social Democrats of 
Croatia], IDS [Istrian Democratic Conference] to the HSS--have 
been less concerned with politics and more with hunting "moles" 
and "agents provocateurs of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union]" 
in their own ranks. Which gives rise to a new question: If the 
stories about the moles are accurate, who in the HDZ planted 
them, the soft line or the hard line? 
  Finally, are there moles even in the very top leadership of 
the HDZ? We might well ask ourselves following the public 
statements by Stipe Mesic, president of the Sabor [Croatian 
Assembly], and Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of 
Zupanijas. Mesic has not only displayed a lack of party 
discipline by refusing--say well-informed sources--Dr. Tudjman's 
request that he submit his resignation, but has confused the 
public with his statement in GLOBUS that many decisions in 
Croatia are being made by the "force of authority, not by force 
of law" and that some of the members of the HDZ have taken over 
the "bolshevik model of thought and political behavior." He had 
something equally important to say in SLOBODNA DALMACIJA to the 
effect that the Washington agreement is a victory for the 
original HDZ, and a defeat for the "current which favored war." 
<H5>  Continuity or Change of Direction </H5>
  At just about the same time, Josip Manolic in FERAL was 
calling upon Gojko Susak, defense minister, to take 
responsibility and resign because of the Muslim-Croatian 
conflict, and indirectly President Tudjman himself for the 
erroneously chosen policy of the HDZ, and thereby also that of 
the Croatian state, toward Bosnia and Herzegovina. Manolic, say 
sources close to the top leadership of the HDZ, also broke with 
party discipline and violated the decision to interpret the 
signing of the Washington agreement as expressive of the 
continuity of HDZ policy, rather than as a change of direction. 
  Can the policy of the state be conducted without exchanges 
of 
fire between responsible statesmen along party lines, especially 
in decisive moments, the citizen-voters are wondering and 
remaining confused as to whether Mesic, Manolic, and the 
president of the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party] are on the 
same line? And why now? As Drazen Budisa says in GLOBUS, it 
should be explained to every one of our citizens that the 
opposition has been in favor of an integral Bosnia and 
Herzegovina from the beginning. Is not Zdravko Tomac of the SDP 
[Social Democratic Party] more sober and wiser when he warns in 
NEDELJNA DALMACIJA that this is the time for the highest degree 
of Croatian concord, that everything should be subordinated to 
reestablishment of Croatian authority over the entire territory, 
that maturity should be shown, and there should be no rejoicing 
when leaders of the HDZ interpret the new decisions as proof of 
the correctness of their Croatian policy conducted toward Bosnia 
and Herzegovina up to now? 
  So, if, as the speculation runs in Zagreb political 
corridors, an early election to the Sabor is the objective of 
the Mesic and Manolic current, what is expected? The result is 
allegedly supposed to be a weakening of the right wing of the 
HDZ and, with the establishment of new coalitions among the 
winners, constitutional and legal changes that would restrict 
the authority of the president of the state to the advantage of 
the Sabor. Would that compel President Tudjman to listen to 
them, in spite of his legitimate five-year term, why would the 
government have to schedule new elections for president? These 
questions will nevertheless remain at the level of speculation, 
because an "early" election for the deputies in the Croatian 
parliament is called by--the president of the state! 
  So the real question is whether the president of the state 
wants an early election to the Sabor, and could these dissonant 
tones within the HDZ hurt him? What can the Mesic-Manolic 
"faction" do? They can capitalize on the assumed political power 
and influence of their parliamentary posts only to the real 
limits of their influence on the coercive agencies: the army, 
the police, and--most important in domestic political 
conflicts--the state treasury. 
<H5>  Integration and Confederation </H5>
  That influence, say the well-informed, is not nearly what it 
would have to be to mount even a small threat to the president 
of the state. There is evidence that that is the case in the 
fact that Josip Manolic presented his argument to the public 
through FERAL. The impact is only a bit greater than if he had 
given the interview to HRVATSKA LJEVICA, whose managing editor 
Stipe Suvar put on the front page of the first issue (could it 
be an accident?) a 1946 poster of Andrija Maurovic with the 
caption "Long Live Election to the Constitutional Assembly, an 
Expression of the Statehood and Sovereignty of the People of 
Croatia"!? 
  At the moment President Tudjman certainly has no reason to 
call an extraordinary parliamentary election. What is more, as 
the political realists suggest, there are also not many reasons 
for a referendum on confederation of Croatia with the federation 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A customs union between the two 
countries would be sufficient for the beginning. Aside from 
that, although the first solicitor general, Smiljko Sokol, has 
said on Croatian TV that only the percentage of votes "in favor" 
in the referendum on confederation is important--so that it 
would be valid even without being conducted on the occupied 
parts of Croatia--the attitude of the public is summed up in the 
formula: first, return of what has been occupied, and then 
possible alliances with other states.

  [Text] Under the adopted law, the beneficiary of a 
"beautiful eyes" type of loan is obligated to settle the unpaid 
value of the loan with the bank all at once. 
  The Croatian Fund for Privatization expects that the Law on 
the Invalidity of Certain Types of Security Agreements and Loan 
Agreements, which went into effect about a month ago, will 
change the disposition structure of stock shares and their 
owners that is already in place. 
  In simplified terms, this concerns legal regulation of what 
are known as (arbitrary, irregular) managerial loans, so that in 
response to Croatian public agitation the government has reacted 
with legal propositions to prevent the purchase of enterprises 
on credit, which is generally approved, insiders say, because of 
"beautiful eyes." 
  The law expressly states that subscribed stock shares cannot 
serve as security to cover claims from loan agreements for the 
purchase of enterprises. Thus, loan agreements between banks and 
a physical person (primarily managers have come forward) based 
on redeemed old foreign exchange savings or on security through 
subscribed stock are invalidated. Also invalidated are 
agreements entered into with participation less than 10 percent 
of the loan value, those entered into for a term longer than 
seven years or with an interest rate lower than 5 percent, and 
loans agreed to without a foreign exchange clause or if their 
"grace period" is longer than 12 months, but also those agreed 
to without security from a mortgage on real property where the 
appraised value is at least 70 percent of the loan amount. 
  The beneficiary of a "beautiful eyes" type of loan is 
obligated to settle the unpaid value of the loan with the bank 
all at once. But if the unpaid portion has not been returned to 
the bank by the day on which the agreement is deemed invalid, 
the agreement concluded between the loan beneficiary and the 
Croatian Fund for Privatization is also invalidated, in which 
case the Fund becomes the owner of the stock purchased with that 
loan. 
  This is the part of the legislation that signifies for the 
Croatian Fund for Privatization a change in the ownership 
structure, because initial assessments indicate that approved 
managerial loans in the past period of time have not undergone 
additional treatment that would result in their conformance to 
the provisions of the law. At least as far as the Split office 
of the Croatian Fund for Privatization is concerned, this will 
mean a change in the ownership structure of, for example, the 
Primosten hotels, or even "Univerzal" or "Kamen" in Split. 
Indeed, information on conforming such loans to the norms 
imposed by the law has not arrived from "Split Bank." 
  As Josko Ivacic, the director of the Split office, pointed 
out, all the names of people holding managerial loans without 
backing will be made public, and that will happen very soon 
because it will be necessary to transfer stock purchased with 
managerial loans to the Fund's portfolio. In addition, Ivacic 
says that it will be interesting to determine the names of the 
untried owners, which Ivacic says are primarily people without 
party affiliations, which will refute talk of how only one party 
is involved in these dealings. 
  Also bearing the "brunt" of this law's articles are all 
agreements concluded since 1 May 1991, naturally if they 
conflict with the provisions of this law. The Public 
Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Croatia will bring 
charges to establish the invalidity of agreements.

<F P=106> [Interview with Grzegorz Dziemidowicz, Ministry of Foreign </F>
Affairs press spokesman, by Katarzyna Janowska; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Janowska] Klaus Kinkel, former German foreign 
minister [as published], said recently that the admission of 
Poland and Hungary into the European Twelve would be a serious 
mistake because of the economic backwardness of both countries. 
He is not isolated in his opinion as far as Western diplomats 
are concerned. So what chances do we have? 
  [Dziemidowicz] Poland's admission into the European Union 
[EU] will not take place tomorrow or even the day after. Our 
full integration is a question of at least 10 years. First the 
Union must "digest" our offer, as it were. This could take two 
or three years. Only then would the real negotiation begin, in 
respect of the terms of our accession and its precise date. It 
could be that the option they adopt will be that of granting 
Poland membership of the Union's political structures first and 
economic structures later. However, all that will be the 
subject of the eventual negotiation process. 
  [Janowska] Precisely. Western politicians claim that Poland 
will find it easier to join the Western European Union, which is 
the political suprastructure for the Communities rather than 
their economic structures. 
  [Dziemidowicz] It is hard to tell now whether that is really 
what will happen. 
  [Janowska] Politicians of the European Twelve stress very 
strongly Poland's economic backwardness in relation to the 
Union's member states. 
  [Dziemidowicz] I believe that backwardness is too strong a 
term here. 
  [Janowska] But it is true that such disproportion exists. 
  [Dziemidowicz] Indeed, in respect of such countries as 
France, Germany, and Britain. On the other hand, we can compare 
Poland with Greece or Portugal at the time when those two were 
applying for membership in the EEC. The disproportion between 
the condition of their economies then and that of our economy 
now is not as drastic as that. During their years in the EEC, 
those countries made enormous progress. I believe that in our 
case, too, these economic disparities will disappear very 
quickly. In the end, it will be the political will of the 
European Twelve that will decide our membership. 
  [Janowska] But can we really compare ourselves with Greece 
or Portugal at a time when our national per capita income in 
Poland does not exceed $2,000 a year? 
  [Dziemidowicz] We are not only looking at present-day 
comparisons here. During the past few years, very rapid 
economic progress, especially involving privatization, occurred 
in Poland. Changes are now taking place much more quickly than 
any of the past prognoses could have predicted. 
  [Janowska] In an interview he gave to RZECZPOSPOLITA, Czech 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus criticized the proposal for Poland 
and Hungary to join the Union. He stated that the Czech 
Republic would not be submitting its application to join the 
Union but that it would nevertheless find itself among the 
European Twelve earlier than we. What is the Polish Foreign 
Ministry's reaction to this? 
  [Dziemidowicz] I would not say that Prime Minister Klaus 
criticized us. The Czech Republic is simply choosing a 
different way. Apart from that, Poland and Hungary are already 
associated with the EU, while the Czech Republic still is not. 
This situation changes the perspective slightly. Each country 
chooses its own preferred and most convenient way to the Union. 
It is neither the Olympic Games nor a race. The objective of 
all four countries in the Visegrad Group is to join the EU 
eventually, and we should wish each other the speediest 
fulfillment of that objective.

<F P=106> [Article by Bernt Conrad on interview with Prime Minister </F>
Waldemar Pawlak in Bonn; date of interview not given: "Pawlak 
Satisfied With Kohl's Support"] 
  [Text] Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak wants to 
"solve for good" the problem of smooth border traffic between 
Germany and Poland within two to three years. He said so in an 
interview with DIE WELT after concluding talks in Bonn. 
  Pawlak stated that the currently hopelessly crowded border 
checkpoints at the Oder and Neisse Rivers should be addressed 
and the transport infrastructure decidedly improved. This 
includes the construction of five new bridges, the establishment 
of four new border checkpoints, and an extension of the 
Berlin-Warsaw-Minsk-Moscow highway, the Wroclaw-Katowice-Krakow 
highway, and the already initiated modernization of the 
Berlin-Warsaw railway line. These projects will soon be 
discussed by a German-Polish working group initiated by Kohl and 
Pawlak. 
  The 34-year-old government head, who promoted investment in 
Poland during his visit to the Daimler-Benz company in Stuttgart 
yesterday, also intends to tackle the mounting, sensitive 
problem of car thefts in the FRG by Polish thieves. "Rapid 
exchange of information is of utmost importance for the police 
in this connection," he said in the interview with DIE WELT. 
The better-equipped criminals are taking advantage of the still 
very poor technology used by the Polish police. This should 
change in the coming years. Yet, Pawlak added: "I am cautious 
as far as promises are concerned." 
  Pawlak did not shirk the question as to whether and how the 
leftist government of former communists and the Peasant Party, 
which he leads, intend to pursue market-economy reform: "Our 
main objectives are democracy and the social market economy--on 
the basis of social stability and evolution, and without shock 
therapy. What we need is wide acceptance of reform by the 
population." With great emphasis, the leader of the Peasant 
Party pointed to the significant decrease in the rate of 
inflation and 10-percent production growth in the first quarter 
of 1994. "These are signs of a stable economic situation." 
  Pawlak noted with satisfaction Kohl's support for leading 
Poland toward the European Union and NATO. Regarding Moscow's 
objection to his country's NATO membership and that of other 
Central-East European reformist states, the prime minister said: 
"Russia had said yes before, but NATO did not react quickly 
enough and Russia changed its mind. I think the chances are not 
bad if we are all determined." He said that military aggression 
was not an acute danger but "a danger in the form of chaos. 
This can lead to most serious consequences. The former 
Yugoslavia should serve as a warning to all of us." Pawlak's 
conclusion: "The important thing is cooperation in partnership. 
This can be a solid basis also for security."

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Krzysztof </F>
Skowronski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of 
Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today is Sejm 
Speaker Mr. Jozef Oleksy. Good morning to you, Sir. 
  [Oleksy] Good morning. 
  [Skowronski] Are you in favor of amendments to the Small 
Constitution that would limit the president's powers? 
  [Oleksy] No, I think that right now, there is no situation 
where one would have to think about this as something very 
urgent. Work on a new constitution is going on, and I am of the 
view that the longer it takes to complete work on the new 
Constitution, the more often we can have situations--in these 
times, full of tension--where one can be tempted to make 
corrections to the Small Constitution now in force. The problem 
is that the Small Constitution's provisions are somewhat unclear 
on certain points that require interpretation, or that, for 
democracy's sake, require extensive interpretation. We have had 
such motions coming from the president regarding the 
Constitutional Tribunal and the ultimate nature of its powers. 
That is a very major amendment to the Constitution and also a 
change in the legal system and in the courts' verdicts and the 
judicial system. There have also been such cases pertaining to 
other issues, and, as we know, today a motion by Sejm deputies 
was submitted to have Article 68 changed precisely so as to 
define with greater precision situations in which there are 
deadlocks such as we are having now. The coalition wants to 
change something in the Council of Ministers, and the president 
is of a different view, and there is no further [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Skowronski] Will Article 68 be changed? 
  [Oleksy] I beg your pardon? 
  [Skowronski] Will Article 68 be changed? 
  [Oleksy] I do not know because it is just a proposal. It 
will be debated like any other proposal. I do not think there 
is a chance for that at the next session, but, when it comes to 
May... [Oleksy pauses] As usual, we think constitutional issues 
are a priority and the issue will be debated. Constitutional 
procedures require a big majority--two-thirds--so, knowing the 
president's position...[Oleksy pauses] One must assume that he 
will refuse to sign the amendment. We will perhaps be able to 
take a stand on the president's veto. It is quite a lengthy 
procedure and it does not happen immediately. The excitement 
that was created surrounding this issue, which I encountered on 
my return from Japan, is out of proportion compared to the 
initiative's essence and nature. 
  [Skowronski] Where were you when the news broke that the 
president said that, if parliament attempts to limit his powers, 
he would try and dissolve it? 
  [Oleksy] That was a shocking piece of news; we were on our 
way home from Japan. I must say I began thinking deeply about 
the president's statement because it is dangerous for the 
essence of democracy in Poland. 
  [Skowronski] And instrumental attempts to amend the 
Constitution are not dangerous to democracy in Poland? 
  [Oleksy] If that is the way you interpret it.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] How else could one interpret it? 
  [Oleksy] If one interprets it as some kind of revenge by the 
coalition or its attempt to fight the president or to limit his 
powers, there is indeed a source of emotion. But this is not 
how I perceive this. As I said, I perceive it to be an attempt 
to make constitutional provisions more specific so as to prevent 
deadlocks and dead-end situations when the coalition and the 
president may differ on personnel changes. But if one 
interprets this the way the propaganda currently has been 
portraying it for two or three days--namely, that it is a field 
for a coalition-presidential battle--it is really no surprise 
that there are all these emotions around. 
  [Skowronski] But, in the end, it really is the field of a 
battle between the coalition and the president. 
  [Oleksy] I think not. I think it is just an attempt to 
overcome the deadlock in a situation of a very tough position 
vis-a-vis [words indistinct] an important post in the government. 
  [Skowronski] Why is the coalition not capable of giving up 
on Dariusz Rosati? 
  [Oleksy] I am not sure whether it is not capable of doing 
that. From what I hear, it is a question of talks with the 
president, and I do not think there is anyone in the coalition 
who thinks along the lines of forcing the president to change 
his position. The president has a constitutional right not to 
sign a proposed nomination. So I do not make the assumption 
that this is some attempt to force the president to sign a 
nomination, but it could be an attempt to force him to initiate 
talks. In that regard, all I can do is make an appeal that 
these talks take place. Otherwise, all this will begin getting 
ridiculous in Poland. 
  [Skowronski] You often meet with Lech Walesa. Why can you 
not lead up to a coalition-president meeting? Is that so hard? 
From where does the main resistance come? 
  [Oleksy] I have not taken this kind of responsibility upon 
myself, even though I have conducted such talks with the 
president. Moreover, I cannot see resistance to talks on the 
part of the president. 
  [Skowronski] So who resists then? 
  [Oleksy] There is resistance with regard to just one 
situation. The president has talked to me about it, too, so he 
is persistent in that regard--namely, that he refuses to talk 
about the specific candidacy. The coalition knows that. But, 
for its part, the coalition wants the talks to be of a wider 
scope--that is, going beyond just this one issue. As far as I 
know, the coalition fears that the president wants to discuss 
just the finance minister nomination and nothing else. But, in 
my mind, and in all the efforts I have been making since I 
became Sejm speaker, the point is to have talks as an obvious 
mechanism of cooperation among the state's supreme agencies. If 
the talks were to be just about filling one post, not a lot 
would be accomplished through them. So the point is whether 
these talks, which I consider absolutely necessary and that they 
should take place as soon as possible--if these talks are to 
make sense, they have to be in the form of some permanent 
practice of talking to each other, face-to-face, without 
television cameras. I mean talks among the state's supreme 
agencies and organs. Otherwise, we just have an isolated case 
and that is it. 
  [Skowronski] What do people in Japan say about Polish 
issues? 
  [Oleksy] There is a lot of interest in Polish issues in 
Japan. We were even quite amazed to see that is the case. The 
visit was very tiresome because of the climate and also because 
of certain rigid ways of thinking that continue to.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] When you say climate, do you mean 
the weather? 
  [Oleksy] Exactly. 
  [Skowronski] What was the weather like in Tokyo? 
  [Oleksy] It was terribly exhausting. 
  [Skowronski] Was it worse than today's Warsaw weather? 
  [Oleksy] It was better, from a temperature standpoint. But, 
as a parliamentary delegation, we were very much determined to 
make permanent Poland's presence, the knowledge of Poland, and 
the awareness of a need for good Polish-Japanese relations. 
This also applies to Japan's presence in Central Europe, 
including Poland. I mean its presence in terms of capital, 
investments, and the economy. At all levels, perhaps with the 
exception of my conversation with the Japanese emperor, both 
during the talk with outgoing Prime Minister Hosokawa and with 
the finance minister, the trade and industry minister, with the 
leadership of a fund for regional and international assistance 
that has the sum of $70 billion at its disposal, and also with 
the leadership of (EximBank), Japan's largest bank fostering 
foreign cooperation, we raised the issue of unblocking financial 
and credit relations with Japan, which, to our surprise, are 
accompanied by very rigid reservations by Japan, some of which 
are philosophical [words indistinct]. 
  [Skowronski] What is the essence of this Japanese 
philosophy? 
  [Oleksy] It goes back to the time of the reduction of our 
debts in the Paris Club. Japan thinks that, at the time, it was 
forced by a debtor to give up its claims. Apparently, under 
Japanese philosophy, once somebody fails to return a loan, he 
can never again expect to be offered beneficial terms of 
cooperation. We were told that bluntly. We tried to overcome 
that because it is a very important issue: Japanese, 
government-guaranteed credits are an absolute precondition for 
Japanese companies to enter the Polish market. It seems that 
their responses varied a great deal. In some cases, the 
responses were tough, but, in others, there was a lot of 
readiness to change the state of affairs. Two important 
meetings will take place in Warsaw in May: There will be a 
meeting by a Poland-Japan working group for new economic 
initiatives between the two countries, and a meeting of 
East-West foreign trade ministers, the so-called ministerial 
initiative.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] So you mean you were partially 
successful in changing Poland's image.... 
  [Oleksy, interrupting] I think we were definitely successful 
in creating the right atmosphere and in convincing some 
interlocutors...[Oleksy pauses] We talked with party chiefs, 
chiefs of parliamentary factions, the leadership of the House of 
Representatives--the upper chamber--and also with former 
Japanese prime ministers and former foreign ministers. 
  [Skowronski] What was the meeting with the emperor like? 
  [Oleksy] It was very exotic to me because it was my first 
conversation with him. 
  [Skowronski] What kind of protocol was there? 
  [Oleksy] It was very complicated. We were taught various 
gestures and moves, but that is a usual thing. Let me remind 
you that, at the end of Emperor Hirohito's term, the emperor of 
Japan was regarded as a god. So that has an impact on protocol, 
but I managed to deal with it. The conversation was very nice. 
The emperor turned out to love Chopin's music, he has read the 
novel Quo Vadis, he is sponsoring subsequent editions 
of works by [Polish author] Sienkiewicz in Japan, and he was 
very interested in a Polish-Japanese cultural center in Krakow, 
which will open in November under Andrzej Wajda's auspices, with 
a substantial Japanese contribution. We talked about cultural 
exchanges, about relations with Russia, relations in Central 
Europe. The scope of the emperor's interests was wider than I 
would be willing to admit before my visit there. 
  [Skowronski] So you met with the emperor, and, recently, you 
also met with Boris Yeltsin. What happened during the other 
meeting, I mean the one with Boris Yeltsin? This is also 
something we have not discussed at the Radio Zet studio yet. 
  [Oleksy] Well, this was a face-to-face conversation, so it 
also included issues I cannot publicize. I conveyed the 
conversation's results and what happened during it to President 
Walesa. 
  [Skowronski] So you cannot share it with our listeners? 
  [Oleksy, hesitating] Not everything. I can say that Boris 
Yeltsin [hesitating] does not see everything the same way we do, 
when it comes to Central Europe--and this is not about 
Partnership for Peace, on which Russian politicians presented 
their country's position to us in wide-ranging terms. Whereas, 
we kept saying our thing--in terms of Poland's persistent 
striving.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] And what are the most important 
differences of views? 
  [Oleksy] But Boris Yeltsin looks at Poland as a country that 
[hesitating], while severing its ties to the region in a 
definite manner, wants to be a member of an arrangement in which 
Boris Yeltsin does not believe. He called it an arrangement of 
old structures established for West Europe's security and 
convenience. There is a difference between us on that. By the 
way, there were many themes full of disappointment with the 
West, which also prove that Russia feels alone and surrounded. 
This is the blunt way it was put. But, as I said, these were 
incidental themes, kind of in the background of conversation. 
  [Skowronski] Russia's position of being alone is one fact, 
and is Boris Yeltsin also alone in the Kremlin, as a politician? 
  [Oleksy] I must say, I heard a lot before the meeting about 
the state of his health and about the weak shape he is in. I 
must say I had in front of me a man of absolutely superb 
health--of both psychological and physical strength--and also 
with an enormous determination to remain in power. Stories told 
by diplomats and politicians about what bad shape Yeltsin is in 
proved untrue. 
  [Skowronski] What [hesitating] will happen in the Sejm this 
week? 
  [Oleksy] This week, the Sejm's proceedings will be very 
intensive. The agenda has already been adopted by the Sejm 
Presidium. That happened before my trip. Two issues will be 
debated. As I said, I do not think that the Sejm deputies' 
constitutional initiative will be placed on the agenda, but that 
has to be decided at Wednesday's [20 April] session of the Sejm 
leadership. There is the issue of the popiwek, or neopopiwek 
[wage-control legislation], which was submitted also in the form 
of a Sejm deputies' initiative, and it does not come from the 
government. So that defines the initiative's essence from the 
standpoint of time requirements.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] It will take longer? 
  [Oleksy] Yes, it will, and consequently.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] But do we need the popiwek at 
all? 
  [Oleksy] There are different [words indistinct] on that. 
Myself, I do not express my view because I prefer to base what I 
say on the opinions of professional experts, who deal with 
calculations and forecasts, rather than on the easy-sounding 
views of politicians. This is what I want to base it on. But 
first of all, there is no government initiative; instead, there 
is one coming from Sejm deputies. This changes the proceedings 
and intensity of the measures. It is happening on a very 
immediate basis. There is also a whole range of issues on the 
agenda. The session will last two days, and I doubt that [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Skowronski] Will you try to alleviate the conflict between 
the coalition and the president? 
  [Oleksy] That depends on the will of both parties. I am 
ready, and this is the way I see my role in the state, but, if 
the parties do not want that, I have no intention of imposing 
myself on them. 
  [Skowronski] Who will it be harder to convince, Aleksander 
Kwasniewski or Lech Walesa? 
  [Oleksy] One does not have to convince Aleksander 
Kwasniewski to do anything because he is a politician with a big 
picture of the totality of the political situation.... 
  [Skowronski, interrupting] What about Lech Walesa? 
  [Oleksy, hesitating] I think he probably also does that, 
but, in his case, he is more stubborn sometimes than.... 
  [Skowronski] And what about Aleksander Kwasniewski? 
  [Oleksy] I think he is less stubborn and more flexible. 
  [Skowronski, laughing] So you are kind of a party to the 
conflict because you think Aleksander Kwasniewski's stubbornness 
is smaller? 
  [Oleksy] It is not smaller. It is just that it is easier to 
make him flexible, but this is just for the purposes of a radio 
interview, and, currently, I play no role in the conflict. 
  [Skowronski] Thank you very much for the conversation. 
  Radio Zet's guest today has been Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Piotr Winczorek, under the "Observations" </F>
rubric] 
  [Text] It is not a very good idea to change the 
constitutional powers of the president in the area of appointing 
people to governmental posts. It is not good to propose such a 
notion as a result of a dispute concerning the filling of the 
post of finance minister. It is not a good custom to shape the 
law, especially the Constitution, according to current political 
needs. 
  The president's reaction to this idea was quite violent. He 
announced that an attempt to implement this idea might end up in 
earlier-than-scheduled parliamentary elections. However, before 
such elections can take place, the present Sejm and Senate must 
first be dissolved. In the legal state defined by the Small 
Constitution, it is possible to discontinue the term of the 
parliament only in a limited number of cases. 
  The Sejm may be dissolved by its own resolution reached by 
the majority of two-thirds of the votes of the deputies. If we 
look at the present composition of the Sejm and the desire of 
the Sejm's majority to work until the end of the four-year term 
of office, it will become clear that it is very unlikely for 
this condition to be satisfied. 
  The Sejm may also be dissolved by the president: 
  --If, within three months from the submission of the budget 
bill, it is not passed. The 1994 budget law was passed in the 
allotted time, and it was signed a few days ago by the 
president. The possibility of taking advantage of this chance to 
dissolve the Sejm may appear only in more than a year. 
  --If the Sejm passes a no-confidence vote against the 
government and, at the same time, does not appoint a new prime 
minister. 
  --If, after various possibilities of establishing the 
government, envisioned by the Small Constitution, are exhausted, 
the Sejm does not do this with the majority of two-thirds of the 
votes. 
  --If the Sejm, after all the possibilities of establishing 
the government are exhausted, refuses to support a government 
established by the president for a period of six months. In 
such a case, it is obligatory for the president to dissolve the 
Sejm. 
  It is easy to see that, as long as the present government of 
the coalition of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish 
Peasant Party exists, the possibilities mentioned in the last 
three points are out of the question. 
  Because these are all the possibilities of dissolving the 
Sejm and the Senate, defined by the Small Constitution, the 
answer to the question of how earlier-than-scheduled 
parliamentary elections can legally be held should be given by 
those who can see such a possibility.

  [Text] Warsaw, 18 Apr--On 18 April, the prime minister 
announced that the elections to parish councils would be held on 
19 June. The elections are to be held according to the old 
electoral law passed in 1990, Ewa Wachowicz, Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak's press secretary, told PAP. 
  The prime minister has ordered that the elections be held 
without waiting for the president to make his decision--a few 
days ago the president announced that he would veto the new 
electoral law (passed by the Sejm on 18 March)--and without 
waiting for the Sejm, which can reject the president's veto by a 
majority of two-thirds of the votes. The president has until 21 
April to make his decision. 
  The most important difference between the two laws is the 
threshold where proportional representation applies. According 
to the old law, the threshold is 40,000 citizens, and, according 
to the new one, the threshold stands at 15,000 citizens.

  [Text] On 15 April President Zhelev received Klaus Kinkel, 
German vice chancellor and minister of foreign affairs. 
Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president, describes the 
character of the meeting: 
  [Begin Stoyanov recording] President Zhelev again stated 
that integration into European structures is a basic priority of 
Bulgarian foreign policy. He expressed the hope that Germany 
will facilitate the ratification of the agreement on Bulgaria's 
associated membership in the European Union. 
  Klaus Kinkel said that the ratification will probably take 
place before the elections. In addition he said he would do 
what he could to help increase German investments in Bulgaria. 
He pointed out, however, that this also depends on Bulgaria. 
We must become a more attractive country. 
  President Zhelev again stressed the losses Bulgaria is 
suffering from the Yugoslav embargo and pointed out that not 
only economic operations that have been affected, as the road to 
the West has been closed. Despite the fact that there are no 
military actions on Bulgarian territory, we are considered a 
risky state merely because we are located in the Balkans. This 
is something from which we will perhaps suffer even in the next 
few years. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra by </F>
Stanislav Cervinka; place and date not given: "The Czech 
Republic Will Not Export Arms to Countries Embargoed by the 
United Nations"] 
  [Text] After his return from his 12-day visit to Syria, 
Pakistan, and Iran, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra 
pointed to the key influence of these countries. In this 
connection, we asked him: 
  [Cervinka] You stressed that the Czech Republic [CR] does 
not export arms to Iran. Does this also apply to Syria and 
Pakistan? 
  [Vondra] The CR has not exported any large volumes of 
military technology to these countries recently. Spare parts 
for the previously delivered technology is an exception. In the 
future, similar deals will be regulated by applicable laws. 
Each and every deal will be judged separately on the basis of 
this law. This law does not include a list of off-limits 
countries. In no case will the CR export arms to countries on 
which the UN has imposed an embargo. In the case of other 
countries, the foreign policy aspects of each and every deal 
will be considered. 
  [Cervinka] How do you view developments regarding the CR's 
claims in the Middle East? 
  [Vondra] It is extremely difficult to assess such a 
situation. The CR, as one of the successor states after 
Czechoslovakia, inherited claims that had been established in 
past decades due to the fact that Czechoslovakia, as a Warsaw 
Pact member, supplied many developing countries with various 
goods. Economic considerations, essential in foreign trade, were 
either secondary or totally unimportant in such cases. Many 
Third World countries still do not perceive past deals as normal 
business but as assistance provided to them by the then Soviet 
bloc to maintain balance in the world or develop their economy. 
This does not mean, however, that the CR will waive its claims. 
If we are to retain our chance of getting paid for our claims 
in the future, we have to search for ways that will encourage 
future cooperation that will be acceptable to both sides. I am 
convinced that this is the situation in those Middle East 
countries on which the UN embargo has not been imposed. This 
cooperation, however, will not continue in the spirit of the 
strategic intentions of the former Soviet bloc.

  [Text] Zvornik, April 18 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem offensive 
on Serb positions continued in all fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
as did the attacks from Gorazde despite the agreement on the 
immediate ceasefire in this Moslem enclave which came into force 
on Sunday at 5:00 P.M. local time. 
  Bosnian Serb military sources said on Monday that the 
strongest Moslem actions were in the region of Doboj, Teslic, 
Gradacac and Mts. Trebava and Ozren (northern Bosnia) and in the 
region of Vlasic, Komar and Srbobran (central Bosnia). 
  Serb-held Doboj is under continual Moslem artillery shelling 
which wounded three civilians during Sunday night. 
  The continuation of the Moslem offensive on the Bosnian Serb 
republic (RS) is an attempt to provoke a Serb response, blame 
them for the attacks and thus cause new NATO air strikes, the 
Bosnian Serb military sources said. 
  They warned that the Serb troops would use their legitimate 
right to self-defence and respond to all attacks by using all 
means. 
  The sources recalled that the Serb side continually urges a 
ceasefire in the entire Bosnian territory and the application of 
political means, rather than war, to search for solutions, but 
that the Moslem leadership persistently refuses this. 
  According to the Bosnian Serb military sources, fresh troops 
of the regular Croatian Army are massing along the left bank of 
the Sava river, towards Posavina (northern RS). 
  The Croatian artillery is shelling Serb positions, also 
under 
attack by the Moslems from the south, with the aim of severing 
the corridor through Posavina which links the eastern and 
western parts of RS. 
  In the region of Sarajevo, the Moslems are continuing 
provocations and engineering work close to the Serb positions, 
all before the very eyes of the U.N. troops, the Bosnian Serb 
military sources said. 
  The sources describe as inadmissible the recent withdrawal 
of 
UNPROFOR from their positions in the Bjelasnica and Igman 
mountains, near Sarajevo, which the Serbs handed over to the 
peacekeepers last spring. 
  Since the Moslem troops siezed the U.N. positions after 
their 
pullout, it has become clear that in question is a joint 
synchronized action, the Bosnian Serb sources pointed out. 
  They said that the U.N. Protection Force is not stopping the 
Moslems from using a tunnel beneath the Sarajevo airport to 
leave the city for Hrasnica and Mt. Igman. 
  The aim of these operations, in which the U.N. troops are 
taking part, either directly or indirectly, is to try to link 
the Moslem forces with the Gorazde region via Rogoj, central 
Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Justice Is on Our Side"] </F>
  [Text] During yesterday's meeting with the delegation of 
the U.S. Council of Foreign Affairs, President Gligorov pointed 
out the United States have so far kept a balanced position in 
the Macedonian-Greek relations, which results from its interest 
to preserve peace and stability in the region, just like it is 
in the interest of both Greece and Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. "America is interested 
to see an agreement acceptable for both sides and will remain on 
such a position during talks with Papandreou. We look forward 
to today's meeting between Foreign Minister Crvenkovski and U.S. 
Secretary of State Christopher and hope to see a fruitful 
discussion." Asked on possible reactions by the Macedonian 
Govt. in case Serbs undertake an ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, 
Gligorov said it would be a tragic event with consequences 
bigger than those in Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing peace and 
stability must be preserved and the Kosovo question must be 
resolved through peaceful means. Otherwise, he said, a new 
Balkan war would start, involving two NATO member countries, 
Turkey and Greece. In regard to Greek remarks on the Macedonian 
Constitution, Gligorov underlined it clearly states Macedonia 
has no territorial aspirations and intentions of interfering in 
any country's domestic affairs. He went on to say Macedonia has 
suggested signing a treaty with Greece on inviolability of 
present borders. "They are now bothered by our name and the 
fact that Macedonia will take care of cultural and other needs 
of Macedonians living out of the country. Let me remind that 
one third of the total Macedonian population lives in Australia, 
the United States, Canada, Germany and other countries and that 
none of these countries are concerned by this responsibility 
Macedonia took on. And, the Article 108 of the Greek 
Constitution likewise states Greece will take care of cultural 
and other needs of Greeks throughout the world." He was also 
asked on his opinion of the loose federation of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and possibilities of Macedonia entering any 
federation. He said Bosnia should be re-established, as 
dividing on ethnic basis violates international laws and in fact 
approves of changing borders by force and ethnic cleansing. "We 
consider it is the best interest for the Balkans that Macedonia 
remains independent and stays out of any form of federation, as 
it would cause new conflicts. This means we are oriented 
towards integrating into European associations and wish to see 
the European option enforced in all Balkan countries. Any 
joining of countries on religious or ethnic basis would just 
bring about new complications. We have a great deal of mutual 
interests with Greece and, once emotions are calmed down in this 
country, there is a realistic hope we will reach a long-term 
agreement. That is how we view our relations with all other 
neighbours -- Bulgaria, Albania, and, when the war is over, 
Serbia, as well." Asked what terms would the possible agreement 
with Greece include, President Gligorov said the inviolability 
of borders would be of greatest priority, and all other issues 
Macedonia is ready to negotiate on should be discussed in a 
package and not separately. He also said Macedonia is "aware 
that both sides must be ready to compromise." As for the ability 
of the Macedonians to stand up to the strong Greek lobby in the 
world, Gligorov answered although Macedonians have no such 
economic and political influence and means to react at every 
moment, the "justice is on our side."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Miroslav Caplovic: "Slovakia's Heading Toward </F>
NATO"] 
  [Text] For four decades, in which the Soviet Union 
dictated in the Warsaw Pact the policy of fraternal cohesion, 
the United States was struggling to bring down communism. It is 
precisely for this reason that the postcommunist states expect 
the U.S. struggle for democracy to lead them among the countries 
of the Western world and why it is naive to expect Moscow to 
renounce its interests in its erstwhile empire. After all, even 
the colonizers of America, Africa, and Asia have retained to 
this day indirect influence in their lost dominions. 
  Slovakia's and its neighbors' heading toward NATO will 
therefore be more than arduous. If the Americans sincerely 
strive for "Slovakia to be a democratic, stable, and prosperous 
state on the map of Europe" (statement made by Deputy Secretary 
of State Strobe Talbott in Bratislava the day before yesterday), 
they will have to offer us "something extra" besides Partnership 
for Peace--that is, they should not confine their assistance to 
cooperation in science and education but must raise the level of 
investment and make accessible to us the U.S. and West European 
markets. It is an unalterable fact that, the more the West is 
involved in Slovakia economically, the more it will care about 
our security. 
  Moreover, the West European orientation of Slovak diplomacy 
has been complicated by the division of the CSFR. A gigantic 
amount of German capital is flowing into the Czech Republic, and 
Bonn will therefore undoubtedly give priority to Prague's 
admission into the European Union [EU] over the Polish, 
Hungarian, or Slovak applications (although no one speaks about 
it in public, this is absolutely logical from the geopolitical 
viewpoint). Brussels will certainly not support the EU's 
expansion up to the borders of Ukraine, where nuclear weapons 
are still located. Is the anxiety that the 
Warsaw-Bratislava-Budapest axis might become a security vacuum 
not justified? 
  Eduard Kukan, the chief of Slovak diplomacy, said in an 
interview for yesterday's RUDE PRAVO that "the best foreign 
policy is good and well-considered domestic policy." An 
occasional "state show" is an integral part of it. While 
receiving Talbott, President Michal Kovac reissued his 
invitation to Bill Clinton to attend the 50th anniversary of the 
Slovak National Uprising. We may not appreciate this 
sufficiently at home, but the August uprising went down in 
history as a nationwide and grandiose expression of antifascist 
resistance, in which few other nations can take pride. Will our 
politicians be able to make use of their foreign contacts so 
that prominent Western leaders come to Banska Bystrica this 
summer? 
  A month later, the burden will lie on voters, lest we turn 
our existing policy line toward Vladimir Volfovich 
[Zhirinovskiy] and send a Pan-Slavic greeting to him....

  [Text] Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman today granted an 
interview to a British publicist, Sir Fitzroy McLean, to be 
broadcast on Dutch television, regarding affairs in southeastern 
Europe and the history of relations between nations in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  Commenting on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President 
Tudjman stressed that, through the Washington agreement on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and its confederation with the 
Republic of Croatia, Croatian and Muslim interests have been 
harmonized with the interests of the Republic of Croatia and 
those of the Western world that wanted to link Muslims with 
Western civilization. 
  Speaking about relations between Croatia and Serbia, the 
Croatian president said that the mutual recognition will create 
the basis for peace and the establishment of a new international 
order in that part of Europe. He also said that the area of the 
Balkans should undergo a process of Scandinavization, recalling 
that the Scandinavian states recognized each other after years 
of being at war, then cooperated with each other, and 
successfully resolved the question of protecting minorities' 
rights.

received special UN envoy Charles Redman. Following the talks 
Charles Redman stated that the United States has very close and 
good cooperation with the Croatian Government: 
  [Begin Redman recording in English with superimposed

Croatia just very briefly, on my way from Sarajevo to 
Washington. Some very important decisions ought to be reached 
as regards what we can do in order to strengthen the UN role in 
Bosnia. 
  At the same time, nobody will forget that we ought to work 
on 
some very important issues here in Croatia. We have made 
significant progress, but we still need to do more, and I hope 
that my meeting and talks with Minister Granic will strengthen 
this process and achieve progress in the right direction. We 
are both pleased with the progress that has been achieved in the 
past months. On behalf of the United States, I would like to say 
that it is our intention to stay in close touch with the 
Croatian Government so that this process should proceed further. 
[end recording] 
  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said that one of the 
main issues discussed in talks with the special U.S. envoy was 
the current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina: 
  [Begin Granic recording] We discussed the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in particular [word indistinct] Gorazde, 
progress reached in talks between the Croats and the Bosniaks 
regarding setting up the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
the situation in UN protected areas, the latest behaviur 
displayed by the Serbs in the UN protected areas and in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the possible U.S. and UN moves. [end

    [Editorial Report] The following reports on developments in 
the Republic of Croatia are drawn from recent issues of the 
Zagreb news weekly GLOBUS. 
<H5>  Weekly Charges Zagreb Mayor Involved in Illegal Sugar Imports </H5>
  In 1992, while he was Croatian trade minister, current 
Zagreb 
Mayor Branko Miksa signed 230 permits allowing the illegal 
importation of 280,000 metric tons of sugar, from which 
"skillful merchants" earned at least $50 million, charges GLOBUS 
(25 March). The weekly states that it has at its disposal 
"carefully concealed documents which could reveal the greatest 
importing scandal in the recent history of Croatia." The "Sugar 
Affair" created an "entire new class of rich people," GLOBUS 
alleges, explaining that all one needed was a bank loan to 
purchase, for example, 3,000 tons of sugar at $350 per ton, 
import it, and resell it for a net profit of $1 million. The 
Zagreb Voce enterprise began importing sugar in 12,000-ton 
shipments, and "a certain Robni Promet enterprise" received a 
permit to import 22,000 tons of sugar valued at $7 million, 
GLOBUS says. Although Miksa's permits, without which the sugar 
could not have been imported, cite authorizations from the 
Croatian Economic Chamber, GLOBUS says that it has a letter from 
the chamber addressed to Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Seks 
stating that it did not issue any such authorizations in 1992. 
GLOBUS further reports that in 1993, Attorney General Stjepan 
Herceg had publicly accused three Croatian enterprises, Sibenka, 
Vinoplod, and Veti, of smuggling sugar. Not long after making 
these charges, Herceg was forced to submit his resignation. 
  Along with large, well-known enterprises that were illegally 
importing sugar, GLOBUS reports, hundreds of "totally unknown" 
small firms, some with "comic names," had also received permits 
to import sugar and, after importing just a few batches, 
disappeared. The paper publishes the names of the following 
firms that it says engaged in such activity: HA-ST, Vedison, 
West Commerc, Zenit Company, Idea MGG, Fijomi Trade, Newa 
Internacional, Anik Impex, Boss Impex, Ida Komerc, Alfa Impex, 
HVH Trade, K.V.A.K., Sun Markt, Equus Caballus, Panex West, 
Teuta Trade, and Stella Mare Commerce. Representatives of the 
finance police, customs office, public prosecutor's office, and 
trade inspectorate have discovered falsified documents and 
abuses by the Ministry Of trade, but the public does not know 
whether any of these discoveries has led to misdemeanor or 
criminal charges, according to GLOBUS. 
  In a detailed account in its 10 March issue, GLOBUS also 
accused Miksa of illegally importing a Mercedes-Benz vehicle for 
his personal use and of "defrauding the state of 35,253 German 
marks" by not paying customs fees and taxes. 
<H5>  Dismissals in Ministry of Foreign Affairs </H5>
  GLOBUS reports that numerous dismissals of diplomats have 
occurred in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MIP]. In an 18 
March article entitled "Why Is Dr. Mate Granic Removing His 
Diplomats en Masse?" the weekly reports that the first important 
persons to go were Vice Vukojevic, chief of the MIP's 
intelligence service, and Benjanin Tolic, also of the 
intelligence service, followed by Zeljko Bujas, ambassador to 
the United Kingdom, who was recalled at the beginning of 1994. 
"Two-and-one-half months later" Milan Ramljak replaced Ivan 
Brnelic in Vienna, and on 1 May Ambassador to Poland Milivoj 
Slavicek and Ambassador to Bulgaria Bernardo Jurlina will be 
replaced. Additional dismissals of ambassadors in countries that 
"are very important for Croatia" are planned but have been 
postponed due to difficulties in finding "adequate 
replacements," GLOBUS claims. The paper states that Tomislav 
Simic, MIP adviser on the international media whose "propaganda 
circulars to foreign journalists provoked sneers and aversion," 
is also scheduled to be removed. GLOBUS welcomes the changes in 
the MIP, saying that they are caused partly by "pressure" to 
remove "old cadres" from responsible positions. 
<H5>  Former Foreign Legionnaire Commander of New HVO Brigade </H5>
  Brigadier General Zeljko Glasnovic, one of the 50 members of 
the French Foreign Legion who returned "to defend their country" 
at the beginning of the "war against Croatia," is today 
commander of the Ante Bruno Busic First Guard Brigade of the 
Croatian Defense Council [HVO] in Capljina, Herzegovina, 
according to the 18 March GLOBUS. The brigade is one of four 
that are currently being formed in Herzegovina. GLOBUS says that 
Glasnovic is, together with General Ante Roso, "the most 
significant man of the HVO." The weekly further reports that 
Glasnovic has been tasked with forming "the real army in the 
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna." According to a brief 
biography provided by the paper, Glasnovi was born in Zagreb on 
24 February 1954 and moved to Canada at the age of eight. In 
1974 he joined the Canadian Army and in 1988 the French Foreign 
Legion, as a member of which he participated in the Gulf War. To 
show that Glasnovic believes that the Croatian Army in Bosnia 
needs strict discipline, GLOBUS cites his remark: "Look at our 
army! What army in the world has soldiers who wear earrings!"

<F P=106> [Article by Leszek Miller: "It Must Not Continue That Way"] </F>
  [Text] What is really happening to Poland? Where are we 
heading? What does the future have in store for us? These are 
difficult questions, and there are no ready-made answers to them. 
  It is worth recalling the forecasts made by the so-called 
reformatory camp during the election campaign. After the 
victory of the left, "a black night of chaos and incompetence" 
was supposed to ensue. The nation was supposed to "wail," and 
the shocked West would turn its back on us in revulsion. Poland 
was supposed to be isolated both politically and economically. 
Lines of people, rationing, and the proverbial vinegar on shop 
shelves were to return as symbols of the hardship of life and 
the condition of the economy. However, politicians and 
journalists had not made a greater mistake for a very long time. 
  After the first quarter of this year, inflation was the 
lowest in seven years--it dropped to 4.5 percent. The 10-percent 
production growth is the highest in 15 years. Unemployment 
dropped by 20,000 people. It is obvious that these as well as 
other indicators are not so high as to be felt everywhere as 
favorable. They do, however, have something in common: They are 
all positive. 
  As a result of the prospect of a stable government and 
economic growth, Western states are revalorizing their interests 
in Central Europe. They are beginning to perceive our country as 
an important factor of political peace and economic reforms. A 
long-term strategy of investment and trade involvement of the 
main economic powers is being shaped. The impossibilities that 
have so far been observed in the relations with neighbors are 
being broken. Prominent politicians from East and West are 
stressing that Poland is heading in the right direction. This 
is what the evaluation of the first six months of the coalition 
of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] is based on. It should be stressed, however, 
that former governments have contributed to it as well. 
  Therefore, the election victory of the left is even more 
aggravating. "We could have prevented this" was how Bohdan 
Cywinski recently expressed his irritation in RZECZPOSPOLITA. 
How? "For example, by limiting the passive franchise of former 
communists. That it is undemocratic? Nonsense." The author 
answers his own question, and, at another point, he appeals to 
remove from memory this "hideous date of 19 September 1993" as 
soon as possible. This is how much has been left of the words 
about "respecting the will of the people" and the conviction 
that this will is the only pass to the political scene. 
  The fears that the situation might not be as bad as it was 
supposed to be are obvious to not only the bickering leaders of 
the right. They can also be found in the evaluations of serious 
people, surrounded by the halo of independence, not meddling 
with minor skirmishes. This is no wonder because the problem is 
extremely important. Even a moderate success of a government 
including the left must mean the compromising of the myths on 
which Poles have been fed for years. 
  It will turn out that a "postcommunist" formation not only 
does not pose any threat to the favorable future of Poland, but, 
on the contrary, is a chance for its development, strengthening 
the mechanisms of parliamentary democracy and the market 
economy. The center-left government does not only deter the 
West but it is a considerable and serious partner for Western 
democracies. In addition, it does not have to be legitimized by 
any authorities, and it does not need any intermediaries, which 
may be the most painful thing. It settles for the mandate of 
its voters. 
  The reaction of some authority centers is quite significant. 
I would like to be wrong now, but it is becoming increasingly 
clear that the activities of Lech Walesa are, unfortunately, 
destructive. The persistent maintenance of the vacancy in the 
extremely important post of the economy's head and finance 
minister, threats for the democratically elected Sejm, 
embarrassing decisions concerning the National Council of Radio 
and Television, refusal to competently take part in the work of 
the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly, veto of 
the wage-control law, the already announced refusal to sign the 
electoral law governing local elections--all this aims at the 
emerging chances of political stabilization and economic growth. 
  In this light, the strategic goal of the president seems to 
be obvious: to prevent the four-year governing of the PSL-SLD 
coalition, to prove that the results of the 19 September 
elections was a mistake, to strengthen his own power, and to 
weaken his opponents and potential countercandidates. 
  Is Lech Walesa all alone in his strivings? Certainly not in 
all of them. In the 18 March issue of TYGODNIK "SOLIDARNOSC," 
Andrzej Gelberg wrote, quoting Marian Krzaklewski, "Solidarity 
will not resign itself to the fact that power has been taken 
over by the communists and will fight against this configuration 
with all its might." Even though the author adds that it will 
do this by peaceful means, he writes later on with disarming 
frankness that the aim is to "change the present parliamentary 
configuration"; he does not explain by what peaceful means it is 
going to achieve this. It is an important sign, especially now 
that strikes and protests have been announced that "defend the 
employees' interests." 
  Thus, the aim of the president's actions, regardless of 
whether they are agreed on or not, is clear. Is it possible to 
achieve this goal? No, it is not, if the rules of a democratic 
state are to be applied. Yes, it is, if the government of the 
center left is gradually discredited and if the social peace is 
disturbed. The price of such destruction would be enormous; 
however, it looks like it is neither appalling nor shameful. 
  Against this backdrop, disquieting are the 
mistakes--sometimes seemingly minor--committed by the SLD. The 
left displays a lack of ability to think in advance. It cannot 
see obvious traps and poorly estimates its own limited or badly 
utilized capabilities. 
  The circumstances of the recall of Marek Borowski are 
particularly instructive and painful here. We would not have to 
look for a new finance minister now if all of the consequences 
of this decision had been considered. It is also not good when 
the main platform of the disputes that the SLD gets involved in 
are cadre issues. Why speak about meetings that are not held 
because one does not have any influence on their organization? 
Why announce the names of deputy prime ministers who have not 
been nominated? What sense does it make to make retorts to the 
Belweder if there are serious doubts about the possibilities of 
making them? 
  I am writing these words with sorrow; however, I am 
beginning 
to fear that there may arise the impression of defensiveness and 
decreasing efficiency. The SLD could have been wrong when it 
did not bear responsibility for the state. Today the risk and 
the cost of even an accidental mistake are enormous, and the 
limit of mistakes has already been reached. 
  The subject that should be thought over are relations within 
the coalition. One can sometimes get the impression that the 
electorates of the PSL and the SLD are closer to one another 
than its leaders are. That is better than the other way around 
because, in this way, a strong foundation for lasting 
cooperation between the two groupings, independent of any 
temporary tendencies, is being created. The PSL-SLD coalition 
is not the exclusive property of politicians who can do anything 
they want with it. It is an indirect expression of the will of 
millions of voters, the property of the people who have elected 
such a parliament. One has to bear this in mind if one wants to 
respect the electorate and the social groups that sympathize 
with the coalition. 
  Nevertheless, relations in the highest places between the 
PSL 
and the SLD are far from expectations. It started with the 
submission of a composition of the government that was different 
from the one that had been agreed on. Then came the statement 
that the SLD would really prefer an alliance with the Democratic 
Union, and then it really started.... 
  Some of the misunderstandings definitely result from the 
lack 
of understanding of the partner's uniqueness, sometimes from the 
lack of sufficiently acceptable information channels, sometimes 
from the manipulation of the media unfavorably disposed toward 
the coalition. At any rate, a breakthrough is needed--something 
like a declaration of goals and intentions that would begin with 
the words "the two parties hereby decide to speak about each 
other favorably." 
  Tensions within the coalition exert a destabilizing 
influence 
on the entire political configuration and fuel the activeness of 
the centers that aim to weaken or break it. If this really 
happened, we would all lose the possibility of winning the 
four-year period of Poland's stabilization, Poland would lose 
its credibility, and internal and external conditions of its 
socioeconomic development would be more acute. If the coalition 
fell apart, no new effective parliamentary majority would be 
formed. The instability of a minority government would lead to 
early parliamentary elections, which would weaken both the SLD 
and the PSL. 
  Therefore, a minimum of programmatic order should be defined 
and observed; it might come down to the following goals: 
  1. Adopting and implementing a three-year socioeconomic 
program for the country's development. 
  2. Ensuring a full four-year term of parliament and the 
coalition government. 
  3. Approving the constitution before the presidential 
election. 
  4. Reaching a coalition agreement in the presidential 
election. 
  5. Holding the elections for local self-governments in the 
period defined by the Constitution. 
  Aside from strategic points, the coalition's program of 
cooperation should also include practical and short-term goals 
concerning the aspirations and expectations of millions of 
Poles--that is, rapid implementing the program of the National 
Investment Funds; amending the Labor Code; adopting laws that 
constitute the Pact on Enterprise; implementing a mass housing 
construction program; improving the citizens' security; 
implementing large-scale economic projects, such as the 
construction of highways, and so on. 
  Even though it is acting in complex circumstances, the 
coalition is not defenseless. It has at its disposal the 
capital of many election votes and sustained social support. 
  The concord between the PSL and the SLD may curb the 
destructive activities of the coalition's opponents; lack of 
crevices and cracks makes it impossible to broaden them. The 
understandable dissatisfaction of many Polish families with 
their living standards does not have to be the fuel for 
"Solidarity." As social research proves, people do not believe 
that the activities of this union are a hope for an improvement 
of everyday life. We can also see the reorientation of the 
West, for which a stable Poland and a lasting, predictable 
government create the conditions for serious investments and for 
economic recovery in this part of Europe. 
  On whom, then, does the further development of the situation 
depend? It depends on ourselves.

  [Text] Ljubljana, April 17 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia's President 
Milan Kucan has admitted that Slovenia supplied arms to Croatia 
and Bosnian Moslems in defiance of a U.N. ban on arms deliveries 
to ex- Yugoslavia's territory. 
  In a letter to Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, 
carried by Ljubljana papers, Kucan demanded a government 
investigation into arms smuggling to determine who was involved, 
what was the profit of officials, institutions and individuals 
gained in that way, and the exact quantity of arms delivered to 
Slovenia from abroad. 
  The truth about Slovenia's involvement in arms smuggling 
came 
out in the public last summer, when 120 tonnes of weapons for 
Croatia and Bosnian Moslems were recovered at Maribor airport. 
  By drawing attention to arms smuggling, Kucan attempted to 
attenuate his role in the affair that assumed international 
proportions. 
  Kucan's "considerate" letter to Drnovsek is also intended to 
build up his reputation, but it will probably trigger new 
polemics instead, notably about the ex-Defence Minister Janez 
Jansa's role in Slovenia's instigating armed conflicts in former 
Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Maribor, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Slovenia's former 
Interior Minister Igor Bavcar has confirmed that well-organised 
channels had been delivering arms to Moslems in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina via Slovenia in spite of the embargo on arms 
exports to the entire territory of former Yugoslavia. 
  Speaking at a trial to the smugglers of 120 tons of arms 
discovered at the Maribor airport last summer, Bavcar said that 
the Slovenian Interior Ministry had sent to Slovenian border 
authorities permits for free passage of arms for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Slovenia's retired intelligence service number two man Janez 
Piber confirmed in court that Slovenian President Milan Kucan 
and Bavcar had introduced him to Hasan Cengic, who had been 
authorised by Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic to obtain 
arms. 
  Piber said he had been told to assist Cengic even before the 
outbreak of armed conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Janez Jansa, president of the Social Democratic 
Party [SDSS], today explained the reasons that his party left 
the government coalition. Robert Skerjanc reports from the news 
conference: 
  [Begin recording] [Skerjanc] The SDSS president, Janez 
Jansa, for this anticipated decision of the party council, put 
forward three basic reasons for why the party's presidency 
proposed that the SDSS leave the coalition: 
  [Jansa] The first reason is a gross violation of the 
coalition agreement, not merely in this latest case when the 
prime minister proposed my replacement, but gross violation of 
the coalition agreement from December onwards. The second 
reason for our departure from the coalition and this decision is 
a fact that the work of the majority in the coalition and the 
government was geared to the creation of conditions that not 
only did not prevent corruption, but created circumstances that 
actually facilitated it. The third reason for our departure from 
the coalition is entirely political, namely, the balance of 
power has changed following the unification, that is to say, 
merger or drowning of the Democrats, the Eco-Greens, and the 
Socialists into this big Liberal Democracy. 
  [Skerjanc] The party council yesterday also made an 
important decision by which it authorized the party presidency 
and its president to start negotiations with the Slovene 
Peoples' Party, the Christian Democrats, and the Greens of 
Slovenia, or, if the Christian Democrats will not leave the 
coalition, the National Democrats, about the formation of a wide 
political coalition whose aim would be a democratic and socially 
and morally just Slovenia. 
  The coalition plans to appear seriously at the local 
elections. In case the Slovene Christian Democrats would leave 
the coalition, the SDSS also sees the need to hold extraordinary 
parliamentary elections, which could be organized simultaneously 
with the local elections. 
  Jansa also spoke about the anti-corruption rally scheduled 
for tomorrow. He said that the Christian Democratic Party took 
part in its organization too, which is, according to him, a good 
omen for future negotiations about the joint coalition. [end

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 20 (AFP) - Bosnian Serb shells 
pounded Wednesday [20 April] into the besieged Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, killing four people and wounding seven, according to a 
local official, reached by radio. [passage omitted] 
  The commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General Sir 
Michael Rose, had welcomed Karadzic's announcement on allowing 
UNPROFOR troops into Gorazde. 
  "It is important because it does bring about a cease-fire. 
It does allow us to run these humanitarian and UNPROFOR 
convoys," Rose said in an interview with the BBC. "It is the 
first step." Any cease-fire, he said, was temporary, but he 
hoped the current move would turn into a permanent cessation of 
hostilities, but this depended on the willingness of the two 
parties not to resume their conflict. 
  In Geneva, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) said UNHCR representatives reported an easing of the 
Serb assault on the town. 
  "The last message we've got said that the shelling had died 
down considerably," UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said after 
contacting staff in Gorazde at 7:00 AM (0500 GMT). [passage 
omitted] 
  Rose said Wednesday, meanwhile, that the exclusion zone for 
heavy weapons around Sarajevo could well be replicated elsewhere 
in the safe areas. Some 12,000 people are now without shelter 
in Gorazde and the corridors of apartment blocks are full of 
people. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, April 20 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
Wednesday [20 April] shelled the besieged Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, killing more people, despite a "unilateral peace" 
announcement and an undertaking by their political leadership to 
let UN peacekeepers into the city. [passage omitted] Meanwhile 
Pope John Paul II appealed to all sides to respect the ceasefire 
and resume peace talks. He deplored that the "assault on the 
martyred city could go on... despite the truce promised by the 
besieging forces." 
  A statement from Karadzic's office said the Bosnian Serbs 
had 
Wednesday "unilaterally proclaimed peace at Gorazde, which ends 
the crisis around the town," the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA 
reported. This "act" was in response to statements Tuesday from 
the Russian and U.S. presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton, 
the statement added. [passage omitted] 
  An UNPROFOR official here said Wednesday that under the 
truce 
agreement, signed with the UN late Tuesday night in nearby Pale, 
the Serb side agreed to stop firing "immediately" as long as 
they were not attacked. However shelling continued early 
Wednesday although with less intensity, UNPROFOR spokesman Major 
Rob Annink said. Several shells hit a building housing UN 
military observers but left no casualties, and it was dangerous 
to move around the town, he added. Meanwhile refugees continued 
to flood in, he said. Serb forces appeared to be trying to 
block the road leading west out of the town, on the left bank, 
he added. 
  Under the temporary ceasefire, the Serbs had agreed to cease 
military activities over a three-kilometer (two-mile) stretch of 
land, starting from central Gorazde and running to the left bank 
of the Drina, which divides the town. UNPROFOR and other 
humanitarian groups could help civilians, and organize medical 
evacuations and prisoner exchanges in that area. [passage 
omitted] In Geneva, a spokesman for the UN High Commission for 
Refugees quoted their doctor in charge of medical evacuations, 
Gordona Stjepanovic, as saying "the situation is worse in 
Gorazde than it was in the worst moments in Sarajevo." 
Spokesman Ron Redmond said there was "nothing to eat" and 
people "risk their lives" trying to get water. On Tuesday, 43 
people were killed, including six children, and 112 people were 
wounded, bringing the total since the Serb offensive began March 
28 to 345 dead and 1,187 wounded, UNHCR said.

<F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic] </F>
  [Excerpt] The situation in Gorazde is becoming ever more 
dramatic and the [Serbian] fascists are again massing along all 
the lines of attack on the town. The greatest concentration of 
chetniks and the largest amount of military hardware have been 
registered in the valley of the Praca River from the direction 
of Necici toward Jabucko Sedlo and Sjenokos. The situation in 
the town (?center) is taking on the bloodiest proportions. The 
innocent civilian population has been suffering from being out 
in the open. A wide-scale epidemic is threatening, so Gorazde 
is again sending an appeal for help for the suffering. The 
situation in the war hospital, the health center is worse than 
sad. No words can describe the situation there. Dozens of 
civilian victims killed by the criminals from the hills are 
lying in the streets of the town and on the bridges over the 
Drina. It was impossible to help them at all, as the chetniks 
blanketed every inch of the free Gorazde territory, and 
particularly the town center, with fierce artillery and sniper 
fire from the surrounding hills. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 080 GMT on 20 April within its 
regular 7-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  In a report from Gorazde "that has just been received," Esad 
(Ovranovic), chairman of the Regional Executive Committee, says 
that "the town is being extremely heavily shelled this morning 
as well. All the defense lines are also being attacked. In the 
last 24 hours, 44 people have been killed, and (?134) have been 
seriously wounded in Gorazde. Therefore, 389 people have been 
killed and 1,324 wounded since the beginning of the offensive. 
The situation is extremely difficult. There is no [word 
indistinct]. There are many wounded people, and the hospital is 
in a terrible state. I really do not know how to find a way out 
of all this." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports that "the free Brcko territory has 
been exposed to one of the fiercest offensives so far by the 
Serbian aggressor. Along with constant shelling of the defense 
lines and civilian targets, the aggressor is trying to break 
through to the free Brcko territory from several directions." 
"The Serbian aggressor, who has been successfully repelled 
along all the lines of the Brcko defenses over the past 10 days, 
is not giving up the attacks. This is shown by the new 
reinforcements that the aggressor has brought in heavy transport 
vehicles to Potocari and Cadjevac. Strong regrouping of chetnik 
men and hardware is being done [word indistinct] the positions 
of the 108th Motorized Brigade and the 108th Infantry Brigade at 
Vranovaca and [name indistinct]." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports that "there has been no peace in the 
Bihac region overnight and so far this morning. Karadzic's 
terrorists have continued shelling and attacking the positions 
of the defenders of the 505th Chivalrous Motorized Brigade and 
the general region of [name indistinct] from their strongholds 
in (Torbula), Stanac, Veliki Radic, and [name indistinct]. 
Operations on those regions from [word indistinct] regions of 
the Republic of Croatia, that is, the so-called Serbian 
autonomous region of Krajina, which are [word indistinct] 
controlled." 
  In a largely indistinct report, a correspondent whose name 
is 
indistinct says that "Olovo continues to be target of the 
aggressor's attacks. During the night, the aggressor's 
long-range artillery began its bestial orgy."

  [Text] Cajnice, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- Following strong Muslim 
attacks yesterday, fighting on the Gorazde front resumed this 
morning with extreme ferocity along the entire line of 
confrontation, the Herzegovina corps command has announced. 
Muslims have so far failed to observe any of the existing 
cease- fire agreements, the Herzegovina corps command said, 
adding that Muslims will probably try to take advantage of the 
deployment of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in the area of 
Gorazde to provoke the Serbs and to accuse them of attacking the 
force of the international community. The most intense fire is 
coming from the center of the town. Muslims are using mortars, 
anti-aircraft weapons, and snipers, the Herzegovina corps 
command insists. 
  Despite orders from its high command, the Serbian side has 
been forced to respond to the Muslim attacks. The Herzegovina 
corps command insists that there is no truth in the Muslim 
claims that Serbian fighters have been pounding the Gorazde 
urban area with artillery weapons. Late yesterday afternoon, 
NATO planes overflew Serbian positions on the Gorazde front but 
at permitted altitude and did not engage in any combat activity.

<F P=106> [Report by Marie-France Chatain ] </F>
  [Excerpt] In Bosnia, the agony of Gorazde is continuing. 
It is difficult to obrtain precise information. According to 
the UNHCR, bombing has decreased drastically this morning. On 
the other hand, Bosnian radio in Sarajevo says that the 
situation is getting worse in the Muslim enclave and adds that 
Serb gunners are still shooting at civilian targets. 
  In any case, for the thousands Muslim refugees holed up in 
the city, the situation is tragic to say the least. Forty-three 
people, including six children, were killed in yesterday's 
bombing. The besieged lack everything -- food and water -- and 
thousands of people are homeless. Here is Christiane 
Berthiaume, the UNHCR spokesperson. Christiane Berthiaume has 
managed to get precise information on the situation in Gorazde: 
  [Berthiaume] People are roaming in the streets, people are 
sleeping on the streets because there isn't anywhere to house 
them. There are 30,000 refugees, 30,000 displaced people, who 
have fled from the villages around Gorazde which have fallen or 
which have been burned down and have come to find refuge in the 
city. However, even before the fighting started, 60 percent of 
the buildings had been destroyed or damaged. There is nowhere 
to put them up. Each square meter is occupied by a displaced 
person. 
  [Chatain] What are you intending to do now that things have 
become worse in Gorazde? Are you intending to repatriate your 
UNHCR representatives? 
  [Berthiaume] It is impossible to evacuate anyone from 
Gorazde 
at the moment. For several days now, we have been trying to 
evacuate at least 200 people who are lying seriously wounded in 
the hospital of Gorazde, and we cannot do it. If the wounded 
cannot leave, the personnel of the UNHCR, of Medecins Sans 
Frontiers, and of the Red Cross cannot leave either. The 
bombing is far too heavy, far too serious. It is hell there.

  [Text] Forty-three people, including 6 children, were 
killed and 112 were wounded in Gorazde yesterday, UNHCR 
spokesman Peter Kessler said on Wednesday [20 April]. A UNHCR 
building in Gorazde was hit twice at about 1800 yesterday 
evening, but there were no casualties among the staff, Kessler 
said, quoting reports by UNHCR personnel on the ground. The 
shelling of Gorazde continued on Wednesday morning, but less 
intensely, Ron Redman, UNHCR spokesman in Geneva, said after 
talking to Gorazde ham operators at 0700 this morning.

  [Text] Chaos and street fighting are raging in Gorazde. 
That was reported this afternoon by local official Esad 
Obranovic, speaking for Radio Sarajevo via ham radio operators. 
Obranovic said the Gorazde hospital, some 200 meters from the 
scene of bitter conflicts on the right bank of the River Drina, 
was crammed with the wounded and people were still seeking 
shelter in its corridors. Meanwhile, house-to-house fighting 
was reported in the suburbs of Gorazde. The Bosnian prime 
minister Haris Silajdzic said the Serb forces had hit an ammonia 
storage facility and were continuing to open fire on the town.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] A radio link-up with Gorazde was 
again established this evening. The person who spoke with 
domestic and foreign journalists was Esad Ohranovic, chairman of 
the executive committee of the Gorazde district. Edib Music 
reports on the link-up: 
  [Music] Judging by information that we received from Mr. 
Ohranovic this evening, the situation in Gorazde is further 
deteriorating. Let us hear what was happening around 2030 this 
evening, and also earlier in the day: 
  [Begin Ohranovic recording] At this moment the Hotel Gradina 
and the neighboring building are ablaze. On the right side 
apartment blocks called [word indistinct] and Panorama are also 
on fire. Everything is enveloped in smoke. Earlier today, six 
people were wounded in a building housing a Red Cross refugee 
center. The chetniks are no longer attacking front lines. They 
simply wish to kill as many civilians as possible by shelling 
residential areas. Between 0800 and 2000 today, 26 people were 
killed and 62 were wounded. It is difficult to bury the dead as 
there is intense sniper fire over the cemetery. 
  A great problem is drinking water, as there are no springs 
that we have access to. Poisonous gases were also released 
today. The people affected are feeling dizzy and faint. The 
situation along the defense lines is extremely difficult, but we 
must persevere. At this moment both the right and the left 
sides are coming under intensive fire; I can no longer say from 
which weapons. [passage omitted] In every case, the biggest 
problem is the population without any accommodation who are 
sheltering in entrances, in porches. This is the biggest 
problem at the moment. We really do not have the facilities to 
accommodate at least 10,000 people. This evening the hospital 
again came under fire, and two people were wounded. Poisonous 
gases were thrown directly on the hospital. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [Announcer Paul Amar] Let's return to the 
deterioration of the situation in Gorazde in Bosnia, because we 
now have live with us from Geneva Mrs Berthiaume. Good evening. 
You are the spokesperson of the UNHCR in Geneva, so you have 
information from Gorazde that we may not have. Can you tell me 
this information about what is happening in that town, that has 
been surrounded by the Serbs. 
  [Berthiaume] The latest information we received goes back to 
about 1800. Two shells had struck the building where the 
employees of the UNHCR are based -- not only them, but also the 
forces of the UN military observers, as well as a large number 
of refugees. There are dozens and dozens of refugees in the 
building, displaced persons, who, I suppose, felt safer in our 
building, and unfortunately we have had no news of these people 
since then. [passage omitted] 
  [Amar] Thank you, Christiane Berthiaume, for telling us what 
is happening in Gorazde. Unfortunately we don't have any 
pictures, simply because the Serbs are preventing international 
television teams from filming. No pictures, but we can still 
give the news.

[19 April] on the building sheltering four UNHCR aid workers and 
five UN Protection Force observers, the UNHCR said here. The UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees here said the shells struck at 
around 5:50 p.m. (1550 GMT), when communications with the 
agency's team in the Bosnian enclave were cut off after a radio

  [Text] Cajnice, 19 April (TANJUG) -- Positions of the army 
of the republic of Srpska on the left bank of the Drina river 
have since early this morning been exposed to fierce artillery 
fire coming from Muslim forces in the center of Gorazde, the 
command of the Herzegovina corps announced this evening. The 
attacks intensified after NATO aircraft had begun overflying 
Serb positions between Gorazde and Cajnice this afternoon. This 
encouraged Muslim forces to attempt to carry out infantry 
onslaughts in several places along the separation line. 
  The command of the Herzegovina corps said that for their 
attacks, Muslim forces have been using facilities in which 
representatives of international humanitarian organizations and 
the UN are accommodated. Fire from anti-aircraft guns and 
machine-guns has been opened from the hospital building, 
schools, and other institutions. 
  The command of the Herzegovina corps today resolutely denied 
reports broadcast by Sarajevo media that the Serb army used 
chemical weapons, stressing that this has been done by Muslim 
forces which have a factory for the production of the banned 
chemicals in Gorazde. Despite the fierce attacks, the Serb 
forces today managed to preserve their front lines, the command 
said.

  [Text] The Bosnia-Herzegovina Government met this 
afternoon to discuss the current situation in Gorazde. At the 
beginning of the open part of the session, Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic read the following statement: 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] The aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been underway for more than two years 
already and has culminated in a fresh invasion by the 
aggressor's forces from Serbia and Montenegro. With the 
knowledge of the entire world, the aggressor is bringing new 
troops, tanks, and artillery from Titovo Uzice, Kraljevo in 
Serbia, and Podgorica in Montenegro. The residents of Gorazde, 
surrounded and cut off, have been destroyed with everything that 
the aggressor has at his disposal for two years, including 
irritant agents that are being used in concentrations prohibited 
by the Geneva convention. Every square meter is shelled and the 
hospital is almost destroyed. Gorazde is defending itself the 
way it can and is trying to stop the aggressor's forces from 
entering the town, and naturally, to prevent a massacre [words 
indistinct]. 
  We would like to remind that this is a UN Protected Area. 
The UN (?leaders) failed to undertake the measures to which 
they are entitled by the relevant resolutions of the UN Security 
Council. We have learned that UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali 
sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Woerner in connection 
with these events. However, for the time being there is still no 
action. The aggressor is encouraged by such a position of the 
United Nations. 
  The aggressor's soldiers today used force to seize the arms 
that were in Lukavica guarded by the members of the French 
Battalion on the basis of a NATO ultimatum of 9 February 1994. 
This action constitutes a flagrant violation of the NATO 
ultimatum and paves the way for a new aggression on Sarajevo and 
other towns throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Parallel to this, 
the aggressor's forces have been holding approximately 100 UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] soldiers hostage. 
  This is not merely a question of United Nations and NATO 
credibility, but also a question of peace or war in this [word 
indistinct]. 
  The international community is responsible for this [word 
indistinct] because it has facilitated the aggression and made 
it easy by keeping in power the arms embargo that is only 
effecting the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is a victim 
of the aggression. 
  We informed NATO Secretary General Woerner about the 
development of the situation and demanded urgent action in 
accordance with the NATO ultimatum. [end recording] 
  The government's session at the beginning of which Prime 
Minister Silajdzic read the statement that you have just heard, 
was continued without the presence of reporters.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srspka, said today that 
Butrus-Ghali's letter to NATO would not help the peace process. 
The letter unfortunately vindicates our decision to reexamine 
our relations with the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], Karadzic 
said at a news conference in Pale, adding that the Serbian 
soldiers need to know clearly whether UNPROFOR is an enemy or 
not. 
  "We most seriously suggest to the United Nations that it 
make 
the security zones as secure as possible, demilitarize them, and 
prevent the Muslims from attacking Serbian positions from the 
protected zones. But, if they want to wage a war we will defend 
ourselves in every possible way," Karadzic said. 
  Asked what he expects from Russia, Karadzic said he still 
does not know whether Butrus-Ghali's letter will go through the 
UN Security Council at all or not, nor what decision will be 
passed. "In any case we rely on our own resources and we are 
ready and convinced that we can defend ourselves," Karadzic 
stressed. 
  Most questions related to the situation in and around 
Gorazde. 
  Karadzic repeated several times that the Serbian forces will 
not occupy the town center of Gorazde. "We could have done it, 
but we want to make Gorazde a protected zone. This means that 
it has to be demilitarized and that peacekeeping forces should 
be deployed -- in order to separate the forces -- in a 3-km zone 
on the left bank, which is the Muslim part," the RS president 
said, adding that this could be implemented, as far as the Serbs 
are concerned, as early as today. 
  "The left bank [of the Drina] is much more peaceful than 
Muslim radio and their radio hams are reporting. They are 
dramatizing the situation with the intention of provoking a 
reaction by the international community, while at the same time 
Muslim forces are attacking us on the right bank, launching 
infantry attacks using boats," Karadzic said, adding that he is 
receiving reports on the situation in Gorazde every hour. The 
Muslims, however, do not want to stop firing, Karadzic added. He 
said that he hopes that the Serbs will this evening establish a 
cease-fire and that the Muslims will have to accept this. He 
rejected accusations that the Serbs are to blame for the 
"catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gorazde and the attacks 
on civilian targets." 
  Representatives of international organizations in Gorazde 
are 
misinforming the public under pressure from the Muslim forces, 
the RS president said, and pointed out that the state leadership 
of the RS is maintaining contacts with Yasushi Akashi and the 
political sector of UNPROFOR. 
  "We only want to protect ourselves against Muslim attacks 
from the protected zones, and if the United Nations does not 
want to do this, we will make Gorazde into a safe zone," 
Karadzic said. 
  Commenting on a statement made yesterday by Alija 
Izetbegovic 
that the Muslims would go for "everything or nothing," because 
the Serbs had gone for everything or nothing and that they would 
"gain nothing", Karadzic said: 
  "The Serbs most definitely did not go for nothing, but did 
not go for everything either. We went for what is ours, to 
defend our interests. If the Muslims decide to go for 
everything or nothing, the international community must adopt an 
attitude toward that." 
  Dwelling on a remark made by special Russian envoy Vitaliy 
Churkin, Karadzic said that Churkin is a very good diplomat. "We 
have recently been under the same pressure and I think that this 
remark came as a result of an emotional reaction. I think we 
can forget that," Karadzic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic by </F>
Fausto Biloslavo in Pale; date not given: "Karadzic: `It Will 
Be Total War'"] 
  [Excerpt] Pale -- [passage omitted] Karadzic -- in a blue 
suit and sporting an unruly forelock -- started by saying: "The 
Gorazde crisis? UNPROFOR (the blue helmet contingent in the 
former Yugoslavia -- L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) is entirely 
to blame, because Gorazde was not a safe area, but a Muslim 
stronghold which was never demilitarized. In addition, it was 
precisely from Gorazde that the Muslims launched a spring 
offensive, and we are absolutely determined to deal a blow for a 
blow, throughout Bosnia, in response to their attacks. The 
international community must cease supporting the Muslims." 
  [Biloslavo] Will you conquer Gorazde? 
  [Karadzic] We could do so, but our objective is simply to 
demilitarize the town and secure it by defending the area on the 
Drina river's right bank, which is traditionally a Serbian area. 
As a gesture of goodwill, we have allowed the United Nations to 
send about 100 blue helmets (Ukrainian volunteers -- 
L'INDIPENDENTE editor's note) to the river's left bank, three 
kilometers from the town center, in order to protect civilians 
only, not the Muslim soldiers. 
  [Biloslavo] The Serbs are being accused of shelling civilian 
targets, and General Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, has defined 
Gorazde a humanitarian catastrophe. What is your reply to this? 
  [Karadzic] You must not believe the Muslim sources, their 
amateur radio stations. They often exaggerate the situation in 
order to provoke Western intervention. We are trying to 
stabilize the cease-fire. 
  [Biloslavo] What do you think of [UN Secretary General] 
Butrus-Ghali requesting NATO to prepare for massive bombing 
raids on the Serbs? 
  [Karadzic] If this request were heeded, this could only mean 
war, and we will respond with every means at our disposal. NATO 
must be clear about this point, because our soldiers need to 
know whether or not the blue helmets are their enemies. 
  [Biloslavo] Are you prepared to retaliate against Italy too? 
  [Karadzic] The French, British, and Americans were once our 
allies, and we find it difficult to shoot on them. Italy was 
our enemy in the last war, but we always had a very good 
relationship with the Italian people. Italy would be well 
advised to cancel the hospitality that it is giving to NATO 
aircraft. If an escalation takes place, a terrible war will 
break out. For the time being, we have no intention of 
retaliating against your country, although we cannot rule out 
anything if the situation gets worse. 
  [Biloslavo] Why did you recover 18 anti-aircraft weapons 
which were supposed to remain under UN control in Sarajevo? 
  [Karadzic] The Serbs have no intention of passively awaiting 
possible air attacks. 
  [Biloslavo] It looks as though the Russians have also turned 
their backs on you. Is this true? 
  [Karadzic] Moscow envoy Churkin's critical remarks against 
us 
are due to the tension which has developed over the past few 
days. It was an emotional reaction, and we are prepared to 
forgive. 
  [Biloslavo] Will you resume contacts with the UNPROFOR 
forces? 
  [Karadzic] For the moment, contacts are suspended, and they 
can only be resumed if the United Nations decide to cancel the 
embargo against the Serbs. 
  [Biloslavo] What do you think of the recent statement by 
Bosnian President Izetbegovic, inviting Muslims to fight "in 
order to obtain everything or nothing"? 
  [Karadzic] We have gained our due. In one respect I agree 
with the Muslims: They will obtain nothing.

  [Text] Washington, April 19 (TANJUG) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton and members of the National Security Council on Tuesday 
morning [19 April] began discussions on a future U.S. diplomatic 
and military platform for Bosnia-Herzegovina. As indicated by 
U.S. Administration officials, the basic U.S. idea is to try to 
persuade its allies and the United Nations to step up air 
attacks on Bosnian serb targets. Yesterday's verbal attack on 
the Bosnian Serb leadership by Vitaliy Churkin in Moscow has 
directly spurred and encouraged Clinton's advisors to opt for 
more severe punitive measures against the Bosnian Serbs, sources 
in Washington said. 
  Churkin's statement that Russia would not allow the Serbs to 
treat it as a `banana republic' and that `negotiations with the 
Serbs' should be suspended was received in the White House with 
relief because it was interpreted as a direct suggestion to the 
U.S. to adopt a radical platform which would not be countered by 
a Russian veto. 
  Commenting on Churkin's statement, Russian Ambassador to the 
United Nations Yuriy Vorontsov said that neither the Russian 
Government nor President Boris Yeltsin were behind it. U.S. 
papers write that Monday's request by U.N. Secretary-General 
Butros Butros-Ghali for new NATO actions against Bosnian Serbs 
had been inspired by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations 
Madeleine Albright, who is also a member of the National 
Security Council. On Monday, she was briefly absent from a 
National Security Council session, which discussed proposals for 
Tuesday's meeting with Clinton, in order to telephone to 
Butros-Ghali and tell him that the White House was willing to 
launch more radical air strikes on the Bosnian Serbs. 
  Observers in Washington are not sure what kind of reception 
the new, more radical U.S. variant will get. It is believed 
that a difficult diplomatic manoeuvre will be needed to win over 
NATO allies for a wider-scale bombing. Indicating a tougher 
stand toward the Bosnian Serbs, U.S. papers and a part of 
political structures on Tuesday said that the White House was 
ready to exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the embargo on arms 
deliveries to all sides in former Yugoslavia. After an 
incredible pressure from the Congress and the radical wing in 
the White House on Monday, the issue was put on the agenda of 
Clinton's meeting with the National Security Council on Tuesday.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Foreign minister of 
the Serb republic (S.R.) in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Aleksa Buha said on Tuesday [19 April] that 
Russian envoy Vitaliy Churkin's angry statement on Monday 
evening that talks with Serbs should be broken off had been made 
in the heat of the moment. Buha said in an interview to 
Obrenovac radio that `Mr Churkin had a very ambitious plan to 
turn partial peace in Gorazde into a lasting ceasefire in the 
entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would give sense 
to the former, but the Moslems rejected the global plan so that 
very little has remained of the partial plan.' 
  `Faced with the current situation, it is possible that Mr 
Churkin was afraid of possible further developments so that his 
statement that talks with Serbs should be discontinued was made 
in the heat of the moment,' said Buha. Over the weekend, 
Churkin and head of the U.N. mission in Former Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi mediated talks on ending hostilities between the 
Bosnian Moslems and Serbs. 
  We agree with Churkin that his country, Russia, must act as 
a 
great country which it is, i.e. with responsibility, but we 
also believe that it should use the right words to address other 
problems elsewhere and that a small country like ours should not 
be the mirror of its greatness, he said. Reacting to Churkin's 
statement, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Yuriy 
Vorontsov said that the Russian Government and President Boris 
Yeltsin did not stand behind it. 
  Buha denied that there were any significant disagreements 
between the S.R. political and military leaderships, adding 
that there were only some minor differences. Asked whether the 
return of Lord David Owen marked also a return to Geneva talks, 
Buha said that the peace talks should have stayed in Geneva. 
  Future Geneva talks must start from the fact that, after the 
creation of the Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia, there are 
currently two entities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Buha said and 
added that the talks should be held in two phases. In the first 
phase, the two states should be delineated while in the second 
agreement should be reached on possible future ties between the 
Moslem-Croat federation and the S.R., he said. Under U.S. 
pressure, the Moslems and Croats last March signed an agreement 
on forming a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia, which would 
subsequently form a confederation with Croatia. 
  The Serbs were not invited to the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Xavier Gautier in Sarajevo; date not given: "The United Nations 
Is Not Protecting Anything, Not Even Sarajevo"] 
  [Text] In Sarajevo, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic is 
regarded by many Bosnians as the most capable, and certainly the 
most ambitious, politician. The message of this 47-year-old 
man, whose jaw is constantly clenched and who was "exiled" to 
Libya under Tito, to the UN Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) is 
virulent. But he refrained from demanding the blue helmets' 
withdrawal. 
  [Gautier] What is the current situation in Gorazde? 
  [Silajdzic] The Serbs have attacked the city of Gorazde with 
30,000 soldiers, supported by 19 tanks and more than 100 pieces 
of large-caliber artillery, which arrived from the barracks of 
Uzice and Kraljevo in Serbia, and from Podgorica in Montenegro. 
Trapped by the arms embargo, the Bosnians have no means to 
defend themselves. The international community has sentenced us 
to death. The Serbs intend to conquer the city and cleanse it of 
its population to complete their "Greater Serbia." They will 
now extend this strategy to the remaining parts of eastern 
Bosnia which still escape them. 
  [Gautier] Can the city hold out? 
  [Silajdzic] It is still defended and Gorazde will defend 
itself to its last bullet. 
  [Gautier] Are other "safe areas" threatened? 
  [Silajdzic] The United Nations is not protecting anything, 
not even Sarajevo. The Serbs are regaining their large-caliber 
weapons, which had been placed under the control of the blue 
helmets... The Serbs will first try to expand into the 
northeastern part of Bosnia. Then it will be the turn of the 
Bihac pocket, where the French blue helmets are currently 
deployed. 
  [Gautier] You attack the United Nations fiercely. Do you 
want the blue helmets to withdraw? 
  [Silajdzic] No. What we are demanding is arms, in other 
words the lifting of the embargo imposed on us by the United 
Nations. It is the United Nations itself which has placed us in 
this quagmire. It must extricate itself from it, together with 
us. 
  [Gautier] Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic has just made a 
lengthy visit to Washington. Has he received American 
assurances on the lifting of the arms embargo? 
  [Silajdzic] In principle, the United States refuses to back 
the UN blockade imposed on us. But we must be realistic: In 
Congress things are not really moving in our favor. 
  [Gautier] So Bosnia no longer has any allies? 
  [Silajdzic] French policy fortunately is changing in our 
favor. French planes took part in the air strikes against (the 
Serbian forces around) Gorazde in a support role. We are 
grateful to France for that. 
  [Gautier] What do you hope the French will do? 
  [Silajdzic] That they simply stand by their principles of 
justice and freedom. 
  [Gautier] Aside from words, what support have you obtained 
from Arab and Muslim countries? 
  [Silajdzic] What else could they do? Their hands are tied 
by the big powers. 
  [Gautier] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, your ally, said 
recently that the main danger threatening Bosnia is Islamic 
fundamentalism. What do you think of that? 
  [Silajdzic] The danger which is indeed threatening this part 
of the world is that of fundamentalism, an ethnic or fascist 
fundamentalism. In our camp, I have never seen Muslims destroy 
a single church in Bosnia. 
  [Gautier] To give a few examples: Last summer, Muslim 
fundamentalists blew up a swimming pool and shot at swimmers in 
Zenica. Muslims also massacred Croatians in the village of 
Uzbol... 
  [Silajdzic] There have been incidents, it is true, but you 
must compare what can be compared. Help us combat this 
barbarism. Bosnia is a civilized country.

<F P=106> [Report by Peter Almond: "We Came to Keep Peace, Not Fight </F>
a War, Says Rose"] 
  [Text] "You do not fight a war in white vehicles," said 
the UN Commander in Bosnia, Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose, yesterday 
as he considered his possible responses to the situation in 
Gorazde. "I do not believe we are in the business of going to 
war in order to create conditions of peace. And I don't think 
either the world or the contributing nations would accept that." 
  With Gorazde "on the edge of a major humanitarian disaster", 
as he told BBC Radio 4, and with the Serbs pouring shells into 
the town at the rate of one every 20 seconds, Gen Rose has few 
options -- short of "going to war" -- to stop the Serbs doing 
what they want. The pressures on him are immense. Bringing to 
the job the authority and background to take a more robust 
approach to delivering aid he succeeded far beyond expectations, 
both in brokering a ceasefire between Croats and Muslims and in 
forcing the removal of Serb guns around Sarajevo. But the 
pressures that defeated his three predecessors were always 
present and are currently defeating him. White-painted vehicles 
cannot be used for combat. 
  His main problem has been to distinguish between the UN 
Security Council resolution that created a "safe area" around 
Gorazde and other enclaves and one that calls for the protection 
of UN personnel if they come under attack. He indicated 
yesterday he remains torn between the two. "I am responsible 
for the lives of 15,500 young men and women here who have been 
sent here as peacekeepers, not to fight a war," he said in 
Sarajevo. "My responsibility is to them as much as it is to the 
people of Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  The threat of air strikes succeeded around the safe haven of 
Sarajevo, but Gorazde required close air support operations that 
were quite different. Instead of the precision strike aircraft 
that Nato had planned to use in operations against artillery and 
command bunkers around Sarajevo, Gen Rose could only call on 
available "cab rank" close air support aircraft to attack 
opportunity targets around Gorazde. 
  The Serbs had the advantage of time and place in their 
attacks: the Nato pilots were handicapped by bad weather, and by 
rules of engagement that require positive visual identification 
of specific tanks or guns threatening UN personnel directly. 
  American pressures to make no distinction between defending 
UN personnel and protecting safe areas -- as stated by Mr Warren 
Christopher, Secretary of State, a week ago -- appeared to 
confuse the UN. While officials at the NATO air headquarters in 
Italy pressed for a wide-scale bombing campaign to stop Serb 
tanks, Gen Rose was pressed by Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
Secretary-General's special representative, to use close air 
support strikes only when absolutely necessary. Mr Akashi won. 
Gen Rose was reminded that he is a UN officer on a peacemaking 
mission. The resulting close air support actions were too 
little and too late. 
  While properly prepared air strikes could still check the 
Serbs, largely with American aircraft, Gen Rose knows that the 
Bosnian Serbs still have more than 100 UN hostages, with 
opportunities for grabbing others, and that he has very little 
hope of getting more troops to reinforce his peacemaking 
efforts. 
  Yesterday, he could only hope that the Serbs will be 
merciful 
in their victory at Gorazde. "I very much hope the situation 
will slowly return to normality, that we can prevent a 
humanitarian disaster around Gorazde and we can then go back to 
what we're supposed to be doing here and that is helping to 
return this country to peace and normality," he said. 
  Deflated and without his usual bounce, Gen Rose sounded 
bitter at the duplicity and treachery of the Bosnian Serb 
leadership. "It is a very sad day for the world when 
peace-keeping is used as a cover for the prosecution of war aims 
in such a blatant fashion. The assurances that were given 
repeatedly during the peace talks over the last week to people 
like Mr Akashi, and indeed to Mr Churkin (the Russian envoy) 
have been totally ignored. 
  "We now arrive at a very very sad situation indeed. However, 
you do have to put that against our overall mandate here in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is obviously a force for peace. And 
if you look at what has been achieved in central Bosnia and in 
and around Sarajevo you will find that life is slowly returning 
to normal." 
  His options to help Gorazde now are limited to trying to get 
medical help to the town. But even in that Gen Rose said he 
depended on the agreement of the Serbs to let casualty 
evacuation convoys in. The Serbs, he said, did not advise it 
"for the moment," and he admitted it may be another day or two 
before they do.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with French Colonel Pernod, commander </F>
of troops in the UN Sarajevo sector, by unidentified radio

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Commander of the Sarajevo sector, 
Colonel Pernod, good evening. Can you hear me? 
  [Pernod] Good evening, I can hear you. [passage omitted] 
There have been developments. Since 2000 this evening the 
weapons have started to be brought in, that is, we have been 
putting them under our control. Four have already arrived, the 
others are following. According to Major (Endic), the situation 
should be back to normal tomorrow, to what it was before the UN 
air strikes. This is of course [word indistinct] but we will 
see how things turn out tomorrow. 
  [Announcer] Colonel, what pressure is being put on the Serbs 
to return these weapons? 
  [Pernod] Well, we have continued the negotiations all 
afternoon. I assume that these negotiations are in conjunction 
with other negotiations of which, evidently, I am not aware. 
These negotiations are undoubtedly being conducted at a higher 
international level. I refer to Mr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Mr. 
Yakushi Akashi and at the level of governments. As far as we 
are concerned, we have negotiated all afternoon and the pressure 
has drastically decreased. Tomorrow in theory, we expect to have 
the freedom of movement we enjoyed before last week's air 
strikes. 
  [Announcer] Thank you, Colonel.

<F P=106> [Report by Zoran Grgurevic from Doboj] </F>
  [Text] After yesterday and last night, which were marked 
by constant shelling of civilian targets in Doboj and Teslic, 
and during which three civilians were wounded, the shelling 
continued today. 
  A general danger alarm has been in force in Doboj and Teslic 
since 0710. The residents are in shelters. A warning was also 
sounded at 0900. Doboj, Teslic, and all suburbs are being 
targeted with mortars and tanks as we report. The shells are 
hitting Teslic from the direction of Tesanj, and in Doboj from 
the direction of Matuzici and Gracanica. According to the 
available data, members of the 110th brigade of the Croatian 
Defense Council, who have been under the Muslim command of the 
7-South Operative Group since the beginning of the war, have 
joined in the artillery attacks on civilian targets. 
  As we have learned from the military sources of the 1st 
Krajina Corps, which was also confirmed in the press center, 
members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] on the Zepce-Maglaj 
front have publicly taken sides with the Muslims. Members of a 
special British company installed, between Maglaj and Zepce, 
four radar stations for detecting Serbian artillery. The data 
is then given to the Muslim units. After the blockade of Maglaj 
and Tesanj was lifted, the so-called peacemakers brought to the 
Muslim forces in this region a significant amount of arms and 
ammunition, which are mercilessly used against civilian targets. 
Members of UNPROFOR have openly taken sides with the Muslims 
and are engaging in small arms fire from their personnel 
carriers on the Serb positions and settlements on Mount Ozren, 
Parnica, Bijela Ploca, and Jablanica, together with the Muslim 
units. 
  The units of the army of the republic of Srpska have not yet 
responded to these obvious provocations because it is clear to 
everyone that an attempt is being made to provoke the Serbs and 
possibly transfer NATO actions to these parts of the republic of 
Srpska.

  [Text] Doboj, April 20 (TANJUG) -- In Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Moslem units continued Wednesday [20 April] attacks on Serb 
positions and settlements in the broader area of Doboj, northern 
Bosnia, said Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) military sources. The 
sources said Moslems fired 82 mm and 120 mm mortar shells, 
infantry arms and rifle grenades on the Serb defense positions 
northeast of Doboj. After the Serb side's response, in which 
several trenches were destroyed, the Moslem activity ceased. 
  Serbs in Doboj have for days been exposed to strong mortar 
and artillery fire, but although the Serb side suffered many 
casualties, the world public, including UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force], did nothing to prevent the plight of the Serb civilian 
population. In the Teslic war zone, south of Doboj, the Moslem 
formations stepped up provocations, mostly using infantry and 
anti-aircraft weapons, and regrouped. The Serb forces did not 
respond to occasional provocations by the Moslem forces which 
used infantry arms in the Mt. Ozren war zone. 
  It was quiet in the night of Tuesday-Wednesday along the 
whole length of the confrontation line at Brcko, in the Sava 
river region, the Serb military sources set out. The same 
sources also said Serb reconnaissance parties observed the 
arrival of fresh Moslem forces. This was an indication that the 
Moslems did not abandon attempts to cut the R.S. in two at this 
point in the Sava river region. Minor provocations by the 
Croatian forces were recorded in some parts of the front near 
Orasje, in the Sava river region.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- Muslim and Croatian 
forces resumed attacks around 1600 today against the Serbian 
positions around Brcko, the information service of the republic 
of Srpska army's First Krajina Corps says in a statement issued 
in Banja Luka. The attack by the Muslim forces was launched 
this morning from the direction of Vranovaca hill, 8 kms south 
of Brcko, and the suburb of Boderiste, south of Brcko. 
  At the same time, Croatian Army forces, using the territory 
of the Republic of Croatia, together with the members of the 
Croatian Defense Council, fired 24 rockets from multiple rocket 
launchers and several artillery shells on the same Serbian 
positions. Two Serbian soldiers were seriously wounded in these 
attacks, and several residential buildings were damaged. 
  Today's attacks are a part of the intensified offensive 
activities by the Muslim and Croatian forces in Posavina and 
part of the big spring offensive by the so-called 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, which is frequently joined by Croatian 
Defense Council units. The attacks are aimed at cutting the 
road links between the two Serb krajinas and Semberija and 
Yugoslavia.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 19 April reports, 
besides the Serbian attacks on Gorazde, on combat activities in 
other parts of the republic: 
  Correspondent from Brcko Hamiz Deronjic reports that 
"Dubrave, Jagodnjak, Tulumovici, Poljaci, Krajinovici, 
Vitanovici, Bajici, Djukici, Kladje, and the central part of 
Brcko's defense in Vranovaca and Boderiste have been the targets 
of chetnik artillery today. The most intense artillery attacks, 
merely a preparation for fresh infantry attacks on the defense 
lines, were aimed against Boderiste and Vranovaca. With the 
substantial support of tanks and artillery, chetniks in the 
region of Boderiste tried twice to break through defense lines, 
but were on both occasions forced to withdraw with losses in 
manpower. At approximately 1300 chetniks moved in for a fierce 
tank-infantry attack in the Vranovaca region, supported by 
artillery and self-propelled antiaircraft artillery. After 
major battles that lasted until 1420 the enemy was forced to 
retreat." Deronjic then reports that "a transport helicopter" 
arrived to "evacuate seriously injured enemy soldiers" after the 
battle. In conclusion, he also expresses the opinion that, in 
the shadow of the situation in Gorazde, "the chetniks are trying 
to quickly fix the problems on the battlefield that have caused 
them the biggest headaches." 
  Correspondent from Bihac Mirza Sadikovic reports that 
"Karadzic's fascists are today attacking Buzim and the nearby 
areas; they also continue to attack and attempt infantry 
breakthroughs on the defense lines in this region, the 5th Corps 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's zone of responsibility." 
  Sadikovic further reports that "throughout the day Abdic's 
paramilitary formations have been shelling the border regions in 
the Cazin area at various intervals, provoking infantry clashes. 
The aggressor indiscriminately shelled other defense lines in 
the 5th Corps' zone of responsibility and the Headquarters of 
the Croatian Defense Council, especially in the Bosanska Krupa 
area of the battlefield, and opened fire with antiaircraft 
artillery and heavy machine guns." 
  A report from the Srebrenica Press Center claims that "the 
Serbian aggressor has been systematically exhausting Srebrenica. 
Beside exhaustion through starvation, he is also increasing 
provocations along the lines of encirclement and at the same 
time concentrating manpower and military hardware on the 
occupied territory of (Vlasenica), (Vratovac), and Srebrenica in 
the direct vicinity of the demilitarized zone. Recently the 
aggressor has been carrying out [word indistinct] propaganda 
activity in Srebrenica and also stepped up surveillance of this 
[words indistinct]." 
  An announcer-read report on the situation in Sarajevo notes 
"increased concentration of manpower and arms around the town." 
It is reported that "four 105 mm howitzers, two antiaircraft 
guns, two self-propelled antiaircraft artillery pieces, and four 
76 mm ZIS [expansion unknown] are positioned in the region of 
Pavovac; two ZIS are placed behind the Lukavica barracks. All 
the weapons are dug into the ground and turned [word indistinct] 
in the direction of Sokolovic Kolonija and Hrasnica. The enemy 
today continued with infantry arms provocations along defense 
lines and in the suburbs."

  [Text] Srbobran, April 19 (TANJUG) -- The separation of 
Moslem and Croat forces in the area of Gornji Vakuf and the 
division of the territory of this town in central 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which began on Tuesday [19 April], are 
accompanied by frequent incidents and exchange of fire between 
the two armies, Bosnian Serb military sources said. 
  Moslems will keep the name Gornji Vakuf for their part of 
the 
town, while the Croats will change the name to Uskoplje. Gornji 
Vakuf will be the third town that has been carved up by the 
Moslems and Croats. Mostar, the biggest town and the 
administrative seat of the region of Herzegovina in the 
southwest of the republic, and Vitez, in the central part, have 
already been divided. These towns were the sites of the 
heaviest one-year Moslem-Croat clashes in the central and 
southern parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina when they were fighting for 
territories. 
  The ceasefire agreement and division of territories followed 
the signing of an agreement on a Moslem-Croat federation in 
Washington on March 18 under strong U.S. pressure. The 
federation should eventually form a confederation with 
neighbouring Croatia.

  [Text] According to the information of the Center for 
Investigating War Crimes of the Prozor municipality, 153 
prisoners have been released from the Heliodrom camp. Borka 
Rudic reports: 
  [Rudic] Of these, 33 arrived last night in the Jablanica 
municipality, where the War Presidency and other civilian organs 
of authority of the Prozor municipality have their provisional 
seats. The other prisoners left for the municipalities of 
Bugojno and Zenica, where their families are. 
  All inmates of the Heliodrom camp should be released today. 
According to what those who have already arrived in Jablanica 
said, there are another 70 Muslims from Prozor in this camp in 
Herzegovina. A further 25 of them are also expected to arrive 
in Jablanica. The others expressed the wish to go abroad. 
  The release of the prisoners from the Heliodrom camp is a 
result of the latest agreements between the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the Croatian sides that were recently reached in Medjugorje, 
and the endeavors to realize the Washington agreement in 
practice. 
  Dr. Slobodan Lang also made a major contribution to the 
successful release of the Muslims from this Herzegovina camp of 
the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. Even after the release of 
these residents of Prozor, who were imprisoned nine months ago 
and placed first in a prison in Prozor and then in Heliodrom, 
according the local Center for Investigating War Crimes, the 
fate of 200 Muslims from Prozor is completely uncertain. 
Therefore, members of the civilian authority of that 
municipality are appealing to the International Red Cross and 
all other organizations to do whatever can be done to finally 
find out what has actually happened to these 200 civilians.

<F P=106> [Article by Bruno Francheschi: "Governor of National Bank of </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Predicts: After War--Convertible Bosnian 
Dinar"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo--The governor of the National Bank of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kasim Omicevic, expressed his hope that the 
recovery of the country's economy, with the help of the 
international community, will make it possible to create a 
strong and convertible dinar. 
  But for now the central bank is just a plan--the National 
Bank of Bosnia-Herzegovina lacks the means to influence the 
financial reality of the country. It has contented itself with 
printing up coupons for Sarajevo on poor-quality paper, the 
value of which, in theory, is equal to the Bosnian dinar. This 
new Bosnian dinar, printed in April 1992, shortly after 
Bosnia-Herzegovina gained independence, has never actually 
circulated in Sarajevo because of the siege by Bosnian Serb 
forces. 
  In an interview with a journalist from FRANCE PRESSE, 
Governor Omicevic says, "We have given a lot of thought to the 
banking system that we will establish after the war. It will be 
set up on criteria common to Western Europe and criteria 
recommended by the International Monetary Fund. Our banking 
system will follow the economy closely on the basis of the 
principles of free enterprise, while in reality we will 
continually save for democracy, because that was our basic 
motivation in signing the new federal constitution for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Present-day reality is completely different, he admits: The 
black market is flourishing, and all transactions are conducted 
in German marks [DM]. "We cannot eliminate that type of market 
through an ordinary administrative decision. For now, the black 
market is the market," says Omicevic. 
  A strong and convertible dinar in a recovered economy will 
itself eliminate the black market and completely supplant the 
German mark as a means of payment, the governor contends. 
  In Sarajevo, everything is paid for in marks. One mark is 
worth 500,000 dinars in coupons, which is equivalent to the 
average monthly wage. A kilogram of meat costs DM90, and DM35 
must be put down for the same quantity of potatoes. And that is 
the impossible dream for the approximately 350,000 inhabitants 
of Sarajevo. 
  Fed by free humanitarian aid packages that arrive in 
Sarajevo 
by airlift, residents mostly use their coupons to buy bread or 
the daily OSLOBODJENJE. Now they will be able to buy streetcar 
tickets for 30,000 dinars as well. International aid will be 
running dry before long, the governor emphasizes, but much 
remains to be done. 
  The government has estimated the cost of reconstruction at 
around $3 billion. The bank has a small quantity of foreign 
exchange, $50 million, while the country has $1.6 billion in 
reserves, deposited before the war at the central Yugoslav bank 
in Belgrade. In June 1991, the national debt was estimated as 
$1.5 billion. 
  Even if the governor is not deluding himself into thinking 
that it will be possible to collect all or even part of the 
foreign exchange reserves, he does believe that there will be 
new negotiations on settlement of the debt, and he is also 
counting on significant support from the international 
community. "We were supposed to pay off $250 million annually, 
which we have been unable to do because of the war," he explains. 
  Restoring the banking system also depends on the confidence 
of the populace. That is why the government is preparing a bill 
that would guarantee to depositors the return of deposits 
entrusted to banks before the war over a period of two years 
after the end of the fighting. In the meantime, banks could 
issue letters of credit to depositors, which would be used to 
engage in commercial transactions. 
  For now, all Sarajevo banks except the National Bank of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are closed. Only the employees of that 
institution can be seen at its cash desks, because there are no 
depositors....

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement </F>
for a Democratic Slovakia, by Viera Urbanova; place and date not 
given: "Scandals Surrounding the President Are Deepening the 
Moral Crisis; Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar on the 
Political and Economic Aspects of the Provisional Government's 
Policy Statement"] 
  [Text] On Wednesday [13 April], coalition deputies 
expressed support for their government by approving its policy 
statement, which came about at lightning speed. Although an 
economy cannot be taken over from one day to the next, the 
broad-coalition government has presented its policy statement as 
a way out of a crisis into which society had been led by the 
Meciar government. Former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar 
regards the Moravcik Cabinet's philosophy of economic reform as 
an irreparable historical error. According to the former prime 
minister, Slovakia will not be able to cope with a third change 
in economic reform. He warns against the treacherous form of 
privatization [envisaged by the present government] and voices 
apprehensions about the development of democracy in Slovakia. 
  [Urbanova] How do you evaluate the concept of the 
provisional government's policy statement? 
  [Meciar] The policy statement is full of contradictions. 
Its contents do not express a cohesive philosophy of 
development; it is more or less a descriptive document. Given 
the term of office that the government has ahead of itself, the 
statement should literally have had the form of a schedule. It 
should have been subdivided into days and assignments that need 
to be resolved in every period of time. I assess the concept of 
the policy statement negatively. The building of the state and 
the building of the state administration have come to a halt. 
The policy statement does not address these issues at all. It 
envisages the third change of economic reform in Slovakia. 
Slovakia cannot cope with that. It cannot start anew for the 
third time in 14 months. Our concept of economic development 
and the revenue part of the budget was based on the philosophy 
of recovery. The provisional government's concept is based on 
the philosophy of restrictions. To survive, it will transfer to 
the state budget more than 5 billion korunas' worth of resources 
from the National Property Fund initially designated for 
structural changes in the economy. The crisis in society will 
deepen, but it will not be resolved. 
  A change in the perception of social relations is making 
itself felt. The principle of egalitarianism and down-leveling 
is appearing in many respects, and the development of social 
policy is again acquiring a consumer character, in lieu of a 
balanced and differentiated interest [sentence as published]. 
Those who worked hard in the mines or steel mills for 20 years 
and those who stole and were in prison for 20 years will be 
equally well off in their retirement. The merit principle will 
be erased. 
  [Urbanova] Privatization will represent a key aspect [of the 
new government's policy]. To what extent has the new government 
deflected from the path on which you embarked? 
  [Meciar] The concept of the new government contains a 
treacherously hidden change of the whole process of 
privatization. Outwardly, the concept appears to be very liberal 
because they want to offer up to 50 percent of state-owned 
property to the citizens. In reality, however, the citizens will 
be robbed. A huge capital surplus will be created on the market 
so the value of the property will drop steeply. When this 
happens, the citizens will accept the offer to sell their 
shares, but at considerably lower prices than the value the 
shares would have a few years later. Two effects are being 
pursued in this way. The actual execution of ownership rights 
will be concentrated in the hands of [investment] funds and not 
in the hands of holders of investment coupons. And these shares 
will be quickly bought up, also with respect to the funds' 
holders. Our government's effort to create a strong middle and 
capital-owning class in Slovakia will be slowed down or 
indefinitely postponed. The function of the National Property 
Fund in relation to the budget will change, as well, because 
privatization revenue will no longer represent a supplementary 
source of budget revenue. Essentially, property will be given 
away. Whereas we have been criticized for selling some things 
cheaply (but someone always had to pay for it), now there will 
not be any payment at all. The reasoning behind this is that 
the Christian Democrats have a relatively strong position in 
investment funds, and they therefore suppose that, with their 
help, they will get hold of the economy more quickly. 
  [Urbanova] The policy statement is the product of an 
agreement arrived at by members of a broad coalition. Is this 
an indication that even political entities as diverse as those 
that constitute the government can reach a consensus? 
  [Meciar] The right-left or, if you want, left-right 
coalition has worked out a mechanism of negotiations that does 
not permit any dynamism of development. Everything is being 
halted and indefinitely postponed on which the government 
entities do not have identical programs. It is apparent that 
the importance of the Hungarian political parties, which hold 
the balance of power, is growing. The Moravcik government is 
thus compelled to make concessions to them and is therefore 
afraid of making public all of the agreements it has concluded 
with them. One of the agreements is to recall Ivan Gasparovic, 
chairman of the parliament, in late April and to replace him 
with Peter Weiss. There have already been coalition talks on 
this issue. At every step, democracy is being violated. The 
moral crisis in society is being deepened by efforts to seize 
power without regard for the democratic principles and by the 
growing scandals surrounding the president. Not all of them 
have been made public. 
  [Urbanova] Some of your deputies claim that the provisional 
government's policy statement copies, for the most part, your 
own policy statement.... 
  [Meciar] Rhetorically it does. They quote many parts from 
our own program but, because these parts are isolated, they say 
nothing. The minister of education's rhetoric, for example, is 
not bad, but he has no money to implement it. Even though they 
have adopted elements from our program, these elements are not 
connected by any underlying philosophy and do not represent an 
economically substantiated whole. The entire philosophy of 
economic reform represented by [Deputy Prime Minister] Mrs. 
Schmognerova and others is a historically irreparable error. 
The citizen will have to pay a social and political price for 
it, but entrepreneurs, too, who could have constituted a real 
and competitive social class, will have to bear the consequences. 
  [Urbanova] What is your view of the crusade against 
REPUBLIKA? 
  [Meciar] I protest against the steps being taken against 
REPUBLIKA and TA SR, and against the planned changes in 
television and radio. We never did anything like this. This is 
no longer a question of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
but one of whether we will be a democratic state. If the idea 
of parliamentarianism, the right of citizens to express their 
views in a referendum, and the right to express one's views 
freely are ignored, it is impossible to keep silent.

Kocis, director of the Hungarian Intelligence Service, visited 
Slovakia. He met with leading officials of the Slovak

cooperation in the fight against international crime, illegal 
arms trade and deals in dual-purpose materials, international 
terrorism, and the exchange of information on the situation in 
the so-called risk areas of Europe. The Hungarian guest invited 
SIS Director Dr. Vladimir Mitra and other SIS leading officials

  [Text] Bratislava--The Press and Information Department 
(TIO) of the Slovak Government Office regards the coverage of 
the parliamentary debate on the Slovak Government Policy 
Statement in the first issue of STV's [Slovak Television] 
"Aktuality" program on 12 April as incompatible with the STV's 
legal status as a public corporation. This is stated in a 
statement by the TIO of the Slovak Government Office that was 
made available to TA SR yesterday. The statement draws 
attention to the fact that the TIO of the Slovak Government 
Office considers the failure to make public a single idea from 
Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's speech, while at the same 
time including a statement by Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] Deputy Olga Keltosova, a violation of the objectivity of 
information. The STV is legally obliged to maintain 
objectivity, the statement says.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "There Will Also Be a Parliamentary Press </F>
Club"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--On the basis of ideas raised at the 
working meeting of the Slovak Television Council with the STV 
[Slovak Television] management and representatives of 13 
political parties on 7 April, the Council arrived at the opinion 
that it is necessary to set permanent rules with a view to 
enhancing objectivity and plurality in STV's news and current 
affairs programs. This is stated in a statement that the Slovak 
Television Council made available to the TA SR yesterday. 
  In the spirit of the Law on Slovak Television, the Council 
decided that, after every concluded meeting of the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic, a "parliamentary press club" 
will be broadcast, to be attended by representatives of all 
clubs of deputies. At the same time, the Council asks the STV 
central director to ensure in the program, as of May, 60 to 80 
minutes a month for the views of representatives of those 
extraparliamentary political entities that achieved at least 2 
percent of the electoral vote in the parliamentary elections. 
The Council also approved the principle that the first 
"Aktuality" program [main newscast broadcast at 1930 local time] 
will be exclusively news-oriented (without commentaries), with 
greater emphasis on coverage of developments across Slovakia. 
  The Council asks that the idea be reconsidered of returning 
to the operation of the Television (as well as Radio) Council 
according to the principle of proportional representation of all 
decisive political entities. The statement draws attention to 
the fact that this would once again turn the Slovak Television 
Council into an object of political contest.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 16 April 
on page 12 carries a 200-word TA SR report entitled "CNN 
Protests." The report states that the U.S. Cable News Network 
(CNN) company, which is one of the applicants for a license to 
broadcast on the STV (Slovak Television) 2 channel, which is to 
be partly privatized, "accused Slovak legislators of 
discriminating against foreign companies in the competition for 
a license to broadcast on the second Slovak Television channel." 
Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 18 April on page 1, under the 
headline "Discrimination in the Law on Tenders?," carries a 
200-word TA SR report on Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's 
response to the CNN complaint. 
  According to the Bratislava SMENA report, in a letter 
addressed to the Slovak parliament, the prime minister, and the 
president, CNN said that, "by setting four new conditions for 
license applicants, Slovakia has signaled that it is not 
interested in foreign capital" and charged that "the approach by 
the Slovak Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting 
discourages foreign investors and suggests that they are not 
welcome here." The CNN letter was referring to new 
requirements, under which foreign stake in the license holder's 
company must not exceed 45 percent and under which the license 
holder must reserve 50 percent of broadcasting time for European 
productions. 
  The Bratislava PRAVDA report on Prime Minister Moravcik's 
reaction states that "the Government of the Slovak Republic is 
greatly interested in the observance of general customs, which 
are also laid down in our legal system, concerning competitions 
and public tenders. It is from this point of view that we will 
assess the whole matter surrounding the report on the CNN 
letter." Moravcik announces that the government will "assume an 
official standpoint" after it has familiarized itself with "the 
whole case."

  [Text] The Slovak Government today discussed the statement 
of some heads of district offices and former government 
plenipotentiaries in which they accuse the president of grossly 
offending parliamentary democracy. After thoroughly reassessing 
the overall situation in the state administration, in particular 
in order to ensure the implementation of tasks arising from the 
law on the reorganization of local administration, the 
government decided to recall 26 heads of district offices. 
  In addition, the government recalled Dusan Kleiman from the 
post of director general of the News Agency of the Slovak 
Republic [TA SR] and appointed Ivan Melichercik as the new 
director. At the same time, it agreed with the proposal to 
solve the economic problems of Slovak Radio and approved the 
request for radio broadcasts in line with the law on the state 
budget. The government authorized the Ministry of Culture to 
make this request specific so that the Ministry of Finance may 
provide the financing for this request.

request of the U.N. Protection Force [UNPROFOR] for transit 
through Yugoslav territory for the Ukrainian and Russian 
batallions which are to join UNPROFOR in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
Federal Information Ministry said today in Belgrade. There are 
already 550 Ukrainian troops on the UNPROFOR in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 160 more left Ukraine for that former 
Yugoslav Republic on Monday. The first 100 soldiers of the 
additional Russian UNPROFOR contingent left Russia in late March 
and are already in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most of them have been 
deployed in the area of Sarajevo.

  [Text] Geneva, April 19 (AFP) -- The rump Yugoslavia 
Tuesday [19 April] said UN sanctions against it had caused the 
deaths of 30,000 people, including 15,000 children. Yugoslav 
deputy health minister Svetlana Arsenic told the UN children's 
committee here that despite provisions to allow medical 
equipment into Yugoslavia, the sanctions had denied vital 
medical equipment to thousands of ordinary people. The embargo 
on trade with Serbia and Montenegro was imposed by the United 
Nations in May 1992 to punish Belgrade for supporting Serb 
aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Children have been 
particularly hard hit by the scarcity of medical equipment and 
drugs and 15,000 have died as a result, the Yugoslav minister 
said. 
  If the UN agrees to an exception for medical equipment, 
"even 
the smallest imports" are subject to complicated bureaucratic 
procedures at the UN sanctions committee in New York, Arsenic 
said. "The examination of a large number of requests is 
constantly delayed and put back," she said. 
  Yugoslavia's ambassador to Geneva, Vladimir Pavicevic, said 
that because of the impact of the sanctions, Belgrade can no 
longer apply the UN convention on children's rights. Sanctions 
against Yugoslavia have caused a sharp fall in medical cover 
available with some of the most vulnerable being the 3.2 million 
children in the region, 200,000 of whom are war refugees "of all 
nationalities", Arsenic added. 
  In several areas of Yugoslavia, the death rate has risen 
above the birth rate, she added, suggesting that this 
jeopardised "the very survival of the Yugoslav people."

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 19 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Turkish charge 
d'affaires has been handed a note of sharpest protest by the 
Yugoslav Government over the terrorist attack in Ankara early 
this morning, in which a car of our embassy's first secretary, 
which had been parked in front of his house, was blown up and 
destroyed. The protest note expresses indignation over the 
terrorist act, which threatened the life and property of the 
Yugoslav diplomat and members of his family. It is stressed 
that the Yugoslav Government considers the Turkish authorities 
fully responsible for the terrorist act, because -- despite the 
Yugoslav side's warnings about threats and hostile 
demonstrations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -- 
they have not adopted efficient measures to protect the Yugoslav 
diplomatic and consular missions, their personnel, and members 
of their families. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Monday's attack on 
the Yugoslav cultural centre in Paris is an act of vandalism and 
the continuation of a yearslong anti-Serb and anti-Yugoslav 
campaign in the French media and public, Yugoslav Education and 
Culture Minister Slavko Gordic said on Tuesday [19 April]. We 
were embittered by the reports that a group of French citizens 
yesterday committed an unprecedented vandalistic and 
anti-civilized act, Gordic told TANJUG commenting the raid by 
Moslem extremists and their French friends on the Yugoslav 
cultural centre and their day-long blockade carried out with the 
tacit agreement of the French authorities. 
  `The aggressive and destructive conduct of the participants 
in the attack on the Yugoslav cultural centre was received with 
insufferable tolerance of the French authorities who stood by as 
two of the staff were brutally harrassed and thrown out on the 
street, and watched the hours-long demolishing of the facilities 
and the destruction of the documentation and books,' he said. 
  The minister said that Paris, viewed by the Serb people as 
the capital both of the French and world culture, has now shown 
another side which mars its humanistic tradition. Gordic 
described as specially depressing the fact that the group also 
included French philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy who is well-known 
for his numerous verbal attacks against the Serbs, Serbia and 
Yugoslavia. Henri-Levy has sided with the attackers and thus 
committed an act fundamentally contrary to all humanist 
principles which has revealed all the misery of his unconcealed 
biased political activities, Gordic said. 
  Serbian Information Minister Ratomir Vico also believes that 
the raid on the French cultural centre in Paris, Yugoslavia's 
only such representation in the world, is an act of vandalism, 
unworthy of French democratic traditions and that the reaction 
of the French authorities `has left a sickening impression 
because it was inadequate and too late in coming.' Instead of 
immediately condemning the incident as an act of terrorism, the 
French authorities allowed the Moslem extremists and the French 
advocates of Moslem interests to abuse the centre for anti-Serb 
propoganda, Vico told TANJUG. Vico warned that the benignant 
attitude of the French authorities and public is completely in 
keeping with the anti-Serb public opinion in that country. 
  The French politicians have lost their neutrality regarding 
the civil war in Yugoslavia, and a part of the intellectuals, 
who were virtually unknown to the public prior to the war in the 
Balkans, have now emerged to use their anti-Serb views to blame 
the Serbs for all the tragic events in the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia, Vico said. Vico recalled that the Yugoslav 
cultural centre in Paris used authentic and objective 
information in an attempt to introduce somewhat different views 
to the French public. The centre responded to the demonization 
of the Serbs, provided documented proof of their sufferring and 
invited foreign newsmen to convince themselves on the spot that 
the events in the Balkans are not only one-dimensional. The 
cultural centre did not pay French intellectuals to speak the 
`truth' but it reacted when the French media carried the 
apparent untruths about the developments in the Yugoslav 
territories, Vico said.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Leading parties of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on Tuesday [19 April] said 
that talks are the only way to resolve the conflict in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Democratic Party of Socialists of 
Montenegro, the ruling party in that Yugoslav republic, said 
that the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina had real chances to 
succeed provided the United Nations and NATO abandon the hasty 
and disastrous military operations against Bosnian Serbs and 
that the legitimate interests of all warring sides be equally 
respected in the diplomatic activities. 
  This party, whose delegates are in federal parliament, 
assessed on the basis of a report on Yugoslavia's diplomatic 
activities presented by Republican President Momir Bulatovic, 
that efforts should continue unabated to contribute to the peace 
process and lasting solutions. The lifting of the international 
sanctions against Yugoslavia is an integral and inseparable part 
of a global agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the party said. 
  The opposition Democratic Party, whose delegates are present 
in the federal and Serbian parliaments, is convinced that the 
establishment of peace in the entire territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is mostly in the interest of the Serb side, 
and an immediate ceasefire around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in 
southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, is the first step towards this. 
  In a statement for the public, Democratic Party President 
Zoran Djindjic said it was necessary to respect the agreement on 
an immediate ceasefire in Gorazde, that both sides accept the 
immediate arrival of U.N. observers, that the U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) immediately demilitarize Gorazde as a protected 
area, and that the international community pressure the Moslem 
side to accept the Serb proposal on a truce in the entire 
territory of the republic. The Democratic Party's information 
service said that Djindjic had telephoned Bosnian Serb president 
Radovan Karadzic to consult him and that the statement for the 
public was based on this phone conversation. 
  Serbian Renewal Movement President Vuk Draskovic told a 
press 
conference that the only solution for the Bosnian crisis was an 
end to all military activities and the signing of a peace 
accord. `We are now on a crossroads - peace or escalation of 
war,' Draskovic said, adding that he believed there would be no 
more NATO air strikes. The leader of this opposition party, 
whose delegates are present in Serbian parliament, believes that 
it is necessary to place the heavy weapons of all three sides -- 
Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- simultaneously under U.N. control, 
and later to demilitarize the entire area, and that only then 
should a political solution be sought. Draskovic believes that 
it is in the national and state interest of Serbs to `distance 
themselves from the war-crazed minority, to brand war-mongers 
and war profiteers.'

<F P=106> [Interview with General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the </F>
General Staff of the Yugoslav Army, by Miroslav Lazanski; place 
and date not given: "We Are Ready for Any Surprise"] 
  [Text] [Lazanski] Mr. General, to what extent does the 
shelling of the Serbian territory near Gorazde influence the 
security and defense of the FRY? 
  [Perisic] The shelling of the Serbian territory near Gorazde 
by NATO is certainly complicating the military-political 
situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Besides, such an action 
by the NATO air-force can undoubtedly result in immense 
consequences for peace in the Balkans and in Europe. In the 
case of further air-strikes on Serbian territory, the danger of 
the war escalating to an uncontrollable level will increase. 
Which is to say, this act encourages the supporters of the war 
option, which makes all those who have peace at their heart very 
worried. I want to emphasize particularly that it is an act of 
aggression against the Serbian people, which has a legitimate 
and natural right to self-defense, guaranteed by the UN Charter. 
  The Yugoslav Army is following the development of the 
situation that has come about after the NATO bombardment 
continuously and with the greatest attention. Consequently, we 
are undertaking all necessary measures to protect the 
territorial integrity of our country. In the case of a possible 
major violation of the FRY's air-space, the army will implement 
the course of action anticipated in the case of its combat 
deployment. 
  [Lazanski] What phase of the transformation is the Yugoslav 
Army going through at the moment? 
  [Perisic] The process of the army's transformation is based 
on the transfer of the authority in the matters of defense to 
the state, on a new military doctrine, and changes in the 
normative-legal regulations. The command posts and units have 
been more rationally organized, and many staff changes have been 
made. Effectiveness in command and security in the rear echelons 
have been increased. The army is now in the final phase of the 
process of depolitization and professionalization. In that 
context, the curriculums in the system of education and training 
in the Yugoslav Army have also been changed. Now, the staff is 
employed according to the new formation-organizational patterns. 
The replacement of the old insignia with the new ones is 
underway. All in all, during the past two years, the changes 
starting from the concept of defense to the visual symbols of 
the Yugoslav Army have already been made. 
  In the oncoming period, the units within the corps will be 
reorganized in accordance with the new demands that have been 
imposed on the Yugoslav Army regarding the country's defense. 
Consequently, we shall modernize the command posts and units by 
providing them with new sorts of armament. We believe that the 
transformation of the army, generally seen, is going on in 
compliance with the economic potentials of the FRY and the 
planned spirit. 
  [Lazanski] Are you satisfied with the army budget that was 
adopted recently? 
  [Perisic] The resources apportioned from the federal budget 
for the financing of the Yugoslav Army in 1994 amount to 43 
percent of the estimated GNP. The means that have been 
approved, provided that the Yugoslav Army gets the real value, 
will enable us to meet some 57 percent of the estimated needs in 
1994. While estimating the total of the funds foreseen for the 
federal budget, starting from the adopted economic policy for 
1994, the Program of Reconstruction of the Monetary System, and 
other measures of the recuperation of the country, the Federal 
Government could not provide the proposed level of funds, so it 
had to cut it by half. Regarding the difficult economic 
situation in the country, and the measures that are undertaken 
for its recuperation, we have accepted the aforementioned 
percentage as a necessity in the current circumstances. 
Therefore, we have been forced to make great cuts in the 
development, and to postpone some aspects of the transformation 
program until later. 
  In general, however, we are not satisfied with the inflow of 
resources in the federal budget cash-box. In the first three 
months of this year, the army was allotted 51 percent of the 
planned amount for that period. At the moment, we owe some 50 
million dinars to the army suppliers. Therefore we have great 
problems getting regular food supplies, with the maintenance of 
equipment, and the disbursement of salaries. Many firms, the 
army's traditional partners, have been in an extremely difficult 
financial situation because of our debts. 
  In such difficult circumstances, in the command posts, 
units, and army institutions, certain planned measures have been 
undertaken, aimed at the rationalization of the utilization, and 
the maximal economizing of the material-technical and financial 
means. 
  Compared with other countries in the world, we spend 
considerably less money per soldier. For instance, in other 
countries the costs per soldier in U.S. dollars are as follows: 
Italy -- $47,881; Belgium -- $38,555; Austria -- $31,923; 
Greece -- $27,683; Hungary -- $14,358; Bulgaria -- $11,028, 
Turkey -- $8,923; and the FRY -- $5,500. We are doing 
everything we can to prevent such a difficult economic situation 
from considerably affecting the country's security. 
<H5>  New Concept of Defense </H5>
  [Lazanski] What will be the priorities of such a military 
budget? 
  [Perisic] Differing from earlier years, when the army budget 
was allotted as a single amount, this year, following the 
proposal by the Assembly deputies, the budget for the Yugoslav 
Army in 1994 has been apportioned according to the particular 
purposes, that is, planned commitments. Thereby the priorities 
have already been established. Keeping this in mind, and also 
the fact that the funds are insufficient, I would point out only 
some of the priorities: Covering the expenses that considerably 
influence army readiness, the payment of running expenses for 
food, clothes, energy, and the renewal of material reserves. 
  Despite the existence of objective difficulties in society 
and the lack of necessary financial means, we are endeavoring to 
keep up the necessary technological-technical level of providing 
the army with armament and military equipment. In addition, 
particular attention is paid to the Air Force and Anti-Aircraft 
Defense [RVPVO], and other systems. 
  [Lazanski] What is the doctrinal approach to the defense of 
the country like now? 
  [Perisic] The basic goal of the FRY is to secure the 
existential survival of the Serbian and Montenegrin people, as 
well as of all other citizens, and the entire civilizational 
development of society. From this basic goal all other goals, 
like national, political, economic, defense, and similar goals, 
are derived. The basic political and doctrinal determinations 
are: First, the protection and defense of the sovereignty, 
independence, and territorial integrity of the FRY from all 
forms of outside aggression; Second, the betterment of the 
defense ability of the society, and the protection of peace on 
the state borders; Third, planned and organizational 
preparations aimed at the effective functioning of the defense 
system in all conditions; Fourth, the defense of the country is 
a vital function of the state and society, that is to say, a 
duty and right of all citizens and institutions that are 
organized as a unique and effective system; Fifth, the repulsion 
of any form of armed aggression against the country; Sixth, the 
FRY does not identify any country as its enemy in advance, but 
rather intercedes for the establishment and maintenance of peace 
and security in the neighboring countries, Europe, and world in 
order to make possible equal cooperation among different 
countries; Seventh, in the case of armed aggression against the 
FRY, the Yugoslav Army and society in general would withstand it 
by using any means, until the final defeat of the aggressor is 
accomplished. 
  The new concept is characterized by the nationalization, 
rather than the socialization of the defense system. While 
making a choice between certain forms of military organization, 
we chose a smaller, highly professional, mobile army in 
peacetime that is capable of preventing any kind of surprise, 
and of creating conditions for the development of a mass army 
trained and determined to wage a war in any conditions, until 
the final victory. 
  [Lazanski] In which way does the Yugoslav Army intend to 
school young people now, and thereby to obtain reserve officers? 
  [Perisic] Since September 1991, the schools for the 
education of reserve officers have been closed down. However, 
the role of the reserve army staff is derived from the military 
doctrine and the concept of defense of the FRY, so that we shall 
soon begin with the fulfillment of those demands of defense. 
With the Bill on Military Schools and Army's 
Scientific-Research Institutions, a new system of educating the 
cadre is founded. The future reserve army staff will be 
composed of the people educated in the schools for reserve 
officers, of conscripts that have already served in the army, 
but whose skills are of particular interest to the Yugoslav Army 
-- perhaps some additional schooling or specialization will be 
necessary afterwards -- then also of the people who are employed 
in the army under two-year contracts and who have acquired 
certain skills of particular interest to the Yugoslav Army and 
also of the active army personnel that will be transferred to 
the reserve, regarding their own desires or the army's needs. 
The schools for reserve officers will admit mostly candidates 
who already have a university degree. 
<H5>  Military Alliances </H5>
  [Lazanski] Is the military top brass aware of the military 
alliances that are being formed around our country, and that 
they may be dangerous for the FRY? 
  [Perisic] With respect to the former SFRY [Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia], which was a non-aligned country, the 
military and political position of the FRY has been changed. 
Our incipient stance is that the defense of our country may be 
organized and carried out according to the following 
possibilities: A defense without allies, a defense with 
potential allies, a defense relying upon subsequent allies, and 
a defense with clearly defined allies. In that sense, the choice 
of allies and models of defense is taken by the government. 
  In the circumstances of a blockade, the possibility of 
joining military alliances is excluded. We are not interested 
in entering aggressive military alliances. In peacetime we do 
not consider joining military alliances, because, in our 
opinion, there are no particular reasons for that. The FRY 
would enter a military alliance with those countries that are 
not aggressors, that have been attacked, or whose vital 
interests are endangered. We base any prospects for a military 
alliance on the congruence of strategic and political interests. 
Rather than believing that a military alliance provides a 
greater degree of security, or of defense potential, we feel 
that one's own independence and sovereignty may be endangered 
through such alliances. The Yugoslav Army attentively follows 
the developments in Europe and in the world, and particularly 
those in our direct neighborhood, in order to be able to 
undertake necessary measures in the organization of the defense 
system and the prevention of possible surprises. 
  [Lazanski] To what extent is the Partnership for Peace 
program attractive to the Yugoslav Army, and to what extent is 
it a serious military challenge and threat? 
  [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army must understand, rather than 
form state policy. It is designed by the FRY's leadership. 
Consequently, the answer to this question must be given by the 
state leadership. 
<H5>  Current Military Programs </H5>
  [Lazanski] When does the Yugoslav Army intend to purchase a 
serious amount of the most up-to-date air-force weapons, as well 
as surface-to-surface missile systems? Does that depend 
exclusively on the sanctions and the country's finances? 
  [Perisic] Regardless of a certain technical-technological 
inferiority in relation to the most high-tech armies, the 
Yugoslav Army is even now capable of fighting for, and defending 
the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the 
FRY, which also includes inflicting intolerable losses upon any 
aggressor. The Air-Force and Anti-Aircraft Defense of the 
Yugoslav Army has at its disposal such weapons that make 
possible the elementary protection of the civilians, vital 
buildings, and the territory. In the case of a more serious 
violation of Yugoslav air space, the Air-Force and Anti-Aircraft 
Defense is ready to react in an appropriate way. 
  Because of the war in our neighborhood, and many threats, 
the 
Yugoslav Army is certainly in need of the most modern weapons 
for aviation and of missile systems. However, their purchase is 
limited by the economic circumstances in the country. 
  [Lazanski] By what percentage can the current military 
industry can be correlated with the military industry of the 
former SFRY? 
  [Perisic] The capacities of the military industry that have 
remained in the republics that seceded, and the majority of such 
industrial capacities are located in those republics, are lost 
to the Yugoslav Army. Those are very important capacities, some 
of which, like the overhauling works in Travnik, were among the 
most modern. A part of the military industries that has 
remained in the FRY has been designed and constructed to meet a 
considerably greater demand than there is currently. Those 
capacities will be adjusted to objective production 
possibilities, and will be partly converted into the production 
for civil needs of the society. Only economically acceptable 
programs will be financed. 
  In our institutes we have considerable scientific and 
laboratory capacities for researches and development. We have 
the technical documentation on all the weapons that were 
manufactured in the former SFRY. We have managed to reorganize 
the production quickly, so that today we manufacture all kinds 
of rifles, aircraft and anti-aircraft guns and ammunition, 
anti-aircraft and mortar ammunition, guided and nonguided 
anti-tank rockets, aircraft bombs, the means of personal 
nuclear-chemical-biological protection, light piston aircraft, 
certain electronic signalling devices, reconnaissance radar, 
radar detectors, and so forth. The domestic industrial plants 
also manufacture various ignition devices that are a great 
priority, gunpowder, rocket fuel, some types and calibers of 
artillery ammunition, explosives, mines, and hand grenades. 
There are fields in which we are among the very top 
manufacturers in the world, in view of our achievements and 
quality: For instance, the increase in range of artillery 
shells by some 30 percent (using gunpowder of better quality, 
better subcaliber ammunition and cumulative projectiles), new 
systems of fire regulation installed in anti-tank and 
anti-aircraft guns, the modernized T-55 tank, the production of 
pyro-cartridges [as published] for pilot seats, the modernized 
G-4M plane, the new pilotless plane, and so forth. Besides, the 
overhauling of a considerable part of the machinery and military 
equipment has been carried out. This is to say, thanks to the 
dedicated engagement of scientists and many smaller and larger 
firms, we are managing to eliminate some consequences of the 
existing inferiority in the field of armament and military 
equipment manufacture. 
  [Lazanski] Are the projects of manufacturing the M-84 tank, 
dubbed Vihor, the Vidra fighting infantry vehicle, and the G-4 
plane still of current interest? Is there any clear deadline by 
which those projects may be continued? 
  [Perisic] Those production lines are still of current 
interest. There are expert cadres entrusted with the 
realization of those projects, and also a major part of such 
manufacturing capacities is still functioning. The introduction 
of those projects in the process of realization directly depends 
on the economic situation in society, and on available financial 
means. The dynamics will be continuously harmonized with the 
realistic potential of the Yugoslav Army for the purchase of 
those weapons. When the sanctions are lifted, those projects 
will be orientated toward exports, which will certainly speed up 
the process of their realization. 
<H5>  The State Decides on Priests in the Yugoslav Army </H5>
  [Lazanski] Which of the most sophisticated weapons that are 
not manufactured in Yugoslavia will the Yugoslav Army go for? 
Will they be Western, Russian, or perhaps Chinese weapons? 
  [Perisic] We have gone for the production of arms and 
military equipment in our factories. We shall be purchasing the 
most modern fighting systems abroad, but those will be of 
various origins. In that way we shall avoid dependency on 
particular dealers regarding spare parts, maintenance, training, 
and so forth. 
  In view of the fact that the procurement of arms and 
military 
equipment from abroad has been very difficult for us because of 
the sanctions, for the time being we are not considering that 
possibility very much. When the time comes for us to be able to 
purchase certain fighting systems, contemporary arms, and 
equipment on the world market, we shall endeavor to purchase 
those categories that are compatible with the FRY's defense 
system. In addition, we shall pay particular attention to the 
quality, price, and maintenance conditions of those arms, rather 
than to the countries those arms come from. 
  [Lazanski] How do you, Mr. General, view the war in former 
Yugoslavia, since you took part in the 1991-1992 operations? 
Could the former Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] have settled 
certain things in a more elegant way, or perhaps prevented them? 
  [Perisic] The war in the former SFRY was triggered, in the 
first place, by the secession of the Republic of Slovenia, then 
by the secession of Croatia, and finally, of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
in which the ongoing war has characteristics of an ethnic, 
religious, and civil war. In that context, the former JNA was 
not a key factor in the disintegration of the SFRY. A different 
question is whether the JNA, given a deep economic crisis and 
political instability at the time, could have prevented the 
secession by force. I personally think that it could not, but, 
anyway, the assessment of that question should be given by 
expert institutions, viewing it from a certain distance of time. 
  [Lazanski] Will army service in the Yugoslav Army involve 
also the ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, and the Muslims from 
Sandzak in the future? 
  [Perisic] According to Article 63 of the Constitution, 
Article 279 of the Law on Army, and Article 21 of the Law on 
Defense, army service is stipulated for all the citizens of the 
FRY, regardless of national or religious affiliation. 
Therefore, that also applies to the ethnic Albanians from 
Kosovo and Metohija, as well as to the Muslims from Sandzak. 
  There are certain difficulties regarding the call-up of 
conscripts and the mobilization of reservists for army 
maneuvers, due to the war in our neighborhood, the activities of 
separatist groups, propaganda, various manipulations, and the 
dodging of the fulfillment of duties toward the country. We are 
doing everything to prevent those occurrences from considerably 
diminishing the readiness of command posts and units to carry 
out their tasks. 
  [Lazanski] Are you considering the engagement of army 
priests in the Yugoslav Army? 
  [Perisic] The regulations on the service in the Yugoslav 
Army, in compliance with the Constitution, say that persons 
serving in the Yugoslav Army are allowed to visit religious 
centers, to worship, and wear amulets and relics, as well as to 
use religious books, but the dissemination of religion is 
forbidden. In addition, it has been made possible for believers 
whose faith forbids carrying arms to serve in the army under 
special conditions. Therefore, a particular need for the 
employment of priests in the army does not exist. However, the 
decision on whether the Yugoslav Army should have priests or not 
should be made by the authorized state institutions. 
  [Lazanski] If and when the embassies of the FRY are 
inaugurated in the former Yugoslav republics, will you send 
Yugoslav military attaches there, or will that be carried out 
from Belgrade, because the distances are not so great? 
  [Perisic] The decision on possible military attaches within 
the diplomatic-consular missions of the FRY in the former 
Yugoslav republics should be made by the authorized state 
institutions. When an overall political solution for former 
Yugoslavia is adopted, when the mutual diplomatic relations 
through embassies are established, and the questions of the 
partition balance and boundaries are settled, then the question 
of military attaches will be settled as well.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 18 (TANJUG) -- Two years of economic 
sanctions have made it necessary for Yugoslavia to import food 
articles it used to export to meet the most basic needs of its 
population, experts of Serbia's Ministry of Agriculture set out. 
Despite great potential in food production, Yugoslavia would 
have to import some 100,000 tonnes of sugar, some 400 million 
liters of milk, 50,000 tonnes of potatoes and 20,000 tones of 
beans, said Ivko Djonovic, Serbian agriculture minister in an 
interview to Belgrade's daily BORBA Monday. 
  In this way, Djonovic denied assessments by federal 
government experts that farmers would this year secure enough 
food to satisfy the needs of the Yugoslav population. Yugoslav 
farmers have prior to the introduction of the sanctions exported 
all currently deficient articles. Thus, Yugoslav sugar 
factories earned 300 million dollars annually from sugar 
exports, said Djonovic. 
  Market surpluses, in his view, could be expected in basic 
cultures such as grain and maize. Experts assessed that some 
2.5 million tonnes of grain would this year be reaped in Serbia. 
Yugoslavia's overall needs may be met with 1.5 million tonnes. 
  Apart from its population of 10.4 million, more than 500,000 
officially registered refugees from the former Yugoslav 
republics, were a cause for concern.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Prelude to a Clash With Domestic </F>
Journalists"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- "The statement by Milorad Vucelic, 
prominent socialist and director general of the Serbian Radio 
and Television, to Novi Sad DNEVNIK that the purge of foreign 
journalists is fully justified, sheds considerably more light on 
the real essence of the latest democratic initiative by the 
Serbian authorities." This was stated in a communique issued by 
the UGS [Association of City Trade Unions] "Independence". "We 
thought that this was only interference in the editorial policy 
of other papers, but thanks to the aforementioned statement, it 
is now becoming clear that this move has far reaching 
consequences in the internal political arena. 
  The pogrom of foreign journalists is only warming up, a 
prelude to the final showdown with those who do not share the 
same views at home. By throwing foreigners out, Serbia is only 
making sure that there will be no easing or lifting of the 
sanctions so that, in the total darkness and without witnesses, 
it can finish off the independent media and independent 
journalists devoted to their profession, "Independence" claims.

<F P=106> [Article by "(ajn, ina)": "The New Law Will Allow the </F>
Security and Information Service To Keep Its Location Secret 
From Foreigners Even to the Extent of Using Force"] 
  [Text] Prague--Foreign tourists who loiter in the vicinity 
of civilian intelligence buildings may be exposed to the risk of 
physical attack by intelligence service members. The secret 
service bill anticipates that Security Information Service [BIS] 
members may ask foreigners in the vicinity of BIS buildings to 
show personal documents. If they refuse to do so and refuse to 
wait until the police arrive, intelligence service agents may 
use physical force, such as blows, hits with hands or weapons, 
and kicks. 
  At present, the police can employ these means, including 
tear 
gas, but not BIS. 
  Stanislav Devaty, interim BIS director, has justified this 
bill by saying that foreigners in the vicinity of the building 
where his office is located are intentionally taking photos of 
secret service members or filming them. 
  Jaroslav Basta, the former head of this service, affirms, 
however, that no other similar service in the world has these 
powers. "In every country, the secret service headquarters 
locations are known, just as in the Czech Republic. Most of them 
are publicly accessible, and only buildings in which there are 
operative agents are kept secret," Basta says. According to 
him, it is up to the secret service to keep itself secret. 
There are a number of embassies and foreign embassy residences 
close to the Prague BIS center. The Chinese Embassy is directly 
opposite it.

  [Text] The Czech Republic wants the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] to help, in particular in 
restructuring Czech industry. This was mentioned in today's 
speech delivered by Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik at the 
EBRD conference in St. Petersburg. 
  According to the minister, the Czech Republic has already 
concluded the first stage of the transition to a market economy. 
However, the country's economy is now confronted with great 
posttransformation challenges. The minister also expressed his 
appreciation of the positive changes that have occurred in the 
EBRD since Jacques de Larossiere became its director.

Expanding"] 
  [Text] Jihlava--The RDP Group shareholding company, which 
affiliates the largest special production manufacturers, will 
expand to include at least another four enterprises; 
negotiations are under way on the entry of several more 
enterprises. This was one of the conclusions reached yesterday 
at the company's general assembly. The RDP Group's aim is to 
create a system of mutual cooperation involving the Czech Army, 
the central bodies of state administration, and the arms 
manufacturers and to participate in the modernization of the 
Czech Army. According to officials from the Defense Ministry, 
the suppliers of final equipment for the Czech Army should, on 
principle, be domestic entities. Roughly 30 percent of the 2.5 
percent of the state budget earmarked for the Defense Ministry 
has been set aside for modernizing the Czech Army. The ministry 
is now drawing up the priorities of the program for the Army's 
modernization. The modernized T-72 tank and the Aero L-59 
aircraft, for example, with all probability will be among the 
new military systems.

<F P=106> [Article by Josef Michl: "Czech Civilian Aviation Industry </F>
Is Heading Straight for a Museum"] 
  [Text] The successful bidder for the purchase of Motorlet 
Praha or Let Kunovice will acquire the results of technical 
development in the value of several billion korunas [Kc]. A new 
mid-size L-610 aircraft for 40 passengers has been developed 
since 1983 in these companies, which, according to the aviation 
industry restructuring program, are not expected to remain in 
the Aero holding. The cost of the development to date amounts to 
approximately Kc3-4 billion, and experts estimate that overall 
completion, including U.S. international certification, would 
cost another Kc1.5 billion. In this instance, it would be 
possible to start aircraft deliveries to potential customers in 
1996. At this time, there are two prototypes of the "610" 
tested--the L-610 G, with General Electric CT7 engines in Let 
Kunovice, and the L-610 MX05, with Walter M602 engines from 
Prague Motorlet being tested by the Czech Army. The civilian 
aircraft manufacturer, Kunovice Let Co., cannot afford to 
operate this prototype. If development of the Czech civilian 
aviation continues in the direction taken, both prototypes will 
end up in the same place---the Kbely Aviation Museum. 
  If the military part of the aviation industry (the L-39 and 
L-59 production) is referred to as one with good marketing 
prospects, it is, above all, because of the initiative of Aero 
Vodochody management. If the official material finds that the 
civilian part of the aviation industry has no chance of 
survival, it is because no one has thought of an aggressive 
marketing policy. At the same time, many experts believe that 
the marketing prospects for civilian production are at least as 
good as for the military one, and it is economically more 
effective. 
  According to marketing surveys conducted outside the 
official 
management structures, there are realistic chances for a 
long-term workload of the civilian aviation firms based on the 
sales of large series of L-420 or L-610 aircraft in Latin 
America, Southeast Asia, and on the traditional markets of the 
former Soviet Union. According to the estimates of the firm 
Saab, until the year 2000, the world demand for midsize aircraft 
is approximately 1,300 units. This most likely does not include 
the potential marketing possibilities in the republics of the 
former USSR, where the service lives of approximately 2,000 
Jak-40 and An-24 aircraft are coming to an end, so that the 
overall demand comes to approximately 3,000 machines. There is 
no manufacturer in the world that could independently satisfy 
this demand. Moreover, in the difficult operational conditions 
in these territories, no competition can stand up to the Czech 
aircraft. In addition, thanks to the comparative advantage of 
the Czech economy provided by the cheap labor and the production 
input, in comparison with the world standard, the development 
cost comes to about one-quarter. The preliminary sales price of 
the L-610 comes to approximately $9 million, while the 
comparable Regional Jet costs $14-15 million and the 
Saab-Scania-2000 more than $12 million. (If we add the cost of 
the operation of the aircraft, which includes the price of 
engines--because their lifespan is shorter than that of the 
airframe--the instruments, spare parts, and complete overhauls, 
the total purchase price of the aircraft comes to approximately 
two and a half to three times as much). With annual sales of 30 
L-410 or L-420 aircraft and 12 L-610 M or G Let, Kunovice and 
Motorlet Praha can show profit and begin to pay off their debts. 
  From this vantage point, the debt burden does not appear to 
be so tragic, although it amounts to Kc1.31 billion debt to 
banks and Kc1.85 billion to the Aero holding in the case of Let 
Kunovice, while its equity totals Kc1.07 billion. And, in the 
instance of Motorlet--an equity of Kc1.55 billion--the debt has 
reached Kc0.8 billion to banks and Kc0.1 billion to the holding. 
Even if we also take into account the debt to the state 
treasury and suppliers (they are partially covered by the 
unfinished production), both firms could be paying off their 
debts beginning in 1996. Moreover, it would mean the 
preservation of the production opportunities and, by extension, 
jobs in cooperating enterprises. The views have been voiced in 
expert circles, including managerial ones, that, except for the 
interests of the Investicni a Postovni Banka (IPB), or, as the 
case may be, other creditors of Aero holding from the banking 
sector, who logically are not interested in a business venture 
with aviation production but, rather, in a speedy return of the 
missing hundreds of millions to the bankers' parental care, 
there is no real reason for one of the few areas in which Czech 
industry is absolutely capable of competing in the world markets 
to be sold abroad below value and with uncertain results. 
  Because the aviation industry has been and still is, above 
all, in the hands of the state, there is no need to search 
laboriously for the bearer of specific responsibility for the 
present situation and ignorance of what is coming. The 
government that recommended the implementation of the 
conclusions from the 8 March 1994 meeting of economy ministers 
on restructuring the aviation industry in fact only officially 
endorsed what has been happening for the past nine months on the 
initiative of the IPB, which, although not a shareholder, has a 
majority on the aviation holding board. No other principal 
decision on the part of the major owner has been adopted. The 
situation in the aviation industry after 1990 can be described 
as waiting for privatization, which, in turn, with respect to 
the current knowledge, can be termed jumbled. Under these 
circumstances, the decision to sell certainly is a welcome 
opportunity for the government to rid itself of a hot potato, 
but, except for the so-far-uncertain amount to go to the 
creditors' pockets, it does not solve the problem. Even though 
the decision to capitalize the Aero holding debts may not be 
ideal, it certainly represents a possibility of further 
development for its military part. This chance was denied to 
the civilian sector, although no real argument has been given 
explaining why this sector should not have just as good 
prospects and why the property of the coupon privatization 
investors, who invested in the first wave of privatization in 
aviation as a whole, should not thereby appreciate. While the 
decisionmaking on the future of Czech breweries, the auto 
manufacturing industry, and china production took place or is 
taking place with media--and thereby public--participation, the 
demise of civilian aviation production in the Czech Republic 
should most likely be quiet and without pathos.

<F P=106> [Article by "(fiz)": "The Aviation Industry Manufacturers </F>
Are Establishing an Association"] 
  [Text] Prague--A total of 22 of the most important 
aircraft hardware manufacturers met in Prague yesterday for 
preparatory talks on establishing the Association of Aviation 
Industry Manufacturers. The Association's Preparatory Committee 
was elected within the framework of yesterday's talks. During 
the course of the next two to three weeks, it should draft all 
of the materials for the constituent general assembly. 
  According to Miroslav Petru, the president of the 
Avia-Hamilton Standard Aviation company, who was one of the 
initiators of this event, the association will endeavor to 
improve the economic conditions for our aircraft hardware 
manufacturers. In his opinion, the aircraft industry is the 
leader in industrial production, and the overall expansion of 
industrial output depends on its favorable economic development. 
According to him, the association's establishment could lead to 
an improvement in the position of our aviation industry and thus 
support the development of this branch, which, by its 
state-of-the-art technology, sets the tone for the other 
branches of industrial production. Petru also said that the 
association will lobby for specific government assistance but 
gave no further details on this issue. He merely said that 
specific support for the aviation industry as the flagship of 
the economy is simply a matter of course in such economically 
developed countries as, for example, the United States and Great 
Britain.

<F P=106> [Article by Antonin Jilecek: "The Development of the Czech </F>
Republic's Economy in February 1994"] 
  [Text] At the beginning of 1994, there was a slight 
recovery in construction output and in several industrial 
sectors. The Czech Republic's overall industrial production 
fell by 3 percent in February and 1.6 percent in the 
January/February period, compared with the same periods in 1993. 
Output in small enterprises with up to 24 employees increased 
by 23.7 percent within two months, while in other enterprises it 
declined by 3.9 percent. The output of the paper industry, 
printing, and publishing companies increased by 15.3 percent, in 
coke plants and the refinery industry by 9.6 percent, in the 
chemical and pharmaceutical industry 3.3 percent, and in the 
food and spice industry 3.0 percent. 
  The number of employees declined by 5.5 percent in January 
and February against the same period a year ago. The average 
monthly wage reached 5,899 korunas [Kc], 11.1 percent higher in 
this period. 
  Construction output increased by 3.3 percent in February 
1993 
and by 7.7 percent since the beginning of the year compared with 
the same period last year. The increment in construction output 
this year has been secured by companies with 25 or more 
employees. The number of employees increased by 1.3 percent in 
February compared with the same period last year. Their average 
monthly wage reached Kc6,371, an increase of 11.8 percent. 
  The volume of goods transported by the railroads has 
increased by 14.8 percent since the beginning of the year 
compared with the January-to-February 1993 period. Bus 
transportation increased by 4.5 percent, and river 
transportation by 4.8 percent, but the number of passengers 
continued to decline. 
  Compared with the January-to-February 1993 period, the 
number 
of slaughter poultry declined by 30.7 percent, slaughter cattle 
by 6.3 percent, milk by 7 percent, and eggs by 8 percent. The 
sale of slaughter pigs increased by 3.6 percent. 
  Owing to the increase in prices for animal products, prices 
for agricultural products increased by 1 percent overall in 
February 1993 compared with February 1994. 
  The price increase in February was minimal (0.2 percent 
against January), and food prices fell by 0.2 percent. In the 
service sector, the price of water and sewage disposal increased 
by 0.7 percent. Compared with February 1993, prices were 
generally up 10.3 percent. Prices for services rose 19.5 
percent, nonfood products 11.6 percent, public catering 6 
percent, and food 4.5 percent. 
  According to preliminary results, the overall volume of 
exports (in prices including cost, insurance, and freight to the 
borders of the buyer) rose by Kc51.1 billion, 6.6 percent higher 
than in the same period last year. Exports to Slovakia declined 
by 15.5 percent. Exports to European Free Trade Association 
countries and developing countries, in particular, have 
increased. 
  Imports in the first two months reached Kc50.2 billion and 
were 26.4 percent higher than in the same period last year. 
Imports from Slovakia fell by 3.1 percent. 
  In two months, the trade balance showed a surplus of Kc0.9 
billion, and Kc1.4 billion with Slovakia.

<F P=106> [Czech Statistical Office report: "Consumer Prices and Cost </F>
of Living in March"] 
  [Text] In March, as well as in February, there was a 
slight month-to-month increase in consumer prices. The overall 
level of consumer prices increased 9.3 percent in March compared 
to February. Prices for nonfood products increased 0.5 percent, 
for services 0.3 percent, and for public catering only 0.1 
percent. In food prices, there was a slight decline of 0.1 
percent, mainly due to lower prices for meat and meat products 
by 0.7 percent, and eggs by 10.8 percent. Among the individual 
nonfood products, prices for coffee increased 2.7 percent, 
sweets approximately 2 percent, and vegetable oil 1.1 percent. 
  The development in food prices had an impact on the level of 
prices in public catering. Prices in restaurants rose only 0.1 
percent and those for catering to work places 0.2 percent. 
Nonfood prices increased between 0.2 percent and 0.6 percent, 
according to individual items, with the exception of personal 
hygiene products, medical supplies, drug store products, shoes, 
and leather goods (an increase between 1 and 1.3 percent), and 
prices for fuel, which declined 0.3 percent. 
  In the sphere of services, prices for cinema and theater 
tickets rose 1.4 and 4.4 percent, and prices for certain 
personal services also rose. 
  In the first quarter of this year, consumer prices rose (in 
March against December 1993) by 2.4 percent, in general, while 
the price development was different for the individual products 
within the main groups of goods and services. In consequence of 
the price increases for rent, heat, and hot water in January, 
prices for services increased 8.7 percent, for nonfood services 
1.9 percent, and for public catering 1.2 percent, while food 
prices virtually stagnated (there was a decline of 0.1 percent 
in March against December 1993). 
  The average yearly inflation rate (average over the 12 most 
recent months against 12 months of the previous year) was 17.6 
percent in March. 
  The development of consumer prices, particularly food 
prices, 
had an impact on the low increase in the cost of living (this 
impact was dependent on overall spending on food in individual 
types of households). The cost of living increased in March 
only 0.1 percent in households of pensioners, 0.2 percent in 
households of employees, and 0.3 in households of farmers.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Spurny: "Government Rejected Report on </F>
Security Situation"] 
  [Text] Last week, Klaus's Cabinet rejected a report on 
which three ministries have been working for six months. 
According to Prime Minister Klaus, the report failed to deliver 
solutions for sorting out the problems indicated in the report. 
The government agreed, however, with the main conclusion of the 
report: "There is no threat to the Czech Republic that could 
throw its political stability out of balance or endanger its 
sovereignty in the foreseeable future." 
<H5>  Gangs, Drugs, and Spies </H5>
  Organized crime, "external security risks" (nationalism, 
above all), and illegal migration are the most serious security 
problems today, the report states. Vladimir Suman, chairman of 
the Defense and Security Committee, recently arrived at the same 
conclusion on his own. The 200-page report, however, deals with 
his conclusions on several pages only. 
  Last year, the police department in charge of criminal 
organizations eliminated 15 gangs. Their members committed 
murders, burglaries, and extortion and forged documents. Some 
of the gangs even cooperated with policemen. When apprehending 
mafia members, police found stolen money in the amount of 
$100,000, 250 kilograms of Semtex, 186 kg of perunite [perunit], 
submachine guns, pistols, radio transmitters, over 1,000 
counterfeit passports, and 0.6 kg of radioactive californium. 
  As regards drugs, police arrested over 100 drug traffickers 
and dealers. Heroin, ephedrine, cocaine, and morphine were 
found on them, all in amounts not exceeding 1 kilogram. Police 
discovered 21 money counterfeiters and also a gang that 
attempted to smuggle arms to Iran and Bosnia. 
  According to the Security Information Service (BIS), no case 
of a planned terrorist action has been recorded on Czech 
territory, if we do not count 44 bomb actions without political 
connotations, which are under investigation by the police. BIS 
is convinced that Russian, Ukrainian, and Polish intelligence 
services have become "significantly active" on our territory. 
Reportedly, they are most interested in our arms exports. Arab 
countries, too, are reportedly very active: Iraq, Iran, Libya, 
Syria, and Palestine. Allegedly, they are mostly concerned with 
the "continuity of economic relations." The rest of the BIS 
report describes the work of counterintelligence. It does so 
very vaguely for secrecy reasons. 
  The Military Intelligence Service (VZS) sees the main danger 
in nationalist conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The 
military sees the second-greatest danger in the developments in 
the former German Democratic Republic. "The totalitarian past 
of the eastern laender is a fertile soil for extremist and 
racially intolerant individuals within the German population," 
the VZS analysis says. Third, the military intelligence list 
describes the "belt of crisis situations," which "starts in 
Africa, goes through the Middle East, south Europe, Central Asia 
and India, and ends in East Asia." 
<H5>  From Crime to Conviction: Too Long a Time Span </H5>
  As regards the problems of internal security, all experts 
are 
united over one problem: There is too long a time span between 
when a crime is committed and when the perpetrator is convicted 
and sentenced. Only in simpler cases are perpetrators sentenced 
within one year. However, if a convict has committed several 
crimes or if he has accomplices, the criminal proceedings may 
take two or three years. 
  Several figures are worth mentioning. Violent crimes 
increased by two-thirds in 1993 against the previous year. In 
the Czech Republic, 195 murders and 4,109 muggings were 
committed last year. A total of 20 percent of crimes are 
committed by minors. The highest success rate as regards 
explained crimes is in the district of Rychnov nad Kneznou (68 
percent), and the smallest in Prague (13.5 percent). The higher 
increase in the crime rate was recorded in the Pardubice 
district (40 percent), and the smallest in Most (a 7-percent 
decline). 
  As regards the Czech Republic's security, the report speaks 
about three priorities: 
  An increased interest of migrants in residing in our country 
is being expected, and, therefore, it is important to secure the 
border with Slovakia as soon as possible. 
  Organized crime (drugs, [radioactive] waste material) is 
expected to increase. With respect to this development, a new 
amendment to the criminal code is being drafted.

  [Text] Skopje, April 19 (TANJUG) -- While Skopje is 
awaiting the arrival of a further contingent of 180 U.S. troops 
serving on the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.), the new Macedonian 
Communist movement is collecting signatures for its petition 
demanding that they should leave. 
  All foreign troops serving under the U.N. flag should leave 
the F.Y.R.O.M., as their presence is at odds with some 
provisions of the state's constitution, says the party's 
president Trifun Andreevski. 
  Andreevski quotes Articles 122 and 123 of the constitution 
which state that the sovereignty and independence of Macedonia 
shall be defended by the Macedonian Army. 
  If this demand is not granted, then the party, based in the 
western town of Gostivar, demands that at least the U.S. troops 
be replaced by those from Russia, D.P.R. Korea, China or Japan. 
  The (?incoming) contingent should bring the (?number of) 
U.S. 
troops [words indistinct] up to 500. 
  Nearly 1,000 UNPROFOR troops, mostly from Scandinavian 
countries, have been deployed in the F.Y.R.O.M. since early 1993. 
  A string of ranking U.S. Army and NATO officials have 
recently been visiting the F.Y.R.O.M., among them U.S. Joint 
Chief of Staff General John Shalikashvili in early April.

<F P=106> [J.M. report: "Macedonia Should Remain Independent"] </F>
  [Excerpt] "To have stability in the region, it is best if 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
remains an independent state without joining any federation," 
Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of Macedonia, said 
yesterday to the 15-member group of the New York nongovernmental 
Council for International Relations. President Gligorov 
explained that otherwise a conflict would immediately occur 
because the question would arise of who Macedonia should join 
with, which, as a matter of fact, has been the cause for the 
previous Balkan wars, the First World War also having started 
over the division of Macedonia. He said: "It does not mean 
that we want to remain isolated. Our firm commitment is to join 
the European associations and establish good relations with all 
our neighbors." 
  The U.S. delegation, composed of top journalists engaged in 
international policy, was very interested in the 
Greek-Macedonian dispute and U.S. mediation. President Gligorov 
assessed positively the upcoming meeting of Prime Minister 
Papandreou and U.S. President Clinton, and he pointed out the 
following: "Until now the United States has conducted an 
impartial policy concerning relations between Macedonia and 
Greece, showing an interest in maintaining peace and security in 
the Balkans. I hope that position will also prevail during the 
discussions between Papandreou and Clinton in Washington." 
  Speaking about the U.S. efforts for giving assistance to the 
finding of a just and acceptable solution for both sides, the 
Macedonian president said: "It is important that goodwill and 
desire for discussion win, and let us not use threats and 
embargoes, because reasonable people can always reach a solution 
through discussion." 
  Asked about the part of the [Macedonian] Constitution that 
Greece is calling upon Macedonia to change, Gligorov replied 
that even before the Badinter Commission came out with its 
assessments in favor of the recognition of Macedonia, some of 
the Constitution's regulations had been changed: "We wrote down 
we had no territorial pretensions and that we are not going to 
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. At the 
same time, we proposed an agreement to Greece on the 
inviolability of the present border under the guarantee of the 
United Nations and the European Union." Gligorov pointed out the 
example of Article 108 of the Greek Constitution, where it is 
written that the Greek state will take care of all Greeks, 
whichever part of the world they live in. 
  "The moment the dispute between Macedonia and Greece is 
settled, there will be long-term good relations ahead of us, 
first of all because of the common economic interest and also 
because both peoples are very close, share the same religion and 
have similar customs," Gligorov said 
  Concerning the latest federation between the Muslims and the 
Croats on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Gligorov 
emphasized: "I think it is positive, although the war between 
the Muslims and the Croats was absolutely unnecessary. However, 
there still remains the problem with the Serbs. In my opinion, 
it would be a good thing if Bosnia and Herzegovina could 
reunite, because its division on ethnic principles could have a 
bad effect not only on the Balkans, but also on some other 
Eastern European countries. It violates many international 
regulations and represents a bad precedent for changing the 
borders and for violent ethnic cleansing." 
  This is how President Gligorov responded to the question of 
what would happen if Serbia started ethnic cleansing in Kosovo: 
"That would be tragic; it is necessary to solve the Kosovo 
problem through negotiations between the Serbian authority and 
the legitimate representatives of the Albanians in Kosovo. If 
that does not happen, and if ethnic cleansing takes place in 
Kosovo, there is a danger of a Balkan war with sizable negative 
consequences, in which two NATO members -- Greece and Turkey -- 
would be involved." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Ljupco Georgievski, chairman of the Internal </F>
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for 
Macedonian National Unity, by Mariyana Boyadzhieva; place and 
date not given: "We Must Tear Down the Berlin Walls of the 
Balkans"] 
  [Text] [Boyadzhieva] How realistic is the idea of creating 
a free zone for the movement of people, commodities, and capital 
between Bulgaria and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]? 
  [Georgievski] We all must work for tearing down the Berlin 
Walls of the Balkans -- the cemented borders which have existed 
since the Balkan wars. Our party was the first in the republic 
clearly to declare already three and half years ago that it is 
impossible to open Macedonia only for Greece and Serbia. This 
must apply to all Balkan neighbors, and first of all to 
Bulgaria. We all are familiar with an idea which generates a 
lot of talk recently. This is the project of constructing a 
railroad between Sofia and Skopje, which is supported in our 
country. The project of constructing a railroad between the two 
countries is older than 100 years. It dates from the time of 
the Turkish Empire. After we proposed the idea of connecting 
Macedonia to Bulgaria and Albania, SRPSKA POLITIKA carried a 
half-page article in which the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity 
[VMRO-DPMNE] was accused of wanting to partition Macedonia 
between Bulgaria and Albania. It is a pity our government did 
not initiate this project three years ago, and not now when the 
United Nations imposed an embargo against Serbia and Greece -- a 
total economic blockade against Macedonia. This is done now not 
because the government really wants it, but because of the Greek 
embargo. I am afraid that if the Greek embargo is eliminated 
within one month the project will be put aside. 
  It is abnormal when one has to wait for several hours at the 
border checkpoints in order to enter another state. I think 
that both countries are not doing much to facilitate contacts 
between people. 
  [Boyadzhieva] How does the Greek embargo affect Macedonia? 
  [Georgievski] This is an anti-European act and its spirit is 
anti-Maastricht. The European Community must understand that it 
cannot treat Greece as a small child which has unique interests 
and caprices, and thus destroy the European spirit. 
  [Boyadzhieva] What emerged during your meetings with the 
Bulgarian politicians? 
  [Georgievski] All those whom I met clearly declared that the 
Republic of Bulgaria steadily adheres to the idea of an 
independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia. It is 
especially important that on this issue there is a national 
consensus in Bulgaria's foreign policy. I think that the 
Bulgarian representatives at all levels must continue their 
active policy and defend this position at all forums and 
international meetings. I was told that many Serbian 
politicians in their contacts with various parties support a 
policy of dividing Macedonia. I hear tales about Struma and 
Radonos regions, and a division into Bulgarian, Albanian, and 
Serbian parts. 
  [Boyadzhieva] What is your attitude to the U.S. "blue 
helmets?" How long do you think they should stay in the 
Republic of Macedonia? 
  [Georgievski] We demanded that the "blue helmets" not serve 
under the flag of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], but in 
accordance with an agreement between our government and the U.S. 
Administration. They implemented their mission in Macedonia 
with a great success. The chance of a direct Serbian aggression 
decreased. The government did not have the courage to outline 
the borders, and this was done with barbed wire only after the 
U.S. soldiers arrived. 
  I think that they should remain in the Republic of Macedonia 
as long as a danger of destabilizing the country exists, and as 
long the sole goal of the Serbian-Greek alliance is to eliminate 
our country's independence. I think that our country must do 
everything possible to come closer to NATO's structures and thus 
to guarantee the total security of its borders. 
  It is well-known that the Macedonian Army was not trained 
independently to fight against a foreign aggression. During 
their withdrawal the Yugoslav generals took with them all the 
serious military equipment stationed on the territory of the 
Republic of Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Tomislav Ivanovski: "Athens Sets Fire to the </F>
Balkans"] 
  [Text] After two successive incidents on the 
Albanian-Greek border, there appears to be a fine and precise 
plan for kindling a fire, slowly but surely, under the 
militarily, politically, and economically fragile and insecure 
situation in this part of Europe, which threatens to ignite the 
Balkan barrel of gunpowder. The two incursions by Greek 
commandos into Albanian territory, in which several Albanian 
soldiers were killed or injured, will not change the borders 
between the two states or liberate "Northern Epirus." They 
simply reveal the policy of Athens' socialist government of 
PASOK [Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement] and Papandreou, 
demonstrate the social and political climate in the Greek state, 
and heat up the overall situation in the region, in which a war 
has been waged on the territories of former Yugoslavia for over 
two years. 
  In its recognizably arrogant and cynical style, official 
Athens refused to accept the Albanian reactions, accusing Tirana 
of "creating unnecessary tension in bilateral relations"! The 
Athens Government is blaming a certain "Northern Epirus Front" 
(that is how Athens describes southern Albania) for carrying out 
the entire operation out of revenge for the "bad position" of 
the Greek minority in Albania, and also because that piece of 
the Balkans is in Albania and not Greece! In some Athens 
newspapers this "Front" is still threatening new operations. 
  This should now serve as an alibi for Papandreou's state 
and, 
according to its loudspeakers, the whole affair should stop 
here. For its part, official Tirana has threatened to use its 
right to "employ the same measures," and has asked the Security 
Council to condemn Athens for the incident. No matter how 
understandable the Albanian reaction is, the whole case is also 
a kind of warning to Athens. It has been noted that Albania, 
under the pretext of taking care of "its brothers," is 
interfering in the internal affairs and issues of neighboring 
countries, unreservedly accepting the positions of "its 
brothers," and not those of the authorities of the countries 
where they live as a minority. Tirana's direct interference in 
the affairs of [the Party of Democratic Prosperity] the party of 
the Albanians in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], and particularly its involvement in the 
arms affair in which some of its members were implicated can 
easily produce similar situations and cause bloody incidents 
with even more terrifying consequences. 
  The tragic incident on the Albanian-Greek border, however, 
cannot and must not be put to the sidelines, because it forces 
the question that has been hanging in the air for some time -- 
where will this behavior of Athens politicians lead, and what 
else can be expected? Ultimately, even if we accept Athens' 
claim that the government has nothing to do with the commandos' 
actions, it is still responsible for the creation of a climate 
of nationalism, chauvinism, hatred, and revenge, together with 
the desire to occupy foreign territories. That is the new 
reality that amazes all those who, until just recently, naively 
believed that there is democracy today in the place that gave 
birth to the word democracy. 
  By making dangerous provocations in its surroundings (except 
for the Former Yugoslav Republic [FYR] of Serbia, which will be 
probably left for the final phase), Athens is creating hotbeds 
of crisis by setting the Balkan peninsula on fire, which has 
been made particularly explicit after the old, capricious, and 
extremely vain Papandreou resumed his seat on the prime 
minister's chair. Within a very short time he had succeeded in 
heating up his state with the imposition of the "Macedonian 
question" as promoted by the previous government after the 
proclamation of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia 
and after the report of the Badinter Commission. By deceiving 
the electorate last October by saying that the world would not 
accept the "new state" in the Balkans without the agreement of 
Athens, that he would easily change its name, and that all 
"Greece's friends" were on his side, Papandreou easily won the 
elections. Nevertheless, in the disturbed Greek economy, 
sustained by European Community money, instead of enthusiasm he 
has introduced nationalism and chauvinism, and instead of 
getting his citizens back to work, he sends them to meetings 
where they hysterically threaten to protect their allegedly 
imperiled hellenism even by force. 
  Nonetheless, the world and Europe, which never tried to hide 
its feeling of dissatisfaction after PASOK and Papandreou 
returned to power, have no understanding of Greek nationalism, 
and they have not only recognized, but also started to help the 
Republic of Macedonia. The response of the narcissistic prime 
minister and his family was to introduce the embargo against 
Macedonia and to threaten the Balkans, Europe, and the whole 
world that he would do his best to destroy the state on his 
northern border if it refused to give in to his blackmail. 
According to the plan, Macedonia should be economically 
destroyed, which would cause a range of social disruptions and 
the destabilization of the present authorities. These would then 
be replaced by an extreme nationalist group, which would cause a 
conflict between the Macedonians and the Albanians resulting in 
the destruction of the state and the subsequent division of the 
country between Greece and the Serbia, and later, perhaps, 
between others in the Balkans. The Athens politicians thus want 
to close the Macedonian file forever and bury the Macedonian 
national question once and for all on their territory. 
  Milosevic's state was the first to be caught in this trap, 
because it wished to settle some old accounts, but there are 
also others who, although elevated to pluralists and democrats 
overnight, still cannot stop dreaming of the past and unrealized 
dreams. Sofia, for instance, is constantly being offered a 
return to the good old days of the late 1970's, when Zhivkov and 
Papandreou had monthly meetings, and as compensation it is being 
offered the construction of a road across Pirin Macedonia to the 
FYR Serbia and Romania. On the other hand, Bucharest is being 
offered "support and understanding" for its serious problems 
with the large Hungarian (and Catholic) minority, by promoting a 
new Orthodox brotherhood. At the same time, they are all scared 
of the "Albanian question" and Kosovo, of the Muslim world and 
Turkey, accused of planning to reconstruct the Ottoman Empire, 
although it is Athens that insists that the Aegean is a "Greek 
sea," and that the whole of Cyprus is a part of hellenism! 
  Living constantly in an atmosphere of extreme nationalist 
feelings, it is no wonder that a group of "crazies" has 
appeared, demanding justice and corrections to "historical 
errors" on the territory of a foreign state, and murdering 
foreign citizens. That is why the irresponsible reactions of 
Athens irritate, because it does not even want to dissociate 
itself from the deed, let alone condemn it. What will happen if 
such "crazy" groups enter Macedonia, Bulgaria, or Turkey, and 
what if they respond with the same measures as Tirana is now 
threatening to do? 
  Apparently, Papandreou does not care about that. The main 
thing is that he has finally shown his partners in Europe and 
NATO that he can do whatever he likes, and that they can do 
practically nothing. He is sending the army to the northern 
borders to intimidate Macedonia and make a mockery of Europe. 
He recommends to the Greek lobby in the United States and 
Canada that Greek terrorist actions in Australia, where 
Macedonian houses of culture and churches were torched, may also 
take place in their countries. It seems as though Papandreou 
does not want to change his image as a tough nationalist, and so 
nothing more can be expected of him. The way that he is, and 
the way that he is pushing his state and the Balkans into a 
crisis more dangerous than the one 82 years ago will not change 
even if Macedonia accepts his ultimatums. At a certain moment 
he will probably satisfy his vanity, but the next moment he will 
think of something else to keep his neighborhood in constant 
tension. Unfortunately, that is the essence of his Balkan 
policy.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Albanisation of Tetovo"] </F>
  [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] Radio informs of recently increasing 
practice of Macedonians selling their homes in Tetovo. 
Purchasers are mainly Albanians from outside, offering 
enormously high prices in hard currency. The tax department in 
Tetovo has received 1,700 applications for house, business 
locals and real estates sales, only in the period from last 
January until this month. The sales are especially frequent in 
the city centre. The basic reasons for this is the present 
chaotic and lawless situation, expelling the official Macedonian 
language from use and the uncontrolled processes of Albanisation 
of Tetovo and surrounding villages.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Horvath, cochairman of the Hungarian </F>
Justice and Life Party, and Ferenc Kulin, parliamentary group 
leader and campaign chief of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by 
Janos Bercsi; place and date not given: "According to Kulin, 
the MIEP is After the MDF's Voters -- The MDF Would Not Govern 
Together With Csurka"] 
  [Text] If the largest government party is indeed able to 
break with [former Prime Minister] Jozsef Antall's former 
policies, then we can again talk about a possible coalition 
cooperation, Lajos Horvath says. Serious political forces do 
not enter into coalition agreements with parties that profess 
extremist principles, Ferenc Kulin says on the other hand. 
  Istvan Csurka, co-chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life 
Party [MIEP], said at a recent political rally that, in a given 
situation, he also considers a coalition with the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] possible, provided that the MDF changes 
its political views. However, up to now, MDF Chairman Lajos Fur 
and MDF Managing Chairman Sandor Lezsak have both distanced 
themselves from the MIEP, because of Csurka's outbursts and 
extreme political views. We interviewed Lajos Horvath on the 
MIEP's coalition intentions. 
  [Bercsi] The MIEP has recognized that the MDF-liberal bloc 
that came to power in 1990 is still holding out, but in the 
current situation the MDF is still less of an opponent because 
we have nothing to talk about with the liberals. The core of 
the popular-national tendency that was once grouped around 
Csurka is still present in the MDF. If the largest government 
party is indeed able to break with the former policies of Jozsef 
Antall, then we can again talk about possible coalition 
cooperation. 
  [Bercsi] Lezsak denied that he and Csurka had conducted 
lengthy talks at the apartment of Sandor Csoori [chairman of the 
World Federation of Hungarians] on two occasions in recent weeks. 
  [Horvath] I also asked Csurka and he denied news of these 
meetings. We have not held any kind of coordination talks with 
MDF leaders. 
  [Bercsi] On what conditions would the MIEP be willing to 
work with the MDF? 
  [Horvath] The Ministry of International Economic Relations 
should be turned into some kind of top ministry, which would 
also carry out the work of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The 
MIEP does not agree with [Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky's 
statements or the Hungarian foreign policy represented by him. 
In our view, the foreign minister should take our economic 
interests into consideration in our foreign relations. In 
addition to this, we would give much more freedom to the future 
representatives of Hungarian foreign policy. It is 
indispensable to change privatization fundamentally in Hungary, 
for which Minister Without Portfolio Tamas Szabo is unsuitable. 
We consider it important to change education because the 
awareness of being Hungarian has virtually been erased from the 
country's young people. 
  [Kulin] I can only see Csurka's "offer" as a campaign trick. 
The MIEP has no other possibility to build its party but to win 
as many members from the MDF as it can. This intention has been 
foiled, so Csurka is now forced to try to blur the boundaries 
that he himself set up! It is clear that Csurka is still trying 
to win the less determined MDF sympathizers over, people who are 
not clear about relations between the MDF and the MIEP. These 
people might as well believe, listening to Csurka's statements 
that, if the MDF and the MEIP join in a coalition in the future, 
then why not vote for Csurka? The only unfortunate factor is 
that the votes cast for the MIEP will probably be wasted because 
there seems to be little chance for the MIEP to reach the 5 
percent necessary to get into Parliament. 
  [Bercsi] Would the MDF accept the MIEP's approach if it got 
into Parliament? 
  [Kulin] The foreign policy programs of the leading Hungarian 
political parties -- including, naturally, the MDF -- all intend 
to form optimal relations with the Eastern Central European 
countries and, in addition to this, integration into Western 
Europe is the primary goal. However, the MIEP is a political 
obstacle and a drawback to this, so I believe that truly serious 
political forces will not enter into coalition agreements with 
parties that profess extremist principles. At the same time, 
Csurka is ignoring all written and verbal rules of political 
ethics in all respects: For a whole year, in a most merciless 
fashion, he has been attacking the MDF's foreign and domestic 
policies that had been formed by Antall.

place and date not given: "The Fidesz Would Make a Wage 
Agreement -- According to Urban, Consumption Could Grow From 
1997"] 
  [Text] The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] is 
asking for three years before the improvement of the economic 
situation also becomes apparent for the population after the 
half-turn is made. Laszlo Urban also told our correspondent 
that a general agreement between the employees, employers, and 
the government which, above a 10 percent guaranteed level, would 
link wage increases to improved productivity, would be a key 
element of implementing their program. If it came to 
government, the Fidesz would radically reorganize the economic 
institutions, it would establish an economic top ministry and 
budget ministry, and it would strengthen the economic diplomacy 
activities of the Foreign Ministry. 
  [Ferencz] The Fidesz is the only party that can express its 
economic program in a slogan: half-turn. However, this short 
slogan can be interpreted many ways. What does it actually mean? 
  [Urban] It means a change of priorities in the budget 
policy. Economic growth would be the goal, but this cannot be 
reached through artificially suppressing the interest rates -- 
unsuccessful attempts at this have been made in recent years -- 
or through restriction, namely reducing the expenditure. In our 
view, the budget policy has to be focused on investment 
incentives. The deficit of the current budget cannot grow but, 
when the budget is planned, funds have to be created for tax 
allowances and measures taken to stimulate investments. This is 
a half-turn compared to the current practice, because the 
government's running expenses have increased in past years and, 
due to the increased budget deficit, it is precisely the 
investment expenditures that have been cut back. 
  [Ferencz] However, to make this policy successful, 
insensitivity to social problems has to be accepted! 
  [Urban] No, it does not! Insensitivity to social problems 
would arise if someone wanted to drastically reduce the budget 
expenditure, including welfare spending. However, this is 
suggested by parties other than the Fidesz -- at least, on the 
level of campaign slogans. In our view, society would not 
accept the reduction of welfare expenditure. 
  [Ferencz] On the other hand, the Fidesz's experts talk about 
the need for voluntary wage limitation by the employees as a 
necessary means to curbing inflation. 
  [Urban] The resources for the temporary overspending that is 
to stimulate the investments has to be found in the budget. In 
our view, this can be solved through reducing the interest on 
the already accumulated debts. This is a huge burden because 
interest payments are already now reaching 20 percent of the 
total expenditure and this might increase to 25 percent next 
year. This item can only be reduced if inflation is noticeably 
reduced. A 5-percent reduction of inflation can decrease the 
interest payments by 30 to 40 billion forints. This is more 
than what a committed government, with a strong political 
support -- I do not actually see any chance for this -- could 
save through reducing the budget expenditure. However, to 
reduce inflation, we will need a tripartite agreement (between 
the state, the employees, and the employers) which will cool 
down the inflation expectations. It has to be achieved that 
wage increases should basically be linked to increased 
productivity. 
  [Ferencz] Can this be regulated through a central pact in a 
market economy? 
  [Urban] A central pact can provide a positive background for 
the bargaining at company level although, naturally, cannot 
replace it. As early as the end of 1993, some of the employers 
attempted to set the automatic wage increases at the lowest 
possible level, and to establish a connection between wage 
increases and the increase of productivity. However, on a 
national level, it was precisely the government's representative 
who first called this untenable. A central agreement can force 
the representatives of employers and employees at every company 
to face the question: Do they consider it more important to 
preserve the workplaces even at the cost of lower wages or will 
they accept the dismissals and fight for a higher wage for the 
people who stay? The government cannot decide this but it can 
establish favorable conditions for the bargaining. The view of 
the trade unions obviously is that more burdens cannot be placed 
on the employees, therefore, wage increases at least have to 
counterbalance inflation. However, in a stagnating economy, 
this would actually contribute to maintaining inflation. 
  [Ferencz] Therefore, the Fidesz's experts attribute a 
decisive importance to inflation expectations in the actual 
increase of prices. However, the experience of the past few 
years seems to contradict this: Between 1990 and 1993, the 
inflation expectations -- and even the inflation forecasts -- at 
the beginning of the year always exceeded the level measured at 
the end of the year. 
  [Urban] The analyses prove that at least half of the 
inflation is wage inflation. The speed of price increases 
stopped receding in the past year, and I attribute the reduction 
in the former years to the dampening effect of the recession and 
to a consequence of the exchange policy that was revaluing in 
real terms. However, the latter was double-edged because it 
placed the costs of curbing inflation on the exporting companies 
and this backfired in 1993. If we want to face the fact that 
there is an over-distribution in the Hungarian economy compared 
to the level that would be supported by our productivity then we 
either cut the budget expenditure drastically -- but this does 
not have the necessary political support -- or we have to make 
self-restricting wage agreements. Private companies are inclined 
to do this anyway, and the managers of state-owned enterprises 
could be encouraged in contracts made with them to implement 
this central agreement. 
  [Ferencz] How well developed is the Fidesz's program on 
changing the economic policy institutional system? 
  [Urban] The economic policy mistakes of the past four years 
can largely be attributed to the lack of a chief economic 
strategist in the government, and the rivalries between the 
various economic-type ministries. It is completely ridiculous 
for a minister who is responsible for the economy to have the 
same number of votes on economic policy issues in the government 
as ministers who have nothing to do with the economy: This 
makes it impossible to make strategic decisions. According to 
our concept, an economic top ministry should be set up based on 
the economic policy experts from the Finance Ministry, the 
Industry and Trade Ministry, the Ministry of International 
Economic Relations, and other ministries, while the economic 
diplomacy activities of the Foreign Ministry should be 
strengthened. At the same time, based on the Finance Ministry's 
staff, a ministry dealing with budget issues could be 
established, thus ending the situation where strategic decisions 
are also determined by daily fiscal considerations. 
  [Ferencz] How long would it take for the results of the 
Fidesz's economic policy to manifest themselves? 
  [Urban] The already mentioned tripartite agreement would 
establish the opportunity for a breakthrough. If we managed to 
complete this by the autumn of 1994, it would be possible to 
anticipate lower inflation and increasing investment activity 
when planning the 1995 budget. Economic growth could begin, 
however, based on this, the reform of state administration would 
first have to be implemented in 1996, it could be decided what 
kind of expenditure can be removed from the state treasury. In 
the following year, in 1997, the expansion of consumption would 
also be noticeable to the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of </F>
the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Zoltan Fekete; place and date 
not given: "The SZDSZ Is Not Planning a Political Cleanup"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fekete] When you were 
elected list leader, that is, prime ministerial candidate, by 
your party, many people thought that history was repeating 
itself in the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. This means 
that, after the so-called inner city "hard core" had placed 
[former Chairman] Peter Tolgyessy in the center, it again wants 
to put a presentable, and even likable, person in the center who 
can be accepted by the country's public. Are you not afraid 
that you will also be pushed in the background like your party 
chairman predecessor was if you do not obey the "hard core"? 
  [Kuncze] On the one hand, I do not believe in the existence 
of anything like an inner-city "hard core" and, on the other 
hand, if Tolgyessy was here, he would probably object strongly 
to having been placed into his position by a non-existent "hard 
core." Tolgyessy was elected party chairman by a large majority 
of the national meeting of delegates, while I was elected list 
leader and prime ministerial candidate on the basis of the 
recommendation of the executive body of the SZDSZ's National 
Council. I believe that my candidacy has the support of the 
whole SZDSZ membership. 
  [Fekete] By rejecting the existence of the "hard core," you 
obviously do not wish to deny the existence of a sharp contrast 
between the line represented by [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto, 
Miklos Haraszti, and Balint Magyar, and the Tolgyessy wing? 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ does have various trends and platforms 
but, to the best of my knowledge, Tolgyessy has not joined any 
of these. However, these platforms and views are not determined 
according to the dwelling places of the members, and the 
contrast between them is not as sharp as you suggest. The 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is not divided according to 
where its members live, either.... [passage omitted] 
  [Fekete] How can you now describe cooperation between the 
parties of the Liberal Bloc? I mainly ask this because a 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] deputy recently said that 
overtaking the SZDSZ, and to come out of the election campaign 
as the biggest Hungarian liberal party are the most important 
goals for the Fidesz. 
  [Kuncze] I can confidently say that cooperation between the 
liberal parties is running smoothly, we have completed the 
coordination of our election programs and, although we have 
differences, these are not unbridgeable. As for the statements 
of the Fidesz politician, I certainly agree with him because we 
are running in the elections separately and we are rivals as 
well as allies. This is perfectly natural, just as the fact 
that differences exist between the two parties. I trust that 
liberals will be governing in Hungary after the 1994 elections. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Fekete] [passage omitted] The SZDSZ has an advertisement 
that states that you would reduce government expenditure after 
you come to power. It is very attractive that you take the 
money out of your pocket in advance. What will happen to the 
tax burden of the citizens? 
  [Kuncze] We are serious about our intention to reduce the 
government's expenditure because otherwise it is impossible to 
convince the citizens that the government is handling their tax 
forints responsibly, that it does not spend the money lightly 
while it is earned by the taxpayers with hard work. On the 
other hand, the SZDSZ's economic experts believe that a 
significant reduction of expenditure is indeed necessary to end 
the current terrible state of the economy. The SZDSZ's plans 
include tax reductions both in the economic organizations and 
the private sphere. [passage omitted] 
  [Fekete] In your view, will we need a government of experts? 
  [Kuncze] The next government will also be formed by 
politicians and the political positions will be occupied by 
politicians. At the same time, we need politicians who are 
familiar with the area they are to manage and control. In this 
sense, we need experts, but I emphasize that this does not mean 
that the ministerial positions will be occupied by experts who 
are independent of parties. 
  [Fekete] [Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman] Gyula Horn 
recently promised that some dismissed radio workers will be 
placed back into their positions, although he did not actually 
promise a clean-up. Is it possible that the SZDSZ will also 
launch these kinds of measures, or are you more in favor of 
legal solutions? 
  [Kuncze] I would like to see an end to fear in this country 
once and for all, and for this very reason I am not going to 
react to any threats, and I do not even like to listen to them. 
Under an SZDSZ government, no one needs to be afraid of any 
kind of political clean-up. It is a different matter that we 
need good professionals in the various positions of state 
administration; if someone is well-prepared and suitable for his 
job then we will not look at his party affiliation or who placed 
him into his job. However, if the person is unsuitable for his 
tasks then he must go, again, regardless of his party 
affiliation. Therefore, people who are good at what they are 
doing have nothing to be afraid of. 
  [Fekete] Three weeks before the elections, how many parties 
have a chance to get into Parliament? 
  [Kuncze] As far as I can judge, the same six parliamentary 
parties that the electors gave legislative tasks in 1990 have a 
chance to get into Parliament. I am now talking about reaching 
the 5-percent limit; it is quite possible that some 
representatives of other parties will also be elected to 
Parliament. [passage omitted] 
  [Fekete] How many parliamentary mandates do you think the 
SZDSZ will get in May? 
  [Kuncze] We have the chance to repeat our 1990 performance 
and gain 90 to 100 parliamentary seats. If we succeed in this 
then it will be certain that the liberal parties together will 
be unavoidable factors in the next governmental cycle.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Imre Konya by Petan in </F>
Pilisvorosvar on 17 April: "A Decision Must Be Made"] 
  [Text] Interior Minister Imre Konya visited the 
Pilis-basin on 17 April, and then participated in a rally 
organized by the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the 
National Federation of Political Prisoners [POFOSZ] in 
Pilisvorosvar. After his program, Imre Konya gave an interview 
to UJ MAGYARORSZAG. 
  [Petan] Mr. Konya! In view of the presentation of 
candidates, in your opinion, to what extent will the national 
forces scatter? 
  [Konya] No doubt, it is dangerous that there are parties, 
like Jozsef Torgyan and Istvan Csurka's parties, that can take 
votes away from the MDF with their radical formulations against 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. Because they will hardly 
be able to exceed the 5 percent threshold, they will actually 
give their votes to those against whom they are taking a stand. 
After the presentation of candidates, one can conclude that 
there is less danger in connection with the Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party [MIEP], because they failed to present candidates 
in many counties, and this means that they will definitely 
remain under the 5 percent threshold. Therefore, whoever votes 
for them will actually support the other side. 
  [Petan] The prime minister has repeatedly stressed recently 
that it is impossible to envisage any talks with the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] as long as a tough core leads this party. 
What if the hard core is forced out of the leadership? 
  [Konya] I do not think it is tactful to engage in 
speculations regarding the internal affairs of another party. 
It is a fact that there is a border line, because the SZDSZ 
made it clear that they do not regard a coalition with the MSZP 
as impossible. For us, however, it is clear that we will not 
form a coalition with the MSZP under any circumstances. At the 
same time, I would also like to say that, among the current 
SZDSZ deputies, there are people who cannot envisage a coalition 
government with the MSZP, and I know these people. Let me also 
say that, in the course of the elections, the voters should not 
rely on their emotions. A decision must be made. The coming 
years will tell whether we can realize our opportunities and 
catch up with the West. There is no time for jumping back and 
forth, and there is no time for changing governments around. 
Therefore, what is at stake in these elections is whether we can 
continue on the road we have started or whether we turn back. 
MDF or MSZP? Those who are afraid should be told that everyone 
goes into the voting booth alone and the elections are secret. 
I hope that the healthy instinct of the nation will prevail if 
everyone goes to vote. One cannot imagine that people would 
vote against their own interests. 
  [Petan] What is your opinion about the order of the Finance 
Ministry according to which, beginning with 1 May, everyone who 
enters Hungary must show that he possesses 5,000 forints or an 
equivalent sum in hard currency? This regulation affects many 
poor Transylvanians and ethnic Hungarians living beyond our 
borders who do not come here to trade goods or do any 
business.... 
  [Konya] It is difficult to find a balance between the 
interests of the public security of the country and the border 
areas and keeping contact with these people. Obviously, we will 
not introduce a visa requirement for public security reasons, 
but the situation requires certain measures. It is unfortunate 
that contacts between people become more difficult as a result; 
therefore, we are constantly following the developments and we 
will stop this new requirement as soon as the situation makes 
this possible.

<F P=106> ["CS.I."-signed interview with Agricultural Minister Janos </F>
Szabo, chairman of the United Smallholders Party; place and date 
not given: "Our Program Is Based on Four Years of Achievements"] 
  [Text] In our series, we publish interviews with heads of 
parties who presented national lists. It is clearly an 
electoral advantage that the United Smallholders' Party [EKGP] 
accepted a coalition role in the past four years -- as pointed 
out by Janos Szabo, agricultural minister and EKGP chairman. We 
asked Janos Szabo about coalition desires, the split among the 
smallholders, and agricultural matters. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As a village party, what does the EKGP 
suggest to solve the current crisis in the agricultural sector? 
  [Szabo] Everyone is trying to effect a brainwash! If the 
crisis is a radical and revolutionary change, then this is what 
is really taking place: the biggest transition in land ownership 
in our 1,100 year history! Despite all our problems and the 
international recession, a decreasing domestic market, the loss 
of our eastern markets, drought, and a chronic shortage of 
capital, 1994 will be the year of growth in agricultural 
reserves. The economy has priority in the EKGP program. This 
program is based on four years of hard work and outstanding 
achievements. The Group of 36 in the parliament played a major 
role in all this, because this faction fulfilled the majority of 
the party's program. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If you were to become part of the new 
government, what would be your first measure to benefit 
villagers? 
  [Szabo] We would guarantee greater state support for the 
agricultural sector; we would export quality products to the 
West; we would urge a reasonable tax reduction; and we would let 
the owners get a bit richer. It is an open wound in the 
agricultural sector that, of 1.1 million part-owners of 
business, only 300 are completely involved in the business; this 
situation requires an urgent solution. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does the fact that the Group of 36 and later 
the EKGP participated in the coalition represent an advantage or 
a disadvantage? 
  [Szabo] During transitional periods, the time required for 
the maturation of a politician is rather short. But one wears 
out quickly, both morally and politically, and the coalition 
wears out quickly also. The change involves traumatic elements. 
It is possible that, according to some voters, playing a role 
in the coalition represents a disadvantage.... But one should 
not be shortsighted! In spite of all the transitional 
difficulties, the last four years have made real history! We 
instituted private property and the framework of a 
constitutional state; despite all the difficulties, there is 
stability in Hungary and, therefore, it makes no difference what 
the professional pessimists say. Those who are affected by 
compensation, land ownership, and the assignment of lands -- 
some 4-5 million voters -- should realize that the government 
has compensated them. We started six months ago, and we 
succeeded in presenting 14 territorial lists and 56 candidates. 
It is clearly an advantage for the Group of 36 and the EKGP to 
be part of the coalition. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] With which parties would you happily form a 
coalition and under what conditions? Would you demand a certain 
ministry? 
  [Szabo] We would gladly form a coalition with the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP] if we make it into the parliament, but we do not 
exclude any other party, with the exception of the Workers Party 
and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. A good agreement is 
the basis of correct coalition relations contacts! This 
agreement should include proportional party decisionmaking in 
accordance with said party's power as represented in parliament. 
Larger parties should not have greater decisionmaking rights in 
the parliament; smaller parties should not have smaller rights. 
We do not have a list of ministerial demands, but our party 
clearly prefers the Agricultural Ministry. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The smallholders are divided: there are 
four parties on the political palette. You repeatedly declared 
that Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders' 
Party [FKGP], is the obstacle hindering union. 
  [Szabo] The only difference between the programs of the 
various smallholders parties -- the FKGP, the Historical 
Smallholders' Party, the Compromise Smallholders' Party, and the 
EKGP -- is the way they go about doing things, but there is no 
difference regarding the essence of their programs. In the 
villages, simple people and smallholders-oriented voters are not 
divided, and there is a basic demand for a single large party to 
represent the small landowners in politics. Nor is there any 
particular importance attached to which party was in the 
coalition and which party was not. We should be united, and the 
EKGP is doing everything in its power to achieve this unity. 
Jozsef Torgyan is an obstacle! He should step aside and leave 
the road, so that unity can emerge.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>
  [Text] New York, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Only a few hours 
after Bosnian Moslem presidency President Ejup Ganic, to his own 
admittance, "implored and begged" the U.N. secretary-general to 
do something about Gorazde, Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO 
Secretary- General Manfred Woerner to mount air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions. 
  The Russians were again not consulted and this caused a very 
angry reaction of Russian U.N. Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsev. 
  Following Butrus-Ghali's announcement, Vorontsev stormed out 
of the Security Council session saying that air strikes could 
not be launched without approval of the Security Council and 
that otherwise the U.N. would be directly involved in the 
Bosnian war on the Moslem side. 
  Senior reporters at U.N. headquarters say they have not seen 
such reaction from Russia since the time of the Cold War. 
  Vorontsev argued that although air support to U.N. troops on 
the ground was "the sacred duty" of the world organization, air 
strikes were something completely different because they would 
automatically draw the U.N. in war operations, not only in the 
air, but on the ground too. 
  The United Nations should decide whether it wants war or 
mediation and the Security Council should rule on this matter, 
said Vorontsev. 
  Those who support air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions 
maintain that the U.N. does not need special authorization of 
the Security Council to launch the strikes and invoke Resolution 
836 of June 8, 1993 to support their position. 
  Para 10 of Resolution 836 says that U.N. member-nations, 
individually or through regional organizations and arrangements, 
can undertake, under the authority of the Security Council and 
in close cooperation with the secretary-general and the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR), all the necessary measures, 
including the use of air power in and around the U.N.-designated 
"safe areas" in Bosnia- Herzegovina, to support UNPROFOR in 
carrying out its mandate. 
  A heated debate will probably ensue in the Security Council 
about the interpretation of this provision. 
  Butrus-Ghali and the majority of the council members believe 
that the provision gives them a free hand. The Russians, for 
their part, could come out with a counterargument that the word 
"authority" in the text stands for special approval of the 
Security Council, which could create an impasse. 
  Vorontsev's argument that it is completely wrong for the 
United Nations to become involved in the Bosnian war on the side 
of only one of the belligerents may finally prevail. "This is 
our position and we will strongly defend it," Vorontsev was 
categorical.

  [Text] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, had a phone conversation with 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic today. 
  Granic and Silajdzic discussed the situation in Gorazde and 
the coordination of the activities of the two states in the 
international arena -- particularly in the United Nations and 
the EU -- and in political and humanitarian fields. They 
expressed pleasure with the results achieved so far in the 
implementation of the Washington agreement and agreed that both 
sides should persist with it so that the international community 
might halt the Serb aggression against Gorazde and so that 
conditions be created for the continuation of the initiated 
peace process. 
  Minister Granic informed Prime Minister Silajdzic that 
Slobodan Lang, Croatian ambassador at the Croatian Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in charge of humanitarian affairs, is in 
Sarajevo to coordinate humanitarian activities. They also 
discussed preparations for the announced visit by Croatian 
President Franjo Tudjman to Sarajevo and agreed that the visit 
should go ahead as soon as security conditions allow.

  [Text] Mario Nobilo, Croatian ambassador to the United 
Nations, has sent a letter on the latest developments in Gorazde 
to the Security Council chairman, New Zealand Ambassador Colin 
Keating. 
  The Republic of Croatia is seriously concerned over the 
situation in Gorazde, where nobody is trying to prevent yet 
another slaughter by the Serbs, Nobilo says. He warns that 
direct violation of the UN resolution on safe zones is a 
dangerous precedent, which could affect the peace process not 
only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in Croatia. 
  The situation in Gorazde is already having a negative effect 
on the negotiations between the Croatian side and the Serb 
rebels. The rebel Serb authorities have refused to take part in 
the second round of talks, scheduled for last week. There is an 
increasing number of reports on provocations by Serb 
paramilitary formations, particularly in sectors west and south. 
The Serb rebels in Baranja have again taken up arms, thus 
violating the cease-fire agreement of 29 March, Nobilo says. 
  The Croatian ambassador also warns that, due to the 
situation 
in Gorazde, another wave of refugees could arrive in central 
Bosnia, which could damage the prospects for gradual 
implementation of the agreement on the Croat-Bosniak federation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, signed in Washington. 
  Nobilo notes that a refugee wave could spread into the 
Republic of Croatia, which is already providing accommodation 
for 280,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The situation in Gorazde is a repetition of the tragedy of 
Vukovar, where the world merely watched as innocent people were 
victimized by a regime held in contempt. 
  The Serb aggression must finally be halted, Nobilo's letter 
says. The UN Security Council must be ready to impose peace. 
Lack of decisive action within the possibilities open to the 
Security Council would at the moment threaten not only the 
prospects for peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also the 
territorial integrity and safety of the Republic of Croatia. My 
government, while continuing to support the peace process, 
retains the right to re-examine its position regarding the 
situation in the occupied territories in these dangerous, 
deteriorating circumstances, in accordance with Article 51 of 
the UN Charter, the letter says in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Report by S.P. Stazic on a news conference by Milan Djukic, </F>
president of the Serb National Party, in Zagreb on 13 April: 
"The NATO Attack Injured the Dignity of the Serbs!"] 
  [Text] Commenting on the air strikes against the Serb 
positions around Gorazde, Milan Djukic, president of the Serb 
National Party [SNS], stated on Wednesday at his party's news 
conference that "the Serb people, as any other people, have 
dignity, and there is a limit to how much injury to this dignity 
can be tolerated." 
  According to Djukic, "with the one-sided air strikes, 
without 
any warning," the NATO forces and the United Nations have 
"injured the dignity of the Serb people." Djukic believes that 
NATO should have bombed the Muslims too, for the sake of peace 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Djukic thinks that, because of this 
action carried out by international mediators in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war, the peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
has become more distant, and that a new war is emerging. Djukic 
claims that the NATO action at Gorazde will make the peace 
process more difficult and put a strain on the relations of the 
conflicting sides in the negotiation process. Djukic explained 
that the international mediators cannot ask the Serbs to join 
the peace process while bombing them at the same time. By not 
approving of the air strikes against the Serb positions near 
Gorazde, and condemning NATO for not having attacked the Muslims 
too, Djukic threw the ball into the neutral court and added that 
"the United Nations and NATO are the most responsible for the 
situation in Gorazde, as they did nothing to really protect the 
area except declare it a protected area." 
  The SNS officials also discussed the possible continuation, 
that is, the postponement of the Zagreb negotiations between the 
local Serbs from the UNPA's [United Nations Protecred Areas] and 
representatives of the Croatian Government. Namely, they 
believe that the second stage of negotiations, which has the 
establishment of economic ties on the agenda, will be much more 
difficult than the first, as the negotiators will have to tackle 
political issues, that is, sovereignty. They believe that the 
negotiations that were supposed to have been held on Tuesday in 
Zagreb have been postponed because the so-called Krajina is 
undergoing the process of establishing their government. They 
also believe that miracles should not be expected in the second 
stage of negotiations, even supposing it ends successfully, as 
the critical point will be reached in the third stage, when the 
subject of negotiations will be the status of the Serbs and the 
so-called Krajina. According to their estimates, the second 
stage of negotiations will only be finished in eight months, and 
they are thus critical of the Croatian politicians who have been 
promising fast reintegration. The SNS officials repeated their 
request that representatives of the Serbs from the free 
territories of the Republic of Croatia also participate at the 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jure Radic, head of the President's </F>
Office, by Hloverka Novak-Srzic; place and date not given: 
"Manolic Cannot Harm Us"] 
  [Text] Dr. Jure Radic talks about the intraparty conflicts 
provoked by the "Manolic case" in a calm and relaxed way, so 
different from the impression one gets from the media, which 
have recently been following almost every HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] member in an attempt to learn more than 
the short announcements arriving from the closed party sessions 
contain. Asked what is happening in the HDZ, Dr. Radic answered 
in a nonchalant way, not letting himself be provoked: 
  [Radic] Nothing special; we are becoming stronger. The HDZ 
is undergoing the process of growing from a movement into a 
party, which is in accordance with the decision of the Second 
General Congress, and this is the time in which it will be 
undergoing minor turmoils; not in a destructive sense, but 
rather in the way that will result in the HDZ emerging as a real 
party; firm, well- connected, a party that is necessary to 
Croatia and the Croatian people. 
  [Novak-Srzic] However, you cannot claim that it is only an 
intraparty conflict. Since the issue is the party in power, the 
conflicts in it reflect on the overall political life of 
Croatia. How come Mesic has remained president of the Chamber of 
Representatives and member of the party Presidency despite the 
fact that some of his criticism was harsher than that of Manolic 
[president of the Chamber of Counties]? 
  [Radic] It is normal that all the events in the HDZ reflect 
on the events in the overall political life of Croatia, as 
Croatian politics are actually the HDZ politics. However, we in 
the party view the Manolic problem and the Mesic problem 
separately. The Manolic problem was on the agenda, certain 
decisions were made -- primarily the decision of the party 
president through which Manolic was relieved of his party 
duties. On the other hand, after a talk with the President 
Mesic agreed to observe the party rules. At a certain point he 
reacted in the heat of the moment, perhaps unpleasantly provoked 
by certain party members, which is normal, human. I firmly 
believe that Mesic will observe the party rules. Moreover, he 
has promised the president that he would become an active HDZ 
member. It is important to point out that Manolic was offered 
the same, on several occasions, including one at the Club of 
Representatives, but he refused. 
  [Novak-Srzic] Do you think Manolic can harm the HDZ? 
  [Radic] He certainly cannot harm the HDZ as a force, as a 
party. 
  [Novak-Srzic] Many say that when Manolic was being relieved 
of his high party duties the party went by the rules of the 
procedure, but insisted on the urgency of the process when he 
was being relieved of his state functions. Some have called it 
a Stalinist method, and they believe that the HDZ members in the 
Chamber of Counties have done it in a clumsy, even arrogant way. 
  [Radic] Those who have attempted to portray Manolic's 
replacement that way wished it that way, but that is not how it 
happened. 
  [Novak-Srzic] We watched it on TV. 
  [Radic] Very few people remarked on that program; the 
committee has also shown that Mr. Manolic was not right. The 
remarks relate to some collection of signatures before the 
session.... 
  [Novak-Srzic] There is talk that after the HDZ Presidency 
session, during lunch at the president's, someone started the 
action of collecting signatures of those in favor of Manolic's 
replacement. 
  [Radic] That is simply not true. After the Presidency 
session, a session of the Club of Representatives of the Chamber 
of Counties was held, which I attended, and so did Mr. Manolic. 
There was a vote on whether he should be relieved of the 
position of president of the Chamber of Counties, as he had 
already been under party suspension at that time. It was at 
that Club session that the decision was made that Mr. Manolic be 
relieved of his post, with three votes against. It was at that 
meeting, and not before or after lunch, as some have stated for 
the papers. Since 36 representatives voted in favor of Manolic 
being relieved, the president of the Club of Representatives 
said: "All right, now we have to formalize the decision, 
collect the signatures." Namely, the request for his 
replacement had to be conducted in compliance with the rules of 
procedure. It would be biased to say that signatures were being 
collected with some other motives. 
  [Novak-Srzic] Mr. Manolic has announced the founding of a 
new party, and said that a great number of HDZ representatives 
would go over to his party. Could the HDZ lose the majority in 
the parliament, and could there be a parliamentary crisis -- 
there has even been mention of early elections? 
  [Radic] It is human to hope. It would be crazy if someone 
were to undertake an action believing it would fail. By the 
same token, it is allowed that others also make judgments and 
present their positions. My personal judgment is that it would 
be unrealistic to expect that Mr. Manolic will attract a great 
number of HDZ members and question our majority in both 
Chambers. There is no danger of a parliamentary crisis, and 
thus no reason for early elections. There is a danger of 
violent methods being used, which is when you want to be 
something by all means, although the majority are against it. 
That is violence. Democracy is the rule of the majority. The 
individual opposing the majority is not democracy. The HDZ will 
insist on democracy being the position of the majority, and we 
will insist on the observance of the procedure and the normative 
deeds. 
  In this case the issue was the conflict in interpreting the 
procedure. In any law, the last resort is that the act be 
interpreted by whoever passed it. If the rules of procedure are 
passed by the Chamber of Counties, then they will be interpreted 
by the Chamber of Counties. As far as our style is concerned, I 
accept the criticism, I agree that not everything was organized 
well and that some individuals were not prepared well. However, 
that is one of our organizational weaknesses, but also 
strengths, since it is from instances such as these that we 
learn not to repeat such mistakes. 
  [Novak-Srzic] What is your comment on Mr. Mesic's 
statements about Bolshevist, Communist, Stalinist, 
non-democratic actions in the HDZ? 
  [Radic] I am sure that Mr. Mesic does not believe that. 
  [Novak-Srzic] After the tragedy in Sesvete [reference to the 
explosion at a military warehouse on the outskirts of Zagreb], 
which occurred while the changes within the party were taking 
place, there appeared the demand for Defense Minister Susak's 
resignation. 
  [Radic] Naturally, I am sorry, as is any person when a 
tragedy occurs. We must all do everything to relieve the 
consequences of the tragedy, but we must make even more effort 
to prevent the possibility of similar accidents happening, or at 
least to reduce it to the lowest possible level. All these 
committees, from the president's to the parliament one, will do 
everything to learn the truth about the causes of the accident. 
We are, in a way, still at war, and thank God there have not 
been more such events and tragedies. As far as the demand for 
investigating the liability of any member of the government is 
concerned, it is a normal procedural possibility of the Croatian 
parliament. Not only does the parliament have the right to do 
so, but it is obliged to, but it is also obliged, as is any 
group, to demand a resignation on the basis of arguments. I 
think that the Croatian parliament has done well by deciding 
that there be an investigation into the real causes and possible 
culprits. You know what the church says: You can sin by 
thought, word, deed, and omission. 
  [Novak-Srzic] However, there are also moral reasons for 
insisting on Minister Susak's resignation, are there not? 
  [Radic] There is a lot of politics and petty politics in 
this, especially now. Remember, the reasons behind the demand 
for Susak's resignation are different every day. You can 
therefore not not put it all together. Minister Susak will 
personally make a maximum effort to determine the causes of the 
accident. However, there are some who would like Gojko Susak 
not to be defense minister. What if it is established that 
there is a possibility that those who want Susak to leave are 
responsible? I would not prejudice anything. Let the facts 
speak. 
  [Novak-Srzic] Do you consider the process of the 
"transformation" of the HDZ completed, and do you not think that 
the issue is in fact the postponement of disunion? 
  [Radic] I do not consider this process finished. I believe 
that the process of the HDZ growing from a movement into a party 
will last several years. It is impossible to achieve that in 
one moment, with one act, or one decree. It is a process. It 
is a normal sequence of events in which the HDZ will calmly, as 
well as in turmoil, as that is also part of life, carry out its 
transformation -- not for its own sake, but for the sake of 
Croatia. 
  [Novak-Srzic] Who will be dropped in the process? 
  [Radic] Those who do not accept the program and statute of 
the HDZ. All the members have been able to participate in the 
creation of each act and the overall policy of the HDZ, but when 
the majority -- and I would like to stress that it is the 
majority -- adopts something by a democratic procedure, the 
others must implement it. We remain a broad enough party to 
allow for differences within the program, but not in the 
important aspects. We must be recognizable precisely in these 
important aspects, and those who are not recognizable in this 
way will not stay. We are open to former communists, but not to 
those who are still communists. 
  [Novak-Srzic] Ivic Pasalic has recently stated in an 
interview that the HDZ was starting the process of 
de-communization. What could that mean? 
  [Radic] There is something there. There are remnants of the 
communist system in our society, and the same holds true for the 
HDZ. You can see this danger in other countries that are 
leaving the socialist world, but in which Communism is 
returning. We are a party that will not allow Communism to 
return either among our members or in Croatia as a whole, 
because we are the essential political force in Croatia. Our 
aim is not to have communist remnants among us. I would like to 
emphasize that the issue is not whether someone used to be a 
communist, but what they support at present. I must point out 
that all this does not indicate the HDZ is turning right; we 
remain firmly in the center. 
  [Novak-Srzic] You have mentioned remnants of the communist 
society. Is it possible that the apartments that some high 
state officials, members of the HDZ, have been given, as was the 
case with Mr. Mudrinic [minister of transport and 
communications], could also be a remnant of the privileges 
following the pattern from the past? 
  [Radic] Personally, I have and will always be against people 
having privileges, especially illegal, only because they are in 
politics. The party must work hard on that, and it must clarify 
things with those who support it. However, we often tend to 
grasp individual cases that we then transfer to the entire 
system. I am in favor of changing the system by not allowing 
such omissions. I have not been informed of this specific case, 
so I cannot tell you anything about it. 
  [Novak-Srzic] Do you have a state-owned apartment? 
  [Radic] No, I bought my apartment before I entered politics.

<F P=106> [Interview with Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of </F>
Counties, by Sanja Modric; place and date not given: "The 
President Will Decide Whether to Convene a New Session of the 
Chamber of Counties"] 
  [Text] [Modric] Can you comment on the political climate 
in Croatia with regard to the replacement that is imminent in 
the Chamber of Counties, after you were relieved of all your 
functions in the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community]? 
  [Manolic] I think the attempt to replace me, the way in 
which it was done, has created a certain repulsion and made the 
public condemn that procedure. I have respected the procedure 
to a "T." Amending the agenda during a session of the Chamber of 
Counties is in the hands of the president of the chamber. 
Therefore, he can, but does not have to, include an amendment 
in the agenda. Since, that day, the HDZ Club of Representatives 
did not manage to have the question of my replacement put on the 
agenda; they demanded that the session be interrupted until a 
Commission for Constitution and Standing Orders gives its 
interpretation of the Standing Orders. The chamber accepted to 
interrupt the session, and it cannot be continued, for the 
interruption lasted for more than eight days. We must convene a 
new session. This time-out has enabled me to buy time to create 
-- first of all in the Chamber of Counties and then also in the 
parliament -- a climate that will make it possible to decide 
about my replacement in a legal and legitimate manner. I hope 
that, when the time comes, deputies will be able to commit 
themselves on that issue more objectively, although they were 
pressured by the HDZ leadership. 
  [Modric] When do you plan to convene the session of the 
Chamber of Counties, or will you convene it at all? HINA 
reports that yesterday you were formally requested to do so by 
representatives of the ruling party in the upper chamber of our 
parliament. 
  [Manolic] Convening a new session of the Chamber of Counties 
is a matter that will be decided by its president. I will be 
governed primarily by political reasons in deciding to convene 
the session, and I will completely obey constitutional and legal 
regulations. My decision cannot be influenced by any kind of 
demands of a group of the HDZ representatives nor of the HDZ 
Club of Representatives. The attempt to eliminate me from the 
Croatian parliament has undoubtedly resulted in a parliamentary 
crisis, for a crisis in the Chamber of Counties can easily be 
transferred to the Chamber of Representatives. I think the only 
way out of this situation is to reach an agreement between 
factors that lead to the crisis or new elections. 
  [Modric] What kind of agreement are you talking about? 
  [Manolic] It can be reached only if all parliamentary 
political parties meet and try to find a solution together. If 
there is no agreement, then there will have to be new elections 
and, in accordance with the view of the electoral body, a new 
parliament must be constituted. 
  [Modric] Will you persist in the founding of a new party 
anyway, the party of Croatian Independent Democrats, as 
announced? 
  [Manolic] Yes. I think that problems and differences within 
the HDZ, especially that of its leadership, which had already 
surfaced during the HDZ Second General Assembly, have piled up 
to the extent that it is impossible to avoid the division. In 
the HDZ, it is no longer possible to have any kind of critical 
political activity regarding the politics of the president of 
the country and the ruling party. 
  [Modric] Will Stipe Mesic be a member of the steering 
committee of your new party? Some newspapers say that Mesic, 
before the last session of the HDZ Club, spent two hours with 
President Tudjman and then swore unconditional allegiance to 
him. President Tudjman personally confirmed that Joza Boljkovac 
was on his side. 
  [Manolic] You see, in the present circumstances, one wrongly 
assumes that this is about my or Mesic's conflict with the 
president of the country and of the HDZ, that this is a conflict 
between people. However, the matter at issue is condemning a 
trend in politics. Differentiation is, therefore, not done 
according to "who is for and who is against the president," but 
"who is for the president's politics and who is against it." 
Therefore, people are divided around politics, and that is 
important. Consequently, what you ask me is irrelevant: is 
Mesic with me or not, am I with him or not. The important thing 
is for people to commit themselves on the state politics. That 
is a process that will not happen overnight but will last until 
we emerge as a political party. 
  [Modric] When is that going to happen? 
  [Manolic] Very soon. There are some elements that make us 
hurry. On one hand, the public is very excited because of those 
developments; it demands solutions and requires prominent 
politicians to make concrete steps. 
  [Modric] Some of your opponents claim you rushed making 
political assessments. President Tudjman also said you were not 
very dangerous, for if you leave the HDZ, only 1 percent of the 
membership will follow you. 
  [Manolic] President Tudjman has proved many times what his 
political judgment is like. Wrong! Involving Croatia in the 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the isolation on the international 
plane, abandoning traditional allies in Europe, seeking some 
allegedly salutary solutions only through negotiations with 
Milosevic, and much more -- all that speaks of the value of 
President Tudjman's judgment and the statement you asked me 
about can be viewed in that light, too. The statement about 1 
percent of my followers is nothing but pure consolation for him 
and his bureaucracy. 
  [Modric] In the fierce media campaign on the occasion of the 
"Manolic case," some newspapers like VECERNJI LIST suggest that 
a group demanding the resignation of Minister Susak could be 
responsible for the tragic explosion in Sesvete [the suburbs of 
Zagreb]. Jure Radic, in DANAS, has asked an important question: 
What will happen if it is established that those who demand the 
replacement of the defense minister are responsible for the 
explosion? 
  [Manolic] First of all, when I demanded that Susak resign, I 
had no criminal acts in mind, but Susak's political 
responsibility for the tragedy of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats. 
I thought that, especially in the aftermath of the Washington 
agreement, the minister was disqualified by his war-mongering 
moves and statements that stirred up hatred between the Croats 
and the Muslims, the statement he made in the parliament that 
"Herzegovina is a part of Croatia," and an attempt to divide 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was actually reckoning without the 
host [the Bosnians]. Therefore, I claimed that Susak had to be 
held responsible for his political actions. Similar demands of 
the opposition, after the explosion in Duboki Jarak, rely on 
different arguments, although we must say that the opposition 
has also been critical toward the politics of Minister Susak in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The explosion in Sesvete, however, requires 
a different kind of responsibility of the said minister. As 
those storehouses are the property of the Defense Ministry, the 
minister, naturally, must bear the consequences. Not because we 
find him "guilty before putting him on trial," but in order to 
enable a comprehensive and objective investigation. It cannot 
be done if the most responsible people hold on to their 
functions and they themselves appoint the so-called 
investigation commissions, which are then suspected of working 
for their benefit. Since, while there were still fires burning 
in Sesvete, newspapers published that the tragedy in Duboki 
Jarak was an "accident," we can say that there are some who want 
to cover it all up, and we cannot allow that. As for the 
speculation of Mr. Radic and those like him, they are very 
tasteless. As the most responsible man in the party, right next 
to the president, Radic should know that he can discuss the 
explosion only after a thorough and objective investigation.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mladen Kevo: "All of Milosevic's Ministers"] </F>
  [Text] The newest Serbian Government headed by 
"Kninite" Mirko Marjanovic is only the logical continuation of 
Milosevic's red camarilla, which has been on the march across 
the Balkans for seven years, leaving ruins and corpses in its 
wake. 
  "We will preserve the sound dinar, we will create a market 
system, we will crush inflation, there will be no printing of 
money without backing, we will quickly increase production, we 
will help the `borderlands,' there will be no loans for the 
unqualified, we are encircled--but we will persevere and emerge 
even stronger than we were before the sanctions." With these 
words, a slightly milder variant of the speech from the 5th 
Congress of the KPJ [Communist Party of Yugoslavia] in 1948, the 
"mandatary for forming a Serbian government," Mirko Marjanovic, 
sold a demagogic haze to the Serbian parliamentary deputies and 
to the Serbian public. This "gentleman" with 50 years of party 
service, a native of Knin, a Belgrade scholarship recipient at 
red universities in Moscow, is now the main smuggler of gas from 
Russia for the second winter in a row, through the company 
"Progres," of which he was the director. 
  The gentlemen did not explain how he "will not print money 
without backing" while the budget of the "Armed Forces of 
Yugoslavia" is $700 million and the "superdinar" has backing in 
gold and foreign exchange amounting to 230 million German marks; 
nor did he explain exactly what "there will be no loans for the 
unqualified" means in a country from which all qualified people 
among them and 350,000 young people have long since fled head 
over heels. 
  Even a cursory glance at the team that will lead the 
country, 
the "ministers," provides an indication of what this latest 
Serbian government will be like. The man concerned with pushing 
this government's proposals through parliament will be socialist 
fossil Dragan Tomic, a person who with a trembling voice, as 
"president of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of 
Belgrade" at the time, announced Milosevic's first rallies in 
1987 and 1988 at the "source." There is Zoran Sokolovic 
"Pirocanac," for several years now Serbia's top policeman, a 
person who has performed immeasurable services in suppressing 
all attempts at "popular happenings" that are against 
Milosevic's will. His sphere of activity will remain the 
truncheon. There is Ratko Markovic, a professor at the School of 
Law in Belgrade, known for his writing of the so-called Zabljak 
Constitution, a piece of legal hanky-panky through which 
Montenegro became Belgrade's captive without the right to appeal 
and remedy, a "jurist" for whom the Orthodox church in Vienna is 
plenty of proof that Vienna is an "old Serbian city." There is 
Slobodan Unkovic, the former chancellor of Belgrade University 
and chairman of one of the former sessions of the Serbian 
Assembly, known for having submitted his own irrevocable 
resignation midway through a session over which he was 
presiding, with the words: "Colleagues, I cannot go on!" There 
is also Radovan Pankov, who will lead one of the key areas, the 
"Ministry for Serbs Outside Serbia" (translation: "ministry for 
the borderlands"), and with Kertes the leader of the "yogurt 
revolution" in Vojvodina, the former party leader in Backa 
Palanka (the place from which the occupation and deportation of 
Ilok was conducted), and one of the ideological thugs of the 
Milosevic regime. 
  The sphere of information has been entrusted to Ratomir 
Vica, 
the former manager of RTV [Radio and Television] Serbia, and 
there is also the director of the "Red Star" soccer club for 
many years, Vladimir Cvetkovic. His club has long since lost its 
radiance, but nonetheless Cvetkovic, as minister of sports, is 
still a "rising star." This team will have at its disposal as 
flank support the good services--and it will need them--of Brana 
Crncevic, who needs no special introduction, Milorad Vucelic, 
the director of TV Serbia and ideologue of the "red chetnik 
movement," the unique Margit Savovic, as "federal minister for 
human rights," Mihalj Kertes--about whom no one knows exactly 
what he does, although many have experienced how it does it, and 
Radmilo Bogdanovic, Serbia's former top policeman. There is also 
Bora Jovic, who is less and less in demand, and there is Zeljko 
Simic, our great friend from the Geneva Declaration, and there 
are retired and active generals. 
  What is actually present here is the entire apparatus of a 
crumbled state that has been completely useless for several 
years now. Each of them could gain a certain role at a certain 
moment. The number of roles is unlimited, but they are all of an 
episodic nature. The latest convocation of the Serbian 
government is only the logical continuation of Milosevic's red 
camarilla, which for seven years now--amid war cries--has been 
on the march across the Balkans, leaving arson, ruins, and death 
in its wake for tens of thousands of members of other nations. 
These are "all the free comrades" who will leave only after they 
have literally spent the last para and pfennig of all the 
possible reserves of the former Yugoslavia. Even then, however, 
they will not leave willingly, and someone will have to ask them 
to give up power. Naturally, "ask" them using their methods....

<F P=106> [Commentary by Nevenka Levak: "Osijek--In First Place"] </F>
  [Text] We are in fact no longer the rich Slavonia of 
immeasurable natural beauty and endless fields of grain, but 
rather the disfigured vestibule to Croatia which many people are 
sweeping under the rug because of peace in their own home. 
  "Osijek is the best!" the residents of this city finally 
shouted, but the excitement subsided when they realized that 
Osijek is in fact at the top of the welfare and unemployment 
list. This was the effective conclusion drawn by Ivan Parac, 
minister of labor and social welfare of the RH [Republic of 
Croatia], during a visit to our city and vicinity. Still, such a 
situation is normal, he continued, because this city was on the 
front line of the fighting, but since we know that we are still 
in that position, this situation is hardly likely to change. 
  The city has been razed and it is necessary to invest in 
reconstruction, it was said at the meeting between Mr. Parac and 
the zupanija administration. This is because it is obvious that 
given the lack of economic capacities, the people who are 
employed have nothing to do, so that those who have had the good 
fortune to find work at private but nonproductive businesses are 
losing their jobs as those businesses close due to unprofitable 
operation. Since the end of May 1992, i.e., two years ago, we 
have not seen a single crane in Osijek, except the one at the 
Drava Bridge, and even that one is scarcely used. 
  Production capacities in Osijek are being rebuilt only 
slowly 
or not at all because there is no influx of fresh capital, and 
there is uncertainty about whether certain outdated technologies 
should even be rebuilt or whether the economy should be fully 
reconstructed and adapted to the needs of the contemporary 
market. But the basic precondition for that--which is still 
called capital--is not present. Mr. Parac also contends that 
Slavonia is at the top of the list in terms of the threat to 
social welfare, which is illogical for this (once) rich region. 
But we are no longer rich. The entire city is supplied by 
several private gardens in Tvrdjavica and Podravlje, while 
everything else that arrives is rinsed like fresh lettuce in a 
pile of taxes and surtaxes for fools. This time, the conclusion 
has emerged that the rest of Croatia should help Slavonia, which 
once fed all of Croatia and then some, but it is already too 
late for such a conclusion. We have already swallowed our share 
of heavy wartime and postwar calamity, and now we are coping 
practically on our own. For two years we have survived on rice 
and noodles, but now, in any event, we also have vegetables. 
Indeed, Minister Parac emphasizes that it is illogical that 
Osijek and Slavonia are in this position, and says verbatim 
"that there have been structural dislocations in the overall 
economy, infrastructure, education system, health care, and 
elsewhere in this region." What interests us in particular is 
the question of what should be done after the city was 
systematically shelled for a year and a half by "acquaintances" 
who knew very well where they were aiming. Perhaps someone could 
call the sweeping destruction of the Osijek economy a 
"structural change," but at the very least that is a ludicrous 
academic buzzword for what has happened to us, about which 
Croatia has remained silent for two years now. It cannot even be 
said that the people in Zagreb knew nothing about this, because 
we have made plenty of noise, but until it became more or less 
popular to descend on Slavonia and individually shudder at the 
situation, which Croatian ministers have been doing lately, no 
one recognized this about us out loud. If this results in 
action, and not only reaction, then we will be satisfied with 
that, because better late than never; but if it has become 
fashionable to visit Slavonia and experience revulsion, then 
that is worse than the blissful ignorance demonstrated thus far 
by individuals from the metropolis. We are in fact no longer the 
rich Slavonia of immeasurable natural beauty and endless fields 
of grain, but rather the disfigured vestibule to Croatia which 
many people are sweeping under the rug because of peace in their 
own home. Unfortunately, we are not able to do that, because we 
live here.

  [Excerpts] Lech Walesa said that amendments to the 
Constitution would mean not only new parliamentary but also new 
presidential elections. This was in response to a proposal to 
amend the Small Constitution tabled by the government coalition 
deputies who want the Sejm, not the president, to have the last 
word on appointing members of the government. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Katarzyna Kolenda] In an 
interview for Lithuanian television, Lech Walesa said that he 
had to give an example for the future because, according to him, 
the rules of the Constitution should not be changed according to 
the political situation. 
  [Walesa] The president guards the Constitution, and if he is 
elected and has agreed to a Constitution, this Constitution 
cannot be changed in the midddle of the presidential term of 
office. The system cannot be changed in the middle of the term 
because then an honest president has to prevent this from 
happening by using all available means. 
  [Kolenda] The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has officially 
invited the president to take part in the meeting of its 
parliamentary floor group. 
  [Kwasniewski, SLD leader, identified by screen caption] I am 
ready for these talks. Everything is up to the president 
because it is better to keep talking. [passage omitted] 
  [Kolenda] Both sides declare that the talks are the only way 
of solving this conflict, the conflict that has been going on 
for some weeks. It is known unofficially that the president and 
the coalition have set conditions that exclude any meeting. 
Everything points to the fact that a solution to the conflict 
and an appointment of the new finance minister are still far 
away. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Today's Meeting Between President and </F>
SLD Deputies; Walesa Will Go to the Field"] 
  [Text] Yesterday morning Lech Walesa received an 
invitation to meet with the Deputies' Club of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD]. The president decided to accept it because 
"one does not refuse to meet organized social forces of over 
five or 10 persons." The president's spokesman stated that the 
meeting will be held today at 1700. As it seems, the subject of 
the meeting will be the conflict between the coalition and the 
Belweder. At noon, the president is supposed to meet with Sejm 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy. 
  Commenting on the proposal of amending the Small 
Constitution, Lech Walesa said in an interview for the PAP press 
agency that he cannot underestimate an initiative that "may be a 
great fire. Therefore, I must sometimes, at the beginning, 
strike in such a way as to make everyone think." 
  The president also said: "I will not do anything that would 
show that I am violating the law. I will ask the people whether 
the Basic Law and the political system of the country may be 
changed when some political group is built for two hours.... I 
will establish a force that will not allow this to happen, and 
it was in this sense that I said this force will resolve the 
parliament. It will be entitled to that. It is in the interest 
of the state and in the interest of each of us to see to it that 
any accidental changes in the system do not take place.... I 
reacted in this way in the name of responsibility for the future 
of the state." 
  Asked about his reaction to the self-governmental elections 
ordered by the prime minister, Lech Walesa stated that Waldemar 
Pawlak should not have done this because the deadline for 
signing the electoral law is 21 April. He said that it was the 
first time he had to complain about the prime minister, and he 
points out to him that one should not act this way. The 
president also announced that, starting on Friday, he would go 
to the field, he would discuss all these issues with people, and 
he would persuade them to force their deputies to resolve 
problems well and logically. 
  "We would like to tell the president about the intentions we 
have when we are resolving a dispute between the supreme 
authorities of the state," said SLD Spokesman Zbigniew 
Siemiatkowski--"a dispute that, as a consequence, may paralyze 
them and cause imponderable results." 
  Siemiatkowski would not confirm that the meeting, proposed 
only by the SLD (the club of the Polish Peasant Party--the 
PSL--has not invited the president to a talk so far), proves 
that the SLD is carrying the burden of the conflict with the 
president. He also said that a meeting with the entire club 
does not rule out the possibility of talks in a smaller group; 
he did not want to discuss any conditions or limits of the 
compromise that the SLD is willing to reach. He stressed that 
there will be no preliminary conditions on which both parties 
would be ready to meet. According to the SLD spokesman, the 
prime minister had to schedule the elections for 19 June because 
it was the only possible date. 
  It is unofficially evaluated in the Sejm that today's 
meeting 
proves that the parties to the conflict want to reach an 
agreement. This would mean that it would not be necessary to 
amend the Small Constitution, and the president may unblock the 
issue of the nomination to the vacant posts in the government. 
  A meeting of the governing coalition was scheduled to take 
place on Tuesday [19 April] evening. The plans were 
complicated by the prolonged session of the government. 
Nonetheless, late in the evening, in the premises of the Office 
of the Council of Ministers, there was a meeting of the 
representatives of the coalition, including Aleksander 
Kwasniewski, Jozef Oleksy, and Jerzy Szmajdzinski of the SLD, as 
well as the PSL's Jozef Zych. Journalists did not receive any 
information on the subject of the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lech Falandysz, deputy chief of the </F>
President's Office, by Agnieszka Kublik; place and date not 
given: "New Political System Means New Elections"] 
  [Text] [Kublik] Rumor has it that you have not been 
sleeping well since you have been trying to find an answer to 
the question of how to dissolve parliament by lawful means. If 
the president were to ask you now whether you managed to come up 
with something, what would you tell him? 
  [Falandysz] I would tell him that for now, I know of no such 
way. But if the coalition manages to change the political 
system--that is, if it takes the right to influence the 
government's composition away from the president--one should 
consider whether the Small Constitution does not allow for a 
dissolution of parliament. I think that the coalition, while 
submitting a motion for an amendment to the Small Constitution, 
considered the possibility of new parliamentary and presidential 
elections. 
  [Kublik] Why would the coalition think that? 
  [Falandysz] I hope that serious politicians are aware that a 
change in the political system should result in new elections. 
I do not even rule out the possibility that the Sejm itself 
will come to the conclusion that it has changed the political 
system and then the Sejm will dissolve itself. 
  [Kublik] I hope you do not really mean that. After all, 
your boss has announced that he is ready to take an extralegal 
measure, even if he were to face the Tribunal of State for that. 
The Small Constitution allows for the possibility of dissolving 
the Sejm in three situations only: if the Sejm does not adopt a 
budget in the prescribed time period, if it adopts a 
no-confidence vote against the government while failing to 
appoint a prime minister, or if the Sejm fails to nominate a new 
government. None of the above situations apply to what we have 
right now. 
  [Falandysz] One cannot rule out anything in politics. 
  [Kublik] Some people fear that the president, while ignoring 
legal provisions, will write a "Consider yourself dismissed" 
letter to the prime minister. This is how he recalled Henryk 
Wujec in the past, from the post of secretary of the Citizens 
Committee, and, most recently, this is how he recalled Marek 
Markiewicz, chief of the National Radio and Television 
Broadcasting Council. 
  [Falandysz] There is no analogy there, but I cannot rule out 
such a situation. One would have to think more about it. 
  [Kublik] But what do you want to think about when the 
Constitution does not provide that the president is empowered to 
dismiss the prime minister? 
  [Falandysz] But one cannot exclude the possibility that, if 
the president withdraws his support for the prime minister, the 
latter would offer his resignation and then one would have to 
begin appointing a new government. 
  [Kublik] Why would the prime minister want to resign? After 
all, he enjoys support in the Sejm of almost 300 Sejm deputies 
for the coalition. 
  [Falandysz] Imagine a prime minister who does not enjoy the 
support of the head of state. How could he represent Poland 
abroad? Theoretically, the prime minister could be dismissed and 
a new government formed. The president could make that 
difficult. 
  [Kublik] In what way? 
  [Falandysz] The Small Constitution provides that the 
president has a final say in appointing a government, even if 
the government was elected by the Sejm. But the president also 
has the possibility of not appointing such a cabinet. 
  [Kublik] Why? After all, appointing a cabinet is just a 
formality because the Sejm has voted it through, anyway. 
  [Falandysz] If one were to interpret the Constitution in a 
presidential-parliamentary way, there is the possibility of the 
president not appointing a government. The Small Constitution 
clearly provides: "in case the Council of Ministers is not 
appointed..." So that means that the president does not have to 
make the appointment. And, if there is no government formed, 
the president could dissolve parliament. 
  Do you know that there are countries where the president is 
always empowered to dissolve parliament? Such a possibility is 
contained in the Belweder's constitutional draft. 
  [Kublik] Is the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] the 
Belweder's main enemy right now? It does not look like Walesa 
is attacking the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. 
  [Falandysz] Let me put in another way: It is not the PSL 
that is behind all of the antipresidential measures. It is the 
SLD that is antipresidential. From the very beginning, SLD men 
have wanted to reduce presidential powers. And then there were 
their attempts, aimed at the three Belweder ministries. Walesa 
has for years fought the kind of regime that is currently being 
promoted by what is today the SLD, where the United Peasant 
Accord was just a vassal. And this is the way it continues to 
be. I once said that the president treats Pawlak as his younger 
brother. But one can still have arguments, even with one's 
younger brother. 
  [Kublik] The SLD accuses Walesa of striving for 
dictatorship. 
  [Falandysz] That is rubbish. All the president does is 
maintain his constitutional powers. They find it extremely hard 
to come to terms with the fact that he, for instance, makes 
decisions on personnel issues in the Defense, Internal Affairs, 
and Foreign Affairs Ministries. They are used to a 
monopoly--they have to have everything: the finance minister, 
the ownership transformations minister, the police, the Army, 
foreign affairs, and the chief customs official. 
  [Kublik] Will the president meet the SLD Sejm Deputies Club 
at Kwasniewski's invitation? 
  [Falandysz] I am not sure it is a good idea for the 
president to hold meetings with political parties. The 
Constitution provides for another possibility: Article 38 
states that "regarding issues of special importance to the 
state, the president is empowered to call sessions of the 
Council of Ministers and to chair them." I think that would be 
a more appropriate forum for a constructive debate on the 
current situation.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski, Zbigniew Lentowicz, and </F>
Jerzy Pilczynski: "The Belweder Putsch"] 
  [Text] Let us make the assumption that everything is for 
real--that the coalition does not want to blackmail the 
president but wants to really restrict his powers, that the 
president not only wanted to frighten the coalition but will 
really dissolve the Sejm. In other words, let us assume that it 
is not merely a game but that the coalition and the president 
will really do what they said they would do. 
  Right now, the president does not have any possibility of 
dissolving the Sejm in line with the law. Now, if he does 
dissolve the Sejm, it will be illegal (this will be discussed 
below). 
  There will be no one who would be able to bring the 
president 
before the State Tribunal for dissolving the Sejm illegally. 
This can be done only by the National Assembly, which will no 
longer exist (unless the coalition amends this article of the 
Small Constitution). 
  It may also happen that the Sejm speaker will not act on the 
president's decision and will convene the National Assembly 
anyway. The situation that will develop then will somewhat 
resemble a coup d'etat. 
  It seems that the president will not be able to dissolve the 
Sejm efficiently (that is, not only make the decision, but 
execute it)... 
<H5>  Without the Aid of the Army and the Police </H5>
  Will he really be able to count on these services to support 
him? 
  In line with the estimates of observers, during the last 
election, a substantial part of the cadres supported the 
Democratic Left Alliance. ``Nevertheless, among the officers. 
there would certainly be people who would definitely support the 
president's decision to dissolve the parliament. Most of them, 
however, would consider such a measure to be an illegal attempt 
on democracy, says a high-ranking officer. 
  ``The president is enjoying considerable respect among the 
military people for what he is doing for the defense system,'' 
he says, confirming our information. He immediately adds, 
however, that, in other areas, the Belweder is evaluated very 
critically by the cadres. The Army hopes that, just as in 
previous disputes, this one will also be resolved where it 
emerged--at the political platform--and that the Army will be 
able to keep away from the commotion. 
<H5>  "It Would Be A Misfortune </H5>
  ...for all of us, particularly for the Army, if even in the 
most acute political conflict, one of the parties asked the Army 
for support," claims Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, spokesman of the 
Ministry of National Defense [MON]. 
  Theoretically, in the present composition of the National 
Defense Committee [KOK], which is empowered to, among other 
things, forward a motion to the president requesting the 
imposition of the state of emergency, the people linked to the 
Belweder are in a majority. Apart from the KOK chairman--the 
president himself--the core of the committee "proper for dealing 
with the issues of defense and security of the state" is made up 
of the heads of the so-called presidential ministries: the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
and MON (the defense minister is, by his office, the deputy of 
the KOK chairman), and the head of the General Staff, appointed 
by the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, as well as the 
KOK secretary, who also steers the National Security Council. 
This group also includes a member of the President's Office, 
appointed by the president. 
  The minority "progovernmental" option within KOK, in a 
hypothetical conflict, includes first of all the prime minister 
(whom the KOK chairman has appointed as his first deputy), the 
speakers of both chambers of parliament, and the head of the 
Finance Ministry. The decisions of a collective body such as 
KOK are made by a majority of votes. Thus, the propresidential 
section of KOK has a theoretical chance to win the ballot on 
forwarding a motion to the president, requesting the imposition 
of a state of emergency. 
  We asked Lech Falandysz, secretary of state in the 
President's Office, whether he believes that the president will 
dissolve the Sejm, even if he were to violate the law. 
  ``If the coalition implemented its initiative--that is, if 
we 
really witnessed a change in the political system--one would 
have to think about what to do. As a rule, it so happens in 
democratic countries that a change in the political system is 
accompanied by new elections. I do not think that the president 
will decide to violate the law. Therefore, 
<H5>  The Sejm Will Not Be Dissolved </H5>
  ...if the law does not allow him to do so. He may take 
advantage of the formula of `bowing to higher priorities.' 
However, I do not think so because it is a general and bad 
formula. Well, the option of a `lesser evil' might be chosen, 
but we have already had that.'' 
  "The president will not yield to blackmail; however, I 
believe that he will not violate the law, either," we were told 
by Lech Falandysz. 
  The interviews we have conducted with the representatives of 
several groupings--Henryk Wujec of the Democratic Union, Jerzy 
Eysymontt of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, Krzysztof 
Krol of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, and Piotr 
Zak of "Solidarity"--suggest that none of them... 
<H5>  Would Approve of a Violation of the Law </H5>
  ...by the president. 
  The provisions of the Small Constitution are in this case 
not 
very favorable to the president, and, in addition, they are 
rather clear. If Walesa wanted to choose Yeltsin's option, the 
senate is an obstacle. Article 19 of the Small Constitution 
does empower the president and the Sejm to order a referendum; 
however, first the senate must give its consent. 
  The constitutional law entitles the president to impose a 
state of emergency on part or on the whole of the state's 
territory. There are two reasons to do this: first, a natural 
calamity, and, second, a threat to the internal security of the 
state. Even though it seems that it is quite a broad concept, 
it can be extended only to certain limits. When a state of 
emergency is in effect, the Sejm cannot be dissolved, and the 
electoral laws as well as the Constitution cannot be changed. 
As far as the specific conditions of the functioning of a state 
of emergency are concerned, the Constitution makes a reference 
to a specific law. It was passed in 1983 and was amended when 
constitutional amendments were being passed in 1989. A state of 
emergency would merely freeze the situation and not resolve the 
problem. In addition, it can be prolonged only once every three 
months, after the Sejm gives its consent. Thus, after three 
months, it would be necessary to submit a report on the illegal 
introduction of the state of emergency to the same parliament. 
  One might think about another possibility, a different 
sequence of events: The president first dissolves the Sejm, then 
imposes the state of emergency. However, the Small Constitution 
envisions four cases in which the president can dissolve the 
Sejm; three of them contain clear limitations. None of them are 
possible right now. One might speculate even further and include 
the presidential powers in the extraordinary activities defined 
in Article 28 of the Constitution; it says that the president 
sees to it that the Constitution is observed and defends the 
sovereignty and security of the state. However, it is difficult 
to imagine that such activities might go against any clear 
provisions of the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Aarticle by R.W.: "OBOP Poll; Government Does Not Keep Its </F>
Promises"] 
  [Text] The government's composition is good--so 
think 39 percent of respondents polled by the Public Opinion 
Research Center [OBOP] at the end of March. Exactly the same 
proportion of people think the government's composition is bad. 
As time goes by, the proportions are getting worse, from the 
standpoint of the current governing team. There are more critics 
now than in November (21 percent), when the government was 
beginning its term, whereas there are clearly fewer satisfied 
people (it used to be 51 percent). The view still prevails that 
Pawlak's government is better than Suchocka's, but there are 
fewer and fewer people who think that. Very few people are 
willing to defend the argument that the 19 September winners are 
keeping their election promises. 
  The current cabinet's composition is liked by farmers the 
most and by private entrepreneurs the least. People with 
left-wing views and those who voted for the Polish Peasant Party 
last year have more praise for the Cabinet (this applies even 
more to those who voted for the Democratic Left Alliance). 
  Those who think the current government is superior to the 
previous one are mostly people with high school diplomas, at 
most. They inhabit small towns and sympathize with the parties 
forming the governing coalition. Suchocka's Cabinet is evaluated 
more highly by people with a higher education, living in larger 
cities, and supporters of the Democratic Union and of right-wing 
parties. 
  Slightly over half the respondents (51 percent) agree that 
Pawlak's government has been introducing some changes, every 
25th person (4 percent) is of the view that the government is 
making a major breakthrough, and every third person (35 percent) 
thinks that the government contributes nothing new to the 
policies in effect before. In the fall of last year, many more 
people evauated Pawlak's cabinet as reform-oriented. 
  The view prevails in the OBOP poll that the government is 
not 
keeping its election promises--so think 63 percent of the polled 
(in November of last year, 26 percent). The opposite view--that 
promises are being kept--is defended by 25 percent of those 
polled (48 percent in the previous poll). There is no longer a 
single social, professional, or demographic group in which the 
view would prevail that the governing team is keeping what it 
promised during the election campaign.

  The poll of 23-29 March was conducted by using a

<F P=106> [Article by "NIKA": "Free Market Gives to the Rich but </F>
Takes From the Poor; PENTOR--What Do Poles Think About 
Liberalism?"] 
  [Text] Almost half of the Polish people feel 
distaste for political and economic liberalism--this according 
to the most recent survey by PENTOR. Thirty-two percent of the 
polled are in favor of liberal values, including 24 percent who 
recognize the values in conjunction with simultaneous social 
protection by the state. Even the mere notion of "liberalism" 
arouses negative responses by a majority of the polled. 
  From among citizens' rights, the right to social protection 
turned out the most important one to our society (97 percent of 
citizens said it is important). Among others, the right to 
freedom of speech (85 percent) and electoral rights (78 percent) 
were listed as less important. As far as fulfilling citizens' 
duties is concerned, caring for one's elderly parents is the 
most important duty (96 percent), according to those polled. 
Fewer people talked about the need to observe the law (95 
percent), the need to pay taxes (73 percent), or about military 
service duty (57 percent). 
  People in favor of economic liberalism not accompanied by 
the 
state's social protection (8 percent of those polled) are mainly 
young people with higher educations. 
  Poles are a conservative nation that bases its values on 
authorities. Eighty-eight percent of those polled think that 
children should be taught obedience vis-a-vis their parents and 
that one should listen to older and more experienced people (75 
percent). 
  Liberal principles are approved by Polish people on an ad 
hoc 
basis; the majority are in favor of state intervention and 
strong state power. On the other hand, we agree with the 
separation of church and state (69 percent). 
  A majority of Polish people (77 percent) are convinced that 
the market economy will make the rich even richer while the poor 
will get poorer. Those polled approve of such principles of 
economic transformations as privatization, the lifting of price 
controls, and free trade, but, at the same time, they take a 
suspicious view of people involved in independent economic 
activities. Even the mere notions of "liberalism" and "liberal" 
bring negative images to the respondents' minds. 
  Despite this, Polish people are of the view that enterprises 
run by private owners are the most efficient. This view was 
expressed by 67 percent of those polled.

<F P=106> [Article by E.Cz., E.K., and J.T.P.: "A Game or War"] </F>
  [Text] The coalition deputies' clubs will decide at their 
next meetings whether or not to support a bill amending the 
Small Constitution. Many coalition deputies have expressed the 
opinion that the amendment bill is an element of the game in the 
current conflict with the Belweder, not a desire to limit the 
powers of Lech Walesa. However, no one denies that this is what 
may really happen. There are rumors that the coalition will 
abandon the idea of amending the Constitution in return for the 
nomination of Dariusz Rosati. 
<H5>  What for What </H5>
  The deputies who signed the bill to amend the Constitution 
explain officially that the Small Constitution played its role 
well when all of the authority centers came from the same 
political camp and the decisions they made showed the goodwill 
of all of the parties. At a moment when power in the state is 
wielded by political opponents at the same time, the 
constitutional provisions make it impossible to find solutions 
to conflicts. Coalition politicians unofficially admit, 
however, that the bill is an element of a political game in 
which various methods are being used. 
  "From a political and moral point of view, this ploy is not 
the worst one possible," admits one of them, who stresses that 
right now the dispute between the coalition and the president is 
not over people but over the political system. "It is being 
decided whether we will have a presidential system, which the 
president is trying to achieve through facts, or a 
parliamentary-cabinet system, as it is stated in the Small 
Constitution." 
  According to one of the leaders of the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD], the dispute may only be resolved by a 
gentlemen's agreement with the president: consent to the 
nomination of Rosati in return for the coalition's abandoning 
the idea of introducing its own people into the presidential 
ministries. If the president "bids higher," the coalition might 
also introduce into this game the National Council of Radio and 
Television, even though it is not interested in that for the 
time being. A bargaining chip is also the bill to amend the 
Constitution itself. Irrespective of the opinions of the clubs, 
if two deputies withdraw their signatures from the bill, the 
bill is no longer valid. For this reason, as was suggested by 
the SLD's Ryszard Grodzicki, who is supposed to be the reporter 
of this bill, the initiators did not allow more people to sign 
this bill. In his opinion, journalists now should not ask the 
initiators of the bill about its chances in the Sejm or try to 
figure out what constitutional ploy the president may use to 
neutralize parliament; they should first of all be interested in 
the opinion of the ministry on Rakowiecka Street [probable 
reference to Ministry of Internal Affairs] on this bill. 
  The signatories of the bill stress modestly that it is a 
bill 
submitted by some deputies, not the coalition, and it did not 
have to be agreed on with the clubs' leaders. The SLD's 
Wladyslaw Zbikowski admits, however, that, in line with the 
club's regulations, before the bill was actually submitted, the 
Presidium of the club was informed about it; the Presidium did 
not oppose it. 
  Grodzicki also suggested that such an initiative would not 
have been possible without the approval, or at least the 
knowledge, of the clubs' Presidiums. He also said that the bill 
was signed by 16 deputies, who are said to be the most 
recalcitrant deputies in their clubs and who most frequently 
breach the clubs' discipline. The list of names on the bill 
suggests, however, that this is not a very accurate opinion. As 
for the SLD deputies, the bill was signed primarily by deputies 
from Warsaw, and, as for the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], by 
those who happened to be in Warsaw. 

<H5>    Chances of the Coalition </H5>
  According to the SLD's Bogdan Krysiewicz, there is no 
definitely antipresidential atmosphere in the club; the 
possibility of collective madness is also out of the question. 
  "We do not make a decision on supporting or rejecting a bill 
very hastily. It would be good if the discussion in the club 
were made in the presence of the president and if both sides 
submitted their arguments clearly," he claims. 
  Zbikowski believes that the bill will be backed by a 
definite 
majority of the club. His parliamentary colleagues are rather 
critical of the president's statements and decisions. 
  Opinions in the PSL Club are divided, as well. Jan 
Komornicki believes that the amendment bill will either be 
rejected in the first reading or be forwarded to the 
Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly and utilized 
during work on the new Constitution. 
  "No one in the PSL, including the prime minister, wants a 
war 
with the president," says Komornicki. Janusz Piechocinski adds 
that the PSL merely wants stable conditions for the functioning 
of the government and that the president has not been ensuring 
that recently. On Wednesday [20 April], during the club's 
session, Piechocinski will try to persuade the leadership of the 
club to empower Deputy Speaker Jozef Zych, who is known for his 
ability to reach compromises and who has not said anything that 
might offend the dignity of the president, to take on the role 
of mediator between the coalition and the Belweder. Unlike SLD 
politicians, Piechocinski claims that the dispute is related to 
ambition: on whose terms the talks will start. If the bill is 
voted on, the club will have to take into account the opinion of 
the PSL Chief Council, which will convene on Saturday. 
  However, if we assume that the bill submitted by the 
deputies 
is merely an element of a game, it would be too early to 
evaluate its chances of being passed. This is confirmed by the 
opinion of one leftist politician, who said that "if the 
president manages to persuade two people to withdraw their 
signatures," the entire issue will no longer be valid. The same 
politician doubts, however, that the president will accept the 
invitation to the SLD Club. 
<H5>  What Is Going On? </H5>
  The authors of the bill propose amendments to two articles 
in 
the Small Constitution: Article 4 and Article 68. The change 
of the former links the end of the term of office to the day of 
the first sitting of the new Sejm and obliges the president to 
order elections no earlier than three months and no later than 
four months from the dissolution of the Sejm. Deputy Grodzicki 
claims that, in the case of amending the law, the regulations 
would probably still include solutions that would make it 
impossible to launch new legislative initiatives; they would 
merely allow the work that has already been started to be 
completed and set in order. The second change would lie in the 
following: If the president did not change the composition of 
the Council of Ministers or if he refused to make such a change 
within seven days of the submission date of the prime minister's 
motion, he could request such a change--approved by an absolute 
majority of votes. As a result of the present state, the 
justification is that key posts may not be filled, which causes 
negative results for the activities of the government and for 
its efficiency. According to the authors, this amendment does 
not aim to limit the president's powers; it makes it possible to 
overcome a difficult situation, in which the president does not 
make a change in a ministerial post within seven days or refuses 
to make it.

<F P=106> [Interview with Center Alliance Chairman Jaroslaw Kaczynski </F>
by Amelia Lukasiak; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Lukasiak] How do you assess the present economic 
program? Is it a continuation of the previous policy? 
Contrasting opinions are being voiced on this subject. 
  [Kaczynski] On the whole, it is a continuation of the old 
policy, with certain compromises made for the sake of particular 
causes--for example, the interests of the farming community. Of 
course, attempts to "dilute" the main tenets of the economic 
program are being made in order to disguise the fact that it is 
still the old program. 
  [Lukasiak] But the condition of the economy does not seem to 
be too bad. After all, in the course of one year, we recorded 
economic growth to the tune of 12 percent. 
  [Kaczynski] Precisely. If production grew by 12 percent 
during one year, we can assume that, with a real transformation 
of the state, we could achieve a result many times that. 
However, if this is to happen, we must cut through a network of 
ties and connections between a narrow band of people controlling 
mainly banks and large enterprises. Contrary to the 
expectations of such prognosticators as, for example, Professor 
Jadwiga Staniszkis, large capital controlled partly by private 
owners and partly by the state does not lead to rationalization 
of the economy. It is in our economic interest to transfer that 
capital outside and boost consumption. 
  [Lukasiak] If the economic program of the present government 
is a continuation of the previous government's policy, then why, 
in your opinion, does the Democratic Union criticize it? 
  [Kaczynski] Because, in the first place, the Democratic 
Union is in opposition, so it must criticize the government's 
policy; in the second place, as I said, the program has become 
diluted; finally, after finding itself in opposition, the 
Democratic Union seems to be changing its values slightly in 
relation to those it was promoting before. Let me remind you 
that that group carried out a policy that was openly oriented 
toward an eventual handing over of power to communists. All of 
the tenets of the Democratic Union's policy were erroneous, in 
both the economic and the political sphere. Now they are trying 
to move away from their previous line in various aspects. 
  [Lukasiak] How doe you assess the present power 
configuration? Why are the ruling parties--that is, the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], 
which, after all, share the same Polish People's Republic [PPR] 
pedigree--unable to arrive at a joint position in such key 
questions? 
  [Kaczynski] At present, we have a triangular configuration 
between the Belweder, the SLD, and the PSL. There is open war 
going on along two arms of the triangle. Sparks also fly 
occasionally along the third arm,--hat is, the connection 
between the Belweder and the PSL--but, on the whole, the two 
actually engage in far-reaching cooperation. However, the 
association is a tactical one because I do not believe it is 
very likely that the farmers will give Walesa much support in 
the election campaign. Walesa is very unpopular in the rural 
community. Even the strong PSL apparatus, with its firm 
foothold in the rural sector, could only lose much and gain 
nothing if it tried to promote Walesa there. Apart from that, 
Walesa is an extremely disloyal partner, and the PSL is only too 
aware of that. 
  [Lukasiak] So what is the nature of the Belweder-PSL 
alliance? What does it rest on? 
  [Kaczynski] Thanks to the alliance, the weaker coalition 
partner--that is, the PSL--gains some real strength because of 
the support it has from the Belweder and is able to break up 
internally the stronger partner, the SLD. The only question is, 
why did the SLD decide to enter into such a configuration at 
all? I was convinced from the start that there was a firm 
conditional compact concerning the solution of the question of 
Walesa's presidency through a speedy promulgation of the new 
Constitution at the beginning of 1994. However, the present 
developments I have watched seem to be rather naively amusing 
and lead me to formulate only one conclusion: It was easy to 
play at politics from behind the backs of the Motorized Reserve 
of the Citizens' Militia [ZOMO] and the Security Service and, 
even later, in the hothouse conditions created by the Democratic 
Union and Walesa, when, on the one hand, as representatives of 
the left-wing orientation, certain politicians belonged to the 
lowest paid social group and, on the other, they were able to 
take the most advantage of the existing economic situation. 
  [Lukasiak] In your opinion, how realistic are the voices, 
which can be heard from many directions, saying that in May we 
might have a new government based on the PSL, which will try to 
lean toward the right? 
  [Kaczynski] This is a logical option if you look at it from 
Walesa's viewpoint. However, it is only so if you assume that 
the PSL decides not to nominate its own presidential candidate 
and agrees to support Walesa. On the other hand, gaining entry 
into such a government could be a very attractive proposition 
for many politicians of the right-wing orientation who have lost 
their chance in their own parties. 
  [Lukasiak] You have already partly answered my next 
question, but would you still tell us what you believe is the 
source of the president's strength at the moment? After all, he 
keeps winning successive battles even though he is under 
criticism from both the right-wing and left-wing camps. 
  [Kaczynski] Walesa's strength lies in the dreadful 
opportunism of our political circles. The vast majority of our 
politicians are not capable of opposing him, either because they 
are too afraid or because they are hoping for some advantages if 
they do not stand up to him. Let me remind you that, in our 
debate on the Small Constitution, I moved in favor of a very 
precise definition of the president's range of competence, so 
that we should not have to face the sort of situation we are 
facing today. At that time, Jerzy Jaskiernia (SLD) battled 
determinedly in order to force through the solution we have in 
the Small Constitution now. After all, the PSL and the SLD 
together could have created the sort of government from which 
the president would now helplessly "bounce off" like a ball 
thrown against a solid wall. In 1992, having 43 seats at our 
disposal after the election, we formed a government in which the 
Interior Ministry and the National Defense Ministry remained 
entirely outside the Belweder's sphere of influence. 
  Every time, we have the same situation: Either Walesa is 
feared too much, or someone needs his support too much. After 
all, Suchocka was permanently terrified because she suspected 
that certain people were forever approaching Walesa about the 
prime minister's post and that Walesa promised that post 
indiscriminately to various individuals around him. 
  [Lukasiak] How do you assess the president's attempts to 
influence the formulation of the constitution, such as, for 
example, the proposal to set up a "people's constitutional 
initiative"? 
  [Kaczynski] That is a gambit played with an eye on the 
public and Solidarity, as well as a "wink" directed at the 
right-wing orientation: You would be well-advised to gather 
around me, get rid of your leaders because they have failed you, 
and unite under my protection.... 
  [Lukasiak] But after your defeat in the election you 
yourself were ready to call a truce in your war with the 
president, were you not? 
  [Kaczynski] Let me explain the essence of my reaction at the 
time. It was composed of two parts. First, I was not taking 
back anything I had said earlier, but I was ready to try to 
judge the president by his deeds. If I had not said that, there 
would have been no alliance of the right wing today. Already as 
a coalition, we issued several statements directed against 
Walesa. We did not have to wait long for his reaction. A number 
of cases that had been brought against me and that by then were 
about to be dropped were suddenly reactivated again. 
  [Lukasiak] You recently said in a court case brought by 
Wieslaw Chrzanowski against Piotr Wierzbicki, chief editor of 
GAZETA POLSKA, for publishing his name on the list of so-called 
confidential agents that, according to your information, 
Chrzanowski was not a secret agent of the Security Agency 
[UB].... 
  [Kaczynski] All I said was that there was no evidence that 
Chrzanowski collaborated with UB, although ,in the majority of 
cases under investigation, such evidence had come to light. The 
documents to which I had access contained the information that 
Chrzanowski was first registered as a collaborator and 
subsequently struck off the list because there was no evidence 
of any collaboration on his part. Why was he registered in the 
first place? I do not know, but it is wrong to claim on the 
strength of it that he was a confidential agent. However, it 
still does not mean that Wierzbicki could not have believed so 
in good faith on the strength of that list because the vast 
majority of the names of the confident agents' list refer to 
people who in reality were collaborating with UB. 
  [Lukasiak] Is security vetting possible, or indeed 
necessary, today? 
  [Kaczynski] There will be no order here without security 
vetting. Security vetting is essential: I have not the 
slightest doubt about it. I do, however, have doubts about 
whether it is possible to call to account the companies set up 
by the old nomenklatura, which are now going bankrupt 
on a massive scale. After all, their money was transferred so 
many times from one place to another without actual infringement 
of the ownership system. 
  [Lukasiak] You spoke about a number of major frauds and 
rackets in our banking networks a long time ago. The truth 
behind your warnings was confirmed by reports from the Supreme 
Chamber of Control [NIK], but no one took particular note of 
them at the time. Now the fraud is slowly beginning to be 
disclosed to the public. Why do you think it has taken so long? 
  [Kaczynski] Those who are now sounding the alarm must admit 
our diagnosis was correct and that we did predict the outcome. 
Now our own warnings and advice are being kidnapped from us. I 
am afraid that it may turn out before very long that the 
Democratic Union is the mother party of all "decommunizers." 
Consequently, I am inclined to ask a tongue-in-cheek question of 
Democratic Union politicians and GAZETA WYBORCZA editors: How 
do they feel in the role of political "cranks"? 
  [Lukasiak] Thank you for talking to us.

  [Text] Warsaw, 20 Apr--No agreement has been reached yet 
and no protocol signed on the legal status of the Russian 
military mission in Poland that supervises the transit of its 
troops from Germany to Russia, Maj-Gen Zdzislaw Ostrowski, 
Polish Government plenipotentiary for the stationing of Russian 
troops in Poland, announced today. In the first quarter of this 
year, the transit of Russian Federation troops from the FRG 
through Poland proceeded according to plan. 
  The problem of the mission's legal status has been dragging 
on since the last meeting of the Polish-Russian mixed commission 
in September of last year, when no protocol was signed. Among 
the matters at issue was the question of expanding the mission's 
competences, as suggested by the Polish side. 
  The Poles proposed the setting up of a new commission 
attached to the military mission, which would deal with claims 
concerning damage caused by the troops stationed in Poland and 
unpaid bills for communal services. The Russians suggested that 
the matters at issue should be dealt with through diplomatic 
channels; they also claimed they had paid their dues. 
  There were six claims by Polish citizens and institutions in 
the first quarter of this year for damage totalling over 2 
billion zlotys [Z]. In March, the Polish-Russian mixed 
commission examined 12 cases with claims exceeding Z3 billion, 
one claim for $331,000, and one for 122,000 DM [German marks]. 
Eleven of these cases were directed to diplomatic channels. 
  The last subunit of the Russian Army left Poland on 18 
September of last year. About 25 servicemen stayed in the 
military mission. It is expected that in May of this year eight 
members of the mission, together with their families, will leave 
Poland.

<F P=106> [Article by "ZOL" and "J.K.K.": "Reward for Persistence; </F>
Economy After First Quarter"] 
  [Text] A decreased rate of inflation in the first 
quarter of this year, compared with the last months of 1993; a 
high increase in industrial output, compared with the same 
period last year; and an improved financial situation in 
enterprises--these are all signs that positive phenomena in the 
economy, which have been reported for several months now, are 
acquiring a permanent nature. At the same time, serious dangers 
are emerging that could constitute a barrier for further 
improvement of the economic situation in the nearest future. 
  Inflation was 1.8 percent in January of this year, 1.1 
percent in February, and 2 percent in March (in November and 
December of last year, prices increased by 4 and 5.6 percent, 
respectively). In this situation, reaching a yearly inflation 
rate of 23-26 percent, becomes realistic. 
  Output by industrial enterprises in the first quarter of 
this 
year increased by 10.6 percent compared with a year ago, and, 
when it comes to building-and-assembly enterprises, the increase 
was 7.3 percent. In the first two months of this year, the 
financial situation of enterprises was much better than last 
year. The net financial results of enterprises were positive and 
reached a figure of 4.5 trillion zlotys (0.3 trillion a year 
ago). Compared with the beginning of last year, the 
profitability of enterprises also increased. 
  "There is no doubt whatsoever that the improvement in the 
economic situation is a cumulated effect of the previous four 
years," said Waldemar Kuczynski, an economic expert for the 
Democratic Union. "It is a reward for persistence in the 
continuation of economic policies that have been subjected to 
total ridicule and criticism despite the fact that they were one 
of the best policies in postcommunist Europe. These growth 
trends have a chance of holding, provided the fundamental 
economic directions taht led to these results are maintained. 
That means a continuation of tight monetary policies, a 
reduction of the inflation level and the budget deficit, and the 
maintenance of a maximum scope of economic freedoms. 
  But there are still some dangers. One of them is undoubtedly 
the vacuum that exists with regard to controlling earnings in 
state-owned companies that enjoy the position of monopolists. 
This vacuum is the consequence of a very risky strategy by the 
government when it comes to popiwek [wage-control legislation]. 
Apart from that, measures justifying a fight with the `gray 
area' may become a major danger, under the assumption that the 
fight will not result in an imposition of restrictions on the 
freedom to conduct economic activities in Poland." [sentence as 
published] 
  According to Miroslaw Pietrewicz, chief of the Central 
Planning Administration, "the beneficial symptoms of a certain 
economic dynamism reported in the year's first quarter continue 
to be very weak. So one must approach them with great caution 
and concern. So one cannot talk about the economy in overly 
optimistic terms on the basis of these symptoms alone. Securing 
healthy demand and supply would be a condition for permanent 
growth. What is also necessary is the development of modern 
production processes because, in the final analysis, this would 
mean a chance to reduce the unemployment level and increase real 
earnings." 
  Tomasz Nalecz, a Sejm deputy for the Union of Labor, said 
that "the symptoms of a revival are so slight that it would be 
hard to speak of a growth trend in the economy. I would like it 
very much to really be the first sign of an economic revival. 
Right now, I think it would be disastrous if this were to be 
affected by the political conflict the country is witnessing, 
courtesy of the coalition and Lech Walesa. I think the conflict 
is gradually beginning to paralyze state structures, and this 
kind of situation surely does not help the Polish economy."

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] GAZETA PRZEMYSLOWA I HANDLOWA, a 
Warsaw-based "weekly for entrepreneurs and employers," published 
a lengthy article in its 15-21 March edition, detailing the 
contents of a report by the Gdansk Research Institute on Market 
Economy (IBnGR) that provides a "map" of investment risks in 
Poland, intended for both Polish and foreign investors. The 
report provides a ranking of voivodships in terms of investment 
risks, with Class A status referring to voivodships that offer 
the greatest attractiveness to investors, Class B to high 
attractiveness, Class C to average attractiveness, Class D to 
low attractiveness, and Class E to very low attractiveness. 
These categorizations were based on local market potential, 
labor market, industrial base, business-friendly environment, 
environmental quality, tourist potential, and commercial and 
transportation infrastructure. 
  According to the article, research results "clearly show a 
division into Poland A and Poland B," with voivodships in 
eastern Poland and in urban areas in central Poland generally 
proving to have "the least attractive investment climate." The 
Suwalki, Lomza, and Elblag voivodships in northern Poland were 
found to have the least environmental degradation, while the 
worst environmental quality was found in the heavily 
industrialized areas of both Upper and Lower Silesia as well as 
in other centers where heavy industry is concentrated. 
  The report traced the wide disparities in infrastructure and 
environmental quality to the uneven regional development 
policies of the communist era. "For many years, regional 
authorities were incapacitated," stated the report, and 
financial resources reached the regions only through the central 
budget, with priorities often dictated by political reasons 
instead of by economic requirements. The result has been "huge 
disproportions in Poland's regional development." 
  The areas showing the least investment risk, those with 
Class 
A status, are the capital city voivodship of Warsaw, followed by 
Katowice, Gdansk, and Poznan. These are cities with a "certain 
renown, a large industrial base, and a marked diversity of 
market potential." These voivodships are generally known 
outside of Poland and possess a certain "magnetism" in terms of 
attracting investments, demonstrated by the fact that most of 
the joint-venture companies currently operating in Poland are 
located in them. 
  According to the report, chances for developing "weaker 
regions" of Poland rest to a large degree with the regional 
authorities, which are "responsible for creating conditions 
conducive to investment." In addition, border regions may 
benefit from the increased opening up of the borders. Highway 
construction and privatization should also contribute to the 
promotion and development of certain regions. The IBnGR 
researchers also note that the flow of investments can also 
contribute to eliminating the differences in development between 
regions. 
  In addition to the Class A voivodships listed above, the 
remaining Class B through Class E voivodships are given below, 
in order of investment risk: 
  Class B--Wroclaw, Krakow, Szczecin, Lodz. 
  Class C--Bydgoszcz, Olsztyn, Koszalin, Bielsko-Biala, 
Slupsk, 
Leszno, Lublin. 
  Class D--Rzeszow, Opole, Elblag, Walbrzych, Kalisz, 
Bialystok, Kielce, Gorzow, Zielona Gora, Suwalki, Torun, 
Legnica, Jelenia Gora, Lomza, Konin, Krosno, Nowy Sacz, Plock, 
Czestochowa, Ciechanow, Siedlce, Chelm, Tarnobrzeg, Skierniewice. 
  Class E--Radom, Piotrkow, Biala Podlaska, Zamosc, Sieradz, 
Przemysl, Tarnow, Ostroleka, Wloclawek.

  [Text] Brussels, April 19 (AFP) -- NATO will make no 
decision on air strikes to protect UN safe areas in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina until the governments of member states show a 
"political will" to act military, NATO officials said Tuesday 
[19 April]. 
  NATO military commanders must also closely study the 
situation in the UN-declared safe zones under Bosnian Serb siege 
before replying to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who 
asked NATO Monday [18 April] for airstrike authorisation. 
  Bosnian Serbs are on the point of taking the Moslem town of 
Gorazde, one of the six so-called safe areas.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>
  [Text] New York, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Only a few hours 
after Bosnian Moslem presidency President Ejup Ganic, to his own 
admittance, "implored and begged" the U.N. secretary-general to 
do something about Gorazde, Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO 
Secretary- General Manfred Woerner to mount air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb positions. 
  The Russians were again not consulted and this caused a very 
angry reaction of Russian U.N. Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsev. 
  Following Butrus-Ghali's announcement, Vorontsev stormed out 
of the Security Council session saying that air strikes could 
not be launched without approval of the Security Council and 
that otherwise the U.N. would be directly involved in the 
Bosnian war on the Moslem side. 
  Senior reporters at U.N. headquarters say they have not seen 
such reaction from Russia since the time of the Cold War. 
  Vorontsev argued that although air support to U.N. troops on 
the ground was "the sacred duty" of the world organization, air 
strikes were something completely different because they would 
automatically draw the U.N. in war operations, not only in the 
air, but on the ground too. 
  The United Nations should decide whether it wants war or 
mediation and the Security Council should rule on this matter, 
said Vorontsev. 
  Those who support air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions 
maintain that the U.N. does not need special authorization of 
the Security Council to launch the strikes and invoke Resolution 
836 of June 8, 1993 to support their position. 
  Para 10 of Resolution 836 says that U.N. member-nations, 
individually or through regional organizations and arrangements, 
can undertake, under the authority of the Security Council and 
in close cooperation with the secretary-general and the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR), all the necessary measures, 
including the use of air power in and around the U.N.-designated 
"safe areas" in Bosnia- Herzegovina, to support UNPROFOR in 
carrying out its mandate. 
  A heated debate will probably ensue in the Security Council 
about the interpretation of this provision. 
  Butrus-Ghali and the majority of the council members believe 
that the provision gives them a free hand. The Russians, for 
their part, could come out with a counterargument that the word 
"authority" in the text stands for special approval of the 
Security Council, which could create an impasse. 
  Vorontsev's argument that it is completely wrong for the 
United Nations to become involved in the Bosnian war on the side 
of only one of the belligerents may finally prevail. "This is 
our position and we will strongly defend it," Vorontsev was 
categorical.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 19 (TANJUG) - Representatives of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic and the United Nations Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) reached a temporary agreement on Gorazde in Pale late 
on Tuesday [19 April] evening, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA 
reported. "The memorandum on temporary arrangements for 
Gorazde" calls for an end to combat actions around the town and 
the deployment of two UNPROFOR platoons with around 100 men. 
"Serbs agree that they immediately cease all combat activities 
in an area 3 km from central Gorazde on the left bank of the 
Drina, unless they are attacked," said the memorandum which was 
signed by Bosnian Serb Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik and 
UNPROFOR Civil administration Head Victor Andreyev.

  [Text] Belgrade, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- The office of Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, announced today 
that "the Serbian side has declared peace in Gorazde 
unilaterally, thus ending the crisis surrounding this town," 
SRNA has reported. "Under an agreement between the republic of 
Srpska authorities and the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR], a 
cease-fire on the Gorazde front comes into force immediately and 
UN troops will be able to enter Gorazde today. This will help 
the international humanitarian organizations to resume their 
work in the town," the statement says. 
  It is noted in the statement that the Serbian side's 
unilateral move is a republic of Srpska response to yesterday's 
declaration by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the position 
of U.S. President Bill Clinton on the crisis in Gorazde. "We 
appeal to the international community to put pressure on the 
Muslim side to make possible a resumption of the peace 
negotiations," the statement says, adding that the time has come 
for the Muslims to state clearly if they favor war or peace. 
  "The Muslim strategy of maintaining a state of neither war 
nor peace is a crime," the statement stresses and reminds the 
international community that the Serbs did not start the 
conflict in Gorazde, that they want a just agreement, but will 
not allow themselves to be dictated to.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 20 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader 
Radovan Karadzic early Wednesday [20 April] authorised the 
deployment of 100 UN troops in the beleagured Moslem enclave of 
Gorazde, Bosnian Serb radio said. The UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) "can from Wednesday morning deploy 100 soldiers in 
the part of the town situated on the left bank of the Drina" 
river, Karadzic announced. The authorisation came as part of a 
third ceasefire the Serb leader has negotiated with UN 
representatives in as many days. 
  The details of the agreement remain to be discussed with the 
United Nations special envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi 
Akashi, the radio quoted him as saying. Akashi has come under 
criticism from Bosnian Moslems after holding fruitless talks 
with Karadzic Sunday as Serb tanks poured into Gorazde, giving 
the Serbs virtual control of the town. 
  Karadzic said Wednesday that UN soldiers would be allowed to 
"protect the civilian population but not the Bosnian Army," Serb 
radio reported. "The aim of the Serb counter-offensive is not 
to take the town but only the right bank of the Drina which 
belongs to the Serbs," the Serb leader added. But relations 
between the Serbs and the military wing of the UN mission in 
Bosnia would remain suspended "because of the active role it is 
playing in the civil war." Reponsibility for the fighting 
around Gorazde rests with the United Nations, as "it has not 
disarmed the Moslem (Bosnian) army in a region that was supposed 
to be demilitarised," Karadzic argued. 
  The radio made no mention of the release by Bosnian Serb 
forces Tuesday of six out of eight teams of UN military 
observers that they had detained last week in retaliation for 
NATO airstrikes around Gorazde. The teams, comprising three to 
five people, were reported by the UN Tuesday to have been been 
freed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by </F>
Pavol Minarik; place and date not given: "Meciar's Opposition 
Criticizes the Government for Meeting the Czech Republic 
Halfway"] 
  [Text] [Minarik] Do you have the impression that, in 
connection with the approaching elections, some Slovak 
politicians are trying to play the Czech card in an unpleasant 
way? 
  [Kukan] Despite the short time in office, the new government 
is being strongly criticized by Meciar's opposition for 
allegedly being too willing to meet the Czech side halfway. I 
have participated in a meeting of the Customs Union Council, and 
I can only say that the treaty we concluded is a reasonable 
compromise. I believe that we will be able to find compromise 
solutions when solving other, more serious problems. It is very 
easy to bang the door when we have a dispute [allusion to 
Meciar's behavior]. However, the situation that follows may 
become a problem. In the election campaign, there certainly 
will be politicians who will try to show that we are making 
concessions to Prague. It is important for the current 
government Cabinet to have clean hands and a clear conscience 
and to show that it has never gambled with or bargained for 
Slovak interests. 
  [Minarik] A month ago, you became minister in the new Slovak 
Government. What are the priorities in the relations between 
Slovakia and the Czech Republic, in your opinion? 
  [Kukan] I do no like to speak about certain priorities 
because, in relations between the Slovak Republic and the Czech 
Republic, there should be as few controversial points as 
possible. Of course, we are interested in having as few 
disputes as possible because we should make use of the good 
things that united us in the past. In the world, we have gained 
respect for our civilized separation, and I am not sure whether 
we have presented this fact correctly at home. Certainly, it 
would be nice if we finally solved all of the problems linked to 
the division of the property of the former federation and closed 
the difficult chapter in our mutual relations. The property 
division is always the most difficult thing after a divorce. 
Here, we have a divorce of two countries that have been living 
together for several decades. You always need two sides to 
preserve good relations. This government is sincerely 
interested in good relations with the Czech Republic, as much as 
it is interested in the protection of the Slovak interests. I 
personally believe that it is possible. This does not have to 
be against the spirit of neighborly cooperation. 
  [Minarik] What about relations with Hungary, which have been 
a very sensitive issue in the Slovak Republic's foreign policy? 
Budapest was positive about the first steps of Moravcik's 
government, but.... 
  [Kukan] We really want the Slovak-Hungarian relations to be 
calm and reasonable, so that we might be able to discuss 
anything anytime. I believe there are certain problems that we 
will be able to sort out in the short period of time our 
government has available. However, this will require a sober, 
realistic, and reasonable attitude on the Hungarian side, too. 
We are not succumbing to the illusion that we will be able to 
very quickly sort out the problems there are between us. 
Moreover, in Hungary, parliamentary elections are to be held 
soon, in less than a month. Public opinion polls have shown 
that the government may change after the elections. We want to 
proceed in the same way, independently of who is in power in 
Budapest or Bratislava. Without hesitating too much, we have 
proposed a meeting on the readmission treaty, the temporary 
economic regime on the Danube, and other issues. 
  [Minarik] You were called on to assume the position of 
foreign minister when you were the Slovak Republic's ambassador 
to the UN in New York. How have your colleagues accepted this 
fact? 
  [Kukan] I was quite surprised when Prime Minister Jozef 
Moravcik phoned me with the proposal. However, I suspected that 
this could happen when the prime minister said, immediately 
after he had been appointed, that a professional diplomat should 
become foreign minister. I will be sincere: I liked it in New 
York; I felt like a fish in fresh water. You have situations in 
your life where it is impossible to say no to an offer. I have 
spent all my life in service abroad--30 years in the diplomatic 
service, and now I have a unique opportunity to look at the 
thing from a different angle. Despite the fact that I have been 
appointed to this function for the period of six months--that 
is, until the election in the fall--I consider it to be the 
culmination of my professional career as a diplomat. As regards 
my colleagues, they certainly were surprised to a certain 
extent. My Czech colleague Karel Kovanda was the first to 
congratulate me, even before I confirmed my decision to the 
prime minister. In the UN, this was not such a surprise. It is 
not unusual that some of the ambassadors become foreign 
ministers. 
  [Minarik] It was Knazko's Alliance of Democrats that 
proposed you for the position of foreign minister. What do you 
have in common with it? 
  [Kukan] I am not a member of the Alliance of Democrats or of 
any other party. According to the coalition agreement, every 
member has the right to propose the agreed-upon number of 
candidates to the government. They proposed me. 
  [Minarik] How does the United States, where you lived for 
four years, view Slovakia? What improves and what damages 
Slovakia's image? 
  [Kukan] The ordinary American does not know much about 
Slovakia. He can learn about Slovakia from the media when they 
report dramatic events. There does not have to be bloodshed, 
but it is always an event that is worth noticing. The reports 
usually have a negative rather than a positive flavor. This 
should not be regarded as bad intentions but as characteristic 
of many media sources. With the access to information they 
have, it is quite normal that they would notice the statements 
and steps of our politicians who are not the usual and the best 
ones. Not all of us realize that everything we do at home is 
being carefully watched abroad and that, logically, this has 
certain effects. This is why a well-considered domestic policy 
is the best foreign policy. I have found myself in humorous 
situations quite often. For example, Americans asked me whether 
they should travel to Bratislava or to some other place in 
Slovakia and whether the situation was safe there. Many confuse 
us with the former Yugoslavia. This is why we have to explain 
the very basic things about ourselves during various meetings 
and lectures.... 
  [Minarik] What is Slovakia's attitude toward the plan of 
French Prime Minister Balladur, according to which the change of 
borders could become the subject of talks between countries? 
  [Kukan] We must understand the Balladur plan in the wide 
context. I am not going to say it in a diplomatic way, but, at 
the beginning, this plan contained unacceptable conditions for 
Slovakia. For Slovakia, it is unacceptable to link the question 
of minorities to the change of borders. If we speak about 
stability in Europe, we cannot ignore the fact that stability 
does not depend exclusively on the status of ethnic minorities, 
but also on political, economic, and security links and matters. 
Since it first appeared, the idea of the Balladur plan has 
undergone certain development. The text of the pertinent treaty 
is still the subject of negotiations. We are aware of the fact 
that this is a matter for the European Twelve to discuss. I 
believe that the authors of the plan will accept some of our 
views. I believe that the resulting document will be acceptable 
for all, and there will be no losers and no winners.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with President Vaclav Havel by Petr </F>
Dudek in Litomysl on 16 April: "The Main Thing Is a Good 
Regional Atmosphere"] 
  [Text] The weekend [15-16 April] meeting involving seven 
presidents fulfilled the expectations of host Vaclav Havel "to 
the utmost" in several points. At a press briefing held after 
the departure of his counterparts, the president hailed, in 
particular, the congenial course of the in camera meetings. 
Vaclav Havel granted an interview to LIDOVE NOVINY immediately 
after the meeting. 
  [Dudek] Will the results of the Litomysl meeting manifest 
themselves in the everyday lives of citizens in Central Europe, 
or is this merely the start of a specific process and we will 
just have to wait for it to bear fruit? 
  [Havel] I do not think we have initiated a definite 
political process because the concept of a political process 
usually means the preparation of something--for example, a 
specific resolution, a declaration, a treaty, and so on. It is 
not a process in this sense; it is something else. It is, as I 
have already said several times, the creation or joint creation 
of a good regional atmosphere. The more politicians get to know 
one another, the more they exchange views, and the more often 
they meet, the better they see into each other's souls and thus 
create a more favorable environment for the political processes 
about which you are asking. 
  [Dudek] In Saturday's [16 April] debate, President Klestil 
commented that the opening of long impermeable borders has also 
brought certain problems--mass migration, for example. Is the 
Czech taxpayer prepared to bear part of the burden that 
migration may bring to the Central European region in the near 
future? 
  [Havel] Of course, migration may cause various problems, and 
it is causing them. Two tasks lie ahead of us. First, it is 
necessary to somehow regulate migration because certain 
countries may be prepared to a varying degree to accept 
refugees. Each of them must gauge its potential; it cannot open 
itself to everyone without limit. Not only the country's 
citizens, but also the refugees would be the worse for this. 
The second task is to remind our public again and again that 
there were times when hundreds of thousands of people fled from 
our country and found a warm reception in Switzerland, Canada, 
and many other countries. 
  The fundamental issue--I would say directly that it is an 
issue of universal solidarity--is that we must be capable here 
and there of taking in someone in need, someone fleeing from 
somewhere, especially if he is fleeing from armed conflict, 
poverty, and suffering. We must understand and somehow help 
him. It is impossible for us to keep on wanting someone to help 
us and be unable ourselves to help anyone and turn up our noses 
at those who are, at the moment, in a worse situation than we 
are. There were times when even we did not have it so good. 
  I admit that, following decades of total isolation, 
migration 
is a new phenomenon that our society is not used to. It may 
provoke all sorts of social tensions, but we must work on 
ourselves in this issue. 
  [Dudek] Do the Czechs still have the capacity to make 
sacrifices? Are we not at risk from the affluent indifference 
your counterpart Weizsaecker referred to in Litomysl in 
connection with the Germans? 
  [Havel] Thousands of the most multifarious good and bad 
traits slumber in the soul of society. We can be at risk from 
anything--good and bad. It is up to us which of our qualities 
we activate, which ones we rely on, which ones we develop, and 
for which ones we create favorable scope. 
  [Dudek] Western Europe, despite the fact that it officially 
recognizes the integration of East and Central Europe, remains, 
to put it mildly, hesitant about opening up its own markets. 
During your talks, did your partners from Germany and Austria 
show any sign of adopting a more accommodating stance? 
  [Havel] This was quite a topical subject, let us say, a year 
ago. It seems to me that the situation has improved a little 
since then--for example, certain quotas and restrictions applied 
by the Austrian side to our goods have gradually been removed. 
Our association agreement with the European Union is even 
asymmetrical in our favor. It seems to me that this 
protectionism is ceasing to be the most pressing problem. 
  Of course, it nevertheless holds true that all barriers 
should be removed more and as much as possible and that we 
should become part of a free economic environment. Allowance 
should also be made for our specific situation. Allowance 
should be made for the fact that our entire former--in essence, 
artificial--market has collapsed and, therefore, that we are in 
a more trying situation than other democratic countries that 
were not so completely tied to an abnormal market. 
  [Dudek] When will a settlement be reached in mutual 
Czech-German relations, as has already happened between Germany 
and Poland? What is preventing an honorable solution to this 
problem, a problem that is holding back Czech-German 
cooperation? Did you discuss this with President Weizsaecker? 
  [Havel] Of course, we discussed this. We discussed it 
privately, during unofficial occasions, at dinner, and so on. I 
would say two things about this. First, the impression is 
sometimes given that the two obstacles that lie between us, the 
Sudeten-German issue and compensation, have prevented good 
relations with Germany. There are a whole host of contacts and 
ties--political, economic, cultural, and others--and these two 
issues should be afforded the place commensurate to them. We 
should not, as sometimes happens, turn this situation into 
something more serious--more so on our side than on the German 
side--than it actually is. 
  Second, I personally feel that the situation will turn out 
well. After the German elections in particular, no matter who 
wins them, some of the issues that have hitherto been blocked 
will move forward very rapidly. 
  [Dudek] When I was following your debate on Saturday [16 
April], it seemed to me that this was a discussion among 
sovereign intellectuals. The meeting of intellectuals was 
supposed to begin on Sunday. Did you have a similar impression, 
and, if so, is this, in your opinion, in order? 
  [Havel] I do not know exactly how an intellectual is 
distinguished from a nonintellectual. For this reason, I cannot 
tell exactly which of the presidents present are intellectuals 
and which are not. The purpose of this meeting was not to 
resolve the specific political issues of the day but, rather, to 
ponder the longer-term issues, prospects, or problems. 
Understandably, the result of this was that the debate was 
perhaps more general and perhaps less dramatic than many a 
televised discussion. However, no one was obliged to watch it.

<F P=106> [LIDOVE NOVINY report: "The President's Denial"] </F>
  [Text] Prague--President Vaclav Havel asked LIDOVE NOVINY 
to publish the following statement: 
  It seems that the CTK reporter who provided information on 
the most recent "Conversations from Lany" did not listen to me 
at all. Otherwise, he could not have said that I supported the 
deputies' compromising draft for the election system to the 
senate, which had the large districts composed of three smaller 
ones. Most of the papers took on this information and came to 
various conclusions. I did not support such a proposal, and I 
cannot support it because I do not understand what the 
difference is between 81 electoral districts and 81 electoral 
districts associated into 27 larger ones. On the contrary, I 
said that I believed another draft to be more reasonable--that 
is, the one about which I had been informed by the deputies and 
that involves 27 electoral districts in which triple elections 
would be held on the basis of three independent lists of 
candidates. This would be a majority system, which would be 
different from the subsequent one in that three mandates would 
be won simultaneously in triple elections. 
  I am aware that those are details that are uninteresting for 
many readers. However, because I like order and precision, I 
have decided to react.

  [Text] According to Defense Minister Lajos Fur, the grave 
situation in Bosnia does not threaten Hungary's security. Gyula 
Horvath reports on Fur's visit to Hungarian military air traffic 
controllers. 
  [Horvath] The minister has said that from the military 
viewpoint the agreement we concluded at the beginning of 1992 
with the military leadership of Serbia and rump Yugoslavia has 
been successful. According to the direct link [name of the 
agreement], incursion into the 10-20 km border zone is 
prohibited and immediate contact must be established in the 
event of a possible border violation. This agreement has been 
working well since. 
  Therefore, should the Bosnian situation escalate even 
further, we will be able to preserve our present situation and 
security, Defense Minister Fur stressed. Answering a question, 
he noted that the AWACS planes using our country's airspace were 
only carrying out monitoring tasks and they did not assist the 
attacks by NATO aircraft.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Forowicz: "Poland-NATO; Breaking the </F>
Barriers"] 
  [Text] In the cooperation we have had so far between the 
Central European states and NATO, we have already reached the 
limits of efficiency, and we need more dynamic forms, said one 
of the speakers at a roundtable session in the Sejm. 
  Participating in the conference is a group of more than 10 
representatives of the North Atlantic Assembly, a 
political-advisory body of NATO, with Chairman Loice Bouverde, 
Secretary General Peter Corterier, Jose Pereira, head of the 
subcommittee on Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, and 
functionaries of the NATO apparatus. The numerous high-ranking 
officials include representatives of Belarus, Bulgaria, the 
Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Russian 
Federation, and Romania. Poland is represented by several Sejm 
deputies and senators, representatives of the Ministry of 
National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, teh Academy 
of National Defense, and others. 
  Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy underscored the expectations of 
Poland and, as it seems, of all interested states in our region, 
to enhance the guarantees of international security through 
cooperation with NATO. He also recalled the thesis that there 
is the possibility of various advancement in the construction of 
links, with the use of the platforms on which there are no 
longer any differences between us. "We appreciate the 
significance of the Partnership for Peace program. We will 
implement it. However, it does exhaust our political 
aspirations." 
  The roundtable discussion consists of three sessions. The 
first one presents "NATO's Perception of Future Relations With 
Central Europe," the second, "Perception of Central European 
States' Future Relations With NATO," and the third, "Prospects 
for Neutral and Nonaligned States." Hans Jochem Peters, head of 
the liaison section in the Political Affairs Department in NATO, 
pointed, among other things, to the importance that is being 
attached to the Partnership for Peace program. Vernon Penner, 
political adviser to the commander in chief of allied forces in 
Europe, posed the question of whether Poland and other states 
applying for membership in NATO are ready to share the burden of 
NATO's duties in resolving international problems. Later on, he 
added that "there are not many states such as Poland that 
thoroughly understand the entire issue." 
  Commander Ian Clapham, staff officer in the office of 
special 
adviser to the commander in chief of the organization in Europe, 
responsible for cooperation, characterized the state of contacts 
that have already been made. In 1993, the Central and East 
European states took part in 220 joint military activities with 
NATO. In 1994, there will be approximately 350 such 
initiatives. Among other activities, this October there are 
scheduled joint Polish-Czech-British-Dutch exercises of 
battalions in the Netherlands, the task of which will be to test 
the feasibility of cooperation in peacekeeping operations. 
  Cdr. Clapham reviewed the contacts to date on the so-called 
second level (the first level are talks and decisions among 
high-ranking politicians)--that is, experts, commanders in 
charge of maneuvers, participants in seminars and courses. He 
said that Slovakia had been given advice on how to organize 
rapid deployment forces; Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria were 
shown computer support of military exercises; various problems 
of the fleets of Albania and Bulgaria were jointly analyzed. He 
said that "the most substantive example of joint action" were 
the early-warning flights over Hungary in connection with the 
Balkan conflict. 
  The speakers characterized the main barriers to further 
cooperation. "In contacts with some partners, we have a trust 
gap," it was generally agreed. In the case of members of CIS, a 
certain problem would be the different plans to transform 
military structures--some of them are being changed quite 
significantly, others have preserved a typically Soviet 
structure. Another problem is the knowledge of Western 
languages; in Poland, only 200 officers speak such languages, 
whereas there should be at least several times as many. 
However, there are also states in the East in which this can be 
said of only a few dozen officers. Important problems are also 
distances--for example, between Kazakhstan and NATO 
Headquarters, as well as the poor communications network. 
  However, generally speaking, "the possibilities for passive 
cooperation are petering out. We have reached the limits of 
efficiency in this form of cooperation. We must enhance the 
clarity, raise the level of trust, and grant greater assistance 
to your states in the establishment of Armed Forces that are an 
element of democracy," said I. Clapman.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 18 April "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- "BSP Wants More Than 
Half of Ministries for Itself" (OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK), "BSP 
Expects Prime Minister To Make Personnel and Structural Changes" 
(DUMA), "Communists Give Week to Prime Minister Berov" 
(DEMOKRATSIYA), "BSP Gives Prime Minister Berov 7 Days To 
Overhaul Cabinet" (24 CHASA), "Socialists Demand From Prime 
Minister Berov Scapegoats for Corridor" (TRUD) -- these are 
samples of the headlines capping reports on yesterday's 
extraordinary sitting of the former Communists' Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP) Executive Bureau. 
  The Socialists gave Prime Minister Berov a week's time to 
make his proposals for structural and personnel changes in the 
cabinet, BSP's DUMA daily says. This is the deadline given the 
principled differences displayed and unpopular action taken by 
the cabinet during the prime minister's sick leave, this daily 
goes on to say quoting BSP spokesman Nikolay Kamov. Yesterday's 
conference was "another reminder that what the Socialists look 
for is more pragmatism and a stronger political instinct", DUMA 
says in a signed commentary. The demand for replacing 70 
percent of the ministers comes to show that the Socialists are 
well aware of the incumbent cabinet's inefficiency, the private 
OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK says commenting on this matter. "Even the 
unprejudiced can now see that the Socialists played a political 
action about the convoy issue (the request for transit of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]-bound UN 
equipment via Bulgaria,)" reads a signed commentary in this 
daily. "The Socialists are now about to play their trump-card 
and push Prime Minister Berov to the wall where he should either 
accept the condition for cabinet changes or step down," the 
commentary goes. 
  A protest rally yesterday in Sofia burned Uncle Sam's 
top-hat 
taken as a symbol of the U.S. foreign policy, DUMA reports. 
Several hundred people chanted "Peace in the Balkans!" and 
"Yankees out!" in protest against the cabinet and parliament's 
decisions to grant a Bulgarian corridor for UN military 
equipment and against the Balkan policy of the United States, 
NATO and the United Nations. "BSP once again showed that the 
national concern is nothing but a mask covering its commitment 
to Moscow and to Moscow's servants in Belgrade," DEMOKRATSIYA 
says commenting on the BSP leaders' decision to demand that the 
cabinet make detailed account for its decision to endorse the 
transit of UN equipment and that President Zhelyu Zhelev offer 
an explanation for his failure to inform the Consultative 
Council on National Security about the UN request. After the 
attempt at ruling this country without a cabinet, the only way 
out for Bulgaria is the salvage policy of the Union of the 
Democratic Forces (SDS), this commentary says further. A story 
on this matter in STANDART NEWS quotes Defence Minister Valentin 
Aleksandrov as saying "a greater number of blue helmets in 
Macedonia gives more guarantees for Bulgaria's security". The 
dissent on the transit seriously damaged confidence within the 
cabinet and the parties of the parliamentary majority, TRUD 
says. BSP's demands were coordinated with other parliamentary 
factions, this daily says quoting the BSP spokesman. [passage

<F P=106> [From BTA's 20 April "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, April 20 (BTA) -- The government's future 
prospects following demands for its complete overhaul by two 
parliamentary groups -- the biggest one, of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP), and of the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms, dominate the dailies. 
  "L. Berov Hasn't Got Hepatitis But Was Isolated 
Deliberately" 
runs a front-page headline in DUMA, the BSP daily. It quotes a 
knowledgeable source of the hospital in which the prime minister 
is being treated as saying that "since last Thursday [14 April] 
there have been no medical reasons whatsoever to keep him in 
quarantine". He definitely has not got hepatitis, the whole 
affair was either deliberately provoked or resulted from 
doctors' incompetence, the source said. On March 11 Prime 
Minister Lyuben Berov had a quadruple bypass operation following 
heart failure and on April 13 the government Press Office 
announced Berov had been hospitalized with hepatitis symptoms. 
According to DUMA, in the middle of last week blood tests ruled 
out hepatitis, while the tests that are being done in Germany 
are part of the stalling and suspense tactics. Government 
sources commented that Berov is well aware of the political 
intrigues over his condition as well as of the imprudent and 
foolish steps taken by some cabinet ministers in his absence. 
The prime minister intends to resume his duties later this week. 
His hepatitis is "political", according to a signed article in 
DUMA. It also says that the Socialists strongly insist that "the 
reform and the new composition of the cabinet should reflect the 
political weight of the parties as judged by the electorate". 
  DEMOKRATSIYA calls Berov's illness "diplomatic jaundice". 
Quoting reliable sources, the daily of the Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS) says "the motive behind the whole affair was to 
allow Berov to trifle with his patrons and stall the cabinet 
overhaul". 
  In an interview on national radio this morning Health 
Minister Tancho Gugalov denied these allegations by saying that 
to his knowledge the prime minister's illness had not been 
contrived for some purpose. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP), which supports the government, asked 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov for cabinet changes and for a new 
programme by May 15. After a meeting of the top leadership of 
the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS), on 
whose mandate the present government was formed in late 1992, it 
announced the DPS would insist that the government be overhauled 
completely. The opposition Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) 
calls for the government's resignation and for early 
parliamentary elections. The SDS will not move for a vote of no 
confidence in the cabinet pending debates on a question about 
the government's financial policy posed by MPs of the SDS. 
Today's meetings of the three major political forces showed 
they are readying for elections. The SDS discussed principles 
of selecting candidates. The DPS is likely to run on a separate 
list in the next elections. 
  Meanwhile, BSP leader Zhan Videnov and DPS leader Ahmed 
Dogan 
visited the prime minister who is working in hospital. "The 
prime minister's condition admits of political activity," 
Videnov said. According to Dogan, Prime Minister Berov, who 
underwent heart surgery over a month ago and is now in hospital 
after developing hepatitis symptoms, is in a very good state of 
health. 
  Videnov said the prime minister had promised to hold two 
rounds of meetings with the major political forces to discuss 
cabinet changes. The Socialist leader told the press today that 
cabinet changes should be made with a view to three main goals: 
Bulgaria's international financial stabilization, industrial 
restructuting and de-escalating tensions in the army and the 
law-enforcement authorities. 
  Critical views on the government prevail in the DPS and it 
will insist on a complete overhaul. The land reform and 
privatization are the major points of its criticism. According 
to Osman Oktay MP of the DPS, the movement has not drawn up a 
list of new cabinet members. [passage omitted] 
  Stefan Sofiyanski, deputy chairman of the leadership of the 
SDS, said it was absurd to demand of "a sick person under 
quarantine to form a new cabinet" and added that this pressure 
comes from the BSP. The SDS will wait for the interpellation on 
the cabinet's financial policy to enter the debating chamber and 
if the draft resolution criticising this policy is voted down 
than it will consider moving a no-confidence vote. According to 
Sofiyanski, it would be impossible for a no-confidence vote to 
take place before parliament's Easter recess. So far the SDS 
has moved five no-confidence votes which were defeated. 
  George Ganchev, leader of the extraparliamentary Bulgarian 
Business Bloc, told journalists today that the Premier would 
resign by the end of the week. He cited a "firsthand source" 
without naming it.

  [Text] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- "Bulgarian President 
Zhelyu Zhelev described as dangerous the speculations of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], of its leaders and the 
BSP-controlled print media, by which the differences between the 
civil and the military leaderships of the Bulgarian Army on one 
of the problems of the military reform are twisted and fanned up 
artificially. Guided by its narrow partisan interests, for more 
than two years the BSP has been intriguing and creating tensions 
and uncertainty among the army's personnel thus destabilizing 
it," says a press release of the Presidency received at BTA. 
  "Holding a majority in parliament, this political force 
determined the budget of the Bulgarian Army and now is shunning 
the problems arising in connection with the support of the armed 
forces, the maintenance of the combat readiness of their 
equipment and the continuation of the military reform," the 
press release says. "The leaders and the print media of the BSP 
have been grossly manipulating the public, telling blatant lies 
about the army's actual problems and the president's confidence 
in the military. Any insinuations about 'purges' in the army 
and some 'campaign launched to purge its officer cadre' are an 
outright attempt to intimidate the officers and win advantageous 
election positions," the document goes on to say. 
  "It is irresponsible to try to seek solution to the problems 
of the military reform outside the Ministry of Defence and the 
Council of Ministers, shifting the responsibility for it 
entirely upon parliament and the president", the President's 
Press Office says in its release. 
  "As it is in all other spheres of public life, the reform in 
the army faces some objective difficulties further aggravated by 
the general crisis in the country. The president of Bulgaria 
and the supreme commander in chief of its armed forces is 
convinced that the command of the Bulgarian Army will not yield 
to such political provocations and speculations and will be 
guided only by the interests of Bulgaria and its national 
security in all their activities," the press release says in 
conclusion.

<F P=106> [Threat for Macedonia Is Myth, Bulgarian Socialists Say" -- </F>
BTA headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- It was a wrong decision 
that turned positive, former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist 
Party (BSP) leader Zhan Videnov said at a news conference, 
commenting on parliament's decision as to the transit of 
Macedonia-bound UN equipment via Bulgaria. According to Mr. 
Videnov, the positive thing about the decision was that it 
clearly stated it set no precedent and should not be repeated. 
  BSP deputy floor leader Nikolay Kamov voiced his concern 
over 
statements made by representatives of the Union of the 
Democratic Forces (SDS) which, according to Mr. Kamov, did not 
rule out the possibility for once again taking this decision. 
"The SDS refuse to firmly state that they are against the 
passage of foreign military troops via Bulgaria's territory," 
Mr. Videnov also said. According to him, it is dangerous for 
this country to think that a series of single acts leave its 
stand unchanged. If approached again with this request, we are 
most likely to again say "yes," the BSP leader said. 
  According to Mr. Videnov, the great powers now see the 
conflict in former Yugoslavia as a global, religious-based one. 
The processes in the Balkans cannot be a concern for the great 
powers only. Serbia-Montenegro is not hostile to Macedonia 
[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and this (that 
Macedonia's security is jeopardized) is a myth certain political 
forces in Bulgaria have created to justify their actions, 
according to the BSP leader. 
  The Socialists have not yet taken an official stand on the 
decision of the Russian Duma to demand lifting of the 
Yugo-embargo, Klara Marinova of the BSP told the news conference.

<F P=106> [BTA headlines: "Socialist Leader Videnov: "Yugo-Sanctions </F>
Proved Utterly Ineffective and Hit Harder Serbia and 
Montenegro's Neighbours"] 
  [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- Zhan Videnov, leader of 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), said he is supportive of 
the idea of an all-Balkan initiative to lift UN sanctions 
against rump Yugoslavia, speaking to the press after a regular 
BSP news conference today. In his view, the Balkan countries 
should call for a change in the status quo but not for a 
complete and sharp lifting of the sanctions as suggested by 
Serbia and Greece. "It is not proper to claim that the Balkan 
countries or Bulgaria are ready to tolerate indefinitely the 
current state of affairs, linking it to a so far unclear 
positive effect on the peace process in the former Yugoslavia," 
Videnov said. He believes that "Bulgaria cannot uphold a view 
that in April 1994 the embargo is a strong peace factor in the 
Balkans." He said he objected to Bulgaria's positive official 
view on the embargo rather than to its commitment to enforce it. 
During his unofficial visit to Bulgaria on Sunday, Vladislav 
Jovanovic, foreign minister of Serbia and Montenegro, also 
called for the lifting of the sanctions as "a road to the 
peaceful settlement of the Yugo-conflict." After his meeting 
with Jovanovic, Bulgaria's Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov 
said Bulgaria would continue enforcing the sanctions despite the 
great damage it has suffered. 
  Zhan Videnov believes that the sanctions could be lifted 
partly by allowing transit transport across Serbia and 
Montenegro, to which the international community has become 
reconciled according to him. This has not materialized because 
Bulgaria has not been importunate, so the embargo has cost it 
several billion dollars, Videnov said. According to him, the 
United Nations should take a decision at last to grant passage 
to escorted Bulgarian convoys through Serbia and Montenegro. 
Videnov drew an analogy between this and the decision taken by 
Bulgarian Parliament last Friday to allow UN equipment granted 
by the U.S. Government to cross Bulgaria into Macedonia, where 
it will be used by the UN Protection Force. The BSP voted 
against, arguing that Bulgaria had clearly declared itself in 
favour of non-involvement in the conflict in the former 
Yugoslavia. The other parliamentary forces, President Zhelyu 
Zhelev and the government stated that granting the convoy a 
single passage would contribute to Macedonia's security, and 
therefore to Bulgaria's security, and would not run counter to 
the basic principles of Bulgaria's Balkan policy. 
  The Socialist leader assumes that the UN blue helmets in 
Macedonia are the prelude to U.S. military bases on its 
territory. "The whole affair is under the UN aegis but 
genetically it is not related to the UN," Videnov said. 
According to him, Macedonia has the sovereign right to decide 
together with the United States or any other country how to 
guarantee its national security. "What worries me is the 
likelihood of revival of the logic of cordons, blocs and axes in 
the Balkans, the likelihood of keeping the peace in the Balkans 
through foreposts of great powers or military alliances," the 
socialist leader said.

  [Text] Sofia, April 16 (BTA) -- Several more MP's of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) are expected to join the 
independent Civil Alliance for the Republic (GOR) next week, 
according to GOR leader Alexandur Tomov. Then it will be clear 
if their number is sufficient to form a new faction. Even if no 
BSP MP's join GOR, a programme will be worked out for joint 
action in parliament. This has been necessited by the last vote 
in parliament on allowing UN equipment to pass through Bulgaria, 
said Tomov. GOR believes parliament's approval of the UN 
transit is in the national interest and is consistent with what 
MP's said earlier. It is not a prelude to or a sign of a 
mitigation of the stand against any passage via Bulgaria of 
armed peacekeepers from Balkan states that may be involved in 
the Yugoconfllct. Tomov will maintain this position during his 
upcoming visit to Turkey. Tomov coordinated his opinion with 
Bulgaria's formal position, and this was probably on the agenda 
of his meeting today with President Zhelev.

  [Text] Sofia, April 17 (Andrey Sharkov of BTA) -- The 
lifting of sanctions on Yugoslavia would lead to a peaceful 
settlement of the Yugoconflict, visiting Yugoslav Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic told journalists here today. 
Jovanovic arrived on a brief informal visit to Sofia from 
Athens yesterday. A Yugoslav foreign minister was last in Sofia 
in 1993. 
  Jovanovic and his Bulgarian counterpart Stanislav Daskalov 
today discussed some alarming aspects of the situation in the 
Balkans. Peace was very close several times last and this year 
but was sabotaged by Muslims (in Bosnia) and their foreign 
patrons, Jovanovic said after the meeting. Bulgaria and 
Yugoslavia are equally interested in a peaceful, fair settlement 
of the conflict. I believe bilateral relations will go ahead at 
full speed after lifting the sanctions; it would be in the 
interest of the two countries and of peace and security in the 
region, Jovanovic also told the press. 
  No one ever proved Yugoslavia is to blame for the war in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, said the Yugoslav foreign minister. The 
sanctions create a favourable climate for the emergence of 
extremist ideologies not only in the Balkans, according to 
Jovanovic. Meeting with Daskalov, he emphasized the importance 
of joint action in support of lifting the sanctions. Bulgaria 
so far has not committed itself to participation in such action 
but the sanctions have inflicted heavy losses on it and it is 
interested in their ending, said the Yugoslav guest. The two 
ministers discussed a proposal by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos 
Papoulias for three Balkan states, including Bulgaria, to urge 
the UN to lift the sanctions. Expressing the Bulgarian stand, 
Daskalov said that Bulgaria will abide by the UN Secuirty 
Council resolutions despite damage to its economy. 
  During their informal talks, that lasted for nearly three 
hours, Daskalov and Jovanovic discussed the issue of Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and stands 
of its neighbours. The Bulgarian proposal for Macedonia's 
neighbours to issue a joint declaration recognizing that 
republic's borders and announcing the lack of any territorial 
claims, cannot be carried out at this stage, said Daskalov after 
the meeting. The Yugoslav foreign minister said Macedonia faced 
no threat from its neighbour to the north (Yugoslavia) but quite 
a few things needed yet to be done to establish goodneighbourly 
bilateral relations. 
  The two foreign ministers differed on the issue of the 
Bulgarian minority in the Western Outlands (in Yugoslavia, 
former Bulgarian territories taken away under the 1919 Treaty of 
Neuilly). According to Daskalov, the rights of this minority 
are not strictly observed whereas Jovanovic said no rights 
violations have been recorded. The hardships ensuing from the 
sanctions, however, are forcing the Yugoslav authorities to 
curtail the rights not only of minorities but of all the people, 
the Yugoslav foreign minister told the press. In such cases, 
efforts are being made to compensate the minorities with 
exraordinary measures, he said. 
  The autonomous region of Kosovo is not a party to the 
Yugoconflict, the Yugoslav guest told the press conference. 
Separatism, fueled by Albania, was kindled there long before the 
Bosnian conflict, he said. According to the Yugoslav minister, 
a spillover of the war into Kosovo should not be feared. 
  The Yugoslav foreign minister assessed the Bulgarian policy 
on the Yugoconflict as objective. According to him, Bulgaria 
placed the three warring parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina on an 
equal footing. The transit of equipment for UN peacekeepers in 
Macedonia via Bulgaria is consistent with Bulgaria's stand of 
non-intervention in the Yugowar, as there is no war in 
Macedonia, said Jovanovic. (The Bulgarian Parliament appproved 
such a transit on April 15). Yugoslavia, however, takes a 
negative view of the military presence in Macedonia because of 
Skopje's unsupported claims of "a danger from the north," he 
said. No conflict exists between Macedonia and Yugoslavia; 
Macedonia is not facing any danger from the north and never has, 
the Yugoslav diplomat emphasized.

  [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- Arriving on an official 
visit here last night, today Germany's Vice Chancellor and 
Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel had talks with 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. They considered 
bilateral relations and a range of international problems. Mr. 
Kinkel familiarized Mr. Daskalov with the European Union's 
efforts to put an end to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. 
They also discussed the situation in Russia and 
Bulgarian-Russian relations. 
  "I had the opportunity to emphasize the importance we attach 
to Bulgaria and our willingness to help it solve its problems, 
ensuing mainly from the disintegration of the ex-Soviet market 
and the Yugo-embargo, "Mr. Kinkel told the media later. The 
sides discussed Bulgaria's foreign debt, a problem which Mr. 
Kinkel believes has been recently settled. Mr. Kinkel and Mr. 
Daskalov made a review of Bulgaria's relations with a number of 
international organizations, such as the European Union, the 
Western European Union, the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade organization, NATO, and the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development, and its desire to get integrated 
with them. "Bulgaria can rely on Germany's support in this 
respect," Minister Kinkel stressed. "Klaus Kinkel's message is 
that Germany has supported Bulgaria and always will but, 
naturally, to become more attractive we should accelerate the 
reform," the Bulgarian foreign minister said after the meeting. 
  "Our bilateral relations are not purely bilateral because 
they are maintained through the European Union in part," Foreign 
Minister Stanislav Daskalov said. 
  At the talks with his German counterpart, Minister Daskalov 
raised the visa problem. Bulgaria expects that Germany will 
relax its visa regulations. However, the Bulgarian foreign 
minister told the media that this was a delicate issue and 
resolving it would take time. 
  The Bulgarian side raised the question of considering the 
possibilities for more active German investments in Bulgaria. 
It requested assistance for the promotion of relations with the 
organization which would succeed Cocom [Coordinating Committee 
for Multilateral Export Controls] and for the allocation of more 
funds to Bulgaria within the framework of the Operation PHARE 
[Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] 
Programme. Asked what the German side insisted on, Minister 
Daskalov said that it requested "to continue reforms in Bulgaria 
despite the difficulties and pursue a foreign policy that will 
create no problems." 
  "Bulgaria's debt to the former German Democratic Republic 
has 
not been discussed," Minister Daskalov said in reply to a 
reporter's question. "Experts will continue, on a bilateral 
basis, the talks opened in 1991 and I hope that we will be able 
to find some compromising solution to the problem," Mr. Daskalov 
said. Bulgaria is indebted to the former GDR, but the German 
side has unilaterally cancelled a number of transactions 
concluded with this country. Describing the dispute as quite 
serious, he said that both Bulgaria and Germany should show 
flexibility.
