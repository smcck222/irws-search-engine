  [Excerpts] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- Arriving on an 
official visit here last night, today Germany's Vice-Chancellor 
and Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel had talks with 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. They considered 
bilateral relations and a range of international problems. 
[passage omitted] 
  Later today Mr. Kinkel was received by President Zhelyu 
Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and 
Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. He discussed the state 
of Bulgarian-German relations and assured the president, Mr. 
Yordanov and Mr. Matinchev of Germany's support for Bulgaria's 
efforts to carry out economic reform. He also assured them that 
Germany would ratify Bulgaria's Association Agreement with the 
European Union before the election of a new Bundestag. Mr. 
Kinkel told President Zhelev that Germany would continue helping 
Bulgaria settle its foreign debt, including its trade deficit 
with what was formerly East Germany, the president's spokesman 
said. 
  "Because of its unification, Germany can understand 
Bulgaria's problems better than any other West European 
country," Mr. Kinkel told Mr. Matinchev, stressing that Germany 
would advocate Bulgaria's bid for closer ties with the European 
structures. At his meeting with Parliament Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov, Mr. Kinkel said that at the beginning of democratic 
reform Bulgaria had been among the leaders in Eastern Europe but 
now it is lagging behind. "Bulgaria now needs classical private 
economic contacts," Mr. Kinkel told Mr. Matinchev who informed 
him of the government's economic policy and the progress of 
privatization and the land reform. At his meeting with 
President Zhelev the guest pledged his assistance in attracting 
German investment. 
  Saying that he would not like to interfere in Bulgaria's 
internal affairs, Mr. Kinkel told the National Assembly chairman 
he hoped that parliament would allow the UNPROFOR [United 
Nations Protection Force] convoy through Bulgaria into Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. Later on 
parliament granted passage. At his meeting with the president 
Mr. Kinkel highly praised the decision, the president's 
spokesman said.

  [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- The official visit here of 
German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel ended 
this afternoon. 
  At a press conference before his departure for Hungary Mr. 
Klaus Kinkel said his talks in Sofia were fruitful and focused 
mainly on bilateral relations, Bulgaria's striving to 
integration with the European structures and the situation in 
the former Yugoslavia. This morning Mr. Kinkel had talks with 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and was received 
by President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. 
Mr. Kinkel invited the Bulgarian foreign minister to visit 
Germany. "Mr. Kinkel's visit has inspired us with fresh hope in 
our striving to integration with the European structures and 
with courage to push with the economic reform", said Bulgarian 
Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. 
  "Germany wishes to help Bulgaria on its difficult road of 
reform", German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said. He 
specified, however, that this may be help for self help. Mr. 
Kinkel said the same in Albania. "As a friend I would like to 
advise Bulgaria to make itself more attractive". Mr. Kinkel 
said. He added that Germany would continue its support for 
Bulgaria, as well as for the Central European states, especially 
after June 1, when it will take over the presidency of the 
European Union. Bulgaria may count on Germany's support in its 
striving to integration with the European Union, GATT, NATO and 
the organization to succeed the Cocom [Coordination Committee 
For Multilateral Export Controls], as well as in the 
establishment of relations of association with the Western 
European Union. 
  Mr. Kinkel discussed in Sofia the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia and in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosovo in particular. "It is necessary 
for Serbian suppression measures to cease there", Mr. Kinkel 
said, stressing the solutions offered by the peace plan which 
would also affect Kosovo. German Foreign Minister Kinkel 
believes that a solution should be found to the disputes between 
Macedonia and Greece and that Greece should lift the embargo it 
has imposed on Macedonia. In Sofia Mr. Kinkel also discussed 
the events in Gorazde. "Serbian attacks on Gorazde are 
unacceptable", the German foreign minister said. He added that 
the solution depends to a great extent on Russian influence on 
the Serbs.

  [Text] Sofia, April 16 (BTA) -- No political conditions 
were set to Bulgaria at the negotiations with the Paris Club of 
government creditors to reschedule the Bulgarian foreign debt, 
Dimiter Kostov, first deputy finance minister and member of 
Bulgaria's negotiating team, told the Bulgarian National 
Television weekly show Panorama. The Bulgarian delegation and 
the creditors reached an agreement consistent with the nation's 
short and medium- term interests, he said. 
  The agreement provides for rescheduling the Bulgarian debt 
over 11 years, with a seven-year grace period. It is a little 
better than earlier ones and has a key role in the 
implementation of international financial institutions' 
financial support programme and for the settlement of the 
Bulgarian debt to private creditor banks, the official said. 
  The finalization of the deal with Bulgaria's private 
creditors (the London Club) began in Frankfurt this week, Kostov 
recalled. The meeting in Frankfurt was attended by 63, or 
actually all German banks, he said. 
  At this time debt-for-equity swaps cannot be discussed, 
Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev told the same show. 
The government is expected to consider an ordinance Karabashev 
is sponsoring regulating the use of foreign-debt bonds in 
privatization. The details will most likely be discussed at a 
meeting next Thursday, he said. 
  The agreement with the International Monetary Fund on April 
11 to support Bulgaria's economic reform programme includes a 
Systemic Transformation Facility that would help the government 
effect mass privatization, close down money-losers and 
streamline state-run companies, said Karabashev.

  [Text] Sofia, April 15 (BTA) -- The final version of a 
draft agreement on the restructuring of Bulgaria's debt to its 
commercial creditors was presented in Frankfurt today, national 
radio said. Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov, head of the 
Bulgarian delegation to the talks, and Deutsche Bank Director 
Peter Tilch, coordinator of the London Club of commercial 
bankers, today briefed the press on the key parameters of the 
draft agreement, radio correspondent Aleksandur Vladkov reported 
from Frankfurt. Bulgaria's debt to the London Club totals $8,700 
million, of which about $2,000 million in arrears of interest. 
25 percent of the debt is repayable in the short term. About 
$850 million are to be paid in debt service by the end of 1994. 
  "So far the European Union, G-24, the IMF and the World Bank 
have promised and will extend about $1,000 million," Aleksandrov 
said, "so that, thanks to the international financial and 
economic institutions, Bulgaria will be in a position to make 
these payments." According to Mr. Tilch, there are different 
options for the implementation of the deal, guaranteeing 
Bulgaria at least 36 percent debt reduction. Depending on the 
choice of option -- repurchasing of debt, re-investment by 
foreign creditors, etc. 
  Bulgaria could get a debt reduction of over 50 percent, Mr. 
Tilch said. It is too early to cite an exact figure because it 
is not known which option will be chosen by the 400-odd banks. 
  "We wish to establish a lasting presence in business with 
Bulgaria and will act accordingly. In its present version the 
agreement is a real breakthrough in the complicated foreign debt 
problem. I hope that by the end of May you will have settled 
all technicalities. A long-term agreement with Bulgaria would 
greatly encourage financial and industrial circles showing 
interest in investing in Bulgaria", Deutsche Bank director told 
national radio. On his part Finance Minister Aleksandrov 
expressed satisfaction with the outcome of three years of 
negotiations and observed that this was the Bulgarian 
Government's most important task in the foreign economic field. 
Mr. Aleksandrov noted the special understanding shown by the 
international financial institutions for Bulgaria's present 
problems which has found expression in the credits they have 
extended. "The rest remains with us -- to step up the economic 
reform and above all privatization," Finance Minister 
Aleksandrov said. 
  Two days ago Bulgaria reached an agreement on the debt to 
its 
official creditors of the Paris Club.

  [Text] Sofia, April 19 (of BTA) -- Sweden's Foreign 
Minister Ms. Margaretha af Ugglas today arrived on an official 
visit in Sofia. This is the first visit a Swedish foreign 
minister is paying to this country since 1985. Ms. Ugglas and 
her Bulgarian counterpart later today are expected to sign an 
agreement on reciprocal protection and promotion of investments. 
  "We want to strengthen and intensify the relations between 
our two countries," Ms. Ugglas said upon her arrival at Sofia 
Airport. "I am very pleased that I am the second Swedish 
minister who comes to Bulgaria this year and I think this is a 
good sign of increasing relations," she also said, referring to 
a January 1994 visit by the Swedish defence minister. 
  Immediately after her arrival here Ms. Margaretha af Ugglas 
met Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. 
  European integration was high on the agenda of the meeting, 
the Swedish Foreign Minister said after having met Foreign 
Minister Daskalov. "Sweden sees Bulgaria as an important 
partner in building the new Europe. I congratulated Bulgaria 
for the agreement with the IMF. It means that Swedish balance 
of payments support will now be freed and within the framework 
of the G-24 there will be 20 million dollars in credits for 
Bulgaria from Sweden and there will probably come another 6 
million U.S. dollars also in credits. I also thanked the 
Bulgarian foreign minister for the fact that Bulgaria, in spite 
of the heavy burden, is respecting the UN sanctions against 
former Yugoslavia. I told my colleague that Sweden is going the 
contribute 2.5 million Swedish kronor to help improve the 
checkpoints of the border crossings between Bulgaria and 
Romania. That is a new Swedish contribution in the effort to 
help the countries that are respecting the UN sanctions," Ms. 
Ugglas said. 
  Asked to comment on the failure of the international 
community's efforts in Bosnia, Ms. Ugglas said it was very 
tragic. "Now there has to be a very determined joined effort on 
the part of the United States, the European Union and Russia. 
There has been too many conflicting signals and now it is very 
important to move together," the Swedish foreign minister said 
on this matter. 
  "I am very pleased with the talks because Sweden's support 
is 
essential for the reforms in Bulgaria. There are no open issues 
in bilateral aspect, on the contrary: Sweden is a country which 
supports Bulgaria in different spheres, including the settlement 
of our foreign debt, which it does through sharing in the 
financing within the framework of the G-24. Sweden is ready to 
help this country cope with the difficulties arising from the 
Yugocrisis through contributing to funds aimed to improve the 
infrastructure along the Bulgarian-Romanian border. Sweden is 
also ready to open export credit lines and to train Bulgarian 
blue helmets, as it has longstanding traditions in this sphere. 
It is ready to help Bulgaria get integrated into the European 
Union," Foreign Minister Daskalov said for his part. He also 
said he was invited to pay an official visit to Sweden. 
  The Swedish guest this afternoon is expected to meet 
President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur 
Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. The 
Bulgarian and Swedish foreign ministers will call a news 
conference this evening.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- The signing of an 
agreement on reciprocal protection and promotion of investments 
was the last item on the agenda of the official visit of 
Sweden's Foreign Minister Ms. Margaretha af Ugglas. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Swedish guest this afternoon was received in turn by 
National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Acting Prime 
Minister Evgeni Matinchev, and President Zhelyu Zhelev in turn. 
Bilateral relations and the situation in the Balkans and former 
Yugoslavia in particular were in the focus of all meetings. 
  The Yugo-conflict was high on the agenda of Ms. Ugglas' 
meeting with Dr. Zhelev who briefed the guest on Bulgaria's 
stand on this matter, said a presidential spokesman who had 
attended the meeting. Asked by Ms. Ugglas what he thinks could 
provide an outcome for the crisis, President Zhelev said that 
what the United Nations have done to date in former Yugoslavia 
is good but the actions seem to be lacking in determination. 
Answering a question about Russia's role in the conflict and 
Turkey's intentions to send blue helmets to Bosnia, Dr. Zhelev 
reiterated this country's principled position for noninvolvement 
of Balkan countries in the conflict and went on to say that with 
their involvement Russia and Turkey added fuel to the 
hostilities between Christians and Muslims. Ms. Ugglas 
appreciated in highly positive terms Bulgaria's policy on the 
Yugo-conflict and commitment to the UN resolutions. Dr. Zhelev 
asked Ms. Ugglas to extend his invitation for a visit to this 
country to Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf. 
  Ms. Ugglas' meetings with Aleksandur Yordanov and Evgeni 
Matinchev highlighted the issue of granting compensations for 
the embargo-related losses this country is sustaining. Mr. 
Matinchev thanked the guest for Sweden's support in overcoming 
the consequences Bulgaria's economy has suffered, as well as for 
its help within the framework of the G-24. 
  After the signing of the agreement the Bulgarian and Swedish 
foreign ministers called a news conference, where they described 
the visit as an important step toward activating the bilateral 
contacts in all spheres. Most of the questions to the Swedish 
foreign minister pertained to Sweden's upcoming joining the 
European Union.

  [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- At a press conference 
tonight [19 April] at the end of the official visit here of 
Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas, the Bulgarian and 
the Swedish foreign ministers were asked to comment on the 
latest events in Gorazde. 
  "We cannot but be concerned by the developments in Gorazde. 
We believe that these events have greatly harmed the peace 
process and now the international community should be extremely 
careful in deciding on its future steps in order to return the 
three sides back to the table of talks", Bulgarian Foreign 
Minister Stanislav Daskalov said. He recalled the declaration 
of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry of April 12, 1994 which says 
that the reaction of the international community under UN aegis 
in Bosnia is an expression of its determination to do everything 
possible for enforcing the respective UN resolutions in defence 
of the safe zones and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] personnel 
and that this reaction is a signal to the warring sides in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to start active negotiations for halting the 
conflict. 
  Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas said: "The 
authority of the United Nations has been questioned in an 
unexpected way and what was gained in the agreements around 
Sarajevo is beginning to unravel. I think that the United 
States, the EU [European Union] and Russia should decide 
together on a course of action, that it is extremely important 
that this be a joint effort. Certainly the United Nations have 
to act with great determination to get the parties back to 
negotiations.

<F P=106> [Report by Andrey Sharkov] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- The 19th session of the 
Bulgarian-Libyan Joint Commission for Economic, Industrial, 
Technical and Business cooperation today signed a protocol aimed 
to reconsider the joint activity in a variety of spheres and set 
the direction for its future development, Construction and 
Regional Development Minister Khristo Totev, who heads the 
Bulgarian delegation, told journalists. 
  The 15 April sittings were attended by officials of all 
branch ministries and organizations with a stable share of 
Libya's market. The discussions focused on the future of the 
bilateral cooperation in a number of spheres, including 
industry, agriculture, transport, trade, construction and health 
care. The Bulgarian side informed their Libyan counterparts on 
the drafting of a bilateral agreement on reciprocal investment 
protection. During their stay in this country the Libyan guests 
met Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Karabashev, Agriculture 
Minister Georgi Tanev and Industry Minister Rumen Bikov, as well 
as representatives of different companies. They expressed their 
positive impressions from the performance of Bulgarian 
construction and engineering experts working in Libya. Secretary 
for Agriculture 'Isa 'Abd-al-Kafi, who heads the Libyan 
delegation, today met the leader of the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party Zhan Videnov. 
  The Libyan side was welcomed to send a delegation to 
Bulgaria 
to investigate the cooperation opportunities this country's 
industry has to offer. The food-processing industry, transport 
machine building, metal processing, the pharmaceutical industry, 
refrigerating equipment and the leather industry are of 
particular interest for the future cooperation between the two 
countries, according to Mr. Totev. The guests pledged to 
approach the competent Libyan authorities to help overcome the 
payment-related difficulties facing Bulgarian specialists in 
Libya. The document that was signed today also seeks to ease 
the work visa regulations for Bulgarians. An expert meeting 
will be followed by singing an accord for reciprocal recognition 
of university diplomas and degrees. The Bulgarian delegation to 
the session reiterated this country's readiness to sign an 
interdepartmental accord in health care and an intergovernmental 
accord on the employment of Bulgarian citizens on Libyan 
territory. This country will come up with a draft agreement on 
employment by the end of this June. 
  Bulgaria and Libya started to develop extensive economic, 
trade and scientific cooperation some 30 years ago, Mr. Totev 
told BTA. Following a 3- to 4-year break, the work of the joint 
commission is now expected to double the number of Bulgarian 
experts in Libya, overcoming a sharp drop of this figure, the 
construction and regional development minister said. About 
6,000 Bulgarians are now working in Libya, most of them 
construction engineers, workers and medical staff. According to 
Mr. Totev, some 4-5 years ago the Bulgarian-Libyan commercial 
exchange was as much as 900 million U.S. dollars per year and 
there was a total of 15,000 to 18,000 Bulgarian experts in Libya.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, April 19 (BTA) -- Bulgaria and Slovenia 
have established traditionally friendly relations and the 
purpose of my visit is to deepen economic cooperation between 
the two countries, Mr. Davorin Kracun, deputy prime minister and 
minister of economic relations and development of the Republic 
of Slovenia, said upon his arrival here tonight. Mr. Kracun and 
his party, including Secretary of State for Foreign Economic 
Relations at the Ministry of Economic Relations and Development 
Ms. Ravbar Vojka and Mr. Rok Tomsic, adviser at the ministry, 
will pay a two-day visit to Bulgaria and are scheduled to meet 
Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev as well as the ministers 
of industry, finance and trade. According to Mr. Kracun, 
bilateral economic cooperation could be upgraded in the interest 
of both countries and possibilities for its deepening will be 
discussed during his meetings here. The two sides are expected 
to sign an agreement on trade and economic cooperation, an 
agreement on reciprocal investment protection and promotion and 
a declaration of intent for setting up a free trade zone between 
Bulgaria and Slovenia. [passage omitted] 
  According to Bulgarian government officials, the two 
countries share identical views on a number of international 
issues, including the crisis in former Yugoslavia and the 
European integration efforts. Ljubljana's position is strategic 
for Bulgaria's interests: It lies on a major transport artery 
to Western Europe providing a passage for Bulgarian goods, 
vehicles and passengers, these officials also said. 
  Estimates set the 1992 Bulgarian-Slovenian commercial 
exchange at U.S.$5,744,722 and Bulgaria's surplus at $1,596,890. 
The 1993 commercial exchange between the two countries totalled 
$16,811,319, with Bulgaria's surplus amounting to $408,241, 
representatives of the Trade Ministry said. Upon his arrival 
Mr. Kracun said that in last year's commercial exchange between 
the two countries, Slovenia had a U.S.$20 million surplus. 
Cooperative deals prevailed in trade relations, Mr. Kracun 
added. Bulgaria exports to Slovenia mainly agricultural 
products (vegetables, tobacco and tobacco products, chemical 
fertilizers) and imports manufactured and semi-manufactured 
articles, including medicines, medical equipment, household 
appliances and transport equipment, according to data of the 
Bulgarian Trade Industry. Slovenia accounted for 43.8 percent 
of the 1993 imports to Bulgaria.

<F P=106> [Article signed by GGD/GOL: "Baranja Serbs Take Heavy </F>
Weapons out of Storage Depots"] 
  [Text] Brussels, 17 Apr (BELGA) -- According to military 
spokesman Freddy van de Weghe speaking in Brussels on Sunday, 
Serbian troops in Baranja, a region in eastern Croatia that has 
been occupied by the Serbs for over two years and where a 
battalion of 520 Belgian UN troops is stationed, have removed 
their heavy weapons from storage depots, in spite of a previous 
agreement. 
  At the beginning of this month, the Serbs had stored their 
heavy weapons in six depots, following the cease-fire agreed 
between Croats and Serbs from the self-proclaimed Serbian 
republic of Krajina. Van de Weghe said that they have already 
withdrawn "a considerable number" of those weapons. 
  This hardening of the Serbian attitude is, according to the 
military spokesman, a result of recent NATO air strikes on 
Serbian positions around Gorazde. Van de Weghe stressed that 
the situation in Baranja was "calm" and that there was 
"absolutely no reason" to fear for the safety of the Belgian UN 
troops on the ground. 
  The military spokesman added that "reassuring reports" had 
been received concerning the 30 Belgian UN troops being held by 
the Serbs in the Raslovac barracks near Sarajevo. Van de Weghe 
said that these soldiers "do not feel they are hostages or are 
being threatened." Most of these soldiers are from the 11th 
Battalion of engineers from Burcht that has been based in 
Sarajevo since the beginning of March.

  [Text] Prague April 19 (CTK) -- It is in the interest of 
the Czech Republic and the whole international community that 
the maximum be done to prevent such situations like the one 
which has recently occurred in Bosnia, and to prevent mainly 
Serbian politicians from further ignoring UN resolutions, 
Alexandr Vondra said today. 
  "The recent developments are very disturbing," said Vondra, 
Czech deputy foreign minister. 
  As a member of the UN Security Council, which has met to 
discuss the situation in the Bosnian enclave of Gorazde, the 
Czech Republic has to push for an agreement within this 
institution, Vondra said. 
  The UN should try to do more, and everybody capable of 
positively influencing the Bosnian situation should take a more 
active part in the settlement of the crisis. "To a certain 
extent, it is probably also a failure of the international 
community," Vondra stated. 
  He said he believed that the Czech Republic had made a 
considerable effort to help solve the problem. It had taken an 
active part in discussions within the UN Security Council, and 
assisted in keeping the peace. The number of Czech UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] soldiers stationed in the former Yugoslavia 
was now a thousand, many more in comparison with the country's 
population than the number of soldiers from most big powers and 
other influential European countries. Czech humanitarian aid 
was not negligible either, Vondra said.

  [Text] Prague, April 16 (CTK) -- The People's Union of 
National and Social Salvation (LUNSZ) led by former high-ranking 
Communist Party official Miroslav Stepan, today condemned "NATO 
aggressive air strikes and other interference in Yugoslavia" in 
a statement given to CTK. 
  The LUNSZ favors the peaceful settlement and ending of 
hostilities in Yugoslavia without external interference, says 
the statement. "NATO has no right whatsoever to interfere in the 
former Yugoslavia and through its military actions there has 
again confirmed its aggressive nature," it adds. 
  "The experience with NATO's illegal actions in ex-Yugoslavia 
confirms the truth of all citizens and organizations which 
oppose the Czech Republic's joining NATO which could draw it 
into fratricidal wars for foreign interests," LUNSZ members 
assert. 
  The statement says that the LUNSZ supports the position of 
Russia which demands that the war conflict in Bosnia be solved 
by Yugoslav nations themselves and primarily in a peaceful 
manner. The LUNSZ demands that NATO activity be ended "as it 
has been promised by NATO when the former Warsaw Pact ceased to 
exist."

  [Text] Prague April 18 (CTK) -- In his talks with his 
Austrian counterpart, Thomas Klestil, last Friday [15 April], 
Czech President Vaclav Havel interpreted the Czech Government's 
stance towards the nuclear power plant now under construction in 
Temelin, South Bohemia, a spokesman of the Czech Industry and 
Trade Ministry told CTK today. 
  The two presidents met at the two-day Central European 
summit 
in Litomysl, East Bohemia. 
  In Litomysl, Havel told Klestil that according to all 
analyses, the Temelin project was the only chance for the Czech 
energy industry, and its level would be equal to that of Western 
facilities of its kind. Havel said he was sure that it was 
necessary to complete the power plant so that brown coal mining 
and burning could be cut down. Havel also promised Klestil 
Prague would provide Vienna with every necessary information on 
possible emergencies. 
  The Austrian Press Agency APA has reported that Havel said 
that no more nuclear power plants would be built in the Czech 
Republic after the completion of Temelin. APA quoted Klestil as 
saying that Havel thought the Czech Republic would shift to 
other forms of energy production within 10-15 years. 
  Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy estimates 
the minimum operation-life of the Temelin power plant at 25-30 
years, his spokesman told CTK.

  [Text] Prague April 19 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic [CR] is 
prepared to enter negotiations on better access of Czech goods 
to the U.S. market and U.S. goods to the Czech market, Czech 
Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said today. 
  Dlouhy was speaking to journalists after his meeting with 
U.S. presidential envoy and deputy chairman of a political 
guiding group for Central and Eastern Europe, Richard Schifter. 
  The United States is also to conduct negotiations with the 
other members of the Visegrad Four -- Slovakia, Poland and 
Hungary -- and Schifter will visit these countries within the 
next few days, Dlouhy said. 
  Dlouhy pointed out that the countries of the European Union 
account for between 55 and 60 percent of exports from the Czech 
Republic, while the United States represents only about one or 
two percent. Therefore it was a long-term priority of the Czech 
Republic to gain admission to the European Union, he explained. 
  Dlouhy announced there will be a White House sponsored 
conference of leading American and Central European companies in 
the summer.

  [Text] Prague, April 15 (CTK) -- If parliamentary 
elections were to take place now, they would be won by the Civic 
Democratic Party (ODS) with 30.7 percent of the vote, according 
to a poll of 1,546 Czechs taken on April 1-10 by the Center for 
Empirical Research (STEM). 
  The second strongest party would be the Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD) with 15.7 percent, while third would be 
the coalition Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) with 12.7 percent. 
  The former Left Bloc coalition would receive 9.1 percent, 
and 
6.9 percent would vote for the Communist Party of Bohemia and 
Moravia (KSCM). 
  With 5.3 percent, the government coalition Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) would 
narrowly receive more than the five percent of votes needed for 
entry to parliament. The Christian Democratic Party (KDS), also 
a coalition party, would receive only 0.6 percent. 
  Parties on the rise include the Assembly for the Republic 
(SPR- RSC) with 3.8 percent and the Free Democrats (SD, formerly 
OH) with 3.4 percent of votes. 
  The Green Party would receive 2.2 percent and the Liberal 
and 
Social Union 1.2 percent.

of the scale, 62 percent of Green Party supporters and 61 
percent of SPR-RSC supporters would take part.

  [Text] Prague, April 19 (CTK) -- Seventy-one percent of 
people in the Czech Republic would go to the polls if elections 
to the Czech Parliament were held now, according to a poll 
conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM) on 
March 28-April 6. 
  The poll of 1,544 respondents with the right to vote 
revealed 
that 37 percent of the electorate were certain they would vote, 
34 percent said they probably would, and eight percent said 
"probably not." Ten percent of those surveyed replied with a 
"resolute no" and 11 percent had not decided. The higher the 
level of education, the less frequent was the answer "I do not 
know" and more frequent the intention to go to the polls, the 
survey showed. 
  Twenty-eight percent of the electorate would vote Czech 
Premier Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party (ODS), 12 percent 
Milos Zeman's Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD), and 11 
percent Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda's Civic Democratic Alliance 
(ODA). 
  More than five percent of those polled supported the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM) and the Assembly 
for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC). Four 
percent were in favor of the government coalition Christian 
Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL). 
  The Left Bloc (LB), former Czechoslovak Foreign Minister 
Jiri 
Dienstbier's Free Democrats (SD), the Green Party (SZ), the 
Farmers' Party (ZS), the government coalition Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS), and the Czech-Moravian Center Party 
(CMSS) all received less than four percent. 
  Twenty-three percent of the voters did not know which party 
they would support. 
  Compared with last month's figures, the ODS has dropped in 
popularity and the CSSD, the KSCM, and the SPR-RSC strengthened 
their positions.

  [Text] Budapest, 14 April (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry on Thursday [14 April] sent a note to the Slovak 
Embassy in Budapest, foreign affairs spokesman Janos Herman told 
MTI. 
  The document says, "The Government of Hungary is, as 
proposed 
in its earlier Note of March 28, 1994, ready to engage in 
immediate negotiations which will lead to the rapid 
implementation of a satisfactory temporary water management 
regime along the lines of the recommendations of the experts of 
the European Commission of December 1, 1993. This presupposes 
that the Government of Slovakia accept these recommendations, as 
Hungary has done. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the 
Republic of Hungary did not receive yet any information of such 
an engagement on behalf of Slovakia neither from the EC, nor 
from Bratislava. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs would 
therefore be grateful if the Slovak side could, at its earliest 
convenience, inform both the European Commission and the 
Hungarian Government on the acceptance of the recommendations on 
the basis of which immediate negotiations could start. 
  "In this connection the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes 
to 
point out that, far from being a 'categorical refusal' of the 
recommendations of the Experts of the EC, the resolution of the 
Hungarian Parliament of March 29, 1994, is entirely consistent 
with those recommendations. A copy of the (as yet for technical 
reasons unpromulgated) resolution is attached to this Note 
Verbale for the information of the Slovak Republic. As is quite 
clear from its terms, the resolution deals only with the 
posititon pending the conclusion of an agreement on the 
temporary water management regime. The Parliament's 
consideration was that in this period an underwater weir shall 
not be built at river kilometer 1843. This was precisely the 
view of the EC Experts themselves, as expressed in the letter 
written on their behalf by Professor Schreiner on February 8, 
1994, to Mr. Pablo Benavides, director of the European 
Commission. The experts had recommended the construction of two 
weirs at different places, in connection with and subsidiary to 
a substantial increase in the discharge regime. Such an 
increase was, as the EC Experts have pointed out, 'the main 
factor' in the recommendations." 
  "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs wishes to inform the 
Embassy 
of the Slovak Republic that the Government of the Republic of 
Hungary remains fully prepared to implement the recommendations 
of the Experts of the EC, as explained in its letter of January 
14, 1994, and would like to express its earnest hope that the 
Government of the Slovak Republic will do likewise," the 
document says.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 April (MTI) -- "The Free Democrats' 
electoral manifesto will bring a turnabout as compared to what 
happened in Hungary in the past four years and how it happened," 
Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) Chairman Ivan Peto told a 
rally in Budapest today. 
  "It will also bring a turnabout as compared to the preceding 
forty years, the underlying cause of economic decline and social 
disintegration in the past four years," he said. 
  The chairman of Hungary's biggest opposition party addressed 
a celebration, marking the fifth anniversary of the approval of 
the "The Program of Transforming the Regime", the first party 
manifesto on democratic transition, a document which later 
became known as the "Blue Book". 
  On this occasion, the Free Democrats came forward with an 
electoral manifesto entitled "Turnabout, Stability, and Growth". 
  The Free Democrats intend to become determining factors in 
the new government which will dismiss the current coalition, 
Peto said. 
  The SZDSZ will only form a coalition with any party if it 
becomes authorized by its membership at a delegates' assembly 
after the elections, he said. 
  "The main question of the elections is whether the 
government 
to follow the present coalition will be led by liberals or 
socialists," the SZDSZ chairman said.

  [Text] Budapest, 18 Apr (MTI) -- A stable government is 
assured in the wake of Hungary's parliamentary elections in May, 
in spite of the fact that certain parties are trying scare 
tactics on the population with their election remarks, Ivan 
Peto, the chairman of Hungary's largest opposition party, the 
Alliance of Free Democrats (AFD), said at a press conference in 
Zalaegerszeg (W Hungary) on Monday. 
  According to the AFD Chairman, a coalition of parties 
collectively holding a 60 per cent majority of the votes would 
guarantee a secure governing position. 
  Peto was of the opinion that votes between the liberal 
parties and the Socialist Party will decide who will replace the 
current government.

  [Text] Budapest, 19 Apr (MTI) -- Hungary defence doctrine 
has changed to that of non-aggression since the termination of 
the Warsaw Treaty, and the country no longer has an enemy image. 
  Over the past four years, the army staff has been reduced 
from 156,000 to 100,000, and soldiers are now imbued with what 
the defence minister describes as a national spirit. The recent 
changes are summed up in a book published earlier this year 
under the title "Four Years of National Defence: 1990-1994". 
  Jozsef Antall's government gave priority to restoring 
Hungary's sovereignty and withdrawing the country from the 
alliance system that hindered this endeavour. 
  In 1991, at a Hungarian initiative, Warsaw Treaty member 
states met in Budapest to wind up the military alliance. 
Defence Minister Lajos Fur, who presented the book to the 
press, recalled that dissolution talks brought some heavy 
clashes between the Hungarian delegation, and Warsaw Treaty 
leaders and Soviet military commanders. 
  Soviet troops, stationed in Hungary for 45 years and 
numbering 60,000 in the last phase of their stay here, were 
withdrawn under an agreement concluded by Miklos Nemeth's 
government in March 1990. The last Soviet soldier left Hungary 
on June 19, 1981. 
  According to current military leadership, four years ago the 
Hungarian Army was oversized and had an aggressive nature, while 
its technological, organizational and moral standards were 
deteriorating. In the first phase, the new leadership 
formulated a security policy which no longer implies an enemy 
image. 
  The development of Hungary's defence was subordinated to the 
interests of the nation and started from geopolitical realities. 
  Hungary has concluded military cooperation agreements with 
the majority of its neighbours. Despite cool relations with 
Romania, the two countries' military leaders are in permanent 
contact and assure a successful implementation of the Open Skies 
treaty. 
  Hungary maintains regular relations with NATO, and was the 
fifth country to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement. 
  The real value of funds earmarked for national defence from 
the state coffer has decreased since the mid-1980s. As this 
trend continued after the collapse of the communist regime in 
1990, the defence budget did not meet the need for standard 
maintenance of the armed forces. Presently, less than 2 percent 
of the gross domestic product is earmarked for defence. 
  The withdrawal of Soviet troops has particularly weakened 
Hungary's anti-aircraft defence. To improve the situation, 
Russia repaid part of the former Soviet debts to Hungary in 1993 
by 28 MiG- 29 jets valued at $850 million. 
  Last year, Germany transferred military components from the 
arsenal of the one-time East German Army to Hungary free of 
charge, with a value of DM 150 million. This year, Hungary 
expects to get helicopter parts from Germany. 
  Hungary's new defence law was enacted, in consensus, last 
December. The law left the 12-month compulsory military service 
unchaged, but reduced the period of unarmed military service 
from 15 to 12 months. Civilian service, where soldiers receive 
basic military training and then work in their trade under a 
contract between their companies and the army, has been cut from 
22 to 18 months. Fathers of two children are called up only for 
six months, while those of three or more are entirely exempted 
from military service. 
  In January, military chaplains began to work in the 
Hungarian 
Army, while in March, approximately 500 officers began to 
provide human services, including moral education and 
social-welfare support.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 18 -- Speaker of the Sejm Jozef Oleksy 
addressing the round table conference on central Europe and NATO 
said that the "Partnership for Peace" programme has not fully 
met Poland's expectations and aspirations. 
  The speaker also stressed that the West is too slow in its 
integration with the rest of Europe. He expressed hope that 
governments of Western states will see their own interests in 
integrating with central and eastern Europe. 
  Chairman of the North Atlantic Assembly Loic Bouvard said 
that Poland can be now treated as one of the most important 
partners from the East and added that the "Partnership for 
Peace" programme is a stage which should lead central and east 
Europen states to full integration with NATO.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 18 -- Speaker of the Sejm Jozef Oleksy 
on Monday received president and secretary general of the North 
Atlantic Assembly Loic Bouvard and Peter Corterier taking part 
in the round table conference "Central and Eastern Europe and 
NATO: Cooperation for Peace and Security," Director of the 
Information Office of the Sejm Chancellery Stanislaw Kostrzewa 
said. 
  Both sides paid attention to Russia's attitude towards NATO, 
particularly in the aspect of Central Europe's strivings to 
become integrated with NATO. The guests spoke highly of 
Poland's initiative to establish permanent contacts with 
parliaments of East European countries, particularly Russia, 
Ukraine and Belarus, as part of the Weimar parliamentary 
triangle. 
  The president of the North Atlantic Assembly said that the 
cohesion of NATO and the European Union (EU) was the best 
guarantee for Poland. 
  Oleksy said that full membership in NATO and the EU would be 
the best guarantee for Poland.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 19 -- After receiving the invitation 
of the SLD (Democratic Left Alliance) parliamentary caucus to 
hold a meeting, President Lech Walesa told PAP on Tuesday that 
if the caucus invites him, he is ready for a meeting and for 
talks. Walesa added he "never refuses invitations and has 
accepted many of organized social forces comprising more than 
five-ten serious people." 
  Commenting on the suggestion by a group of deputies to amend 
the Small (interim) Constitution, the president said he cannot 
ignore an initiative "that can become a great fire." Walesa 
criticised the prime minister's move to announce local elections 
and said he "has a grudge against Pawlak" over doing this. 
  In reply to a remark that the Small Constitution does not at 
the moment empower the president to dissolve parliament, Lech 
Walesa said that "we are constructing a new constitution, a new 
order and a new system. This process has many shortcomings and 
it would be bad if the president did not see them. Being aware 
of the fact that the change of the system is proposed, the 
president cannot avoid issuing a challenge, cannot avoid asking 
the question if the system can be changed like that, if this 
case does not require asking society and the nation for consent." 
  "I am not doing anything that would testify to my violating 
the law. I will address the nation with the question whether it 
is possible for a group set up for two hours to change the basic 
law and the political system of the country. In my opinion, 
this is inadmissible and should be forbidden. I will build a 
force that will make this not possible and in this context I 
said that I will use this force to dissolve parliament. It will 
be authorized to do so. 
  "It is in the interest of the state and all of us not to 
make 
accidental changes of the system, like it is happening now. It 
is a challenge for today and for the future. That is why my 
reaction was as it was. I reacted in that way not because I 
love power and I want to have it. I reacted like that in the 
name of responsibility for the future of the country, bacause 
tomorrow a different coalition may be set up and change the 
basic law." 
  Replying to a remark that the proposal was made by several 
deputies only while the decision belonged to parliament, the 
president said: 
  "A match can set fire to the whole city. Therefore I 
sometimes have to strike early to make everybody think. Of 
course, may [as received] opponents will say that I want to 
destabilise the situation but can the fact that I am using legal 
measures at my disposal be called destabilisation?" 
  The president stressed in this context that it was high time 
to tell judges and prosecutors that "nobody should be allowed to 
say that the president is destabilising (the situation) when he 
exercises his rights and observes the dates envisaged by the 
law." He added that there were many things in Poland which were 
still in the process of creation and "our behaviours are 
strange. Seeing serious shortcomings I must provoke a 
discussion." 
  Criticising Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak's decision to 
order elections to local government on June 19, President Walesa 
declared that this was yet another thing to which he had to 
react. "For the first time I must complain about the prime 
minister's conduct and tell him publicly that he should not act 
in such a way. I still have time to sign the new local election 
law (the final date is April 21) and he should not have done 
such a thing." 
  Walesa also added that he would have to draw the attention 
of 
lawyers to the fact that the faulty legal system permitted [word 
indistinct] to annouce that the elections would be held 
according to the old law while the Sejm already passed a new 
law. "It is not so much the prime minister that is to blame but 
rather the incorrectly constructed system," the president said. 
  The president confirmed that he starts a tour of the country 
on Friday and intends to publicly speak of this and other 
problems.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 19 -- Prof. Krystyna Kersten on 
Tuesday told the Sejm constitutional accountability committee 
that Soviet archival materials, conveyed to the Polish side by 
President Boris Yeltsin, are very incomplete and selective and 
they do not allow for forming an unequivocal stand on whether 
and in what circumstances the Warsaw Pact forces could have been 
engaged in Poland in the years 1980-1981 and whether Wojciech 
Jaruzelski "had rational premises to seriously take into account 
the possibility that the Hungarian and Czech scenarios of 1956 
and 1968 may come true" in Poland. 
  According to her and other historians, experts of the 
committee, the archival materials do not make it possible to 
reconstruct a coherent picture of intentions and activities of 
the then Soviet authorities towards Poland. Experts opinions 
were presented on Tuesday to the committee which is examining an 
initial motion to bring to constitutional accountability persons 
responsible for the imposition of martial law on December 13, 
1981. 
  Prof. Andrzej Werblan expressed the opinion that the 
entirety 
of documents should be presented if one thinks of achieving 
historical goals and not political ones. In his opinion, 
Yeltsin aimed at political manipulation and interference in 
Poland's issues. 
  General Wojciech Jaruzelski, testifying on Tuesday before 
the 
committee, said that the threat of external intervention had 
been real but it corresponded to Poland's internal situation and 
the then international situation. He also said that martial law 
would not have been necessary if "Solidarity" had decided to 
start talks with the government on setting up a council of 
national reconciliation, if it had not violently opposed the 
government's motion to limit the right to strike and if it had 
recalled a large demonstration scheduled for December 17, 1981.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 18/4/1994 -- "The talks between 
the foreign ministers of Romania and Armenia pointed to the 
necessity of concluding the soonest a basic political treaty 
between the two countries," said Romanian Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Mircea Geoana at the close of the first round of talks

Caucasian and the conflict in former Yugoslavia. Papazyan 
referred to the conflict in Nagorno Karabakh and outlined the 
latest developments and initiatives for its settlement. Teodor

of cooperation in the international bodies, especially the CSCE 
and the UN, and at a subregional level, with reference to the

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/4/1994 -- A government 
delegation from the Netherlands headed by Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers arrived in Bucharest on Tuesday, April 19, for a two-day 
official visit. The Dutch guests were greeted at the Otopeni 
Airport by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu, Minister of State Dan Mircea Popescu, 
the Dutch ambassador in Bucharest, Monique Frank, and other 
officials. 
  Shortly after his arrival, Premier Ruud Lubbers said that 
his 
visit in Romania would further substantiate the cooperation 
between the two countries. The Netherlands is located on the 
other side of Europe and considers that transports and trade are 
especially important, said the Dutch prime minister and added 
that the Rhine- Main-Danube watercourse would ease the bilateral 
ties, as Romania is located on the other end of the road and 
therefore the bilateral cooperation was extremely necessary, not 
only in the economic field but also in the political one and 
perhaps also in tourism. The Dutch premier mentioned the 
Latin-rooted language spoken by Romanians as a very special 
trait of Romania in central Europe. 
  On Wednesday [20 April], Premier Ruud Lubbers is scheduled 
to 
meet Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Chamber of 
Deputies' Speaker Adrian Nastase, the presidential adviser Misu 
Negritoiu, and the governor of the National Bank of Romania, 
Mugur Isarescu. 
  Today Ruud Lubbers was received by Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu, at Cotroceni Palace. The Dutch guest was accompanied 
by Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Kooijmans. The visit of 
the high Dutch officials is the first of its kind since 
Romania's December 1989 revolution. 
  The interview was attended by Romanian Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Teodor Melescanu, Minister of State Dan Mircea Popescu, 
presidential advisers Misu Negritoiu and Traian Chebeleu, the 
Romanian ambassador to the Netherlands, Marin Buhoara. 
  After the official talks, the Romanian president gave his 
guests lunch.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/4/1994 -- Romanian and Dutch 
Prime Ministers Nicolae Vacaroiu and Ruud Lubbers assessed the 
necessary framework existed for fertile bilateral cooperation. 
It would be helped also by the Agreement on Mutual Guaranteeing 
and Protection of Investments, signed by the two premiers on 19 
April in Bucharest. 
  Other bilateral agreements will follow, including two 
documents on road and water transports, said Premier Vacaroiu 
during the news conference that followed the talks between the 
two heads of government. 
  Referring to Romania's current situation, the guest said 
that 
what was worst seemed to have been overcome. "We are interested 
in cooperation and expect many Dutch investors to come to 
Romania", Lubbers added. 
  Premier Vacaroiu stressed that the visit demonstrated the 
upward course of the bilateral relations. 
  Premier Lubbers told the same news conference about the 
Netherlands' initiative to back, through the PHARE [Economic 
Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program, Romania's 
efforts to cut down power consumption and improve the technical 
performance in urban central heating.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/4/1994 -- Romanian Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu says in a message to the Crans Montana 
Forum meeting in Bucharest that in the political and economic 
context of transition toward market economy, toward integration 
in the European structures and openness to the world, economic 
flows experienced by South-Eastern Europe, Romania has a 
privileged position because of its human, industrial, and 
natural resources. 
  Premier Vacaroiu says also that Romania offers to the 
foreign 
investors a dynamic domestic market, swift access to neighboring 
external markets, a stimulating and continuously improving legal 
framework, well-trained and relatively cheap work force, 
numerous industrial capacities available for privatization, and 
many possibilities of cooperation with an industry in full 
process of restructuring, retooling, and privatization. All 
theses factors define an environment favorable to investments 
whose potential will be further increased by the new facilities 
granted to the foreign investors and the creation of a stock 
exchange, the first in the past 50 years, says the premier. 
  The Romanian prime minister says also that the fifth annual 
session of the Crans Montana Forum to be organized in Bucharest 
[over 21-24 April] is expressing the external dimension of the 
deep economic and political renewal that Romania undergoes. 
  Premier Vacaroiu expresses in his message the hope that 
while 
largely approaching the context of the political, economic, 
commercial, and investment relations between the North and the 
South and between the West and the East, the works of the Crans 
Montana Forum meeting in Bucharest will contribute to the 
exploration of the ways of achieving a Europe united in 
well-being and economic cooperation.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- "Romania's 
integration in the European political, economic, and military 
structures is one of the main directions of the Romanian foreign 
policy. Its essence lies in a process of modernization devised 
to include the army too, so that this could become a modern 
army," National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told a ROMPRES 
correspondent. This line of policy finds its reflection in the 
principles of military diplomacy, which mirror the efforts to 
develop bilateral relations with the armies of other states. 
Very soon, the Romanian minister said, he will be on a visit to 
Great Britain, and arrangements are being made for similar tours 
to the U.S.A., probably in July, and to Portugal. There are also 
invitations to Spain, Albania, Egypt, Qatar, and other 
countries. He mentioned also the neighboring countries with 
which "Romania has lately concluded a well defined chapter," the 
Romanian minister said. 
  Another dimension of the Romanian military diplomacy is the 
Partnership for Peace, meant to consolidate stability in our 
region, and wider yet, in the European region. 
  "Whenever we speak of integration, we must also specify what 
we want to integrate into, and that is in the partnership with 
NATO, an alliance which, after the cessation of the cold war, 
proved viable and apt to ensure a climate of security." 
  In the opinion of the Romanian defense minister, "the North- 
Atlantic alliance should undergo certain changes, now that the 
other pole of rivalry has ceased to exist, and find itself a new 
logic, the logic of collective gain. Confrontation will have to 
be replaced with something else, perhaps with cooperation." 
  While pleading for a partnership formula open to all states 
and stressing the idea of equal security for all European states 
and of sovereignty and independence of their decisions for all 
the countries included in the partnership program, the Romanian 
minister said that such a formula could contribute to defining a 
system of general security, which, based on what already forms 
the skeleton of NATO, could "form the necessary security 
umbrella apt to encourage a course to prosperity in this part of 
Europe, too," Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/4/1994 -- The main danger 
threatening Romania is not coming from outside, but rather from 
inside, subversion being one of its forms, Ion Mircea Pascu, 
secretary of state in charge of defense and international 
relations of the Romanian Ministry of Defense, told a news 
conference Friday, 15 April. Subversive acts can be 'canvassed' 
in many ways, he said, by those who pursue such aims. Romania 
does not exclude extraneous danger, although this is less 
poignant at the moment. He said Romania's option is for 
integration in the European structures, and that the Partnership 
for Peace is one step towards that goal. Romania's ultimate 
target in its strive for integration is the forging of a 
European security system comprising all the actors on the 
European political stage, the Russian Federation, the Ukraine, 
the United States, and Canada, inclusively. 
  Related to the problems the Romanian Army is confronted 
with, 
the secretary of state said its endowment and equipment shall be 
done as the budget allocation permits. Although modest, this 
provides for certain growths which will enable the army to 
upgrade medical assistance and housing conditions for the 
military.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 15 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
Normalization --the period of purges after the Soviet invasion 
in 1968 -- has returned to Slovakia, Jan Smolec, editor-in-chief 
of the pro-Meciar REPUBLIKA says. 
  "What we predicted, happened. The Czechoslovakists, pro- 
Hungarian elements, Slovak janissaries and certainly lots of 
international lobbies are intensively strangling Slovak 
freedom," the daily says. It stresses that the "initiators of 
Slovak sovereignty" are being sacked, while their posts are 
being occupied by opponents of sovereignty and independence. 
  "Everybody was shocked how rapidly the current government 
started to destroy the corner stone of our fragile democracy -- 
the freedom of the press. They want treacherously to liquidate 
the only opposition daily in Slovakia. Ostensibly because it is 
published by the Slovak news agency (TA SR)," Smolec notes. 
  He expresses a regret that the "normalization steps and 
liquidation of the daily" is happening before the eyes of the 
Slovak president for whom the nationally-orientated journalists 
had worked. Unfortunately, the head of state placed around 
himself the sort of Slovaks who were afraid of uttering a word 
about the Slovak president under the federation (Czechoslovakia) 
and now they are "servilely jumping around" him. According to 
Smolec, Kovac has "hesitated and speculated so much" that 
Slovakia has experienced a repetition of the Victorious February 
(ascendancy of the communist regime). 
  "These days confirm that Slovak freedom will long not 
flourish. Independence is threatened. Decision-making is in the 
hands of people who struggled against it. The era of 
normalization, corruption and hypocrisy is evidently coming," 
stresses Smolec who predicts his expulsion from the paper as in 
the days of the normalization. 
  "Dear readers! Hope dies last. The truth will not succumb 
to fire or sword. Watch attentively the REPUBLIKA imprint. If 
we are thrown out, we will raise our voice under another title," 
concludes Smolec.

  [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Dusan Kleiman was 
quoted by Slovak Television as saying that today's government 
decision to fire him as director general of the News Agency of 
the Slovak Republic (TA SR) was politically motivated. 
  Kleiman said that the decision was undemocratic as it came 
three days before he was scheduled to appear before the 
parliament's Education, Science and Culture Committee. 
  This only proves that the government did not need for its 
decision facts or a matter-of-fact investigation into the 
circumstances of the publication of the daily REPUBLIKA, Kleiman 
said. 
  He added that the present government had embarked upon the 
road of confrontation with anyone who was politically 
inconvenient for it. 
  Kleiman, 49, was asked by the then government of Vladimir 
Meciar in August 1992 to establish Slovakia's first press 
agency. TA SR now has a staff of about 500 and an annual budget 
of about 90 million Slovak crowns (over two million USD). 
  Under Kleiman it started to publish REPUBLIKA, the sole 
"pro- 
Meciar" national daily, which has run into a debt of about 18.5 
million Slovak crowns. 
  Deputy Premier Roman Kovac said the government had found 
out "that legal regulations were breached in the agency on 
several occasions." 
  He cited the law on budgetary rules, the law on public fund 
collecting and lotteries, and the Finance Ministry's ordinance 
saying that business activities of organisations partially 
funded from the state budget must not end at a loss. 
  Kleiman is mainly reproached for the publication of the 
daily 
REPUBLIKA, the only national paper supporting the former 
premier, Vladimir Meciar, which had a loss of 18 million crowns 
(about 545,454 USD) last year. 
  TA SR's overall deficit was 25 million crowns in spite of a 
contribution of 35 million crowns from the state budget. 
Moreover, Kleiman agreed in March with the free transfer of 
REPUBLIKA to its editor-in-chief even though the paper is worth 
10 million crowns according to experts. For the eight days 
during which the paper was owned by a private person, its 
operation continued to be defrayed by the agency. 
  Kovac said today the future of REPUBLIKA depended on the new 
TA SR secretary general. "The government believes that equal 
conditions must be created for all papers in Slovakia. We think 
that privatisation is the quickest and best solution." 
  The Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) 
today issued a statement saying that today's decision to dismiss 
26 district mayors was "political normalisation reminiscent of 
the occupation following (the Soviet-led invasion of 
Czechoslovakia in) 1968" and the beginning of political purges. 
  The HZDS justified its statement by Interior Minister 
Ladislav Pittner's words that insufficient guarantees of the 
mayors' loyalty to the new government were the main reason for 
their dismissal.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, April 15 (CTK) -- The Slovak 
government wants to maintain the social acceptability of the 
economic transformation, through continued tight fiscal policies 
and by keeping the budget deficit at a level acceptable to 
international financial institutions, Premier Jozef Moravcik 
told journalists today. 
  Moravcik and Deputy Premier Roman Kovac today began a 
two-day 
working visit to east Slovakia. 
  Kovac said that the Slovak National Bank, given the growth 
of 
its hard currency reserves, would probably be able to re-finance 
loans for commercial banks. He indicated that the establishment 
of financial discipline in the economy was also important, as 
money in circulation had gradually been transferred into a 
"shadow economy". 
  Kovac said that the Finance Ministry last year had exempted 
more than 4.8 billion Slovak crowns (about $158 million) in 
taxes, and that the losses of the state ensuing from unpaid 
customs duties are estimated at about 10 billion crowns. 
  Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik went on to say that the case 
involving the Manager company and Prumyslova Banka in Kosice was 
merely the "tip of the iceberg", beyond which exists a network 
of manipulations with state funds. 
  Manager, which was founded by members of the VSZ steel works 
in Kosice, was awarded 9.5 percent of VSZ's stock with a nominal 
value of 1.5 billion Slovak crowns for 300 million crowns by the 
Meciar government. A loan for the purchase was immediately 
provided by Prumyslova Banka, in which VSZ owns a considerable 
share. Former government minister Julius Toth, immediately 
after his recall, became the head of both VSZ and the bank. 
  Moravcik said that the case was related to the distortion of 
privatization through the channeling of public funds into 
private financial institutions.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 16 (CTK) -- The new government 
programme is confrontational and internally unbalanced, Sergej 
Kozlik, deputy chairman of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) and former Slovak ex-premier for economic 
questions, told journalists after an HZDS Presidium meeting 
today. 
  He said that the government had only restricted space for 
the 
realization of its programme. 
  HZDS leaders are concerned over the government concessions 
to 
the Hungarian minority parties which expressed great 
satisfaction with an ethnic minority programme which concerns 
them, Kozlik said. 
  Former Justice Minister Katarina Tothova said that the 167 
days would not be sufficient for the government to prepare early 
parliamentary elections and that the behavior of the coalition 
parties did not testify that the elections are being prepared. 
  The HZDS intends to come back with the idea of a referendum 
to decide on early elections as "laws had been violated," Kozlik 
said, adding that the petition lists had not yet been returned 
to the HZDS from the Presidential Office. Kozlik was referring 
to the petition campaign to support calling a referendum on 
early election which was organized by the HZDS shortly before 
its fall in early March. President Michal Kovac rejected calling 
a referendum as the organizers failed to collect 350,000 
signatures needed.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, April 16 (CTK) -- Relations 
between Slovakia and the Czech Republic should develop in a 
non-standard way given their specific nature, Slovak Premier 
Jozef Moravcik told journalists today. 
  Referring to the question of "Slovak gold", Moravcik said 
that it is being kept by the Czech Republic illegally. He 
pointed to the fact that the Czechs made the return of the gold 
conditional on Slovakia recognizing the 24 billion crown ($0.8 
billion) debt towards the Czech Republic arising from the 
division of the former Czechoslovak State Bank's asserts and 
liabilities. Moravcik said that the Slovak Government intends 
to include this issue into a big package of the as yet unsolved 
problems which it wants to discuss with Czech representatives.

  [Text] Dunajska Streda, West Slovakia April 18 (CTK) -- 
"Relations between the Slovak Republic and Hungary must be 
deideologised and relieved of the unnecessary historic burden," 
Peter Weiss, chairman of the coalition Democratic Left Party 
(SDL), said today after his talks with Gyula Horn, chairman of 
the Hungarian Socialist Party. 
  Weiss said both countries accepted the idea of concluding a 
general agreement which would also enshrine the unchangeability 
of the border. 
  Horn said that before the agreement is signed, Slovakia must 
comply with the recommendations from the Council of Europe (CE) 
and solve the problems of bilingual names of communities and the 
way of writing Hungarian names. But he added that "the status 
of ethnic minorities in Slovakia is still better than in 
neighbour countries." 
  Turning to the controversial Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
hydroproject 
on the Danube, Weiss said he supported the completion of 
Nagymaros. He voiced the hope that a technical solution 
beneficial to both countries would be found. 
  Weiss said he was convinced that the problem would be solved 
so that neither side "lose face." 
  Horn said that the problem of Gabcikovo, the Slovak part of 
the hydroproject completed in 1993, must be depoliticised and 
that a commission composed of independent experts from both 
countries should be set up to propose a solution. 
  Hungary has been strongly criticising Gabcikovo, complaining 
that it has diverted water from its territory.

mean by historic reconciliation, how old grievances are to be 
set aside and history should be for historians rather than 
politicians. I told the prime minister that we want to take 
confidence-building steps in this direction." 
  "A basic treaty is vital for relations. If the MSZP enters 
government after the May elections, Hungary would still sign the 
treaty. Moravcik spoke of some fear among Slovaks. They hope 
the basic treaty will fix the inviolabity of borders," Horn said. 
  The MSZP chairman said the basic treaty could eliminate 
fear. 
"Of course, all this is closely connected with what the basic 
treaty should declare on national minorities. I told the prime 
minister that the Hungarian nation's sense of solidarity with 
ethnic Hungarians beyond the border is natural. Hungary's 
efforts for a European agreement protecting national minorities 
to be signed is also understandable," Horn said. 
  "It is part of the basic treaty that Hungary would promote 
the economic prosperity of ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia, and 
welcome their cultural and administrative autonomy. Of course, 
reality should always be kept in view," Horn said.

  [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Slovak Economics 
Minister Peter Magvasi said in Geneva on Monday [18 April] that 
Slovakia was seeking acceleration of the ratification of the 
European Agreement so that it might be associated with the 
European Union (EU) soon, his spokesman told CTK today. 
Slovakia signed the association agreement last October. 
  Speaking at a session of the UN European Economic 
Commission, 
Magvasi said that Slovakia's economic situation in 1993, the 
first year of its independence, was influenced by the split of 
Czechoslovakia and the ensuing split of the currency. The 
economy was also affected by the taxation reform and recession 
in advanced Western European countries, he added. 
  Compared with 1992, when the gross domestic product dropped 
by 7 percent, the estimated decline of 3.7 percent last year was 
relatively favourable, Magvasi said. 
  He added that consumer prices increased by 15 percent last 
year against 1992, and that the rate of unemployment had 
stabilised and reached 14.4 percent at the end of the year. 
  Magvasi said that the fundamental goals of Slovakia's 
independent monetary policy in 1993 -- stabilisation of the 
national currency, minimisation of inflationary trends, 
maintenance of the balance of payments and increasing of 
convertible currency reserves -- were in harmony with the 
process of transformation. 
  He said that by the end of 1994 Slovakia would like to 
accede 
to the agreement on the cross-border effects of industrial 
disasters. 
  Magvasi also said that Slovakia would welcome acceleration 
of 
the construction of the key "North-South" transport artery which 
will effectively link the Scandinavian and Baltic states to 
southern Europe via Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.

  [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Slovakia needs 17 
billion crowns (about 515 million USD) to complete construction 
of the nuclear power plant at Mochovce, an official at the 
Economy Ministry said today. 
  The plant's first two reactors, which are 90 percent 
complete, were to have started operating by 1995, but now it 
appears they will not be ready until 2000. 
  Work on the plant was interrupted last year due to a lack of 
money and the breakup of its supply system. The Economy 
Ministry and Slovak industry representatives are negotiating 
conditions for a loan to pay sub-contractors. 
  Those from the Czech Republic who participated in the 
plant's 
construction, mainly through the Skoda Plzen engineering group, 
are owed 2.1 billion Slovak crowns. 
  The Economy Ministry's Imrich Szitas said it appeared that 
Russia, the plant's likely future supplier of nuclear fuel, 
would provide a loan of 450 million USD. Preliminary talks 
between Economics Minister Peter Magvasi and Russian officials 
suggest that Slovak imports of fuel would be paid for with 
exports of Slovak goods. 
  Talks are also being conducted with the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and a consortium of 
Electricite de France and Bayernwerk of Germany on a possible 
loan of 1.3 billion marks that would be paid through supplies of 
electricity. 
  Szitas denied that the EBRD made a loan conditional on the 
shutting down of a reactor at another Slovak nuclear plant, 
located in Jaslovske Bohunice, West Slovakia. It will be shut 
down once the Mochovce plant is completed, he said. 
  The entire plant in Jaslovske Bohunice is undergoing changes 
to increase safety in a gradual process that is to be completed 
in 1997, Szitas noted.

  [Text] Bratislava April 19 (CTK) -- Former Slovak Economy 
Minister Jan Ducky told CTK today that the Meciar government had 
been considering interrupting the customs union with the Czech 
Republic, but that he personally did not know of any final 
decision having been reached. 
  The daily REPUBLIKA reported today that Premier Meciar had 
decided to withdraw from the customs union agreement right at 
the time he was recalled by parliament. 
  Ducky, who was also chairman of the Slovak Customs Office, 
said in the CTK interview that his recalculation of last year's 
custom's payments according to GATT regulations revealed that 
"Slovakia lost roughly 400 million crowns (about 12 million 
USD)" through the customs union. 
  But while Ducky does not think the loss of such a sum merits 
the cancellation of the customs union, he still sees the 
disadvantages of the current agreement outweighing its positive 
aspects. 
  "Raw materials and semi-manufactured products flow from 
Slovakia to Bohemia, which everywhere in the world are subject 
to lower customs duties than are finished products, which come 
to Slovakia from the Czech Republic," said Ducky. 
  Ducky also said that he had been a supporter of the customs 
act at the time of its inception, but that he had thought it 
would be adjusted eventually to satisfy both sides. 
  "The time has come to think economically. If the customs 
union is not changed in basic ways, business circles will force 
its termination," emphasied the ex-minister. 
  Ducky pointed to several instances when the "balance" of the 
agreement has been disturbed by the Czech Government's 
application of value added taxes.

  [Text] Bratislava April 18 (CTK) -- Cooperation between 
the Czech and Slovak Armed Forces was discussed during a one-day 
visit of Chief of the Czech Army General Staff Major General 
Jiri Nekvasil to Slovakia. 
  In Bratislava, Nekvasil met with Slovak Defence Ministry 
State Secretary Andrej Sobol and Slovak Army Commander 
Lieutenant General Julius Humaj. 
  Generals Nekvasil and Humaj confirmed after the talks that 
four protocols to an agreement on cooperation between the two 
countries' armies were agreed upon so that the Czech and Slovak 
Defence Ministers, Antonin Baudys and Pavol Kanis, would be able 
to sign the agreement on May 2 in Bratislava. 
  "There are no obstacles on the way of cooperation," Humaj 
said. 
  The cooperation would primarily concern an exchange of 
experience in solving specific problems, for example the army's 
logistic support according to the Western model, Nekvasil said. 
He mentioned the possibility of joint exercises and joint 
armament projects but declined to give details. He admitted, 
however, that he liked the new Slovak howitzer Susana. 
  The Czech and Slovak Armies are predetermined to cooperate 
in 
building their national defence by similar conditions, identical 
problems and tasks and the situation in the region, Humaj said. 
  "Although we are aiming at integration into European 
structures and have adopted the Partnership for Peace programme, 
neither the Czech Republic nor Slovakia had their security 
guaranteed by any treaty. We therefore rely on our own forces 
and ought to build our national defence. In this we are finding 
a common tongue and will to cooperate," Humaj said. 
  He said that the second major task which is awaiting both 
armies -- transformation in order to be able to integrate into 
NATO -- also requires cooperation and an exchange of experience. 
  Humaj described as premature considerations about common 
armament systems. Given the shortage of finances, the two 
armies would concentrate on modernising the current combat 
equipment in the near future and only after this would they be 
able to develop new systems, he said. He added, however, that 
talks on this topic conducted so far were purely informative.

  [Text] Tirana, April 18 (ATA) -- On April 15, at about 
20.30, a Serbian border patrol executed by a volley of shots 
youths Skender Rasim Morina, age 25, and Lulzim Sadik Morina, 
age 22, who were found 150 meters in the territory of former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The two youths killed perfidiously were teachers in the 
elementary school of their village, Pogaj of Has district, near 
the Kosova border. A day before they had gone to meet their 
relatives in the Prizren commune in Kosova, and on their way 
back, they fell victim of the volley of shots by the Serbian 
border forces. 
  On April 16, the local mix commission, as well as the group 
of the Albanian and Serbian experts went on the spot. They 
observed that the victims carried no weapon or any other 
defensive means. The places of the wounds showed that the 
Albanian citizens were first shot in the legs in order to halt 
them. Later, the Serbian border guards approached them, and in 
a very short time, although wounded in the leg, the victims were 
shot in the head and chest. 
  The Ministry of Public Order, once again, calls on all the 
Albanian citizens not to cross the border illegally for any 
reason. They must be equipped with the necessary documentation 
and move only through the border crossing points.

  [Text] Prishtina, April 17 (ATA) -- Serbian formula 
"Albanians -- Expatriation, Deportation, and Extermination" that 
aims the ethnic cleansing and colonization of Kosova, the 
slogan, action is added for a long time: the exchange of houses 
and donation of land to the Serb settlers [sentence as 
received]. Serbian Government is making large investments for 
this, but colonization is committed even without investments at 
all: so the Albanian houses and land are confiscated and handed 
over to the Serbs. 
  According to the recent information of Serbian press, the 
campaign of recolonization of Kosova is under its way. 220 
houses will be erected in Istog commune, while a flat with 20 
apartments for Serbs settlers from Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia 
is being built. Istog commune has actually 500 Serb settlers. 
It is planned the permanent establishment them in three ares 
and each family initially will posses a house and 20 ares of 
land. The first site will be located in the property of 
"Dubrava" Plant and initially will have 120 families, but later 
more because it will be extended into a surface of 30 hectares. 
The second site will be in Gjurakovc and the third in Muzhevine 
village, in each of them private houses for 50 families will be 
erected. A large number of Serb's family settlers is already 
established in Belice, Osojan, Zhace, and Gjurakovc villages, 
all these in Istog commune. 
  Serb settlers in Kline commune have on possession an area of 
150 hectares, while in Decan commune some 180 houses are under 
construction for Serbs and Montenegrins settlers. In the same 
commune is planned the construction of houses for 400 families. 
According to the Serbian press, these families will receive 10 
acres for gardening and 3 to 4 hectares arable land. Besides 35 
buildings, some 219 sites are assigned to the settlers, in 
Gjilan commune, while only in Dragodan quarter of Prishtina, 200 
sites be handed over to Serbs and Montenegrins for construction. 
Plans and undertakings of this kind that serves to the 
colonization exist in other parts of Kosova. To this purpose is 
serving the expulsion forcefully of Albanians from their houses 
and putting in Serbs and Montenegrins families. According to a 
recent report of the Council for the Protection of Human Rights 
in Prishtina, some 42 Albanian families were expelled from their 
houses, only during the first three months of the year. 600 
people from families of sacked workers are expelled during these 
last three years. Dismissing from the job of 130 thousands 
Albanians and putting Serbs and Montenegrins in their places is 
the largest ethnic cleansing carried out in mines, plants and 
institutions. 
  These days in Podujeve has come 25 Serb families with 78 
members and 33 of them are employed immediately. Currently 400 
Serb work in Podujeve, many of them have come from Prokuple and 
Kurshumli communes near Serbia-Kosova border. 
  The consequences of the war in the former Yugoslavia are 
reflected in Kosova in the massive settlement of displaced 
people from those areas in Kosova. Such a thing is considered 
as a great chance by the Serbs for a new recolonization of 
Kosova, besides the ethnic cleansing, violence, terror and 
discrimination carried out by the Serbs. The Serbs have placed 
and are placing in Kosova refugees from Slovenia, Croatia, and 
Bosnia-Hercegovina, at a time when thousands of Albanians are 
expelled. Serbs plan to bring in 500 thousand Montenegrins and 
Serb settlers and to deport Albanians beside "Bjeshkeve te 
Namuna" in the territory of Albanian Republic. 
  Political and state subjects of Kosova have demanded from 
the 
UN High Commission for Refugees, that the settlers should have 
only the status of refugees and should not become permanent 
settlers. If the colonization is carried out under the veil "of 
the refugees issue solution," this would imply international 
recognition of Kosova colonization and it would be tragic.

  [Text] Pristina, April 19 (ATA) -- A framed trial began 
April 18 in the Serbian court of Pristine against Albanians of 
Kosova accused of allegedly creating the Ministry of Defence of 
the Republic of Kosova. All the accused arrested during last 
September have been subject to barbarous tortures. 
  The Serbian Attorney's Office of Pristine accuses them of 
acting against self style Yugoslavia since the second half of 
1990 until their arrest, that they have allegedly attempted to 
put at stake "constitutional order" by "the use of force" in 
order to secede the territory of Kosova from Yugoslavia and 
create "the special state" of Kosova and annex it to the 
Republic of Albania. They are accused of allegedly forming the 
Ministry of Defence of the Republic of Kosova. The indictment 
also says that they have allegedly formed military staffs at 
commune level. In this context the indictment mentions the 
names of the premier of Kosova, Dr. Bujar Bukoshi, of the 
minister of defence of Albania, Safet Zhulali and others. It 
also mentions some relations with the foreign world. 
  On April 18, the first day of the trial, the indictment was 
not read at all and the whole sitting dealt with numerous 
remarks by sixteen defence attorneys, who pointed to the 
numerous violations of the legal provisions and of the Serbian 
laws themselves during the penal procedure and investigation. 
Especially, the attorneys said that during investigation they 
have been barbarously tortured to force them utter statements. 
The attorneys demanded the exclusion from this trial of the 
deputy public prosecutor, Jovica Jovanovic. 
  Following the remarks and demands of the attorneys, the 
trial 
was postponed for an indefinite time. 
  The accused were brought to court on April 18 escorted by 
Serbian police forces, which were in great number also around 
the court building.

  [Text] Lityomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- In their 
first one-hour meeting here today the seven Central European 
presidents delivered only general opening speeches in which they 
dealt with closing ties between the Central European countries 
and their gradual integration into the European Union. 
  President Vaclav Havel told journalists that they would deal 
later in greater detail with concrete political questions, such 
as the former Yugoslavia or relationship to Russia. "This was 
only the beginning, not the climax of the meeting. We will 
carry on our discussions," Havel said. 
  He stressed the meeting did not mean that "we are colluding 
against any one else or that we think we are better." The 
meeting is only to express the closeness of cultural traditions 
and history. 
  The meeting has brought together the presidents of Austria, 
the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Slovak 
Republic and Slovenia. 
  German President Richard von Weizsacker said that Germany 
wanted to help bring the region closer to Western Europe. 
  Slovenian President Milan Kucan said that if it appeared 
that 
integration into Europe was an illusion, it was necessary to be 
striving for it on the Central European level at least. 
  Polish President Lech Walesa submitted the idea of "United 
Nations of Europe". Pointing to the very differing levels of 
individual countries, he proposed to make out a list of the 
conditions of integration and to mark the conditions which 
individual countries had already fulfilled. He came out in 
favor of "seeking unity while specificities are preserved." 
  Hungarian President Arpad Goncz pointed out that regional 
and 
pan-European integration were complementary. He described 
future Europe as "a large region" whose parts are at various 
levels of development. 
  Austrian President Thomas Klestil said the purpose of the 
Litomysl meeting was to promote trust among the participating 
states which would contribute to "Central Europe becoming a zone 
of greater stability and security than thus far." 
  He said the term of security was a "comprehensive" one and 
mentioned fears of nuclear energy. Klestil said that nuclear 
energy and particularly Austria's disagreement with the 
construction of the nuclear power plant at Temelin, south 
Bohemia, would be discussed "bilaterally." 
  He confirmed that Austria, if it becomes a member of the 
European Union, would support other Central European countries' 
effort to enter the Union. 
  The need to successfully solve the problem of ethnic 
minorities in Central Europe was pointed out by Slovak President 
Michal Kovac. He said conditions to eliminate this burden from 
Slovak-Hungarian relations would be better in the wake of the 
internal political changes carried out in Slovakia in March. 
Kovac said this would help Slovakia join the European Union. 
  Havel said he strongly supported all integration processes, 
irrespective of how they may be called. He stressed that the 
present offered the first ever chance "for all [in Europe] to 
live in peace and security." 
  Goncz said he had invited the presidents to a similar 
meeting 
in Hungary next year.

  [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- German 
President Richard von Weizsacker today called for dialogue 
between the concerned groups to remove problems of the past 
which burden German-Czech relations. Speaking at a press 
conference after the first round of talks between seven Central 
European presidents here, Weizsacker said that the past was 
still markedly affecting the two countries' relations and that 
it was "important to free them of past errors which are still 
affecting them." 
  This should be done through dialogue "not only between 
governments, but also between representatives of the groups 
which themselves experienced these bad times," Weizsacker said. 
He stressed that not property questions, but "a moral and 
historical evaluation of the past," a " typical task" for the 
two countries' presidents, was of priority importance. 
  Weizsacker was probably hinting at the issue of the 2.5 
Sudeten Germans who were expelled from Czechoslovakia after 
World War Two and whose property was expropriated, and at the 
German occupation of the Czech Lands during the war.

  [Text] Litomysl, April 15 -- President Lech Walesa said in 
Litomysl, the Czech Republic, on Friday that he thought that the 
united states of Europe would be created on the European 
continent soon. 
  Lech Walesa is attending a meeting of presidents of seven 
European states, including Thomas Krestil from the Republic of 
Austria, Vaclav Havel from the Czech Republic, Richard von 
Weizsacker from Germany, Michal Kovac from the Slovak Republic, 
Milan Kucan from Slovenia and Arpad Goncz from Hungary. 
  The Polish president told journalists on Friday that there 
was a need to overcome the division of Europe from the communist 
era. In his opinion, a list of common values and European 
problems should be drawn up in order to eliminate differences in 
development in selected countries and regions of Europe. 
  The president said that Europe is searching for its place at 
present and that thinking logically the continent should become 
an undivided entity. "We are on the crossroads," Lech Walesa 
said. He added that, in his opinion, European presidents and 
politicians would be responsible for how fast our continent 
would find the best road to development. 
  The participants in the meeting pointed out, in their 
addresses, to problems stemming from bilateral relations between 
the neighbouring countries. 
  The presidents are expected to discuss issues related to 
Russia, Russia's position on Europe, Central Europe and European 
integration as well as matters related to the Balkan problem. 
  Bilateral talks of delegations to the meeting are also to be 
held. According to unofficial information, President Lech 
Walesa intends to meet with presidents of Austria, the Czech 
Republic, Germany and Slovenia.

  [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 15 (CTK) -- Polish 
President Lech Walesa, in his talks with President Vaclav Havel 
tonight, said he was afraid of a special formula for Russia 
within the Partnership for Peace plan, Pavel Seifter from 
Havel's office told journalists. 
  He added that Walesa said this "special formula" for Russia 
could be dangerous to Europe. Havel voiced a similar 
apprehension, though not so strong as Walesa, Seifter said. 
  Walesa said he was satisfied with today's meeting. Reacting 
to Hungarian President Arpad Goncz's invitation extended to the 
seven Central European presidents to come to a similar meeting 
to Hungary next year, Walesa said that he "will have" to invite 
the presidents to the next meeting.

  [Excerpt] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- The 
presidents of Slovakia and Hungary, Michal Kovac and Arpad 
Goncz, discussed the sensitive problem of the Gabcikovo 
hydroelectric project on the Danube, ethnic minority questions 
and a readmission agreement at their meeting on Friday [15 
April], Kovac's spokesman Jozef Sitko told CTK. 
  The two politicians are attending an informal summit meeting 
of seven Central European presidents here. 
  Sitko said that problems existing between Slovakia and 
Hungary and the possibilities for their settlement were 
discussed in a "very good atmosphere." He said that in view of 
the forthcoming elections in Hungary the talks were merely 
informative. Both presidents are seeking mutual concessions and 
solution to the problems, Sitko said. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- The 
Litomysl summit confirmed the existence of European ideas, and 
the seven Central European presidents who participated wish that 
the notions of pluralism, tolerance and solidarity will 
contribute to the architecture of the new Europe, Slovene 
President Milan Kucan told CTK today. 
  "If it turned out, however, that the idea of a united Europe 
could become unreal and illusory, and all my conversation 
partners had these fears, then we would of course have to think 
of forming something that represents Central Europe in the 
political sense, that is more intense and even institutionalized 
cooperation," he said. He added that he hoped this would not be 
necessary and that the idea of a united Europe would remain a 
reality. 
  Kucan said his invitation to the summit, which began on 
Friday [15 April] and ended this afternoon, implied great 
recognition of Slovenia and positive appraisal of the fact that 
the country's reforms allow it to cooperate with other Central 
European countries in their striving for integration. 
  Kucan was joined by the presidents of Slovakia, Germany, 
Austria, Hungary and Poland and Czech President Vaclav Havel, 
who initiated and hosted the event.

  [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- The seven 
Central European presidents meeting in the Litomysl chateau for 
two days of informal talks took part in a televised debate on 
questions concerning the region and the individual states. 
  Most presidents agreed it was very hard to define Central 
Europe. Polish President Lech Walesa said it would be better to 
talk about united Europe. A number of problems, like "Chernobyl 
and other nuclear power stations", surpass national borders and 
so [as received] be discussed in a pan-European context. 
  Czech President Vaclav Havel, who is hosting the summit, 
said 
Central Europe's idiosyncrasies should not be a reason to 
consider the region a "special independent political entity" of 
some kind. 
  German President Richard von Weizsacker said Germany 
considered it vital that all the countries of Central Europe 
enter the European Union [EU]. Only then would the Union 
justify its name, he said. While discussing relations with 
Russia Weizsacker said the West did not want to provoke it but 
to cooperate -- though not on terms Russia would dictate. 
  Walesa emphasized that Central European countries had to act 
together and defend their common values together to deprive 
"certain groups in Russia" of the possibility of exploiting 
Central European irresolution. He said Russia "does not 
understand what partnership is" in reference to Moscow's 
cautious attitude towards the Partnership for Peace project. 
  Havel stressed the need to "categorically reject" elements 
on 
the Russian political scene which believed "Russia has a special 
right to advise us on what we may and may not do". 
  Slovenian President Milan Kucan said the international 
community had made some errors which significantly influenced 
the course of the war in the former Yugoslavia. The fundamental 
mistake had been the inability to understand that the federation 
had to fall apart. The military pressure NATO was now applying, 
he said, could only continue till the three warring sides, 
Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb, come together at the negotiating 
table. 
  All the presidents speaking in the debate, which was hosted 
by French public affairs commentator Jacques Rupnik, agreed 
admission to the European Union was desirable but accepted 
Havel's observation that EU entry was less important than the 
adoption of the values and principles on which the EU was 
founded and the willingness to bear their share of 
responsibility for the fate of the world.

  [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- Czech 
President Vaclav Havel today refuted journalists' speculations 
that the absence of Premier Vaclav Klaus at a joint dinner of 
the seven Central European presidents on Friday [15 April] was 
caused by the tension allegedly existing between him and Klaus. 
  Havel told CTK at a press conference at the close of the 
summit that, in a telephone call with him on Thursday, Klaus 
excused himself, arguing that he was not quite well and had to 
prepare for a trip to South America. 
  "I have no reason whatsoever to look for a different 
background to this," Havel said, adding that none of the 
presidents commented on Klaus' absence because none of them were 
accompanied by a premier. 
  Journalists present considered Klaus' absence to be one of 
the most interesting aspects of the summit. Speculations were 
being spread whether a mere personal problem, probably 
concerning the division of powers, was behind Klaus's gestures 
or whether another, deeper meaning should be searched for. 
  First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra and Parliament 
Chairman Milan Uhde were also invited to attend the meeting. 
Uhde excused himself because of a very important meeting in 
Velka Bites, south Moravia, Havel's spokesman Ladislav Spacek 
said.

  [Text] Litomysl, East Bohemia, April 16 (CTK) -- The 
states whose presidents met at the Litomysl summit do not feel 
they are a political or geopolitical body that should play a 
role or even be a link between Eastern and Western Europe, 
President Vaclav Havel said today. 
  The seven Central European presidents met because their 
countries shared many concerns, but because they wanted to be 
considered as distinct from other parts of Europe, he said at a 
press conference at the end of the summit. [sentence as received] 
  Havel said the presidents should meet as frequently as 
possible, though not necessarily all of them together. 
Groupings could depend on the matter discussed, he proposed. 
  If it was felt that some president who should have 
participated was overlooked, "we shall see him next time we 
meet", Havel said, probably in an allusion to press comment that 
the Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro should have been 
invited. 
  Havel informed reporters Austrian President Thomas Klestil 
had invited to a future meeting in Alpbach which the Swiss 
President Otto Stich might also attend.

  [Text] Tirana, April 18 (ATA) -- As regards the April 15 
incident with the Yugoslav border guards killing two Albanian 
citizens about 150 meters in the territory of former Yugoslavia 
[FRY], the spokesman of the Albanian Foreign Ministry says "We 
have to do with a barbarous and unjustifiable killing. The 
massacre could be avoided and the local mix commission as well 
as the group of the Albanian and Serbian experts observed that 
the victims carried with themselves no weapon or any other 
defensive means. These very grave acts follow other earlier 
acts committed against Albanian citizens and run counter to the 
most elementary human norms included the respective 
international documents and acts. These crimes are part of 
constant provocations and brutal behaviour of the Serbian 
authorities against the Albanians in general and those who live 
in their own territories in Kosova and Montenegro. They intend 
to increase tension in the border between the two countries and 
in the Balkan region. We do not consider the latest event as a 
sporadic border incident, but a deliberate and coordinated act, 
taking into account the April 10, 1994 event in Peshkepi of 
Gjirokaster. These monstrous acts, in such coordination, aim at 
extending the flames of war in former Yugoslavia further in the 
south. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Albania energetically protested this tragic event through a note 
sent to the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
Serbia and Montenegro, in Tirana", the spokesman of the Albanian 
Foreign Ministry concludes.

<F P=106> ["Press Conference of Ministers Serreqi and Kinkel" -- ATA </F>
headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 15 (ATA) -- Taking the floor at the 
beginning of the press conference on April 14 in Tirana with his 
German counterpart, Kinkel, the Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred 
Serreqi expressed his thanks for the aid that Mr. Kinkel has 
given to Albania with regard to its integration into Europe and 
for the promise that during the second half of this year, when 
Germany will be in the lead of the European Union, Albania will 
have it as a defence attorney of its interests in the 
integration process. 
  Mr. Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister and deputy 
chancellor of Germany, said that his visit to Albania was short 
but intensive. "We spoke about our bilateral relations. In the 
future too, Albania may rely on Germany," Mr. Kinkel said, 
adding that "we consider ourselves defence attorneys of the 
countries that are in the transition period and nurture friendly 
feelings for them." Mr. Kinkel offered Germany's aid for 
problems of drinking water, energy, infrastructure, as well as 
for the problem of debts. "Both parties agreed on bilateral 
relations. We will try on bilateral and multilateral level, 
and, particularly, through international organisations, which 
can help on these cases, to help Albania cope with these 
difficult questions," Mr. Kinkel said. 
  Regarding the question of the Albanian refugees in Germany, 
Mr. Kinkel said that Germany is ready to welcome them but, 
however, a way should be found to return these people to their 
country. Until 1993, the Federal Republic of Germany had been 
providing Albania with an amount of 175 million German marks in 
aid for the development of the judicial system in Albania and 
other fields, Mr. Kinkel said adding that "we are ready to 
support Albania resolve these questions such as admission to the 
Council of Europe, integration into the European Union, 
integration into NATO and support regarding Albania's efforts 
toward West European Union. We will support Albania in the 
International Monetary Fund and other international financial 
institutions. Albania is a member of the North Atlantic Council 
of Cooperation. The fact that Albania is also interested in 
bilateral military cooperation with Germany is well known." 
  As regards the Kosova problem, Kinkel said that the Serbs 
must put an end to their oppressive actions, and that the plan 
of actions and efforts for peace include the Kosova issue. 
"Here we fully support Albania's interests and demands," Mr. 
Kinkel said. He said that he has asked both the Albanian 
president and the foreign minister to give up objections 
regarding Macedonia's admission to CSCE. Kinkel denounced 
Greece's embargo against Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia --FYROM] and demanded that the killings near the 
Albania-Greek border be clarified. He appreciated the agreement 
signed on the war graves and expressed gratitude for the 
realization of this agreement. 
  Later both ministers responded to the reporters' questions. 
  Responding the question about the statement of the Greek 
minister for European affairs, Mr. Pangalos, according to whom 
Germany is a giant with a child's brain, about its economic 
blockade to Macedonia, as well as the serious incident in the 
Albanian-Greek border, Mr. Kinkel said that these three points 
should be separated from each other. 
  Regarding the embargo on Macedonia, Kinkel said that Greece 
must lift the embargo because it is a violation of the European 
consensus attained on the international law. Regarding the 
third point, the border killings, he said that the issue should 
be clarified as soon as possible. 
  Responding to the question whether Kosova will be excluded 
from the sanctions against Serbia, Mr. Kinkel said that, 
officially, Kosova is not included in these sanctions and that 
the Albanian Government maintains a very strict stand as regards 
the question of lifting the sanctions. "We understand this 
stand and for this reason I tried to explain how to treat 
sanctions and how to differentiate between their suspension and 
non-lifting, depending on the steps to be undertaken by the 
Serbs," Mr. Kinkel said.

  [Text] Tirana, April 19 (ATA) -- Through a letter of April 
18, 1994, Ronaldo Sardenberg, chairman of the Security Council 
Committee created by the 724 Resolution on the former Yugoslavia 
(Serbia and Montenegro), expressed its thanks to the Albanian 
Government with regard to its stands towards violations of the 
embargo by other ships, which have been detained and 
investigated by Albanian authorities. 
  The committee expresses in particular its appreciation for 
the good cooperation of the Albanian Government with the embargo 
assistance mission in Albania. The letter says that the 
investigations of the Albanian Government into the case of the 
"Vela Luka" ship and other cases have been considered by the 
committee as ample facts proving the violation of the embargo by 
foreign ships. 
  The committee has been informed by Albanian authorities for 
the "Valio" ship with 1,200 tons of gasoline, which tried to 
enter Yugoslavia, thus violating the embargo.

  [Text] Tirana, April 16 (ATA) -- Ramiz Alia, Albanian 
ex-president, together with other ex-party members, will soon 
appear before the court, Tirana's deputy attorney, Fatos 
Dervishi, told ATA in an interview which was carried by the 
newspaper LAJMI I DITES on April 16. 
  He says that the investigation into the criminal case of 
Ramiz Alia has been concluded, adding that the file will soon be 
sent to the Tirana District Court for trial. "Ramiz Alia," Mr. 
Dervishi stressed, "is accused of misappropriating state 
property of great value in collaboration with the other 
defendants and for abuse of office. He is also accused of 
violating the fundamental freedoms and rights of citizens." 
  Mr. Dervishi reports further that the present trial will 
also 
include ex-premier Adil Carcani, ex-deputy premier Manush 
Myftiu, ex-deputy chairman of the People's Assembly Rita Marko, 
as well as former members of the Political Bureau Simon Stefani, 
Hekuran Isai and others. All of the above named persons are 
accused of the same crime as Alia, Mr. Dervishi says. The total 
value of misappropriated funds and property amounts to 2,883,502 
leks. The abuse of office and the violation of the citizens' 
rights caused economic damage in the amount of 4,847,778 leks. 
  Defendants Simon Stefani and Hekuran Isai as former interior 
ministers and members of the Political Bureau of the PLA 
[Albanian Party of Labor] are accused of killings on the border. 
  Assistant Prosecutor Fatos Dervishi added that Aranit Cela, 
former attorney general and former president of the Supreme 
Court; Rapi Mino, former chief prosecutor; Zylyftar Ramizi, 
former deputy interior minister; and Veiz Haderi, former 
chairman of the branch of interior affairs in the Saranda 
District, will also be defendants in the trial. The above are 
also accused of the execution of 22 people in 1951, without 
investigation or trial.

  [Text] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov is working in the privacy of his hospital room at the 
Lozenets Hospital of the Military Medical Academy in Sofia, the 
government Press Office said today. "Prof. Berov is in a good 
state of health. His stomach complaint and the slight yellowing 
of his eyes have passed," says a communique issued today at noon 
by Dr. Todor Gerasimov, chief of the Lozenets Hospital. Berov's 
liver function is returning to normal, biochemical tests carried 
out in Bulgaria show. Blood serum has been sent to Germany to 
be tested for hepatitis type C but the results are not out yet. 
  A month ago Berov had a quadruple bypass operation from 
which 
he recuperated enough to attend a government meeting. Early 
last week he was hospitalized again as he developed the symptoms 
of an acute liver condition. The diagnosis has not been 
specified yet. Medics assume that Berov either had a passing 
mechanical obstruction of the bile ducts or suffered from a 
light form of viral hepatitis type C.

  [Text] Sofia, April 18 (BTA) -- The leader of the ethnic 
Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) Ahmed Dogan asked 
for an appointment with Prime Minister Prof. Lyuben Berov. Mr. 
Dogan met today with Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, who 
is entitled to head the cabinet during the prime minister's 
absence through illness. 
  Ahmed Dogan wanted to know when he would be able to meet 
with 
the prime minister personally, Mr. Matinchev said after the 
meeting. He said that DPS had certain ideas about structural 
changes in Prof. Berov's Cabinet, (which was formed on the DPS's 
mandate). However, he declined to give details or comment. 
  "An overhaul of the cabinet would open new opportunities to 
the government, but its performance over the next three or four 
weeks will be of vital importance, for it will show whether we 
shall ask for such an overhaul," Mr. Dogan said after the 
meeting. He said that their ideas about structural changes in 
the cabinet were still at the probing stage. Mr. Dogan hopes to 
meet with Prof. Berov as soon as he is allowed by the doctors. 
Asked whether this will be the first appointment of the prime 
minister after his hospitalization, Mr. Dogan answered that he 
hoped so.

  [Text] Albanian President Sali Berisha today received 
Ambassador Norman Anderson, chairman of the CSCE mission in 
Skopje. 
  During the meeting President Berisha told Anderson: We are 
assessing your mission's efforts to preserve stability and 
prevent the conflict, because Albania is deeply interested in 
preventing this conflict. However, we observe with anxiety that 
the tension continues to remain high and the danger great. The 
latest developments in Gorazde and the defeat of the United 
Nations and other institutions have greatly increased 
possibilities for the conflict to spread down through the region. 
  Regarding the crisis in Albanian-Greek relations, President 
Berisha stressed that the Albanian side has continuously tried 
for a policy of understanding and cooperation with its southern 
neighbor. However, he said, we ascertain that besides the 
Greek-Serb alliance, the Greek Government has continuously used 
the Albanian refugee factor as pressure against our country's 
sovereignty. 
  On the other hand, Greek Government officials have attempted 
to manipulate certain minority elements to fulfill Greece's open 
territorial vindications against Albania. The last case -- the 
massacre by the Greek commando at the recruit barracks in 
Peshkepi e Siperme -- was an attack against Albania's 
sovereignty, for which the Greek Government should bear 
responsibility. The Greek commando came from Greek territory 
and returned to this territory, too. It had all the 
characteristics of a commando of the Greek special forces or 
forces with special training. That is why we have raised this 
problem to the UN Security Council and the CSCE and have asked 
the European Union to set up a commission, despite 
investigations carried out by our both commissions, because 
Greece cannot be a party in the judgment. 
  However, we are determined to overcome contradictions 
through 
dialogue and hope that the other side shows the same will as 
well. 
  Regarding Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], President Berisha stressed that Albania is 
profoundly interested in cooperation with this Republic and in 
its stability. A considerable percentage of the population in 
that Republic is Albanian. I can say that with their 
participation in the government, the loyalty they have shown 
toward the coalition, and the democratic means and methods they 
have used and continue to use to realize their human and 
national rights, the Albanians are and will be a factor of 
stability. 
  Without negating the achievements in the field of rights and 
freedoms, we insist that the realization of their human and 
national rights is an important condition for Macedonia's 
stability. In this aspect, the census of the population, the 
opening of the schools, and the increasing commitment of the 
Albanians in the official structures can be considered by us as 
important steps. 
  For his part, Anderson expressed his concern over the 
situation in the region and particularly in Macedonia. The 
pressure exerted from Serbia, the possible explosion of a 
conflict in Kosova, and the blockade from the south endanger the 
stability of this Republic. In this direction, the cooperation 
between Albania and Macedonia is useful and serves stability in 
the region. We consider the solution of many questions that 
preoccupy the Albanians there to be an indispensability and we 
are insisting that the Macedonian Government fulfill the demands 
of Albanians. We are presently working to accomplish the census 
of the population and hope that it will be held in June this 
year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by </F>
RIA-NOVOSTI special correspondent Vladimir Gurzhiy in Tirana 
under the "Diplomacy" rubric; date not given: "For Peace in 
Europe, All States Must Make a Contribution"] 
  [Text] [Gurzhiy] Minister, what are the foreign policy 
priorities of democratic Albania today? 
  [Serreqi] Albania's foreign policy is based on three main 
directions. First, to facilitate the transitional period and 
create favorable conditions for building a rule-of-law state and 
establishing true democracy in Albania. Second, to accelerate 
Albania's integration into Europe. Third, to secure a stable, 
acceptable, and honest solution to what we call the all-Albania 
question, which is directly linked with what is happening in the 
former Yugoslav federation. 
  [Gurzhiy] What is Albania's approach to problems of 
all-European partnership and cooperation, to the CSCE as an 
all-region political organization, and to the North Atlantic 
Cooperation Council as an organization of military-political 
cooperation? 
  [Serreqi] As I already pointed out at the start of our 
conversation, one of our foreign policy priorities is Albania's 
speediest worthy integration into all European and international 
structures. Here we rely on the reforms being implemented in 
Albania and on the successes achieved on this path over the past 
two years, and we take into consideration the special features 
of the Albanian people's mentality via a pronounced European 
orientation. 
  We believe that our main problems can be resolved more 
successfully via fruitful cooperation with international 
organizations than via bilateral alliances. We proceed from 
this logic in building our relations with European security 
structures -- above all, NATO -- at the first stage through 
participation in the "Partnership for Peace" program and at the 
next stage through full membership of this organization. 
  [Gurzhiy] How do you rate the Russian position on these 
problems? 
  [Serreqi] We believe that membership of these international 
organizations presupposes the fulfillment of all the provisions 
of the corresponding documents. In the context of events in 
Europe and in the world, particularly after the collapse of the 
"bloc system," we believe that to build a more stable and 
peaceful Europe all states must make a contribution. We rate 
positively and support all efforts by other organizations within 
the CSCE framework aimed at restoring peace and international 
order. Any other approaches pose a threat to stability. They 
cannot, of course, be welcomed. 
  [Gurzhiy] The resolution of the Albanian national question 
obviously presupposes the Kosovo problem. What is Albania's 
present position in respect to Kosovo? 
  [Serreqi] We believe that the problem of Kosovo is the key 
to settling the crisis in the former Yugoslavia -- a crisis 
which could spread to the whole of the Balkans. Under real 
conditions, Albania takes a clear stand: We are opposed to 
altering borders by force. We have repeatedly advocated the 
inviolability of state borders. But this certainly does not 
mean that we are abandoning our demands to observe the rights of 
Albanians in accordance with international documents and the 
norms of international law. 
  I believe that the Yugoslav crisis is complex. So far the 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been its most tragic part, and it 
is unfortunately continuing. 
  We welcome the recent very promising initiatives aimed at 
extinguishing the flames of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, just as 
we supported the NATO ultimatum, the sanctions resolution, and 
the Russian presence aimed at persuading the Serbs to join in 
this process. 
  We insist that the "Kosovo question" must be a constituent 
part of the overall plan for settling the crisis as its key 
problem. We believe that pressure must be put on Serbia to make 
it agree to the establishment of international control over 
Kosovo, starting with the return of the CSCE observers mission. 
Second, the question of lifting or easing the sanctions should 
be linked not only with the restoration of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina but also with the resolution of the problem 
of the Albanians in Kosovo. 
  [Gurzhiy] So do you believe that the problem of Kosovo must 
be tackled right now, without waiting for a settlement in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Serreqi] The crisis in the former Yugoslavia is complex. 
We respect the strategy of a phased resolution, but we cannot 
agree with the sidelining of its key elements. The problems of 
the crisis are organically linked to one another and must all be 
resolved together -- step by step. The war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has somewhat pushed other problems into the 
background. The international community must realize that a 
potential threat of the widening of the crisis is linked with 
them. Thus, in respect to Kosovo it is obvious that it is 
unacceptable to regard the Kosovo problem as an internal matter 
for Serbia. If this problem is not tackled in a timely way on 
the basis of an honest and fair approach, the threat of the 
destabilization of the situation inside and outside the Balkans 
will arise. 
  [Gurzhiy] What place does Russia occupy in Albania's foreign 
policy? How do you rate Russia's Balkan policy and, on the 
whole, the state of Albanian-Russian relations and their 
development prospects? 
  [Serreqi] Russia's presence in the Balkans is a historical 
fact, and its present participation in the context of the 
development of events in the former Yugoslavia is real. If we 
base ourselves on our previous conclusion that this presence 
must be realized within the framework of the efforts of the 
international community (CSCE, NATO), then any contribution, 
including Russia's, aimed at establishing peace should be 
welcomed. 
  In terms of bilateral relations, I would like to emphasize 
that we have long been working with Russian Ambassador to 
Albania V. Nerubaylo on the realization of a visit to Moscow by 
an Albanian Government delegation headed by A. Meksi, chairman 
of the Council of Ministers. We are awaiting a decision on the 
date of the visit. 
  [Gurzhiy] I believe that your interview will also serve to 
realize this visit. In this connection, what would you like to 
convey to Russian readers? 
  [Serreqi] Unfortunately, I have not yet had an opportunity 
to visit your country, but I believe that I do nevertheless have 
some idea of Russia. I am not sure that my knowledge of the 
political situation is consonant with my acquaintance with 
Russian culture. The sociopolitical changes in your country have 
been so great and so rapid.... In particular, I feel optimism 
at the well-known assessments of the Russian people's spirit and 
culture, and I am sure that the present processes will lead 
Russia to democracy. I would be pleased to visit your country 
as soon as possible. I also hope that your country might be 
able to make a worthy contribution to European and world affairs 
under conditions of genuine democracy.

  [Text] Precisely two years ago, the democratic government 
presided over by Aleksander Meksi that emerged from the 22 March 
elections took its oath before the president of the Republic. 
We availed ourselves of this opportunity to interview Prime 
Minister Meksi: 
  [Begin recording] [Meksi] Regarding the government's 
activity 
during these two years, I would highlight the great work done in 
the direction of the all-round reformation of Albania in the 
aspect of structures and the judicial, economic, and general 
aspect so as to pass from a state with a centralized economy and 
a state of the dictatorship of the proletariat into a state of 
democracy and free market economy. Of course, just a glimpse of 
that great work of the government and parliament, after two 
years, cannot be understood in one moment. However, if we take 
into account the large number of laws, we would understand that 
many things have changed in Albania and, in my opinion, they 
have changed for ever. 
  Nevertheless, the Albanian Government and parliament will 
have a greater obligation in the next two years, precisely in 
the direction of changing the economic, state, and judicial 
structures in Albania, because there are still many things to be 
done. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What didn't you manage to 
accomplish in these two years as you would have liked to? 
  [Meksi] We would have liked public investments to have been 
more numerous and larger, but the difficulties of these two 
years and the need for a social character in the whole economic 
reform, as well as the need to support unemployment and the less 
economically rich strata, left fewer funds for foreign 
investments. We hope that in the coming years, together with 
the support program by the G-24 countries, these investments 
will be greater. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] What message would you like to 
address to the Albanian people today? 
  [Meksi] First of all, the overwhelming majority of the 
Albanian people have courageously supported the reform in 
Albania. The message I would send to them on this occasion would 
be to thank them for the support that they have given to the 
government and the economic and state reforms in Albania. This 
message is valid for all Albanians, first to the emigrants who 
have helped to overcome these two difficult years; the trade 
unions who have developed a dialogue, objected, and proposed 
better solutions to the government; and the political forces who 
have been objective and who have wanted to improve the reform in 
Albania to the benefit of Albania. 
  My thanks go to all those foreign experts who have come to 
Albania and have contributed to the reform; to all the 
associations who have helped Albania with humanitarian aid; to 
all states, first those of the European Community, the United 
States, Turkey, and other countries that, with the humanitarian 
aid, credits for raw materials, and assistance for the balance 
of payments have made it possible for Albania to overcome these 
difficult years of transition. [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer] Democratic Party [PD] Chairman Eduard 
Selami held a news conference today. Let us follow a report by 
our correspondent Zamira Koleci: 
  [Koleci] PD leader Selami considered the changes that have 
occurred during these two years of Government in Albania to be 
unimaginable, in a positive sense. During the news conference, 
he defined the program followed by the democrats and its 
social-democratic and republican allies to be the best and only 
alternative to set the country on the road of pluralistic 
democracy, market economy, and integration with the world. 
  Proceeding from the reality of the last two years and the 
transformations and progressive changes, as well as the present 
political reality, the PD considers the demand for new elections 
to be baseless and destabilizing. The PD leader expressed his 
regret that the Socialist Party and its leadership cannot 
dissociate themselves from the past and that the socialist 
leaders oppose justice to defend corruption. Meanwhile, he said 
that his party has continuously condemned corruption as a 
phenomenon that injures democracy. 
  At the news conference Selami gave attention to the 
situation 
in the region, which he considered to be very complicated. 
According to him, the worsening of the situation in Bosnia and 
the fall of Gorazde [as heard] have cooled and weakened the 
hopes for peace and have shaken the stature of the United 
Nations and the people's belief in it. After the Serbs evicted 
the international observers, the situation of Albanians in 
Kosova is becoming increasingly worse. 
  The news conference continued with reporters' questions. 
  Asked about the government coalition, Selami answered that 
the PD assesses the results of this cooperation to be very 
positive. However, he said, in democracy it is natural not to 
agree with everything. 
  Regarding the Council of Europe's reaction to the criminal 
incident of 10 April on the border with Greece, Selami, who was 
there heading an Albanian delegation, informed the reporters 
that the Albanian Government's note found complete approval and 
the problem has now entered the road of dialogue. 
  Selami assessed the possibility of the creation of a right 
of 
spectrum party to be completely normal in democracy. Meanwhile, 
he mentioned the PD's strict stance against the right-wing 
extremist forces. The victory of Berlusconi is a very positive 
phenomenon for the PD and an advantage to expand cooperation 
with Italy. We are parties of the same spectrum, continued 
Selami, and that makes communication easier. 
  After greeting the fact that Italy is presently going toward 
new political solutions, he said that Albania wants good 
relations with its coastal neighbor. Optimistic about the 
future, Selami assured them of positive relations not only at a 
party level, but also between the Albanian and Italian 
Governments.

  [Text] The UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Command in 
Zagreb has withdrawn its request for an air corridor over 
Bulgaria. The wording of the statement gave as the reason the 
delicate nature of the cargo to be transported. The message was 
given to the Bulgarian ambassador in Zagreb. According to our 
reporter Vladislav Stoychev, the news was made known in 
parliament through Nikolay Slatinski, chairman of the National 
Security Commission. 
  I would remind our listeners that prior to this development 
a 
letter from the commander of the Blue Helmets addressed to the 
government was handed over to the Chairman's Council of the 
National Assembly. The letter requested an air corridor for a 
Ukrainian aircraft that was to carry Finnish Blue Helmets over 
the route from Skopje to Helsinki and back. 
  We have a direct link with our reporter Vladislav Stoychev, 
who has further information from parliament: 
  [Stoychev] Regarding the UNPROFOR request for an air 
corridor over Bulgaria, the parliamentary forces today addressed 
a question to the Foreign Ministry asking whether similar 
flights had taken place previously. A short time ago Yunal 
Lyutfi [spokesman for the Movement for Rights and Freedoms 
parliamentary group] informed journalists of the preliminary 
results of the inquiry, received from an unnamed source in the 
Foreign Ministry. The reply stated that -- here I quote -- 
hundreds of violations of Bulgarian airspace have been 
registered under all the governments formed since the adoption 
of the present Constitution. [no reference to close of quotation 
as heard] This evidently refers to flights not approved by the 
National Assembly, as required under the Constitution. Lyutfi 
said that at the moment the foreign minister is also carrying 
out a check on violations of Bulgarian territorial waters.

  [Text] Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev had a 
meeting today with Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af 
Ugglas, who is visiting Bulgaria. He highly praised the 
contribution that Sweden is making within the framework of the 
Group of 24 to help Bulgaria stabilize its balance of payments 
and stressed that the relations between the two countries still 
do not reflect the potential possibilities. 
  For her part, Ugglas confirmed Sweden's readiness to provide 
additional financial aid for Bulgaria and its intention to 
expand trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.

  [Text] Before the Slovene Government delegation ended its 
visit today, the Bulgarian and Slovene sides signed an economic 
cooperation agreement and a declaration of the two governments' 
intention to set up free trade zones in the near future. 
  With its advanced privatization, stabilized financial 
system, 
and 1.5 billion dollars in foreign investments, Slovenia is a 
reliable partner, it was stressed at the news conference held at 
the end of the visit. Davorin Kracun, Slovene deputy prime 
minister and minister of economic relations and development, 
stressed the two countries' similar interests: Both countries 
have suffered heavily from the embargo against Serbia, so 
bilateral cooperation and trade between us, under more liberal 
conditions, can help to some extent in making up for the lost 
markets and the shortages that have been caused. Listen now to 
what Mr. Davorin Kracun had to say: 
  [Begin recording of Kracun, in English fading into 
announcer-read Bulgarian report] Industry Minister Bikov and I 
discussed the possibilities for production-sharing in industry, 
the Slovene deputy prime minister said. We compared data on the 
two coutnries' industrial structures and discovered many 
prerequisites for corresponding sectors of industry to 
complement one another. As examples, the leader of the Slovene 
Government delegation mentioned electronics, engineering, and 
the food and chemical industries.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Petur Bochukov: "Corridor -- Yes! But It </F>
Depends on Its Purpose"] 
  [Text] It is honorable to act according to your principles 
when you are poor and depend on others, when you are in debt and 
cannot make ends meet, and when the pressure from outside is too 
strong. When you are considered honorable you also gain the 
esteem of the others, even when moral values deteriorate. 
  The Bulgarian position on the noninterference of Balkan 
states in the Yugoslav conflict, repeatedly expressed, is 
supported by all parliamentary and extraparliamentary forces in 
Bulgaria. This is an honorable position that not only 
corresponds to our national interests, but also makes a clear 
and significant contribution to limiting the war in Bosnia and 
seeking a peaceful solution through negotiations and mutual 
concessions on the part of the sides to the conflict, and the 
European and world forces that stand behind them. Bulgaria also 
followed a principled position during the Gulf War, sacrificing 
$1.5 billion that Baghdad owed us. We did not receive any 
compensation. Bulgaria acted on the basis of principles, and 
also took into consideration the requirements of the 
international community on the issue of sanctions against the 
rest of Yugoslavia. As a result we lost and continue to lose 
billions of dollars at a time when our economy faces collapse. 
Again, we received no compensation. 
  Now we are subjected to a new pressure. We are required to 
agree to a corridor through which Turkish "Blue Helmets" will 
pass on their way to Bosnia. It was explained to us -- as 
Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes did during his recent visit 
to Bulgaria -- that the "Blue Helmets" in question are under the 
aegis of the UN and that we must free ourselves of our fears and 
complexes. A Turkish delegation led by Turkish Parliament 
Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk had a similar mission. It insisted 
on changing the Bulgarian position on this issue, which is so 
sensitive against the background of the situation in our region. 
We do not know whether the delegation returned to Ankara with 
high hopes. At present Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller is 
visiting Washington where she needs Clinton's support for her 
new economic program and for sending the Turkish "Blue Helmets" 
to Bosnia. Let us recall that she herself visited Bosnia, 
together with Benazir Bhutto, to express the Islamic world's 
support of the Bosnia Muslims. Let us also recall that the 
decision of the UN Security Council on including Turkish "Blue 
Helmets" among the UN peace troops also was adopted under the 
strong and continuous pressure of the United States and Turkey. 
Finally, let us remember that the Islam fundamentalists of the 
Welfare Party registered brilliant successes at last month's 
municipal elections and now the mayors of Istanbul, Ankara, and 
many other Turkish cities belong to this party. 
  It is logical that Turkey's next step, in which Islam plays 
such an important role, should be aimed at strengthening its 
military presence to the east of Edirne. This could be achieved 
most easily by establishing a presence in Bosnia. For this a 
corridor through Bulgaria is necessary. The United States 
already has begun relevant psychological conditioning. At a 
meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov, U.S. 
Ambassador William Montgomery requested a transit corridor for a 
one-time transportation of UN military and other equipment. It 
is intended for a new contingent of U.S. "Blue Helmets" in 
Macedonia, who will be transported by air. The equipment will 
be transported to Bulgaria by train from the Netherlands, 
through Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Romania. The one-time 
use of a transit corridor for UN needs does not contradict our 
legislation and conforms to our commitments based on Article 43 
of the UN Charter. In addition, sending an additional 
contingent of 200 "Blue Helmets" to Macedonia is in the interest 
of all Balkan states, because it is a preventive measure against 
the spread of the Bosnia conflict. 
  It is natural for Bulgaria to provide a transit corridor for 
UN military equipment. However, our leaders must first answer 
the following question: Why was this equipment not transported 
by air, as was the case with the first contingent of 300 U.S. 
"Blue Helmets" in Macedonia, and is the present U.S. request not 
a prologue to a request for a corridor for the transportation of 
Turkish "Blue Helmets" through Bulgaria's territory or by air? 
If the answer to this question is negative, the Bulgarian 
Government could agree to providing the transit corridor 
requested by Ambassador Montgomery. 
  The Americans cannot and do not want to understand our 
sensitivity and justified concern regarding the Turkish military 
presence in the Balkans. Perhaps this is so because their 
colonial ruler came from a different continent, or perhaps their 
current strategic interests are related to the expansion of 
their most loyal ally in the vast space between China and the 
Adriatic? Regardless of what their motives are, they contradict 
Bulgarian interests. Therefore, despite the fact that we are in 
the midst of a crisis and encounter grave difficulties, we have 
no other choice except to behave in a worthy manner, defend our 
independence and sovereignty, and sustain our principled 
position. Every retreat from this position is tantamount to 
treason.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Lazar Tomov: "Poor and Obedient"] </F>
  [Text] In the last two or three years, willingly or not, 
Bulgaria was dragged into two world-scale embargo operations. 
Both were imposed on us by the United Nations. We, as 
exemplary schoolgirls, unconditionally agreed to observe the 
world order and discipline. For this obedience we have received 
so far pats on the back and promises for the future, but not a 
single cent of compensation. This was the situation during the 
embargo against Iraq, which owes us almost $2 billion, and this 
is the situation now with the Yugo-embargo. Despite the fact 
that the UN observers accuse us of violating the embargo, it has 
already become clear that again we are the most obedient ones. 
Our obedience borders on stupidity, because while we export 
gasoline with bicycles or get involved in chicken-feed affairs, 
the Western states do not waste their time. Let us remember 
that time is money, especially in time of war. 
  Recently it was revealed that during 1992-93 alone the 
countries involved in the Yugo-conflict received significant 
quantities of weapons. The suppliers were Germany, Austria, 
Italy, Switzerland, and a prominent French company that 
specializes in the production of arms. Through (un)known ways 
"humanitarian" shipments reached the borders of former 
Yugoslavia. They contained almost 1,200 Stringer and Armarbrust 
anti-aircraft missiles, 120 T-72 tanks, 155-mm. howitzers, tens 
of thousands of automatic rifles, hand grenades, ammunition, and 
much more. While the Western companies amassed profits, our 
native parliament representatives nag each other even over 
absolutely unfounded embargo violation accusations. This is 
understandable to a certain degree. Since we destroyed our arms 
industry, economy, and agriculture, nothing is left to us but 
obedience accompanied by requests to compensate the losses 
caused by the embargo. According to some calculations those 
losses amount to $6-8 billion. Thus, in observing the embargo 
Bulgaria is losing real money, which it badly needs, especially 
now. It must be remembered that even if we receive a little 
something in the future, this will be something we have already 
spent in advance, and will have to return anyway to various 
pacifists and peacemakers with interest.

  [Text] The DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] wants 
[Transportation] Minister Kiril Ermenkov, [Agriculture] Minister 
Georgi Tanev, and Forestry Committee Chairman Khristo Todorov to 
be replaced. Our reporter Mariya Tsankova obtained this 
information from unofficial sources before the end of today's 
session of the DPS Central Council. 
  According to information from within the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party], the Socialists are calling for the replacement 
of Ministers Karabashev, Bikov, and Valentin Aleksandrov [of 
trade, industry and defense]; the New Alliance for Democracy 
reportedly wanted one of their number appointed foreign minister. 
  At today's Central Council meeting, Kadir Kadir proposed 
Khristo Totev for deputy prime minister if there is a cabinet 
reshuffle. The DPS maintained its view on the need for a major 
government reshuffle, but declares that if the cabinet falls it 
will join in the lottery for distributing candidates for cabinet 
posts between the parliamentary political forces. 
  According to BTA, DPS leader Ahmed Dogan said after his 
meeting with Lyuben Berov that the prime minister was in 
excellent health. Professor Berov has still not reached a final 
decision on possible cabinet changes. Everything is at the 
stage of taking soundings in the parliamentary groups, but by 
the end of the week he will probably have formed a clear idea on 
structural changes, Dogan said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kuzma Kuzmanov, director of the Kozloduy </F>
Nuclear Power Plant, by Veselka Damyanova; place and date not 
given: "Our Country Has the Potential to Protect Its First 
Nuclear Power Plant, Kozloduy Director Kuzmanov Thinks"] 
  [Text] [Damyanova] Why did you say the Kozloduy Nuclear 
Power Plant will close soon? 
  [Kuzmanov] It will be inevitable if we are not given the 
money we need to maintain the plant. I am not speaking about 
investment, simply about funds for maintenance. I do not even 
mean the funds needed to implement the plant's safety program. 
If we are not given the resources we need, we will have to 
close down Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. 
  [Damyanova] What is the basic source of funds for Kozloduy? 
  [Kuzmanov] The basic source is the National Electricity 
Company, from which we receive revenue (for consumed energy). 
Special measures must be adopted because it is the power supply 
issue that is involved here and we must receive the funds we 
need. In addition to money for maintenance, we also need money 
to develop the plant -- this involves investments. These must 
be pegged to inflation in order to ensure a proportional 
increase. I could understand a difference of 6, 8, or 10 
percent, but when investment is not coordinated with the 
inflation coefficient then the situation becomes dangerous. 
  [Damyanova] You also receive help from the West.... 
  [Kuzmanov] In fact, we receive a fixed amount of aid on the 
basis of an agreement between the government and the European 
Development fund. This is gratuitous aid for increasing safety 
and the conditions of exploitation, which in 1993 amounted to 12 
million francs [currency not further specified]. It has been 
increased to 20 million francs for the next three years. 
Obviously, this aid is significant, but not decisive. The 
money we receive from the National Electricity Company is 
decisive. 
  [Damyanova] Who else could help? 
  [Kuzmanov] I think that our country has sufficient potential 
and could protect its nuclear power plant, but there is no one 
to decide the issue.... We cannot allow the power plant to 
continue to be exploited under the existing conditions. 
  [Damyanova] Does the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant continue 
to be an evil myth for some people, as you once told KONTINENT? 
  [Kuzmanov] I said this in the past because certain circles 
are trying to present the nuclear power plant precisely in this 
light. I meant that several years ago the Western politicians 
turned Kozloduy into an evil myth. However, we showed the world 
that we can implement measures and improve conditions. We 
showed that the reactors about which it was said that they 
cannot function, could function after we obtained the 
appropriate permission from the relevant organs. 
  [Damyanova] Your colleague Delcasso said that if the problem 
Kozloduy faces at present happened in France, the relevant 
minister would immediately resign.... 
  [Kuzmanov] He even said that he could be imprisoned for 
something like this.... 
  [Damyanova] Do you have many problems? 
  [Kuzmanov] Yes, there are a lot of problems in Kozloduy, and 
let us not even mention the problems Bulgaria faces as a whole. 
However, there is an unwritten rule: always to follow closely 
the situation in every branch. Otherwise, you know very well 
what could happen if we had to close down Kozloduy. 
  [Damyanova] Who is interested in closing the plant? 
  [Kuzmanov] I do not want to comment on this issue. The most 
important thing for us is to receive what we are entitled to.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ivan Georgiev, "leader of the Bulgarian </F>
National Radical Party," by Magdalina Andonova; place and date 
not given: "We Are the Alternative That Scares Rulers"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Andonova] You use the 
concept of "denationalization" in your program. With what means 
will you struggle against it? 
  [Georgiev] I will answer you with an example. The 
Bulgarians in Aegean Thrace are called Slavonic Hellenics?! 
One of the ways we maintain contact with them is through the 
historical literature we bring there. This literature indicates 
their roots to them. We will attract this population by 
improving their economic prosperity and then they will strive to 
come closer to us. If we succeed to bring down the border 
barriers and create appropriate social conditions we will 
perhaps be able to bring them back to the bosom of the Bulgarian 
nation. In Germany for example, the authorities pay for the 
social security of their immigrants. 
  [Andonova] In anything related to foreign policy you use the 
principle "good is what is good for Bulgaria." Do you often 
read Machiavelli? 
  [Georgiev] Yes, I have read "The Prince," but this is not 
what we mean. If we, nationalists, do not unite Bulgaria we 
will perish. We are not like the Bulgarian Socialist Party and 
the Union of Democratic Forces, which could transport their 
interests outside the borders of our country. We need an 
economic and spiritual upsurge. It is well-known that no one 
likes the weak ones. 
  [Andonova] With what foreign parties do you maintain 
contacts? 
  [Georgiev] Jean-Marie Le Pen invited me to visit France. 
Their delegation will visit us in September. We are in contact 
with Haider's party in Austria, Paradzik's Human Rights Party in 
Croatia, and the Italian Alliance -- all of them nationalistic 
parties. We also have close relations with Zhirinovskiy's party 
-- we have an agreement to help each other at difficult moments, 
and in addition, our programs are similar. [passage omitted] 
  [Andonova] Do you intend to amend your style of behavior? 
Do you not insert hysteria in our society, which even without 
this has grave problems? 
  [Georgiev] The times are changing and so are the categories. 
No one has the moral right to blame a dying person who is trying 
to save himself. In some regions, for example in the Rhodopes 
and the Ludogorie, the people think that I am too meek and 
should be firmer. Against the background of this economic 
destruction the Bulgarians in some regions, Yakoruda for 
example, directly face a genocide. In those regions the people 
prefer only the Bulgarian National Radical Party. What about 
the burning of the Bulgarian national flag? The Bulgarian 
authorities keep silent about this sacrilege and do nothing. 
This fact speaks of the lack of a Bulgarian sovereignty. We do 
not have organs which could protect the property and dignity of 
the Bulgarians. [passage omitted] 
  [Andonova] What do you think the current Bulgarian borders 
should be? 
  [Georgiev] From the ethnic and historical points of view we 
are entitled to an additional 127,000 square km -- up to the 
Albanian mountains. More than half of Bulgaria is outside our 
borders. 
  [Andonova] When do you think you will come to power? 
  [Georgiev] We will form our government in the 38th National 
Assembly. The people want to get rid of everything that makes 
them feel inferior and unneeded. Nationalism is one of the 
alternatives. We have a very simple formula -- a rich nation in 
a rich state.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Party program coordination talks 
have started between the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], 
Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats], the Agrarian Alliance, 
and the Party of Entrepreneurs to lay the foundation for a 
coalition after the elections. This was announced at the news 
conference of the Agrarian Alliance. Laszlo Gardai reports: 
  [Gardai] I am sincerely sorry that the election campaign is 
not what it ought to be, the campaign chief of the Agrarian 
Alliance said. He considered to be news only the information 
from the various parties about who concludes a coalition with 
whom, but party programs were not aired sufficiently. There is 
no forum for a true show of colors, because, for example, the 
three-and-a-half-minute speeches on television on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays [party political broadcasts] are meaningless and 
instead of these, debates should be staged. [passage omitted] 
  The spokesperson for the party, (Klara Spirak), announced 
that four-party coordination has begun with the participation of 
the SZDSZ, Fidesz, the Party of Entrepreneurs, and the Agrarian 
Alliance on the economic, agricultural, education, and public 
security programs. 
  The Agrarian Alliance also signed a cooperation agreement 
with the Green Alternative and the cochairperson [not further 
identified] voiced her criticism that during the past four years 
no sensible law was adopted on environment protection. If the 
Agrarian Alliance gets into parliament, it will ensure that 
environmental protection is given a much greater role.

<F P=106> ["CS.N.L."-signed interview with Hungarian Democratic Forum </F>
Chairman Lajos Fur; place and date not given: "Most of the 
Issues Will Be Decided Between the Two Election Rounds"] 
  [Text] Lajos Fur, chairman of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF], thinks that a cooperation of divided 
national-commitment forces is impossible until the first round 
of the upcoming elections. Lajos Fur thinks that most issues 
will be decided between the two rounds of elections. He hopes 
that the uncertain voters will eventually vote for the MDF. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people say today that the MDF remained 
alone before the elections also because it deviated from the 
spirit of Lakitelek. Do you think this is true? 
  [Fur] If we look at the Lakitelek documents, it transpires 
that we have not deviated from any of the statements. It was 
clear at the time too that we did not call for radical changes, 
but we were for a gradual reform policy to avoid a radical 
change. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Then why are these accusations repeatedly 
coming up? 
  [Fur] There can be individual offense or unfulfilled 
ambitions behind this, or even the fact that some people 
imagined something else behind the concepts and not what they 
really cover. I am convinced that the things formulated at 
Lakitelek are being carried out. Naturally, the best ideas do 
not appear crystal clear in everyday politics. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] People with a national commitment find it 
difficult to accept that the political forces committed to 
national values are so much divided that they almost lack a 
chance. While their opponents created election alliances, the 
forces that call themselves national forces are divided and 
present everywhere, from the MDF and up to the tiny extremist 
parties, on the political arena. 
  [Fur] Unfortunately, this is true, and it is very sad. The 
situation is similar to the one prevailing in Poland, where the 
national forces are scattered. I can only guess the reason 
behind this. National feelings appear in many different ways in 
the political thinking. Of course, the liberal and leftist 
blocs are also split. In the case of nationally-commited 
parties, individual groups emerged more spectacularly. This is 
not a positive development, because if many people vote for 
these small parties, the national forces will lose many votes. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Have you already made any attempts to create 
unity? 
  [Fur] This is impossible until the first round of elections, 
but one cannot tell what will happen between the two rounds, 
because it is obvious that most of the issues will be decided 
between the two rounds. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] According to some opinion polls, the 
national and liberal parties, as well as the leftist parties, 
enjoy one-third of the votes each. At the same time, the 
trenches are very deep and an increasing number of people fear 
that it will be difficult to form a government. 
  [Fur] If I look at those who already decided to vote and 
also decided whom to vote for, these percentages generally 
reflect the truth. We also enjoy the support of at least 3 
million voters who have not yet decided even whether to go to 
vote at all. If this 40 percent can be mobilized, this might 
upset the forecasts and change the uncertain situation in our 
favor. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is it not strange that the least 
politically- informed people will decide on the elections 
results? 
  [Fur] They are also citizens of this country, only that they 
are not interested in the political life. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Political analysts often say that the fact 
that you constantly warn the citizens of a leftist danger only 
increases the socialists' popularity. 
  [Fur] I do not think that our warning awoke the citizens' 
leftist attraction. The measurable sociological factors that 
induce the fear of a possible leftist danger can also be 
scientifically demonstrated. In my opinion, in such a 
situation, we can defeat the leftist danger if we try to draw 
the people's attention to this and win over the uncertain voters. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] In that case, this is only a power that 
lasts for one cycle. The fact that you are present on the 
political arena signals that this is not a real danger. 
  [Fur] There are people who claim that this danger will only 
last one year, because they will not be able to govern after 
that. In my opinion, there is greater danger in such a turn, 
because the economy and the political mood will improve in the 
immediate future because they will not be able to spoil 
completely everything we have done so far. But there is a 
danger in the leftist method prone to administrative measures, 
namely that they will rebuild their own power with such a 
determination that it will not leave any scope for the other 
forces. However, this is only a supposition. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] With whom would you be willing to hold 
coalition talks? 
  [Fur] This will be the most difficult thing. And not only 
for us. Many people ask whether it is enough for the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] to form a coalition with [Workers Party 
chairman] Thurmer to set up a socialist government. Will Horn's 
left wing talk to the Workers Party at all? How will a 
social-liberal coalition disintegrate the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ]? We have natural allies, the Christian 
Democratic People's Party [KDNP] and the Smallholders' Party. I 
do not think that it is possible to hold coalition talks with 
Torgyan's smallholders. With Csurka's party? I cannot envisage 
this either. With Pozsgay? They call themselves both leftist 
and national. Who is left? 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The Federation of Young Democrats calls 
itself a national liberal party. 
  [Fur] The big question is what results they will achieve in 
the elections. It is good if they call themselves national and 
exclude the possibility of a coalition with the MSZP. But their 
chairman speaks lightly of the MDF and the government; if they 
continue to do this, I do not know if there is any basis of 
cooperation. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] A lot of concern has been formulated here in 
the course of our discussion. Are you optimistic? 
  [Fur] Yes, I am. Stalemate is the worst thing in politics. 
I hope that at least 1.5 million of the uncertain citizens will 
go to vote. They are the quiet and balanced people in private 
life and in the local public life who cannot give their votes to 
anyone else but to a balanced and sober national center party.

<F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Orban, chairman of the Federation of </F>
Young Democrats, by Attila Farkas; place and date not given: 
"Party Interests Should Not Have Priority Over the Interests of 
the Bourgeois Center"] 
  [Text] In our series with heads of various political 
parties, Orban Viktor, chairman of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [Fidesz], speaks about the chances of the liberal 
center, including the chances of his party. 
  [Orban] I see the bloc of liberal parties to become 
increasingly stronger, and I do not attribute importance to the 
occasional excessive statements. The chairmen of the four 
liberal parties agreed on the strategy to be followed until the 
elections. From the experiences of presenting candidates, the 
four parties representing the bourgeois center force came to the 
conclusion that, together, they have a good chance to get more 
than half of the mandates. Therefore, it has no sense to think 
of a social-liberal coalition. 
  [Farkas] Have the chairmen of the four party agreed on this? 
  [Orban] The party chairmen agreed to use all their power to 
gain 50 percent of the votes, and they are advancing to a 
relevant political strategy. I do not know who denies what, but 
I think that we need time for this position to infiltrate the 
parties. The Fidesz is in an better position in the sense that 
the party presidium decided on the political strategy to follow 
on coalition matters before the four-party meeting, and this 
strategy is identical with those of the four parties. 
  [Farkas] There is often suspicion coming from the Fidesz and 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] that the SZDSZ is 
approaching the socialists, while the other side is accusing you 
of "flirting" with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. Could 
this lead to a split between the two leading parties of the 
liberal bloc? 
  [Orban] In principle, it could. But, in my opinion, this 
debate is over now. In the course of our talks held last week, 
we accepted the guidelines to be mutually followed and, in my 
view, this satisfies both the Fidesz and the SZDSZ. 
  [Farkas] At the relevant news conference, the Agrarian 
Federation, the Fidesz, and the Entrepreneurs' Party rejected 
the ideas of excluding the social-liberal coalition, but later 
SZDSZ leaders denied that this issue was on the agenda.... 
  [Orban] Everyone says what he wants. Journalists were 
present at that news conference and they were able to hear 
everything; therefore, it is useless to make something out of 
this after the event. We said everything at that news 
conference and, in my opinion, the correct formulation was that 
there is no longer sense in thinking about a social-liberal 
coalition. 
  [Farkas] In your statements made in recent weeks, you 
clearly excluded the possibility of a Fidesz-Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] coalition. It seems, however, that your scope of 
maneuvering is smaller than that of your party. To what extent 
is this opinion different from that of the leading bodies of the 
Fidesz? Can one interpret this difference as a strategic split? 
  [Orban] This cannot be regarded as a strong difference, and 
I do not intend to step in the background or to resign at all. 
I have a clear opinion on how to solve Hungary's economic 
crisis. I argue in favor of this opinion and I hope that I will 
have a majority within the party. 
  [Farkas] What if the cooperation of the four liberal parties 
does not work after all? 
  [Orban] I do not know. In my opinion, we have no other 
choice, and this should be clear both to the SZDSZ and the 
Fidesz, as well as to the other two parties. These parties got 
into one camp not only through their identical programs but also 
through their common political interests, because every other 
form of cooperation only creates worse chances. This is 
particularly sensitive regarding the SZDSZ and the Fidesz, 
because these two parties were the most radical anti-communist 
parties four years ago, and we confronted daily those people who 
are still heading the MSZP. If we did this four years ago, it is 
impossible to be with them in a coalition. One cannot make such 
a turn, because the Hungarian public would not forgive us. This 
is equal to a situation in which a party wipes itself off the 
domestic political palette, and we must accept this. 
  [Farkas] It has often been said that "the four years have 
been nice, we have learned a lot, but now we want to be part of 
the government...." Do you see a chance for that? If not, 
will the Fidesz be able to stand four more years in opposition? 
  [Orban] I see chances, and this originates from the fact 
that the four bourgeois parties succeeded in presenting 
candidates. Regarding the Fidesz, I think we are moving forward, 
because we have gone through tests in the past four years, tests 
that every party can only handle with difficulty. 
  [Farkas] On what do you base your optimism? 
  [Orban] Opinion polls and the gathering of nomination slips 
show this. I think that the sympathy toward the policy 
represented by us is increasing and our prestige in the society 
is growing. We said last year that one should think in terms of 
a liberal center, and not in terms of a social-liberal 
coalition. We were accused a lot because of this, and we even 
lost several battles, but winning the final battle is very near. 
Now we must not fail and put party interests above the 
interests of the bourgeois center.... 
  [Farkas] A real war of messages has evolved between you and 
Gyula Horn. It seems that you appear most frequently in the 
declarations of the MSZP chairman, and not necessarily in a 
positive light.... 
  [Orban] This is not surprising. It was the same before. 
After a temporary fallback, Gyula Horn and his party found their 
old voice. Their voice resembles the tone flowing toward the 
Fidesz in 1988 and 1989. They spoke to us so aggressively and 
accusingly after 16 June 1989. In my opinion, every 
manifestation of the MSZP, including their videoclips, tones, 
and statements, speak about revenge, and this is their message 
to everyone, and especially to us. This tone is not new; I got 
used to this after 16 June 1989. The Fidesz did not get scared 
at that time either; nor do we think that we will get scared now.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Horvath, cochairman of the Hungarian </F>
Justice and Life Party, by Lajos Pogonyi; place and date not 
given: "The Proof of the Pudding Is in the Eating in Politics 
Too"] 
  [Text] [Pogonyi] Several leaders of the Hungarian Justice 
and Life Party [MIEP], including Istvan Csurka, said recently 
that, against the left and the liberals, you are ready to make 
peace with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], a party that is 
prone to shift to the left sometimes. 
  [Horvath] What the MDF did in its government activity helped 
the left and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] to come into 
their own. The Marxists who used to castigate private property 
before, became capitalists and large-scale land owners under the 
MDF government. 
  [Pogonyi] I do not understand. You mean they became large- 
scale land owners? 
  [Horvath] Yes, by purchasing huge areas in the course of the 
compensation process. On the basis of their acts, we must say 
that the MDF-government also served the interests of the left. 
We now expect the MDF to give up this activity, and then we 
might be able to talk to each other. 
  [Pogonyi] I heard and saw in one of the political film clips 
of the MIEP recently that your party is the one that is 
consistently carrying out the Lakitelek program. 
  [Horvath] We would like to suggest by this that we accepted 
the third way, the national solution. 
  [Pogonyi] Is the "leftist and liberal danger" so big in 
Hungary that you are ready to reconcile with the MDF? 
  [Horvath] I do not think that this would be a reconciliation 
between the MIEP and the MDF. The matter is that the leftist 
and liberal bloc is our common enemy, a bloc that perhaps does 
not have so much chance in the elections as it tries to project. 
In any case, they are greater enemies of the MIEP than the MDF 
or other national parties. 
  [Pogonyi] If I am correct, Peter Boross said recently that 
the MDF would not form a coalition with the MIEP in any 
circumstances.... 
  [Horvath] I do not know if he formulated this so firmly. We 
would not form a coalition with today's MDF either. In other 
words, if this is the way the present MDF is talking about us, 
we do not see anything special in this. 
  [Pogonyi] Your faction colleague in Parliament, Janos Denes, 
said recently that cosmopolitan liberalism is an ugly twin of 
communism. Please comment on this statement. What should we 
understand by this? 
  [Horvath] There is a very interesting American writer who 
wrote a book entitled "The Uncovered Capitalist." In its 
introduction, the author states that the communist conspiracy is 
only a tiny part of the global conspiracy. His arguments are 
quite convincing to me. The new world order tried to infiltrate 
the cells of Eastern Europe through Marxist internationalism. 
It failed, and now it is trying a different approach. 
  [Pogonyi] So it is not true what Peter Boross claims, namely 
that while the elections will be decided between the MDF and the 
MSZP, the liberal parties will fall off. 
  [Horvath] Although I cannot predict things the way Mr Boross 
can, but there is no problem whatsoever with the liberals. 
There are huge differences between the liberals. 
  [Pogonyi] For example? 
  [Horvath] There is a big difference between real liberalism 
and sham-liberalism. 
  [Pogonyi] Could you give an example of the latter? 
  [Horvath] For example, the present SZDSZ is such a pseudo 
liberal party which openly flirts with the old system and the 
communist and socialist parties. However, there is a tiny 
amount of liberalism in which we can find at least the seeds of 
national liberalism. 
  [Pogonyi] Are you perhaps talking about the Federation of 
Young Democrats [Fidesz]? 
  [Horvath] Yes, about the Fidesz. 
  [Pogonyi] If I recall correctly, the Fidesz has only been 
lately claiming to be a nationally commited party and a 
moderately liberal, center-like people's party. 
  [Horvath] Yes, but all this sounds more genuine since the 
well-known personnel changes that have taken place in the party. 
Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. 
  [Pogonyi] Speaking about the pudding and eating, will the 
MIEP get the 5 percent necessary for making it into Parliament? 
  [Horvath] Yes, it will. Regarding the number of voters, we 
succeeded in presenting lists in two-thirds of the country. We 
have a total of 70 individual candidates and 12 territorial 
lists. 
  [Pogonyi] What is your opinion about the fact that Izabella 
B. Kiraly's Hungarian Interest Party is almost nowhere before 
the elections? 
  [Horvath] I was quite certain about this. 
  [Pogonyi] And now a little about foreign policy: Istvan 
Csurka rejoiced at the victory of the Forza Italia in the 
Italian elections. In your opinion, will this be a lasting 
delight? 
  [Horvath] We do not yet know what kind of force the Forza 
Italia represents, but we do know that it occupies a position in 
Italian politics similar to our position in Hungarian politics. 
Istvan Csurka and I signed the telegram in which we greeted 
them. We regard the Forza Italia as a force that firmly opposes 
the left and rejects the half-heartedness of the center parties. 
  [Pogonyi] Were you offended by Zhirinovskiy's failure to 
invite you to the congress of his Liberal Democratic Party? 
  [Horvath] Zhirinovskiy and his party invited everyone, 
including the MDF and even Izabella B. Kiraly. We not only 
refrained from replying to him but also refrained from 
publishing the invitation in the press. 
  [Pogonyi] Why? It might have been unpleasant? 
  [Horvath] We consider the whole thing to be irresponsible. 
We regard Zhirinosvkiy as a dangerous politician of unclear 
roots, who is famous for his scandals, and not for his wisdom. 
  [Pogonyi] An obligatory concluding question: With what 
party would the MIEP form a coalition? 
  [Horvath] Regarding its political commitment, the 
Independent Smallholders' Party is the closest to us, just like 
most of the core of the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP]. 
  [Pogonyi] The radical Mikloses? Miklos Gaspar, Miklos 
Lukacs, and Miklos Hasznos? 
  [Horvath] I will not mention names, in order to avoid 
arguments or internal tension. We are talking about the marked, 
radical, and Christian right-wing group in the KDNP.

  [Text] Warsaw, 20 Apr--During Wednesday's meeting between 
Lech Walesa and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] parliamentary 
floor group, the president announced a return to cooperation 
with the SLD in order to create a new constitution of the Polish 
Republic. "A manly decision: We are returning to cooperation," 
Walesa said, adding that he took as an apology the floor group 
leader's acknowledgment of the president as the author of the 
citizens' constitutional initiative. 
  Kwasniewski said that "we willingly hand to the president" 
the authorship of the citizens' initiative. "If it is taken up, 
it will only be of advantage to constitutional work. I think it 
would be worthwhile to stop all of this ill-feeling in the 
interests of work on the large Constitution," the head of the 
SLD parliamentary floor group said.

<F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia network] </F>
  [Text] Katarzyna Kolenda will report to us on the latest 
events at the Sejm: 
  [Kolenda] Just after the meeting of the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] parliamentary floor group had ended, a totally 
unexpected and unplanned meeting took place between SLD leader 
Aleksander Kwasniewski and President Lech Walesa. This meeting 
was proposed by the president himself, and the coalition had 
been knocking in vain at the president's door for this meeting 
for several weeks. 
  Literally a dozen or so seconds ago, Walesa's news 
conference 
ended at the Sejm. The president did not want to say, however, 
what the private talks with Kwasniewski were about. He only 
said: We cleared up certain things that should not have 
happened in the past. The president did not want to say to what 
political facts he was referring. 
  The president also said that he did not see any need for a 
meeting with the entire coalition for the time being. In the 
president's view, the leaders of the SLD and the Polish Peasant 
Party should first agree on a new candidate for the post of 
finance minister and deputy responsible for economic affairs. 
Only then, after agreeing on this candidate, can a meeting take 
place. 
  At the news conference, the president said that Dariusz 
Rosati will not be his candidate for this post. In other words, 
the president upheld his declaration made earlier during the 
meeting of the SLD parliamentary floor group that he would not 
endorse that candidacy. 
  Asked whether he thought that today's meeting with the SLD 
parliamentary floor group and today's talks with Kwasniewski 
marked an end to the conflict of the past several weeks, Walesa 
said that this was not the case at all, that these conflicts 
will go on, and that he intends to cause them himself. The 
president indicated, however, that these conflicts are meant to 
help resolve very serious problems. 
  The president admitted that Kwasniewski's declaration that 
there will be no changes to the interim Constitution had upset 
his plans a little, because, as announced earlier, the president 
is going out into the country on 21 April, where he intends to 
convince the people of his arguments.

  [Text] Warsaw, 20 Apr--Decisions were made, we all admitted 
our mistakes--matters must move on, President Lech Walesa said 
during his news conference on Wednesday at the Sejm, commenting 
on his earlier meeting with the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
parliamentary floor group. 
  "I am satisfied with the apology and the admission that I 
was 
right, after all," Walesa said. During the meeting with the SLD 
group, its leader, Aleksander Kwasniewski, had acknowledged that 
the president was the author of the citizens' constitutional 
initiative. "I am not saying this in order to fight, in order to 
prove who was better. It is good that we have removed one of the 
problems that makes cooperation possible," the president added. 
  Lech Walesa said there had been no concessions on either 
side; there was the logic of facts and "a logic that said that a 
platform for talks has to be found." Answering a question from 
journalists on what he had won as a result of the meeting, 
Walesa replied, "I do not want to win anything for myself; I 
want to win peace, calm, and a good solution for Poland, and 
this has been achieved for today, it seems. There will be no 
tinkering with the Small Constitution, there will be no attempt 
on the powers of parliament and the president. We are left with 
work." 
  Asked by journalists if he accepts the coalition's aim of 
putting its representatives into the posts of deputy ministers 
in the ministries subordinate to him--Foreign Affairs, Internal 
Affairs, and National Defense--the president recalled the plan 
by Foreign Ministry head Olechowski, under which the political 
structures in his ministry would be made separate from the 
organizational structures, staffed by professionals. "If the 
coalition accepts that plan and brings it into those three 
ministries, I have nothing against that," Walesa said, adding 
that the agreement of the ministries concerned would, of course, 
be essential. 
  "If need be, of course--yes," the president said in answer 
to 
a question on whether he will soon meet representatives of the 
coalition. He added that, "for today," he does not see such a 
need. In the president's opinion, a suitable forum for this type 
of regular meeting in the future would be the National Security 
Council. 
  Walesa announced that he would soon be visiting all of 
Poland's provinces. The president denied that this is to be the 
beginning of his election campaign. "Encouraging people to take 
part in the local self-government elections, to make good 
election choices, that is not an election campaign, it is 
helping all those people who take the good of Poland seriously."

<F P=106> [Interview with Labor Minister Leszek Miller, leader of the </F>
Democratic Left Alliance, by Robert Krasowski and Igor Zalewski 
on 20 April; place not given: "Coalition Gains Strength With 
Every Day"] 
  [Text] [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Did one really have to use a 
constitutional weapon against the president? Could one not have 
come to an agreement without pointing a gun at the president's 
head? 
  [Miller] First, we should ask a question regarding the 
president's real goals. Is he ready to "live together," or 
will he fight the coalition with every possible means at his 
disposal? And we should keep in mind that he has quite a few 
such means: He is empowered to veto laws and to cause a 
decisionmaking paralysis, and he can join all those who think 
that "the worse it is, the better it is." So we could be facing 
deadlocks for months to come, which will be disastrous for 
Poland, but perhaps they will enable the president to gain the 
most right-wing and the most populist electorate that would 
constitute the basis for his support in the coming elections. 
If those are the president's goals, this war is unavoidable. 
We will then be dealing with such diverging interests that it 
will be hard to find any compromise. 
  But if, on the other hand, the president is of the view that 
such "living together" is possible, one should avoid making 
decisions that would make both sides' positions rigid, and one 
should look for compromise solutions. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Which scenario is more likely? 
  [Miller] Sometimes I have a feeling that the first scenario 
is more likely, and at other times I have a feeling that the 
second one is. At this particular time, I would be willing to 
admit that Lech Walesa is willing to cooperate. But I cannot be 
sure because the president is not consistent with regard to his 
views and feelings. He changes them rapidly, and then he sends 
conflicting messages to the public at large. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Suppose the Belweder grants certain 
concessions--would you be in favor of withdrawing the draft of 
amendments to the Small Constitution? 
  [Miller] If the president were willing to come to a 
compromise solution and to live together, then, yes, I would be 
in favor of that. But that issue is of no major importance 
after today's [20 April] meeting between Walesa and the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] because we gave up on the idea of 
amending the Small Constitution. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What kind of proof of a compromise position 
would you expect from President Walesa? 
  [Miller] First of all, a resolution of the issue of deputy 
prime minister for economic affairs. After all, there is a 
vacancy at one of the most important state posts, and that is 
not a normal situation. I view the president's reservations 
regarding our candidate as not very convincing. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] So are you saying President Walesa should 
accept Rosati? 
  [Miller] That is exactly what should be the topic of 
conversation. And either the president comes up with more 
serious reservations regarding Rosati's candidacy, if he can 
think of any, or he simply decides that Rosati is a good 
candidate and approves of him. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] All that looks like a dispute concerning 
prestige. 
  [Miller] If we want to achieve any personnel success in the 
future, we cannot lightheartedly abandon anyone we recommended 
because no one else will agree to be a candidate afterwards. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But everybody knows that, if there is 
anyone stubborn in Poland, it is Lech Walesa. Because he said 
that Rosati will not join the government, then, even if he 
agrees now, he will try to have it his way next time. 
  [Miller] Lech Walesa often changes his mind. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Are such joint stands by the entire 
coalition against the president a cementing factor for the 
coalition? 
  [Miller] Definitely. After all, they prove the falsity of 
all those speculations that Prime Minister Pawlak is allegedly 
staging a theatrical performance of some sort with the 
president, with an amazed public watching it. Right now, more 
and more people can see that is just not true and that we are 
dealing with a genuine difference of views. 
  Anyway, I think the prime minister must have recalled the 
fates of all of the president's loves, beginning with the first 
triumphant picture with Jozwiak and Malinowski [not further 
specified] and ending with recent events. Being an intelligent 
man, the prime minister can draw his own conclusions. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] So that means it used to be different 
before. 
  [Miller] I think that both Pawlak and the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] could have a feeling that the SLD is yearning for a 
different type of coalition arrangement. Some statements--like, 
for instance, that the SLD feels closer to the Democratic 
Union--could have aroused such a suspicion. And it is possible 
that the prime minister was looking for some kind of an 
alternative just in case it turns out that he has to build a 
coalition with somebody else. That is exactly what could have 
been the reason for the kind attitude taken toward the Belweder, 
which could be seen in particular at the beginning of the 
government's term. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Did you have a feeling during the crisis 
over Kawalec and then Borowski that the prime minister 
cooperates with the Belweder against the SLD? 
  [Miller] The rush with which all that happened, especially 
on the part of the president, may lead to such a conclusion. 
But I really do not think this was a message on Pawlak's part 
that he was acting against the SLD's interests, but, instead, it 
was a message that he intends to be the prime minister and the 
Cabinet's chief. 
  At any rate, I will be blunt about this: The previous 
finance minister acted inconsiderately. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] It can be concluded from what you are 
saying that both sides are to blame for the flaws in cooperation 
between the coalition partners. 
  [Miller] It all began with the prime minister. After all, 
the first scandal we went through, even before the formal 
establishment of the government, had to do with presenting the 
president with a different government composition than what had 
been agreed upon with us. But one can say that both sides 
provided a lot of reasons for the decrease in mutual confidence. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But, if a compromise with the Belweder 
turns out to be impossible, are you not afraid that the PSL will 
take the Belweder's side in the end? 
  [Miller] The coalition gains strength with each passing day. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Does Pawlak have to be afraid that, being 
only with the SLD and with no support from the Belweder, he will 
eventually be dominated by the SLD? 
  [Miller] No. Pawlak is this government's prime minister. 
Besides, I have a feeling that the PSL will win the 
self-governmental elections and that that will strengthen 
Pawlak's position. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Do you agree with the views expressed by 
some right-wing politicians that the president's moves are 
purely destructive and disastrous to the country? 
  [Miller] That would be an overstatement. Walesa has acted 
very responsibly at a few historical times. But I have a 
feeling that the closer we get to the elections, the more the 
president wants to approach Poland mainly from the standpoint of 
the elections. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But a preelection fever is also visible in 
the SLD. We have been getting messages concerning friction 
between Kwasniewski and Oleksy. We hear that a competition is 
beginning about who is to be the candidate. 
  [Miller] There are such differences, and they will be there 
in the future. You, gentlemen, are familiar with the SLD's 
leadership so you know that it comprises ambitious people who 
have their own views that they do not give up easily. There was 
a time when Kwasniewski and I were perceived to be opponents. I 
can see that a need is emerging for another antagonism-based 
duo. The election campaign will be conducive to a rise in 
temperature also within the SLD. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] In an article of yours published in 
TRYBUNA, you wrote that "there is a need for a coalition 
agreement in the presidential elections." Is that supposed to 
mean that the PSL and the SLD should come up with a joint 
candidate? 
  [Miller] If one could do that, it would be the best 
solution. But if we do not accomplish that, then what we should 
agree upon, at the least, is that we, for instance, will not 
interfere with each other in the first round of the elections, 
and that we support a joint candidate in the second round. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But it could happen that candidates for 
both the PSL and the SLD will enter the second round. 
  [Miller] In that case, that would be much harder to 
accomplish. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Is it conceivable to you that Pawlak should 
be the SLD's candidate in the elections? 
  [Miller] I refuse to answer the question. Or maybe not. 
During the previous presidential elections, I submitted 
Aleksander Kwasniewski's candidacy for president of the Polish 
Republic at a session of the Chief Council of Social Democracy 
of the Polish Republic. I will gladly do the same thing again. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Is the cooperation between the coalition 
partners up to now--within Pawlak's government--good grounds to 
believe that an agreement like that is possible? 
  [Miller] I think it is. We still have a few months ahead of 
us during which more events may unfold that will strengthen the 
coalition. Right now, I sometimes have a feeling that our 
electorates are closer to each other than the leaders, while the 
process of rapprochement between the electorates will continue. 
That pressure will also be of some importance.

<F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Markowski: "NATO Parliament Members in </F>
MON; Minister Kolodziejczyk in Cross Fire of Questions"] 
  [Text] A group of NATO parliament members who 
arrived in our country at the invitation of Professor Longin 
Pastusiak, chairman of the standing Polish delegation to the 
North Atlantic Assembly [NAA], were received on 19 April by 
National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Jerzy 
Milewski, secretary of State in the Ministry of National Defense 
[MON]. The group is headed by NAA Chairman Loic Bouvard and 
Jose Pereira, chairman of the NAA Committee for Central Europe 
and the former USSR. 
  The meeting, which lasted over an hour, turned into a "cross 
fire" of questions concerning the defense system and security of 
our country directed to Miniser Kolodziejczyk. They concerned 
such specific issues as the content of the presentation document 
pertaining to our participation in the "Partnership for Peace" 
program, the financial issues in Poland's integration with NATO, 
civilian control over the Armed Forces and the competence of the 
individual establishments and divisions in Poland responsible 
for security, changes in the budget of MON, our capabilities of 
increasing our participation in UN peacekeeping operations, and 
our opinion on the practical implementation of the "Partnership" 
program in joint exercises, trainings, and the education of 
Polish officers in Western military academies. 
  As has been shown, the range of the topics was quite broad. 
Minister Kolodziejczyk stated that the presentation document, 
which discusses our participation in the "Partnership" in 
detail, has been submitted to the Council of Ministers and that, 
once it is accepted, it will be officially forwarded to Brussels 
and Mons. It has a greater practical than political dimension, 
even though our interpretation of the democratic control over 
the Armed Forces has been included in the document, as well. 
Minister Kolodziejczyk also recalled that a parliamentary 
debate on the defense system is expected to be held in mid-May; 
the main topic discussed will be the separation of civilian 
supervision over the Army from its purely military structures of 
command. "During the debate, we want to stress," said Minister 
Kolodziejczyk, "that security, unfortunately, costs a lot; 
however, money invested in it is far less than the cost of war." 
  The minister admitted that there exists a real chance to 
strengthen the MON budget with the sums necessary to implement 
the "Partnership" and to modernize the Army's technology. As 
for civilian control over the Army, which was probably of 
greatest interest to the NATO parliament members, the minister 
stated that he expects the debate to result in new legal 
regulations in this regard; right now, in force are still the 
regulations issued in 1967, which give the defense minister not 
only administrative but also military powers. "In Poland we 
suffer from an overabundance of politicians who are competent in 
the issues of defense," added Piotr Kolodziejczyk. He 
illustrated this problem with the example of himself and 
emphasized that "this is a temporary state, which is bound to 
change." 
  The ministry's budget, which the guests asked about, is 
consistently decreasing. Since 1986, it has decreased by 60 
percent and right now amounts to 2.1 percent of the state 
budget. This information of the minister simply amazed the 
guests. They also scrupulously noted the words by P. 
Kolodziejczyk when he said that the West is absolutely closed to 
technical and technological cooperation in the area of the 
modernization of our Army. "If the condition of integration 
with the West is standardization, how can this condition be met 
if one is denied cooperation in this area?" the minister asked. 
  Military cooperation with our neighbors was also very highly 
evaluated: We are not running a race for NATO with them. We are 
interested in their integration with the organization as much as 
we are in our own. This was underscored by Minister Milewski, 
who also drew attention to the need to avoid the "gray zone" as 
soon as possible. This zone is becoming a natural temptation for 
Russia's expansion. As for our participation in peacekeeping 
missions, it was said that we have been a part of them for 
years, and it is not a matter of our willingness to increase our 
participation. It is, rather, a matter of cost. The UN is not 
famous for refunding incurred costs on time. It must be 
remembered that, because MON's budget is so small, it is 
difficult to credit such operations. 
  The NATO parliament members were obviously satisfied with 
the 
openness and substantiveness of the discussion in MON, which is 
of considerable importance in winning new supporters of the 
stand we have taken in our striving for integration with NATO.

<F P=106> [Interview with Michal Strak, minister and chief of the </F>
Office of the Council of Ministers, by Janina Paradowska; place 
and date not given: "An Apple on a Branch"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Paradowska] In your view, 
what is the coalition's strongest cementing factor? Power for 
its own sake? 
  [Strak] I will put it bluntly: lack of a better alternative 
for each of the coalition's partners. And this lack of an 
alternative is a more serious problem for the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] than it is for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
The numbers currently in parliament determine the fact that the 
SLD, along with the Democratic Union [UD], could possibly create 
a parliamentary majority, whereas the PSL would have to gain the 
support of two parties. 
  [Paradowska] What could one possibly establish that would be 
creative, based on a lack of an alternative? 
  [Strak] Lack of an alternative gives room for breathing and 
makes it possible to conduct politics without a dramatic fear 
that everything is about to collapse at any moment. So one can 
plan various measures a few years in advance because the time 
for the government to be verified is still somewhat in the 
future. 
  [Paradowska] This way, one can earn the "government of 
stagnation" label. 
  [Strak] We will see whether there will be stagnation. The 
opposition can attach any label it wants, but let us wait 
peacefully for what this government will be doing precisely in 
this longer kind of term. I think the evaluation will not be 
complete until the end of the parliamentary term. In my view, 
the length of authorities' term of office is a sanctity in a 
democracy. Unless we learn to respect it, it will turn out 
that, when it comes right down to it, we have not yet matured 
sufficiently to be able to function in a democratic regime. 
  [Paradowska] I came across the following sentence in one of 
your interviews: "The PSL finds it easier to say what it does 
not want rather than what it wants, which means it is easier for 
the PSL to present its political vision with precision and to 
regard it as a program." That is not a very encouraging 
confession, coming from a representative of a team that has 
gained power and wants to remain in power for the coming years. 
  [Strak] There used to be governmental teams that knew 
precisely what they wanted but did not quite know what they did 
not want, and how did they end up? We all know how. One could 
use the following academic criterion: "Could you list 10 items 
that you want?" But one could also approach it from the 
standpoint of what should not happen. This question is very 
important: At the stage of transformation in which Poland has 
found itself currently, do we need positive schemes more, or 
have we reached a point where various things have already 
happened and we must make a selection, which means facing the 
question of what constitutes a permanent accomplishment and 
should be perfected further, and, on the other hand, what it is 
that we decide to give up on. Let me use the example of 
self-governments. After four years, we know that 
self-governments at the gmina level should be further developed, 
whereas, for the moment, we do not have to organize 
self-governments at the powiat [small administrative unit] 
level. So you see that it is equally important to have positive 
as well as negative visions. 
  [Paradowska] So what are your positive and negative programs 
at the post you occupy? 
  [Strak] The positive program is expressed by four draft laws 
that concern: the Council of Ministers, organs of territorial 
governmental administration, civil service, and amendments to a 
law on state officials. Issue number-one, as far as the system 
of ruling the country goes, is to lead to an order in the 
governmental administration. A second element is about 
continuing with self-governmental reforms at the gmina [smallest 
administrative unit] level. The negative program is about the 
nonintroduction of self-governmental mechanisms at the powiat 
level or even at the voivodship level. Because relations with 
the church are also included in my range of duties, it follows 
that my positive program is to arrange these relations in a way 
that would prevent friction from occurring in the 
church-government rapport. Issues related to information 
circulation are also within my field of interest, and, in that 
area, we must lead to the government's stable presence in the 
media. 
  [Paradowska] What do you mean by "the government's stable 
presence in the media"? 
  [Strak] I mean that there should be opportunities where one 
can read or watch how the government would like to see itself 
portrayed. So we want to have a permanent column in 
RZECZPOSPOLITA. I also think one should consider how to make use 
of a provision in a law on radio and television that states that 
public radio and television have an obligation to present the 
position of the supreme organs of state power. Unfortunately, 
how that should come about was not specified in the provision. 
It is like an apple that someone has put on a branch high above 
the ground and no one knows how to reach. So one should build a 
ladder of some sort. 
  [Paradowska] In your view, what should such a ladder look 
like? 
  [Strak] One must simply define it as there being a time slot 
in the television schedule reserved for the government to 
present its position, the same way it is happening now with 
religious programs. 
  [Paradowska] There is the governmental "Balance" television 
program. 
  [Strak] Because the government is criticized for not coming 
through strongly enough in the media, one can presume that 
"Balance" is simply not enough. It is possible that we will set 
up a joint commission made up of government and media circles to 
discuss this issue and similar ones. 
  [Paradowska] All of your predecessors used to say that the 
Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] cannot be reformed, 
that it is unmanageable, and that it must be broken apart. You 
want to build new commissions around it. 
  [Strak] Generally speaking, I break anything apart with 
great reluctance. I think that, if something is already in 
existence, it is better to try to fix it. I have never been, or 
will ever be, a revolutionary. But I think the main problem 
with the entire power structure in Poland is that vertical 
structures function--and quite well, too--but that there are no 
horizontal structures functioning at all. There is no 
interministry coordination. So I would like to lead to the 
establishment of a whole range of bodies that would function 
within governmental structures and that would deal with solving 
different problems on a horizontal level. A single ministry 
will not solve, for instance, the problem of border crossings. 
  [Paradowska] So there will be separate bureaus for border 
crossings, plenipotentiaries for pathology, and so forth? 
  [Strak] It is not an issue of plenipotentiaries. These 
issues are dealt with by specific people in the various 
ministries, so one does not have to set up new posts, but we 
must create for them an opportunity to jointly watch the same 
reality. Coordinating functions can be localized in different 
places--be it in URM or in the individual ministries. It is 
possible that the issue of border crossings should be assigned 
to URM, whereas the issue of national minorities should be 
assigned to the Culture Ministry. 
  [Paradowska] What you are saying confirms the opposition's 
accusations about the desire to have a maximum centralization of 
all issues. 
  [Strak] That is not true. It can be concluded from 
information that I got on the organization of the British 
Government that over there, they have 150 different committees 
functioning across the different ministries. 
  [Paradowska] To what extent are your plans to increase the 
powers of voivodes [local governmental officials] linked to this 
coordination? And, also, what is the essence of these 
additional powers supposed to be about? 
  [Strak] That is quite a different issue. I would like to 
empower voivodes with decisionmaking powers regarding personnel 
issues in special administrations. So I do not want to take the 
special administration away from the ministers, but I want to 
make chiefs of the special administrations begin to feel that a 
voivode is also their boss--perhaps not boss number-one but with 
a sufficiently strong position that his view must be considered. 
  [Paradowska] But my understanding is that this arrangement 
of a "ministerial Poland" that we have suits you, and there will 
be no revolution in that regard, either? 
  [Strak] A major debate is ahead of us, concerning how the 
entire power structure should be organized. I think the number 
of ministries will remain more or less the same, but their 
structures will change and they will stabilize. Political posts 
will be clearly separated from substantive ones. In connection 
with the work we are conducting, the Foreign Ministry has 
already prepared its own organizational concept. 
  [Paradowska] So everything is in accordance with your 
concept of puttiang things in order, perfecting them, but not 
changing too much? 
  [Strak] One cannot destroy vertical arrangements that are 
already in place and thanks to which the state is functioning 
and is not in an anarchy. But in order to improve the process 
of governing, horizontal coordination must be activated. Once 
the ministries' structures are put in order, this mechanism will 
be set in motion. I think that, if we have any reserves at all, 
it is precisely in the area of improving the efficiency of 
ruling. 
  [Paradowska] So far, you have been improving the efficiency 
of ruling by replacing voivodes, or at least this is what you 
are most famous for. Because you plan to increase voivodes' 
powers, should one not adopt the appropriate statutory 
regulations first and then look for the right people? 
  [Strak] In theory, this is exactly as it should have 
happened, but, in practical terms, it must have happened the way 
it really did. 
  [Paradowska] You could not overcome pressure by party 
rank-and-file? 
  [Strak] It was not just the issue of pressure. Even before 
it occurred to anyone that I would be URM's chief, I already 
spoke at that point on my idea of what the regional power 
structure should look like, and I also said that it must be 
adapted to the changes taking place at the top. But one must 
not forget that, despite all of the propaganda about it, we 
replaced voivodes in just 29 voivodships. 
  [Paradowska] And you think that is not a lot? 
  [Strak] I do not know whether it is a lot or a little. It 
is more or less the same as in France during the change of a 
team. 
  [Paradowska] There are some differences. In France, there 
is a corps of highly skilled officials who must, for instance, 
be graduates of prestigious schools. 
  [Strak] In Poland, neither new officials nor old ones have 
graduated from such schools. My point is that we have just 
reached the limit of about 60 percent of changes that I regard 
as rational, but that does not mean that there will be no 
further changes. 
  [Paradowska] But the SLD has not participated in a major way 
in this booty sharing. 
  [Strak] It is not an issue of sharing booty between the SLD 
and the PSL. There were specific agreements between the SLD and 
the PSL in all of the voivodships except Wloclawek. The SLD has 
no reason to feel it was discriminated against. Of course, on 
the surface it may seem like the PSL got more posts, but the 
fact that the SLD candidates prefer to present themselves as 
nonparty, that is their business and theirs alone. I will not 
force anybody to show their current or past party identification 
cards. 
  [Paradowska] Your most recent idea is to introduce terms of 
office for voivodes, under which, with every change of 
government, there would also be a change of voivodes and their 
deputies. 
  [Strak] Why do you say change? Perhaps this is about 
stabilization. The point is to establish clear rules of the 
game and to lead to a situation where a voivode knows that, as 
long as a particular prime minister is in power, his situation 
is stable, while his future--I mean a renewal of the contract by 
the next prime minister--will depend on whether the voivode is 
loyal to the political arrangement that is in power at a given 
time, and also on whether he will not do too many things that 
could endanger his relationship with the government that could 
gain power. Then nobody could hold it against him that, while 
being a voivode under Prime Minister Pawlak's government, he has 
good rapport with UD or with some other opposition party. In 
that sense, the voivode is apolitical. 
  [Paradowska] I must admit I do not comprehend this 
apolitical nature completely. 
  [Strak] Why don't you analyze the fate of those voivodes who 
have remained at their posts but who do not get publicity? What 
have they done to deserve this lack of reservations about them? 
Simply put, in the previous period, they acted normally 
vis-a-vis parties that were in the opposition; to them, there 
were no better and no worse political forces or better and worse 
Sejm deputies. They were voivodes for everybody. So they 
avoided conflicts with anyone and now it pays back. So, if we 
define the rules, we should tell voivodes outright: You are 
supposed to cooperate with the government properly, and it is a 
question of your skills to make those who come after us approve 
of you, as well. Voivodes, both old and new, accept that. So 
as to avoid destabilization in case of a change, we are 
establishing the post of director general of the office 
[presumably of URM], which will not be subject to fluctuations. 
That will be exactly the state civil service. So we are 
presenting a certain comprehensive structure whose essence is to 
separate whatever is political (and thus subject to change, with 
the voivode being a political official under this concept) from 
what is civil service. 
  [Paradowska] I must admit ftaht I still cannot see what the 
stabilization is about. What is stable about a situation in 
which an entire government changes and almost, at the same time, 
voivodship leaderships also change? 
  [Strak] Why do you continue to assume that everything 
changes? 
  [Paradowska] Because the other parties will also have their 
rank-and-file members, who must be awarded posts after the 
victory. Unless that is so, it is your prediction that the PSL 
will rule forever. 
  [Strak] My assumption is that, after the change of 
government, a major portion of the voivodes will remain at their 
posts and the new prime minister will extend contracts with them 
because they will have had good rapport with everybody. Of 
course, some change is always unavoidable. 
  [Paradowska] What criteria did you use while looking for 
voivode candidates, naturally apart from the political criterion? 
  [Strak] These criteria are somewhat different with regard to 
voivodes coming from SLD and PSL lists. The SLD suggested 
people associated with the economy or with the administration of 
the scientific community--for instance, former university 
presidents or their deputies. So, basically speaking, the 
arrangement of people there could be described as a 
scholarly-economic one. Among PSL people, there are former 
chief officers of groups of villages and people who served in 
the state administration in the past. So one cannot say they are 
completely without any prior experience or preparation. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Paradowska] To what extent is everything that you do and 
proclaim--the relationship to self-governments at different 
levels, the new philosophy of stabilization regarding voivodes, 
the administration reforms--a result of decisions made within 
the coalition, and to what extent is this your own vision of the 
state? Is this Minister Strak's private business? 
  [Strak] Being here, it is my task to articulate my party's 
and the coalition's points of view. The coalition will be 
delivered this batch of laws, and it will decide what to do 
next. But it is beyond any dispute that the arrangement of 
state power must be put in order. We will debate in different 
groups regarding the way that should be accomplished, in both 
the voivodships, during sessions by the Council of Ministers, 
which, after all, is composed of coalition ministers, and in the 
Sejm. I can assure you that party interests or my private 
interests will not be of primary importance in that regard. The 
greatest party interest that is ahead of us to be accomplished 
is that, after four years in power, it will turn out that this 
country's functioning has improved. 
  [Paradowska] Thank you for the conversation.

<F P=106> [Speakers identified by caption] </F>
  [Text] After a three-hour debate on the annual report by 
the National Broadcasting and Television Council [KRRiT], the 
Sejm Culture Commission decided it would not decide today on 
whether or not to approve it. The deputies decided they would 
do this only after the constitutional tribunal has ruled whether 
the president is entitled to dismiss the chairman of the 
council. The deputies did not clarify if the approval of the 
report would depend on whether the post was held by Marek 
Markiewicz or Ryszard Bender. 
  [Zofia Kedziora] It is a total disaster, complained SLD 
[Democratic Left Alliance] Deputy Izabella Sierakowska about 
public television. She asked members of the council how they 
appraised their decision to appoint as head of public television 
Wieslaw Walendziak, who, according to the deputy's perception, 
was to have been a wunderkind of the council. 
  [Deputy Izabella Sierakowska] I must say with regret that 
this child of yours has not been a success at all. 
  [Marek Markiewicz, KRRiT] I do not know, I do not feel too 
comfortable in the area of obstetrics. I find it hard to say 
whether the child, in the form of Chairman Walendziak, has been 
a success, especially in the third month since its birth. 
  [Kedziora] Marek Markiewicz believes that it will be 
possible 
to appraise the television only after some time, once the 
effects of the recent transformations become visible. 
  Deputy Jerzy Wuttke accused the council of making PolSat a 
monopolist by awarding it the franchise. This is contrary to 
legislation. Before the council members replied, Deputy 
Wenderlich from the SLD asked whether the view expressed by the 
preceding speaker had been his own, that of the BBWR [Non-Party 
Bloc in Support of Reforms], or the Belweder's. 
  [Deputy Jerzy Wenderlich] This occurred to me when Deputy 
Wuttke said with apparent regret that the president's positive 
role was to all intents and purposes mentioned in only one 
sentence. 
  [Kedziora] According to Marek Markiewicz, for the moment, 
the 
only monopolist is public television, and only a national 
station can compete with it. 
  [Ryszard Miazek, KRRiT] We face the question whether Polish 
television is going to be private Polish television or Italian, 
German, British, or American. We replied as we have: We are 
building Polish private television--weak at the moment, but it 
is going to grow alongside Polish capitalism. 
  [Kedziora] It can be expected that the commission is going 
to 
examine the council report in late May or early June.

<F P=106> [Article by Professor Leszek Balcerowicz, compiled by </F>
Czeslaw Rychlewski: "What Kind of Economy?; Freedom Is a Source 
of Development"] 
  [Text] One must first of all pose the following question: 
What kind of requirements should the economic system in Poland 
meet? In my view, it should serve four goals: first, assure 
economic freedom; second, enable rapid development--that is to 
say, establish more and more jobs that would be increasingly 
productive; third, assure equal opportunities to the maximum 
extent possible--that equality of opportunity must not be 
confused with an equality of situation (for instance, of income 
levels); and fourth, limit to a minimum the harmful impact of 
practical economic activity on the environment. There is 
far-reaching coherence among these goals, meaning that whatever 
serves one of them usually serves the remaining ones, as well. 
  Long-term planning, which in enterprises is based on the 
stability of currency, the law, and politics, is the basis for 
development. Immediate goals cannot take precedence over 
long-term ones--for instance, a short-term consumption of 
investment activity. That is because the long-term consumption 
level will suffer as a result. The existence of efficient 
financial institutions is also indispensable. 
  Rapid and long-prospect development continues to require an 
economy based on private ownership. There is no justification 
for distinguishing so-called strategic branches that are 
supposed to remain in the state's hands. Telecommunications, 
transportation, and the energy industry should be subjected to 
the same kinds of requirements as other economic sectors. 
  A long-term development of the country is not possible 
without competition. Experience shows that detailed 
interventionist policies are the main source of corruption and 
inefficiency everywhere. Such policies impede individual 
entrepreneurship, which is a progressive factor provided the 
principle of equal opportunities--meaning that people's 
situations are determined by their mental and personal skills 
and not by the force of pressure applied on the state--is 
respected. With rapid development based on the principle of a 
major equality of opportunities, the discrepancy between income 
levels proves much smaller than in many countries that were 
developing at a slower pace because they were hampered by 
pressure groups linked to the state apparatus. A comparison 
between countries of Southeast Asia and Latin America proves the 
point. 
  Aside from that, capitalist principles of economic 
management 
can also be made to serve ecology--of course, to the extent that 
it is possible in the real world. If one just pays for using 
the resources of the natural environment, the huge, capitalist 
mechanism leads to a wise and reasonable exploitation of that 
environment. That can be clearly seen in developed capitalist 
countries. 
  At what stage are we? Our economy is in much better shape 
than what we inherited in 1989. But there is still a lot to be 
done, and, apart from that, some dangers are emerging for what 
we have already achieved. We should lower the inflation level 
to 5 percent per year at the most. That is going to be very 
difficult, given the strong pressure to increase earnings; the 
pressure is much greater than in other postsocialist countries. 
Trade unions must make a decision: Do they want to be a source 
of populist pressures that create unemployment, or do they want 
to contribute to creating new and productive jobs? 
Prodevelopmental relations in enterprises will take place only 
when profits are not constantly pressured by earnings but, 
instead, are devoted to investments. 
  I can also perceive dangers for economic freedoms and for 
competition. There is an attempt to return to monopolistic 
structures under the old banner of putting the economy in order. 
As a result of the introduction of compensatory payments on 
imported agricultural products, Poland is heading in the 
direction of an agricultural policy that has become the source 
of waste and social injustice in EC countries that are wealthier 
than we are. 
  There are also disturbing trends visible in privatization 
that have aroused political disputes anew. As a result of 
unstable and populist policies, we have already wasted about two 
years, and, right now, the privatization of more banks, among 
others, is being delayed again. Reforms of the social insurance 
system, the educational system, or health protection should not 
be postponed, either. Reforms condition the correct functioning 
of these important areas and are also nursing public finances 
back to health. 
  Economic reforms can be continued in an efficient manner 
only 
within an appropriate, stable political framework. 
Unfortunately, Poland lacks that at the moment. The vacuum in 
the Finance Ministry is cause for concern, as well as recent 
personnel decisions subordinated to party politics. There is no 
constitution that would protect the economy against the 
destructive influence of populist policies. Strong, 
constitutional safeguards of economic freedoms are needed. 
Constitutional provisions should also strengthen the central 
bank's position, and they should shield the budget against 
unprotected expenditures. Only then will we have a strong 
currency.

  [Text] [Announcer Grazyna Bukowska] Twenty percent of 
establishment posts in the Polish Armed Forces remain vacant. 
The posts of almost half of the NCO's [noncommissioned 
officers] establishment and one in 10 officers are not filled. 
The National Defense Ministry [MON] has, for the first time, 
declassified the information on employment in the Armed Forces. 
  [Correspondent T. Bialoszewski] There are almost 90,000 
professional servicemen in the Polish Army. Half of these are 
officers. There are 26,000 warrant officers. The professional 
NCO's are the fewest in number; there are only 19,000 of them. 
  [Major General Roman Harmoza, Defense Ministry head of 
personnel, identified by caption] "The Army is short of 46 
percent of its NCO's. It is they who form the backbone of the 
Army because they work directly with the soldiers." 
  [Bialoszewski] Signals services, commonly described as the 
neural network of the Army, are experiencing the worst personnel 
problems. The MON staffing command states that the problem can 
be resolved by contract service. Suitably qualified civilians 
are taken on by these services. 
  [Harmoza] "We have 1,000 contract servicemen of different 
ranks. This year we have taken 270 servicemen into the 
services, and the limit has been exhausted." 
  [Bialoszewski] There are almost 10 times as many people 
willing to do contract service as are taken on. The Army does 
not have enough money to employ all of the necessary people. 
The Army wants to rejuvenate itself. The principles of 
retirement of officers will be rigorously observed. The 
principles of promotion are also changing. 
  [Harmoza] "We will only be able to promote people if there 
is 
a vacancy for the promoted person. If we want to promote one 
major, one major will have to go." 
  [Bialoszewski] Professional soldiers constitute only 30 
percent of the Armed Forces; the ministry has plans for half of 
the Armed Forces in the year 2000 to consist of professional 
soldiers.

compared to February this year. A further increase is expected 
in April, given that loans have been granted to revive 
production, Todor Balos, member of the Vojvodina Economic

production in the first three months of this year was at a 
slightly lower level than in the same period last year, but the 
March results, which were better than in February, as well as 
the expected further increase in production, indicated that we 
are on the path of reviving production in line with the

<F P=106> [Article by Xhemail Rexhepi: "Autonomy Legalizes the </F>
Slavery of the Albanians"] 
  [Text] The Albanian political scene, especially in Kosova, 
has been very lively recently. The recent visits of Dr. Ibrahim 
Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, to Britain, France, 
and Italy, with their successful talks with high-level 
government officials of these countries, and especially his 
subsequent talk with U.S. President Bill Clinton, have 
contributed to this. It is worth mentioning here the first 
steps toward solving the question of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
Croat-Serb conflict in Croatia, as well as the forecasts by 
various international mediators that the problem of Kosova will 
soon be put on the agenda within the framework of solving the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia. 
<H5>  We Will Not Be Forgiven Recklessness </H5>
  Besides the schedule forecast for solving the crisis in the 
area of the former Yugoslavia, there have also been statements 
by various diplomats that the problem of Kosova "must be solved 
by extensive political autonomy," or that "The autonomy of 1974 
must be restored," and that "Serbia's jurisdiction over Kosova 
is not contested." There have also been statements by different 
parliamentarians, congressmen, senators, and publicists, who 
emphasize that "The crisis in the former Yugoslavia cannot be 
solved if the independent status of Kosova is not accepted. 
Only an independent and sovereign Kosova is a guarantee of 
peace and security in this area and even in the entire region." 
  Nevertheless, the first kinds of statement rather than the 
second make a greater impression in the media darkness of 
Kosova, in those two or three weeklies and the single daily that 
are rarely sure of appearing on their appointed days. This is 
understandable, if for no other reason than the fact that we are 
sensitive to being offered solutions to the Kosova problem with 
a "sort of autonomy," when it is well known that the population 
of Kosova long ago clearly declared their political will for an 
independent and sovereign Kosova. 
  However, what does not seem reasonable to us are the 
contrived explanations of the different kinds of autonomy and 
the many speculations over whether Serbia will be ready to agree 
to them or not. It seems that they prompted the leader of one 
recently formed party to announce that "Any solution that averts 
a conflict must be accepted!" When we consider all these 
extrapolations devised in cafe corners and especially in the 
commentaries of the Belgrade press, we realize that these 
matters call for great care, especially on the part of those who 
speak on behalf of the parties they belong to, but also those 
who in one way or another appear on the political stage and 
create public opinion in Kosova and beyond. 
  In the final analysis, now is least of all a time to forgive 
mistakes and political recklessness. We must also learn from 
our turbulent, splendid, and tragic history, when we lost the 
fruits of liberation struggles on the negotiating tables in 
London or Paris, and especially in Belgrade and at Brioni. 
<H5>  Autonomy Is Not a Solution </H5>
  It follows that it is not out of place, whenever recipes for 
a Kosova solution involving some kind of autonomy are offered, 
to demonstrate with facts and evidence to those responsible for 
such recipes that the problem of Kosova and its Albanians cannot 
be solved in this way. On the contrary, such a status merely 
legalizes their further slavery. 
  The Albanians in Kosova have now tried every kind of 
autonomy, in the time of the Ottoman Empire, and under 
Yugoslavia and Serbia. It is enough to mention the four kinds 
of autonomy that Kosova and the Albanians have experienced as 
part of Serbia and Yugoslavia in the last 50 years. As is well 
known, the autonomy of 1945, which was produced to suit the 
police and military regime of the Serbian and Yugoslav UdBA 
[State Security Administration], turned Kosova into a large 
concentration camp for the majority of Albanians, who for four 
years on end had fought alongside the allies against fascism, 
with the aim of exercising the right to self-determination and 
deciding their own destiny. 
  However, the right of self-determination was not achieved, 
and the Serbian regime shot thousands of Albanians as 
"counterrevolutionaries, Balists, and anti-Yugoslavs," and 
maltreated, imprisoned, and interned hundreds and thousands of 
others in all the Yugoslav prisons. They were accused of being 
kulaks for failing to hand in their grain and meat surpluses 
(when their children were dying of hunger), for not paying the 
state levy ("zajm") [Serbo-Croatian word used], or for not 
unveiling their women, while the acme of violence was reached in 
the infamous weapons-collection campaign. The archives of the 
Yugoslav UdBA itself, as published after the Brioni plenum 
[1966], reveal that during this campaign alone more than 30,000 
Albanians in Kosovo were beaten and bestially maltreated, almost 
100 were murdered, and hundreds and thousands of others were 
turned into life-long invalids. 
  Thus, in the first phase of autonomy, Kosova and the 
Albanians were allotted the status of slaves, which directly 
paved the way for their forced emigration to the steppes of 
Anatolia. The second phase of Kosova's autonomy did not prevent 
this unprecedented exodus. On the contrary, all possible means 
of state violence encouraged it, until about 250,000 Albanians 
from Kosova had emigrated to Turkey by 1966. At this time, as 
is well known, the Rankovic [interior minister in the 1950s and 
1960s] line lost the battle for power and domination in the 
hierarchy of the Yugoslav rulers. The Titoite line claimed to 
be against the "strong hand" of Yugoslav unitarism and embarked 
on a kind of reform and decentralization of power. 
  In the course of this reform, Kosova and Vojvodina won a new 
status of political autonomy, being accepted as constitutive 
elements and federal units, albeit within the composition of 
Serbia. This was the autonomy of 1974, under which Kosova and 
the Albanians indeed achieved important turning points in their 
educational, cultural, and economic development. However, even 
with this constitution, the Albanians did not achieve their 
historic goal of the right to self-determination, or even 
equality with the other peoples in the Yugoslav federation, 
although they were numerically the third-largest people in the 
former Yugoslavia. The fact that Serbia suspended this very 
same constitution while the federal Yugoslav state was still 
operating and did so without any opposition from the other 
federal units best shows what kind of basis it was for "the 
security and equality of Kosova and the Albanians." 
<H5>  Half-Baked Solutions -- Open Conflict </H5>
  In fact, it was precisely under the 1974 Constitution that 
the Albanians' disgust and discontent expressed in the spring of 
1981 were branded as counterrevolutionary, with the most serious 
labels and epithets being attached to the Albanians. By 1987, 
the police had maltreated about 650,000 Albanians or one 
Albanian in three in Kosova, besides imprisoning hundreds and 
thousands of others. By 1990, about 150 Albanians, mainly young 
people and including even children, had been killed. The 
Serbian regime has continued its violence against the Albanians 
under the autonomy guaranteed to "Kosovo-Methohija" four years 
ago. Under it, 12,000 Albanians have now been dismissed from 
their work; all the secondary schools and colleges; and even 
some elementary schools have been closed to Albanians; all the 
Albanian-language media, including Prishtina Radio-Television 
and the sole Albanian-language daily RILINDJA, and all the 
cultural and academic institutions have been closed, including 
most recently the Kosova Academy of Arts and Sciences and the 
Albanological Institute. By the same logic, and on the basis of 
the autonomy of "Kosova-Metohija," hundreds and thousands of 
Albanians are daily beaten, plundered, and maltreated, and 
hundreds are detained in prisons, while the "blessings" of the 
last four years have forced 300,000 Albanians to emigrate from 
Kosova and to seek their salvation in various European countries. 
  Because of all this bitter experience with autonomy within 
Serbia and Yugoslavia, the possibility that they might remain 
under the jurisdiction of Serbia with "some kind of extensive 
political autonomy" makes the Albanians' flesh creep. It is 
precisely for this reason that all the legitimate institutions 
of Kosova and virtually all the Albanian political parties 
rightly refuse all bargaining involving such solutions for 
Kosova. 
  In the final analysis, they are also bound by the political 
will of the population of Kosova expressed in the referendum of 
September 1991 and the multiparty and presidential elections of 
May 1992. The Albanians' restrained behavior so far and their 
declaration that the question of Kosova must be solved in a 
democratic way, through dialogue and peaceful means, are also 
strong arguments for the Albanian side not to accept any 
half-baked solutions, but only the settlement that the political 
will of the people demands -- a sovereign and independent 
Kosova. Any other solution leaves open the door for a conflict 
even greater than that seen so far, something the Albanians have 
never wanted.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] The chetniks have only stopped short of dropping an 
atom bomb on the residents of Gorazde. They are mercilessly 
killing the people with everything they have, destroying their 
houses. Yesterday afternoon, the chetniks wreaked havoc in 
Gorazde with aerosol surface-to-surface missiles PAB-275. 
Houses were destroyed as if made out of cards. The roofs of 
all buildings within a radius of 200 meters were blown off and 
the walls fractured. Dozens of people were killed and wounded. 
Owing to the constant fire by chetniks from the surrounding 
hills, the casualties have not yet been evacuated from these 
ruins. 
  According to reliable information, these missiles were 
launched from Pljevlje [in Montenegro, 60 km away]. This is yet 
another proof of the involvement by the so-called Yugoslavia in 
the aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina. The crying and screaming 
of the seriously wounded were heard coming from these ruins 
throughout the night. 
  The Gorazde valley is a valley of pain, screaming, and 
horror. The constant deadly pounding by those who do not 
distinguish between killing people and drinking water last night 
killed Dr. Muhamed Pasic, who, despite a rain of sniper bullets, 
went to give medical help to the seriously wounded in the 1 May 
district. 
  This morning, the chetniks are continuing the realization of 
their bloody plan, wiping Gorazde from the face of the earth. 
The chetniks confirmed this morning that they only understand 
the language of force and that they are unable to live in peace. 
The inferno in Gorazde continues. Further human lives are 
being lost, so is the hope among the survivors that someone will 
finally demonstrate to the chetniks with force that the time of 
cavemen, barbarism, and unpunished crime has long gone.

  [Text] Cajnice, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- This morning, the Muslim 
army resumed its heavy artillery and mortar attacks from the 
center of Gorazde on the Serbian army positions on the right 
bank of the Drina, the command of the Hercegovina corps of the 
Serbian Army has announced. Strong Muslim forces are in 
evidence near the town's bridges. Serbian military sources see 
this as a likely indication that the Muslims are preparing to 
destroy the bridges. Throughout yesterday afternoon NATO planes 
frequently flew over Serbian army positions at an altitude of 
over 3,000 meters. This provided the Muslims with an additional 
motive to intensify their combat activities. Yesterday the 
Muslims tried to use for propaganda purposes an incident in the 
chemical plant in Vitkovici, four kilometers south of Gorazde, 
to accuse the Serbs of using poison gases. 
  The Herzegovina corps command stresses that due to the low 
level of technological process in the plant there is a danger of 
a genuine ecological catastrophe throughout the Drina basin. 
Over the past 24 hours two Serbian fighters have been wounded 
on the Gorazde front.

  [Excerpt] Serb positions near Gorazde, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- 
Gorazde is neither destroyed nor devastated and any comparison 
with the flattened town of Mostar or -- as the Muslim propaganda 
likes to present it -- with Vukovar is in complete contrast with 
the real situation. A group of journalists who visited the Serb 
infantry units on the front line had the opportunity to see the 
extent of the deception used by Muslim radio in Sarajevo and the 
Western media, which insist that Gorazde is in flames and ruins. 
There is a clear view of Gorazde from the Biserna hill on the 
right bank of the Drina river about 800 meters from the town 
center. 
  On the river's left bank several floors of the Gradina Hotel 
are burned down. Several windows on one of the highest 
buildings in the town center are blackened with smoke. The 
glass roof on the sports hall is broken. Roofs on several 
buildings have been damaged. Minor damage, most likely from 
gunfire, can be seen on some buildings, and that is all. True, 
there are very few people in the streets and people run when 
crossing the bridges. But there is no evidence of any corpses 
in the streets, as reported by Muslim radio and the Western 
media that has been using it as its source. [Passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 20 April carries in its 
regular 45-minute newscast three reports on the situation in 
Gorazde. 
  The first item is compiled by Mediha Colo, who summarizes 
the 
contents of several "radio bridges" established today with 
Gorazde. In these reports, Gorazde Mayor Rijad Rascic and a 
group of local doctors in the war hospital describe the 
situation in the city. Colo says that "during the realization of 
the radio bridge, the communications center in Gorazde managed 
to establish a telephone line with the hospital, where doctors 
joined in the conversation." One unidentified doctor says that 
"just in front of the hospital, a smoke bomb landed, which did 
not make a lot of noise on impact, and some white smoke came out 
of it. Then there was something like a firecracker, which burst 
through a concrete surface. There were people under [words 
indistinct], the four of them were burnedt. One got away with 
horrendous burns. He keeps talking about some kind of air 
[words indistinct]." The doctor says "there are some missiles 
that are parachuted in. They fire the missile from above the 
city and it does not go over.... [pauses] It lands with a 
parachute on the street. The explosions are tremendous. They 
have even been firing Maljutka missiles at civilian targets, at 
apartments, at people." Another doctor says that "they are 
demolishing the hospital, there are people buried under the 
ruins, the hospital is almost totally in ruins." 
  Mediha Colo says that "in the next radio bridge, Rijad 
Rascic 
gave us information about missiles with aerosol fillings, which 
the chetniks have been firing today at Gorazde." Rascic says 
that "these missiles are intended to destroy fortifications and 
clear mine fields. They were used in the Vietnam War. They 
create pressure in the place of impact and kill within a radius 
of 80 meters and inflict serious injuries within a radius of 300 
meters. We have some shrapnel from one of these missiles, and 
there is this mark on it: (SAD-275) and something else, but I 
do not have the part with the other mark in my hand here." 
  Enes Musovic then reports from Gorazde that "no one here 
knows what to say to yet another blatant lie launched by the 
fascist scum from Pale. The chetniks have neither halted the 
attacks on Gorazde nor has it even occurred to them to have a 
unilateral cease-fire. Just at a time when Belgrade Radio in its 
own fashion lied to its servile listeners about an alleged 
cease-fire by the chetniks and the invented constant 
provocations from Gorazde, Gorazde came under cross fire from 
all the Chetnik artillery from all their positions." He says 
that "28 people were killed in just one hour today, 12 of them 
children." He says that "the chetniks are intensifying their 
attacks as the evening approaches. Attacks by strong infantry 
forces of Karadzic's murderers on the defense lines in the city 
center are supported by dozens of tanks from the direction of 
Kopaci and Jabuka." 
  Gorazde Mayor Rijad Rascic reports that "the chetnik 
criminal 
Radovan Karadzic says that only the left bank of the Drina River 
should be protected by the UN Protection Force. However, the 
public should know that there is no left and right bank in 
Gorazde. Gorazde is a city that cannot be divided, that will 
not be allowed to be divided. The people on the right bank have 
to know that they will not be betrayed; they should have 
absolutely no doubts about that. Everything on the right bank 
will be defended in the same way it is defended on the left 
bank. Anyone who might think that one or the other bank is 
safer is wrong. Both the left and the right bank are under a 
very serious attack, but our defenders are successfully 
organizing the defense with what they have, which is mostly 
their bodies."

  [Text] Zagreb, April 20 (AFP) -- A dozen Bosnian Serb 
tanks were seen travelling towards the besieged enclave of 
Gorazde, apparently heading for a Moslem-held munitions factory, 
UN spokesman Matthew Nerzig said here Wednesday. Four tanks 
advanced towards the town centre from the eastern town of Kopaci 
and five others from Jabuka at 12:30 (1030 GMT), said Nerzig, 
quoting reports reaching UN offices from the Moslem enclave. 
The Serbs "could be interested" in the Pobjeda (Victory) arms 
factory, he added. The factory was not included in the 
ceasefire signed Tuesday evening by the United Nations and 
Bosnian Serb leaders at their stronghold in Pale, being left for 
an overall peace settlement.

<F P=106> [By Moira Whittle, PA News] </F>
  [Excerpts] An Irish doctor today described in vivid and 
terrifying detail the horror of life for aid workers trapped in 
the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde. Mary McLauglin, who comes 
from Cork, is in a building in the town after travelling there 
to arrange medical evacuations before the violent Serb offensive 
began. She described, just hours before 10 patients were killed 
by a direct hit on the main hospital, how she and the other 
eight UN workers were "chronically frightened" and suffering 
daily from acute anxiety attacks. Dr McLauglin also spoke of 
her feelings of helplessness in the face of the tragedy suffered 
by the people of Gorazde. 
  A despatch sent by the group after today's shelling said 
they 
were "running out of words to describe what is going on ... It 
seems the Serbs are prepared to level east Gorazde 
house-by-house in order to gain control over it". 
  The doctor said: "Yesterday at 6 PM shells landed at the 
United Nations Military Observers building with four of them 
rocking it and spreading debris into the rooms upstairs where 
the refugees shelter. One blew a hole in the side of the 
building adjacent to us and a little boy lost both his legs. We 
cannot go to the assistance of such cases as it would be 
suicidal to face direct fire ... How many others were injured 
we do not know, but the fire raged in the building all night as 
a grim reminder to us of how close we come to direct hits." 
[passage omitted] 
  For Gorazde residents and refugees, she said conditions were 
"appalling". "They have no food and have to risk their lives to 
get water. Most shelter in badly-damaged buildings and the wet, 
foggy weather is no help. But worst of all is the constant 
shelling of the town and few have cellars suitable to protect 
against this. We feel so helpess in the face of the great 
tragedy for the people of Gorazde. Not a family has escaped 
death."

  [Text] Zvornik, Bratunac, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- UN 
peacekeepers and a medical team have not yet succeeded in 
entering Gorazde, although the Serbian side has done everything 
in its power to ensure that this mission is accomplished, 
TANJUG's correspondent learned from republic of Srpska army 
sources this evening. The same sources specified that republic 
of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic and UN special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi agreed on this mission on Sunday. It was 
allegedly agreed that 100 UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] 
members and a 60-member medical team should go to Gorazde. 
However, the Serbian side was not told about the reasons for 
delaying the start of the mission; it was told that the military 
and medical contingent could arrive in Gorazde tomorrow.

troops and 41 medical personnel left Sarajevo Thursday for the 
battered Moslem enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, UNPROFOR 
spokesman Major Rob Annink said. The convoy, including French, 
British and Ukrainian troops, would attempt to enter the 
enclave, where 65,000 are under Serbian attack, if the fighting 
there was not too intense, Annink said.

  [Text] Early this afternoon the defenders of the Croat 
Defense Council [HVO] and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army repelled a 
number of furious Serbian attacks supported by over 1,500 
artillery shells on the Dubravice-Bodariste-Vranovaca defense 
line in the northeast section of the free territory of Brcko, 
the political department of the 108th HVO Infantry Brigade 
reports. 
  In the Bodariste area, the HVO defenders have destroyed one 
Serbian tank and disabled an estimated several dozen attackers, 
the 108th HVO Brigade reports. The defense lines remain 
unchanged. There have been no casualties among the fighters. 
One civilian has, however, been killed in an artillery attack 
on targets of the free territory behind the front line, the HVO 
reports. 
  Apart from this, some 50 shells, ranging from 20 to 203 mm 
caliber, land every hour on the free territory against the 
backdrop of constant Serbian infantry attacks on the lines of 
defense. In the north section of the battlefield the defenders 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army repelled an infantry attack on 
the Vitanovici and Bajici area last night. Seven Serbian tanks 
supported this attack. The defense lines remain unchanged. We 
do not know whether there were any casualties, the 108th HVO 
Infantry Brigade reports.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- A woman was injured 
in Brcko today when the regular army of the Republic of Croatia 
launched an attack from multiple rocket-launchers, the 
information service of the 1st Krajina Corps of the republic of 
Srpska army said in Banja Luka this evening. This was the 
second multiple rocket-launcher attack today and it was carried 
out at about 1600. Altogether six rockets were fired from 
positions on the left bank of the Sava river, i.e. from the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia, and both attacks were 
launched on civilian targets. In addition to multiple 
rocket-launcher attacks, Croatian artillery fired 16 shells on 
the [Bosnia] Serb villages of Krepsic and Loncari from positions 
near Zupanja and Bosnjaci, also from the territory of the 
Republic of Croatia. Nobody was wounded in the attack but 
considerable material damage was caused. 
  Republic of Srpska army units were forced to respond to the 
attacks. 
  All this confirms assumptions that an intensification of 
attacks can be expected, which is aimed at severing the corridor 
which links the republic of Serb Krajina and the republic of 
Srpska with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic from Brcko] </F>
  [Excerpt] Another enemy tank -- the fourth one since the 
outset of the massive chetnik offensive -- has been destroyed on 
the Brcko front. After hours of shelling our positions this 
morning, the Serbian aggressor early this afternoon made yet 
another attempt to break through the defense lines with strong 
armored and mechanized forces. With heavy artillery support, 
the tank and infantry attack was carried out in two directions, 
toward Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca and Boderiste-Vranovaca. The 
fighters of the 108th Infantry Brigade and the 108th Motorized 
Brigade responded well to this attack. About a dozen chetniks 
were killed in infantry fighting and the fighters of the 108th 
Brigade fired a precise shot and destroyed a chetnik tank with 
the entire crew. 
  The fighters of the legendary 108th Motorized Brigade have 
asked us to say that this was their way of expressing their 
support for the defenders and citizens of Gorazde. They say: 
We cannot rout the chetniks around Gorazde but, for Gorazde, we 
will rout the chetniks here. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Poison gases were used against Serbian positions on 
the Glamoc front last night [19 April], forcing Serbian fighters 
to seek urgent medical care. Here is a report by Slavisa 
Sabljic: 
  [Sabljic] Aircraft flew over Serbian positions on the Glamoc 
front in the republic of Srpska at about 1800 yesterday evening. 
These planes, which are as yet unidentified but which were 
definitely enemy planes, left behind a thick veil of smoke 
forcing all Serbian fighters on the front line to seek urgent 
medical care to deal with breathing discomforts and sharp 
stomach pains. 
  Serbian military sources are awaiting the results of a 
microbiological analysis of specimens taken from the affected 
soldiers before giving any further details about the incident. 
They are confident, however, that an as yet unknown poison gas 
was used for the first time and that the brave soldiers of 
Glamoc were the first to experience the toxicity of the gas. 
  The thick toxic smoke was released by propeller aircraft 
which throughout yesterday flew over the Serbian positions on 
(Goricna), Golija, and (Bujaca), about 15 km from Glamoc. 
  [Announcer] We have learned that the specimens are being 
analyzed in Banja Luka and that the results of the analysis will 
be announced the day after tomorrow.

  [Text] Belgrade, 20 Apr (TANJUG) -- Radovan Karadzic, 
president of the republic of Srpska, today welcomed British 
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's statement that the peace 
process in Bosnia would be renewed soon. In an official 
statement -- TANJUG received a copy of the text -- Karadzic said 
that "the Serbian side is ready for talks, but only on the basis 
of equality." 
  "This means that the international community must make a 
step 
forward in connection with the sanctions, imposed on the entire 
Serbian nation, before any talks could start," stressed 
Karadzic. He specified that the international community must 
ensure that this time the Muslims negotiate with good 
intentions. The Muslim military offensives will no longer be 
tolerated and the Serbs will respond to them with resolve. In 
this context Karadzic reiterated that the Muslims caused the 
latest clashes by launching an offensive from Gorazde a month 
ago and that "they remembered Gorazde was a safe area only when 
they suffered a setback in their offensive." The international 
community should have inquired what a Muslim army division in 
full combat gear was doing in a safe area, said Karadzic. 
  In order for an "agreement to be likely," as suggested by 
Hurd, the international community ought to "stop playing the 
Muslim game of war and peace" and it must oppose the Muslim 
right to veto every peace plan which had already been agreed 
with the European Union and the United Nations. "The 
international community ought to make it quite clear to the 
Muslims that their impossible ambition to control the entire 
Bosnia, as a method of sabotaging peace, will not longer be 
tolerated," said Karadzic. "Peace will come to Bosnia only when 
the international community accepts the obvious truth that the 
Serbs have the right to self-determination just like the other 
ethnic communities," said Karadzic, concluding that "immoral and 
totally counterproductive sanctions and threats of force cannot 
conceal this obvious truth."

  [Text] Following the NATO decision to positively respond 
to request by the UN secretary general concerning the use of 
NATO air forces for the protection of safe havens in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haris Silajdzic, head of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina government, has sent a letter to NATO 
Secretary General Manfred Woerner, in which he says: 
  The NATO decision to positively respond to the request by 
the 
UN secretary general concerning the use of NATO air forces for 
the protection of the safe havens in Bosnia represents 
significant progress that will improve the safety of the 
civilians exposed to aggression from Serbia and Montenegro and 
lead to serious (?negotiations). On the other hand, Gorazde 
needs measures that should be taken immediately to save the 
children, women, and men exposed to intensive fire. Many of 
them were forced to come out in the streets with choking gas and 
irritants, and then massacred with mortar and sniper fire. As 
of yesterday, the aggressor forces have been using 
surface-to-surface missiles, which have devastating effects. 
Allow me to remind you that nearly 80,000 people have been 
forced to go to a very small area. They represent an easy 
(?moving, target) [words indistinct]. Your excellency, the 
bloodshed must immediately be stopped with all available means. 
I am sure that your organization will take action (?in the name 
of humanity and justice) without delay. The mass killing of the 
innocent civilians of Gorazde must stop. 
  This was stated in a letter which Haris Silajdzic has sent 
to 
Manfred Woerner.

  [Text] Members of the executive committee and chairmen of 
the municipal councils of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have confirmed their support for full 
implementation of the Washington agreement. At their meeting in 
Mostar, they also discussed the political and security situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
Zdenko Vranjes has filed this report: 
  [Vranjes] Addressing the members of the executive committee 
and the chairmen of the municipal committees of the HDZ in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, president of the 
presidential council of the Croat republic, said that a majority 
of the Croatian and Bosniak people want to implement the 
Washington agreement and the constitution of the federation. 
The minority of the Croatian nation which would like to 
obstruct the Washington agreement must be aware that it fulfills 
the interests of the entire Croatian nation both in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia. We must 
continue to stress that Bosnia-Herzegovina is our homeland in 
order to prevent anybody from making exclusive claims on it. 
  Zubak said that talks on the presidency of the federation in 
the interim period will be resumed with Bosniak representatives 
on Saturday. Under the constitution, the Croatian side wants to 
have their man as president in the interim stage. However, 
Zubak added, the Croatian side is prepared to accept a 
compromise if the Muslim side insists on a Muslim president of 
the federation and if Haris Silajdzic is nominated for this 
position.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with anonymous Bosnian Serb Government </F>
representative by Fausto Biloslavo in Pale; date not given: "We 
Are Getting Ready for the Worst"] 
  [Text] Pale -- "At this moment it is as if we were on the 
edge of a precipice, waiting for NATO to launch a large-scale 
attack," a member of the Bosnian Serb Government observes 
realistically. He agrees to speak with L'INDIPENDENTE only on 
the understanding that he will remain anonymous. "It is 
becoming difficult to launch an attack on Gorazde because our 
positions are now very close to the Muslims," the minister 
reveals. "If they decide to bomb us they could miss the target 
and hit their friends. NATO is ready to attack other targets 
such as electric power plants, telecommunications centers, 
government buildings, and obviously military detachments." An 
Gulf-style escalation of the war is therefore emerging. 
Meanwhile, in the streets of Pale, the capital of the 
self-proclaimed republic of Srpska, the loudspeakers from the 
police cars are asking people to donate blood to build up the 
stocks in hospitals. "We are getting ready for the worst," the 
L'INDIPENDENTE source assures. "We do not have antiaircraft 
bunkers for the civilians, but there are plans to evacuate the 
people quickly to the hills, far from military objectives, as 
our grandparents did during World War II." 
  Over the past few days, fathers of a certain age and 
government personnel are being drafted, even for very short 
periods of duty and in the zones behind the front, but in a kind 
of general mobilization. "Bosnia is not the Iraqi desert and it 
will not be easy to hit us," maintains the Bosnian Serb 
government representative. "The NATO pilots rely on computers, 
but when they have to find the objective in these impervious 
areas, they are obliged to fly at minimal height and at low 
speed. At that moment they are vulnerable to our antiaircraft 
weapons." According to the minister, NATO has scarce and often 
outdated information: "In one raid on Gorazde they hit a 
civilian house. A command had in fact been installed there, but 
15 days earlier." Another possible NATO target is a series of 
bridges on the river Drina dividing Serbia from Bosnia. "They 
can forget about cutting off our supplies and logistics by 
destroying the bridges," maintains the government source. "We 
have several alternatives ready. It would be a psychological 
move instead, designed to isolate us from the rest of the world, 
but in any case Serbia will not remain neutral in this war." 
The Russians instead are viewed with suspicion after Yeltsin's 
warning to the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde. The people are 
starting to think that their "Slav" friends are turning their 
shoulders on them and more than one person, even in government 
circles, has made it known "that there are 400 Russians in the 
Serbian quarter of Sarajevo. If Moscow were to give the 
Americans and the Europeans the go-ahead to bomb us, they would 
not be able to escape that quickly without our giving them a 
lesson first." On the Serbian side the deadly game with NATO is 
being carried out by two people: president Radovan Karadzic [of 
the republic of Srpska] is playing the political game using a 
carrot, while General Ratko Mladic [commander of the Bosnian 
Serb army] is playing the military game using a stick. "Mladic 
leads the Serbian forces at Gorazde in person," the 
L'INDIPENDENTE source notes. His charisma among the soldiers is 
increasing by the hour and this improves the morale of the 
troops." 
  Everybody is wondering whether NATO will also bomb Pale and 
the L'INDIPENDENTE source answers: "There are no military 
targets here, but there would be a symbolic value in the bombing 
of Pale. I am certain that it would be the last card that the 
allies could play."

  [Text] Belgrade, Apr 20 (TANJUG) -- Health Minister of the 
Bosnian Serb state (R.S.) Dragan Kalinic Wednesday warned that 
representatives of the "Medecins sans Frontieres" organization 
were misusing their humanitarian mission by giving political 
connotations to their reports. 
  In a letter addressed to Eric Stobbaerts, "Medecins sans 
Frontieres" mission chief in Belgrade, Kalinic said he was 
astonished at the statements by the organization's 
representatives in Gorazde, Moslem enclave in south-eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and by its central office in Paris, which 
contained negative political connotations for the leadership of 
the Serb state in that former Yugoslav republic. 
  Kalinic asked "Medecins sans Frontieres" to keep to the 
activities within the framework of its mandate, realling that 
the Serb authorities had highly appreciated the cooperation with 
this organization in the past, the R.S. news agency SRNA 
reports. The statements by the M.S.F. members have for some 
time been rife with anti-Serb stances, particularly those made 
by its representatives now in the Gorazde enclave, where the 
fighting escalated at the end of March after Moslems -- as 
confirmed by U.N. representatives -- started attacking the 
neighboring Serb territories. 
  Nevertheless, the M.S.F. representatives in Gorazde keep 
pointing out in their reports that Serbs are attacking that safe 
area, even though it was being used for military actions against 
the Serbs. 
  The U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali recently 
warned that Moslem safe areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina were being 
used for preparations for military actions, and that lawlessness 
prevailed and prostitution was common in those areas.

  [Excerpt] Prague, April 15 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
republic of Serb Krajina Milan Martic on Friday ruled out any 
possibility that Krajina be a part of Croatia. 
  "The only way to peace is the separation of Krajina from 
Croatia," Martic underscored in the Krajina political seat of 
Knin in an interview to the Belgrade correspondent of the Czech 
CTK news agency. "Life together is absolutely out of the 
question," he said. 
  "The sooner this reality is accepted, life will be better in 
Krajina and in Croatia," Martic said. 
  "Theoretically, it is possible, if Croats amend their 
constitution, that the (Krajina) people might agree to 
co-existence. And yet, even then, it would have to be solely 
through the will of the people," Martic warned. 
  ``As far as I am concerned, personally, I would never 
approve 
that. I do not trust Croats...(because) Serbs have bitter 
experiences [words indistinct] the Krajina president said from 
[passage indistinct] 
  Martic also strongly denied that President Slobodan 
Milosevic 
of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia had pressured him to get 
Krajina Serbs to agree to autonomy within Croatia in exchange 
for the lifting of the international embargo against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  "Milosevic is for us to chose our own way," Martic 
underscored. 
  Martic sees a compromise by the Serb side not in agreement 
to 
autonomy within Croatia, but in the restoration of economic 
cooperation and comprehensive normalization of mutual ties. "The 
main condition is -- equal relations between the republic of 
Serb Krajina and Croatia as two independent states." 
  "We are for peace, but not at all costs. We shall not buckle 
down under supposedly democratic pressure to give up our right 
to self-determination," Martic (?concluded). [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bosnian Serbs launched three artillery attacks on 
Zupanja and Bosnjaci at around 1445 today. The early warning 
center in Zupanja sounded a general alert at 1445 and again at 
1600, when a second attack began. A third attack began at 1650. 
Most of the shells landed in the Zupanja area. According to 
the reports we have received so far, dozens of mortar shells 
were fired on Zupanja and Bosnjaci, causing considerable 
material damage. Nobody was injured in the attacks.

  [Text] A news conference was held today in the European 
House in Zagreb by Stipe Mesic, the Croatian Assembly speaker, 
and Josip Manolic, the speaker of its Chamber of Counties, on 
behalf of the promotional board of a new political party, the 
Croatian Independent Democrats [Hrvatski Nezavisni Demokrati]. 
This promotional board has already been joined, they said, by 
17 deputies from the two assembly chambers from the ranks of the 
Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ]. 
  They cited the impossibility of influencing the articulation 
of party and state policies within Croatia's ruling party, the 
HDZ, as their reason behind the creation of the new party. 
These policies are in a state of crisis because, as they say, 
they are not discussed by the party's leadership since all 
decisions, they say, are taken by only one man. We were trying 
to initiate, within the HDZ, a debate on the fundamental issues 
of democracy and the law-governed state, and particularly on HDZ 
policies toward Bosnia- Herzegovina but we were denied this, 
Manolic, Mesic and their fellow-members Slavko Degoricija, Pavao 
Tomislav Duka, and Perica Juric explained. This is why, they 
said, they are going to convene the founding assembly of the 
Croatian Independent Democrats as early as this month. 
  We are deliberately aiming to bring about a polarization 
within the HDZ, Mesic and Manolic added. We do not intend to 
join the ranks of opposition parties. We want to cooperate with 
all parties, including even the HDZ. We support the government 
of Nikica Valentic while we reserve the right to criticize him 
for having no articulate program for Croatia's development, and 
for the implementation of privatization and denationalization. 
We want the government to govern in keeping with the 
constitutional principle of triple division of power, Stipe 
Mesic and Josip Manolic said at their news conference.

    [Editorial Report] Ljubljana DELO in Slovene of 5 April on 
page 2 carries a report by Vladimir Vodusek about personnel 
changes in the Defense Ministry and various military services 
following the dismissal of the former Defense Minister Janez 
Jansa, which the author sees as the beginning "of the 
disbandment of the Moris special brigade and the intensive 
banishment of Jansa's influence in the army." 
  As is reported, Tone Krkovic, commander of the special 
brigade Moris, and Darko Njavro, deputy security commander of 
the Moris special brigade, were relieved of their posts. 
Vodusek writes that these changes took place before the inquiry 
commission produced its final report about the incident in 
Depala Vas, which resulted in Jansa's ousting. 
  Although Krkovic proposed Boris Mikuz as his replacement, 
Vodusek writes, ``[new Defense Minister] Jelko Kacin decided for 
Vojko Pavlin from the Moste Polje training center, who was until 
the July war the commander of the Ljubljana province, and was, 
together with Miha Butara, replaced by Janez Slapar. The new 
commander will probably set up an entirely new office of 
assistants. In political circles, one could have detected, for 
quite some time, plans to reduce the numerical and striking 
power of the special brigade, which also got its epilogue in the 
accusations about the coup, the replacement of Janez Jansa, the 
dismissal of Anton Krkovic, and the stripping of Darko Njavro's 
authority. 
  "Beside Tone Krkovic, both [defense] state secretaries 
Franci 
Znidarsic and Gorazd Vidrih offered their resignations. Jelko 
Kacin did not accept the resignation of Albin Gutman, commander 
of the republican Territorial Defense Headquarters, although one 
could have noticed from the media that he `allegedly stood too 
much to the side' in the Smolnikar case. On the other hand, 
government adviser Miran Bogataj, who took over the internal 
investigation of Milan Smolnikar's arrest and in the 
[parliamentary] commissions supposedly advocated Janez Jansa too 
openly while did not identify with the views of the Liberal 
Demoracts enough, will be promoted to a state secretary." 
  As the article says further, Milan Zver, the chief of 
Jansa's 
cabinet, and press representative Nika Dolinar are also leaving 
the Defense Ministry and so is Maja Stojnic, who is in charge of 
the international liaison. 
  "Big surprise are the rumors that the hitherto chief of the 
Government Information Bureau Mile Setinc would become the head 
of the military security service [VOMO]. Dusan Mikus, as a 
moderate professional agent, is probably really not the must 
suitable man for the potential use of VOMO for political 
purposes, however the military intelligence service is, amidst 
the general chaos, the only satisfactory constant in the 
intelligence sphere," Vodusek writes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Davorin Kracun, Slovene minister for </F>
economic relations, by Guenther Guggenberger; place and date not 
given: "Upswing After Recession"] 
  [Text] [Guggenberger] Mr. Minister, in the past few years, 
production decreased while unemployment increased in Slovenia. 
What are the trends? 
  [Kracun] In some fields there was still a decline in 1993. 
However, according to the calculations made so far, there has 
been an upswing in the economy as a whole. 
  [Guggenberger] What is your explanation for that? 
  [Kracun] For our economy, which exports more than 60 percent 
of its production, the worldwide recession and above all the 
recession in Europe was a major obstacle. Now the situation is 
more favorable. It was possible to open up new markets, and we 
have changed some general conditions in our country. 
  [Guggenberger] What do you mean by that? 
  [Kracun] For some time, a new law on enterprises has been in 
force in our country. The next step was tax reform, as a result 
of which the taxation of profits decreased to 25 percent. 
Compared to other countries, this is very low. Foreign 
investors can import machines and plants without paying duties. 
We resolved privatization as one of the most important reform 
steps. It concerns the field of the previous social property -- 
these were firms that were formally in the hands of the 
employees, who, however, did not have any right to sell them; 
enterprises owned by development funds and bank reorganization 
funds, and actual state property such as steel works, the postal 
service, and railroads. 
  [Guggenberger] How far has the privatization process 
advanced? 
  [Kracun] Some years will pass before it is concluded. Some 
enterprises have to get out of the deficit zone. 
  [Guggenberger] That is to say, the state will hardly act as 
an entrepreneur in the future? 
  [Kracun] Yes, in this way we are following Western 
developments. 
  [Guggenberger] There are plans to develop the 
infrastructure. 
  [Kracun] In the next five years, we will build 300 km of 
superhighways, above all in the southwest-northeast direction 
from the port of Koper to Lendava at the Hungarian border and 
the connection between Maribor and Spielfeld. The railroads will 
also be modernized. 
  [Guggenberger] Economic relations with the European states 
are of utmost importance for Slovenia. What are they to be like 
in the future? 
  [Kracun] Several agreements with the EU and the European 
Free Trade Association [EFTA] are already in force now. The 
trade and cooperation agreement with Hungary guarantees us duty 
free trade for about 90 percent of all industrial goods. The 
trade agreement with the EFTA is not quite so favorable. At 
present, we are negotiating a free trade agreement with this 
group of countries. In this way, both EFTA and the EU will be 
relatively open markets for us, except for agricultural 
products. Moreover, there are bilateral free trade agreements 
with the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The same with Hungary and 
Poland will follow. We also have appropriate contacts with the 
Baltic states, Romania, and Bulgaria.

<F P=106> [Article by Bozena Kriznik: "Behind the Political Stage: </F>
Talks With Eight Directors"] 
  [Text] Ljubljana, 15 April -- A recent visit of Iranian 
Foreign Minister Velayati in Slovenia was not of a purely 
political nature as one could have concluded from the 
composition of the Iranian delegation and sparse information 
from the official diplomacy. Namely, the Iranian guest responded 
to the invitation of Minister for Economic Activity Dr. Maks 
Tajnikar to attend a ceremonial dinner in Brdo. Among the guests 
were also the directors of the eight Slovene companies who are 
the biggest exporters to this Asian country. In the talks that 
lasted approximately three hours they exchanged opinions on the 
most topical issues, also discussing the settlement of debts, 
and examining possibilities for further cooperation. 
  Minister Tajnikar first presented the economic situation in 
Slovenia to the Iranian guests and in this way demonstrated that 
our economy is going through a phase of revival, that we have a 
developed technology, balanced foreign and domestic trade -- 
proof that we are a serious economic partner. A joint 
appearance on foreign markets, for example, would be to mutual 
advantage while Iran would probably also find it interesting to 
break through into Europe via Slovenia. We could use good 
political relations for the strengthening of the economic ties. 
  A group of businessmen (consisting of Dr. Joze Duhovnik from 
Litostroj, Aljosa Ivancic from Iskra Ponti, Dr. Mirko Opara from 
Smelt, Bojan Mavko from Iskra Sistemi, Maksimiljan Senica from 
TAM, Andrej Kokalj from the Slovene Ironworks, Dr. Alenka Brvar 
from Iskra Elektrooptika, and a representative of Iskra Tel) had 
the opportunity to present their problems and views on 
cooperation directly to the foreign minister and his entourage. 
They discussed concrete deals, new initiatives prepared by the 
Slovene companies, the degree of viability of various contracts, 
and also the Iranian debt of approximately $19 million. They 
redefined some issues. The Iranians showed particular interest 
in the transfer of technology (Iskra, Slovene Ironworks, TAM). 
They also agreed that the Iranian ambassador will visit 
individual companies to agree on concrete deals. 
  'Ali Akbar Velayati was told that the Slovene economic 
delegation will visit Sarajevo shortly and, on that occasion, 
meet with the top Bosnia-Herzegovina officials and economic 
representatives. In Brdo they, thus, also discussed how Iran 
and Slovenia could participate in the reconstruction of Bosnia 
-- which is a great interest of Slovenia's. They also spoke 
about the idea according to which companies from Slovenia and 
Iran would participate in cooperation deals while Iran would 
also finance some of the projects of this kind. The aid would, 
therefore, not go directly, but through some of our companies. 
Minister Tajnikar will inform the Bosnian leadership of this 
offer. 
  Discussing the Iranian payment problems -- this issue was 
raised first by the director of Litostroj -- Veleyati said that, 
a week ago, their central bank passed a decision to resolve the 
payment problems in the shortest possible time. It seems that 
payment problems are not as critical as to threaten the economic 
cooperation between the two economies. It does not hopelessly 
involve poor payment record of the Iranian side, but objective 
circumstances that can be understood, and delayed payments. 
Also, Iran is striving to improve its payments' discipline. It 
is important that Slovenia has a market and certain privileges 
from it; Iran is primarily interesting for us because of oil 
(which we do not buy from the state, which demands to high a 
price, but on the free market). 
  The companies whose directors met in Brdo are among the top 
10 Iranian partners and exporters and their deals amount to 
several million dollars annually.

Conference"] 
  [Text] At his first news conference, Russian Ambassador to 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Yuriy Petrovich Trusin announced his country will open an 
embassy in Skopje at the beginning of May. The conference 
focused on Moscow's position on events in Bosnia. He described 
the situation there as dangerous. The Russian view, he said, is 
this conflict must be resolved through an equal cooperation 
between the United States, Russia, and the European Union, but 
under UN surveillance. Moscow insists that the parties in the 
war declare an immediate cease-fire and sit down at the 
negotiating table. Trusin said Russia also demands and urgent 
lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. In regard to 
yesterday's statement by [Deputy Foreign Minister] Churkin that 
Russia ought to break negotiations with Bosnian Serbs, because 
of their failure to keep promises, Trusin said it was an 
emotional remark and added his country's attitude toward the 
Bosnian crisis remains unchanged.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Ljubomir Janev, general manager of </F>
the "Makpetrol" oil firm, by S. Padora; place and date not 
given: "Driving at Old Prices"] 
  [Text] The government decision of two days ago on the 
abolition of the 10-percent customs fee for import of oil 
derivatives not only will help avoid possible disturbances in 
the fuel supply, but it will also mean a stable price, that is, 
maintenance of the price that is now paid by consumers. If not 
for longer, users can stay "cool" at least until 30 June, which 
is the date until which this decision remains valid. It is also 
a period in which all is possible, even what the optimists hope 
for -- the lifting of the embargo imposed by the southern 
neighbor on Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] on 16 February. 
  What the "abolition" of the customs fee in fact means, and 
how it is going to be reflected in the price, the supply, and 
consumption is the subject of our discussion with "Makpetrol" 
general manager Ljubomir Janev. 
<H5>  Costs </H5>
  The additional burden on the price, as Mr. Janev said, was a 
result of the eastern transport corridor which has been used 
since the embargo. More precisely, according to the specific 
customs regulations, the crude oil arriving in the country for 
refining was not taxed until that period. That same fact 
brought about the only possible alternative -- to "drag" only 
oil products for which taxes are to be paid, which burdened the 
price and increased the costs. Moreover, the transport costs 
became five times greater than before (when the crude oil 
arrived by railroad from Thessaloniki directly to Miladinovci). 
  "Because of all this, and with the aim of avoiding 
difficulties in the supply, we asked the government to abolish 
the customs taxes on oil products, since it was not our desire 
to buy it abroad and transport it via the eastern corridor -- 
that was simply imposed on us. After some discussions in 
government commissions it was finally agreed that our request 
was substantial and it was good that the government understood 
the problem, because by decreasing the taxes a more stable price 
and a better management is provided," Ljubomir Janev said. 
  On the other hand, since the 10-percent customs fee applied 
after the embargo was simply not "planned" in the annual budget, 
it was decided to apply it retroactively from 1 March. 
<H5>  Supply </H5>
  As far as the situation in the supply is concerned, as 
Ljubomir Janev pointed out, the situation is under full 
"control." Although there is a quantity of crude oil in the 
Thessaloniki port valued at $7 million ($4 million for 
"Makpetrol" and $3 million for the Skopje Oil Refinery), for the 
time being all financial deals for purchasing oil derivatives 
from the East and the West are successfully covered. At this 
moment, 5,500 metric tons of Italian gas have been transferred 
in the country, and an equal quantity is expected to arrive at 
the Refinery from the same supplier. Moreover, an agreement was 
signed this month with the Bulgarian company "Neftokhim" for 
42,000 tons of derivatives from Bulgarian producers. It is also 
news that in the days to come there will be discussions on a 
peak state level for convoy transports that will cross the 
Macedonian-Bulgarian border two to three times per day in a 
well-organized way and without delays. This would buy time, but 
the very fact that the time and handling costs will be shortened 
means a good saving. 
  "The experiences of the previous and the present embargo 
have 
greatly contributed to our good organization and, with the great 
help of the government and its interventions, the road for the 
derivatives has been shortened. Instead of using fuel tankers 
travelling for days from Burgas to Macedonia, we are now using 
the railroad transport across Bulgaria. More precisely, the 
derivatives arrive by railroad to Sandanski, Plovdiv, and Sofia, 
where they are loaded on fuel tankers; thus the time is 
shortened and the distribution dynamic is much better," Ljubomir 
Janev told us. 
  Beside the eastern transport, there are negotiations with 
Albania for the possible use of the western coast. There is an 
intention to lease two tanks for light derivatives in Valona, 
and it has been agreed to purchase 7,000 tons of "virgin oil" 
for Macedonia, in order to discharge the capacities which can be 
used for storing derivatives for Macedonia from Italy, Rijeka, 
or other suppliers sailing on the Adriatic Sea.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Z. Petrov: "Is Only Big Money at Stake?"] </F>
  [Text] In Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] there exists a real hunger for arms. 
According to psychologists and sociologists, the reason for 
such an enormous increase in interest for these kinds of objects 
for taking human lives lies in the rising uncertainty of the 
citizens for their personal security, as well as in the 
psychological determination preconditioned by the military 
activities in our close and not-so-close region. One of the 
most common examples of the enormous interest of the citizens in 
the purchase of arms are the long queues in the Interior 
Ministry department for issuing permits to carry and possess 
arms. As a matter of fact, the shops selling these "goods" are 
the ones that are the most visited in Skopje. The shopkeepers 
say that guns, firearms, hunting knives, and "Rambo" knives are 
the most popular. 
  In other words, arms are slowly becoming an indispensable 
tool for the new businessmen, politicians, and often for common 
people, too, who are ready to pay 1,000 German marks [DM] or 
more to purchase a good "Magnum," "Beretta," or the somewhat 
cheaper "Zbrojovka," "Zastava," or "TT." In a way, one can 
somehow understand the interest in firearms for personal 
protection reasons, such as the guns and pistols for which there 
is a legal regulation for carrying and possessing (the permit 
issued by the Interior Ministry). The problem arises when we 
talk about light infantry armaments -- automatic rifles, machine 
guns, mortars, bombs, mines, or sniper rifles, in which case we 
cannot speak of a traditional Balkan love for "shooting" or 
self-protection. Even at weddings, when only until recently guns 
and pistols were fired, we now often hear the firing of 
automatic weapons as if it were a real front line. Wherever 
there are arms, there are unprofessional handlers (there was 
such a case two years ago when a citizen was killed while a 
person was shooting dogs with an automatic rifle), but there are 
also real professionals, that is eliminators, as was the case of 
the triple murder in Strumica. 
  The police reports say that last year 42 cases (there were 
39 
in 1992) of illegal trading and possession of explosives were 
discovered. Then (in 1993) four machine guns, 34 automatic 
rifles, 33 bombs, a mine, 8,532 rounds of different ammunition, 
6,290 grams of explosives, 112 meters of slow burning fuse cord, 
72 powder cartridges, and 50 explosive fuses were taken from 92 
persons. In most of the cases the arms were bought through 
different channels from Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Croatia, as 
well as from the arsenal of the former Yugoslav People's Army, 
from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Speaking about the illegal arms trade, it is a well-known 
fact that they can be purchased at almost all greater market 
places in Macedonia, and the prices for these "assortments" are 
not a secret at all. "Kalashnikovs," for instance, can be 
purchased from DM1,500-2,000 apiece, but if greater quantity is 
bought, the price is drastically decreased. Automatic rifles of 
the types "Makarov" or "Scorpio" can be bought for 
DM1,000-1,500; pistols and semiautomatic pistols, depending on 
the model and the year of production, cost from DM400-1,000; a 
bomb sells for DM50; while the average price for ammunition is 
DM1 per round, again depending on the kind of weapon it is used 
for. 
  What is especially indicative in the context of arms 
smuggling is the fact that most often they end up in western 
Macedonia. As a matter of fact, it is no secret that the 
citizens of Albanian nationality are the constantly hungry 
market for weapons, and they are the greatest customers of the 
illegal arms trade. The big actions of the Interior Ministry in 
the Struga village of Radolista of a year and a half ago, as 
well as the recent action in Gostivar, connected to the 
"all-Albanian paramilitary army," indicated the last station for 
smuggled arms, because aside from the common automatic rifles 
which are usually supplied from Albania (the Chinese version of 
the "Kalashnikov"), bombs were also discovered, as well as radio 
stations, mobilization lists, literature, uniforms.... 
  In spite of the rigorous fines, according to which criminal 
charges become unavoidable, it is a fact that arms are coming 
into our country from all sides. The statistical data related 
to the phenomenon called illegal import and possession of arms 
indicate a tendency toward continual rise, and the number of 
these criminal acts is constantly increasing. It is a social 
problem, with further serious political implications, because it 
is not just necessary to stop an illegal profitable business, 
but a potential powder keg which can explode at any time. 
Ultimately, the danger can be clearly viewed in the fact that 
nobody in the state knows the psychological stability or mental 
balance of each one of those carrying a "Colt," a "Magnum," a 
"Smith &amp; Wesson," or a "Walther" under the coat.

<F P=106> [Article by Katerina Perknerova: "Baudys's Palm Reading"] </F>
  [Text] In mid-February, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
(Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party) refused 
to share a discussion table with former Minister Vacek in the 
television studio. He justified this fact by saying that, when 
Vacek was minister, only the Army's symbols were being 
repainted, but the Army had not been transformed. According to 
Baudys, only under his leadership has the transformation of the 
Army begun. The key question is what our idea about 
transformation is. It is certain, however, that the defense 
minister intends to present a long-term transformation project 
in the summer--one and a half years after his assuming office. 
From this viewpoint, the thing is clear. We should present 
some figures, however: The Czech Republic Army had 92,599 job 
positions on 1 January. According to experts, the optimum 
number should be 65,000 soldiers. Since 1990, 777 units have 
been abolished; of these, 132 were abolished last year. A total 
of 187 units have been newly established. The Air Force 
discontinued its operations at seven airports. A total of 6,594 
people left the Army in 1993; of these, 4,303 were officers and 
20 generals. According to Baudys, this not the right time for 
personnel changes.... 
  Mr. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), a member of the Defense 
and Security Committee, said in an interview for RUDE PRAVO in 
February that, "in the three most recent years, almost nothing 
has changed in the Army." At the recent meeting in Harrachov, 
he even stressed that, if the positions of platoon, unit, and 
troop commanders are not filled (only 35 to 40 percent of these 
positions are filled), "the Army may face collapse." J. 
Pospisil, Baudys's deputy and Fejfar's party colleague, is 
rejecting this catastrophic vision, but he, too, believes that 
the Army is losing between 150 and 200 competent officers, who 
do not believe in the prospects of the military profession. The 
Czech Republic Army has reached the figures planned for 1996. 
We are not going to comment on Baudys's idea that colonels and 
lieutenant-colonels should take over the positions of warrant 
officers. 
  I see today's situation in the following way: Fearing more 
screenings, personnel purges, and similar Baudys's actions, 
professional soldiers who have been in service for a long time 
are taking the first opportunity to leave the Army for civilian 
life. Fejfar is convinced that this applies not solely to former 
political instructors and military counterintelligence but also 
to expert professionals--for instance, elite pilots. Young 
people are not eager to join the Army because no one can tell 
them in which direction the Army will develop. 
  Baudys's being in darkness as a minister has its effect on 
the Army, too. Having no concept for transformation, he cannot 
tell the Czech factories what orders the Army will place. It is 
quite possible that he does not realize that the development of 
a new tank takes not several months but years. He believes that 
the purely professional Rapid Deployment Brigade is an important 
transformation step. This brigade should be established on 1 
July. Foreign military experts believe that such a short time is 
unrealistic for training the brigade. 
  Baudys believes that it is alarming that cases of wounding 
soldiers, of even death cases, are on the rise. He assured us, 
however, that he gave the task to General Staff Commander 
Nekvasil to adopt efficient measures. 
  The problem is that no simple order can solve the problem of 
the decomposition of our Army. If the training is at minimum, 
pilots do not fly the necessary number of hours, there is 
disorder in Army units, and military material is being stolen 
(the Defense Ministry registered 3,500 cases of illegal activity 
by soldiers). Then no wonder accidents resulting in death are on 
the rise, too. 
  If Baudys says, in view of this bad situation, that the 
basic 
transformation of the Army will be completed in 1995 and the 
Czech Republic Army will be prepared to join NATO, this seems 
like palm reading to me, which the minister demonstrated in a 
television show directed by Simek, rather than a realistic 
evaluation of the prospects of the Czech Republic Army.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Devaty, security and information </F>
service director, by Jiri Stastny; place and date not given: 
"The Security and Information Service Is Satisfied With 
Control"] 
  [Text] The parliamentary Defense and Security Committee 
debated the government bill on the Security and Information 
Service [BIS] on 13 April. This bill should regulate the status 
of BIS members, the utilization of intelligence-gathering 
devices, and the BIS status and its control. After the debate, 
we asked interim BID Director Stanislav Devaty: 
  [Stastny] The majority of the amendments provide you with 
more powers than the draft bill you have presented. Why were 
you so restricted when drafting your bill? 
  [Devaty] When we worked on our draft, we based our 
considerations strictly on the Principles for the Law on 
Intelligence Services. Our draft has undergone a very rigorous 
vetting procedure. BIS welcomes the changes, of course, because 
they allow us to work better. 
  [Stastny] Are you satisfied with the fact that BIS is under 
the control of parliament? 
  [Devaty] I welcome any kind of control. This protects me as 
well. For instance, when I am attacked in the press, I can 
address this control body and demand that this problem be sorted 
out. In my opinion, the parliamentary committee should control 
all BIS activities because it is responsible for them. A 
separate law will define what will be in parliament's 
jurisdiction. 
  [Stastny] How do you view volunteers for cooperation with 
BIS, and what is their role in the fight against organized crime? 
  [Devaty] The basic requirement is the will to cooperate. 
There is no other alternative. Cooperation with those people is 
one of the methods being used by all of the secret services all 
over the world. In some instances, if we want to penetrate into 
the structures of organized crime, this cooperation becomes 
indispensable. 
  [Stastny] The Interior Ministry has initiated tougher 
procedures against various extremist groups. Is BIS also 
preparing a similar step? 
  [Devaty] Of course, our service also deals with such 
problems and closely cooperates with the police. Unlike the 
police, however, we do not have executive powers; therefore, we 
pass all of our information on these groups to them. I believe 
we have done enough in this sphere; therefore, we are not 
planning further steps. 
  [Stastny] In what spheres do you cooperate with the police, 
specifically? 
  [Devaty] We cooperate with them when working on specific 
cases. Important information--about organized crime, for 
instance--is passed on to police departments that deal with 
them. Then, we can take steps like we did in the Buontempo 
case. Our service can ask the police for cooperation, and vice 
versa.

<F P=106> [Article by "(km)": "HTT, the Manufacturer of Tamara, Is </F>
Developing a More Advanced Passive Radar"] 
  [Text] Prague--Tesla Pardubice HTT, manufacturer of the 
Tamara passive radar, which, according to experts, can reveal 
even the "invisible" U.S. Stealth reconnaissance aircraft, is 
developing a more advanced new-generation passive radar. This 
information has been confirmed by Chief of the General Staff 
Major General Jiri Nekvasil. 
  Representatives from the Pardubice-based enterprise, 
however, 
do not want to divulge anything about this new system, which 
should be called Borap. "We will not discuss the things under 
research; they are taboo," declared Rudolf Barak, president of 
the HTT Group company. Nevertheless, he indicated that special 
enhancements to the current Tamara system are involved. 
  Tamara can reveal aircraft against which current radar 
systems are ineffective. It is similar to the U.S. AWACS early 
warning system. However, as opposed to active radar systems, 
which emit radio waves and assess their reflection, Tamara only 
receives radio impulses from the atmosphere. 
  So far, the Army has refused to purchase more Tamara systems 
for its arsenal because it is waiting for the completion of the 
more advanced system. The Defense Ministry currently has at its 
disposal one Tamara radar and two of its antecedents, the Ramona 
system.

<F P=106> [Article by Josef Maraczi: "Some 18,000 Soldiers Were </F>
Persecuted"] 
  [Text] On Saturday [16 April], a declaration was issued at 
the nationwide conference of the Military Association of the 
Rehabilitated (VSR), whose members are soldiers persecuted for 
political reasons between 1948 to 1989. In the declaration, 
there is a statement that care for the rehabilitated soldiers, 
retired soldiers, and widows of professional soldiers, plus 
assistance in building a modern army of our democratic and 
sovereign state, are the goals of this social organization. 
  The number of soldiers and civilian employees of the 
Military 
Administration who were persecuted for political reasons between 
25 February 1948 and 1989 is about 18,000. They are officers, 
warrant officers, and others. Some of them were even executed 
or emigrated from the country. After November 1989, some 11,000 
applications for rehabilitation were submitted. The Central 
Rehabilitation Commission found 2,000 cases to be unfounded. A 
total of 9,000 people were rehabilitated. 
  The VSR associates 3,826 members in 81 organizations. Josef 
Svab, commander of the Military Hospital in Olomouc, was elected 
new chairman of the association at a conference on Saturday. In 
his speech, he said that, in view of his profession and the age 
of the members of the association, he considers his main task to 
be solving the social and health problems of the rehabilitated 
soldiers. In the social sphere, the association wants to push 
for the completion of the rehabilitation of people persecuted 
for political reasons in the 1950's and 1970's. 
  The association also wants to put legal responsibility on 
the 
officers who participated in the preparation of repressive 
actions of the communist regime, such as "Norbert", "Vlna", and 
"Zasah" [cover names for actions conducted by former State 
Security], and the suppression of the 1969 demonstration 
commemorating 21 August [anniversary of the Soviet-led 
invasion]. In cooperation with parliamentary deputies and the 
Defense and Security Committee, the association is interested in 
drafting new legal documents applicable to the Army, and a 
consistent implementation of democratic changes in the Army. 
  Some participants in the meeting have shown dissatisfaction 
over the absence of Defense Minister Baudys, who did not excuse 
himself. Jiri Nekvasil, General Staff commander of the Czech 
Army, was also criticized, mainly because of the letter he had 
sent to the meeting and that was described as offensive by the 
participants. This applies mainly to the passage in his letter 
in which he said that he would not participate in the meeting 
because "our ideas about the activity of your civilian 
association with respect to the Army of the Czech Republic 
differ." Commander Nekvasil also said in the letter that "he 
cannot accept the idea that some members of the association are 
trying to establish a separate group of soldiers within the 
Army." However, he appreciated the activity of those who 
contribute, using their experience, to the fulfillment of the 
current tasks of the Czech Army. 
  The participants in Saturday's meeting are writing a letter 
to Nekvasil in which they express surprise at the fact that no 
representative from the Defense Ministry or the General Staff 
took part in the conference, despite the fact that the 
association is interested in cooperating with both bodies. "A 
difference of opinion alone should not be a reason for a 
negative stance of the Army command toward our association and 
activity," the letter by people who were persecuted by the 
communist regime and rehabilitated after November 1989 states.

said in an answer to an AFP reporter's question. The Romanian 
Government had an open attitude in 1992, when King Mihai I was 
in Romania; in autumn 1993 he was asked to adopt a clear 
position toward the rules of the Romanian Constitution. "I do 
not want to take similar measures to those taken throughout 
history by France, Italy, or Greece (in connection with former 
monarchs and their direct descendants). Therefore, we want to 
have a clear statement from him," said President Iliescu, who 
avoided giving a clear answer to the question: "Will King Mihai 
be granted an entry visa to Romania?"

<F P=106> [Article by Oana Stanciulescu: "Iliescu-Milosevic Agreement </F>
-- As Soon as Sanctions Are Lifted, Bega Canal Will Become Free 
Trade Zone"] 
  [Text) "One of the quickest ways of reviving the Yugoslav 
economy is to use the infrastructure of Romanian industries, 
which are largely complementary with the Yugoslav industries," 
said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic at the recent meeting 
with Premier Vacaroiu. The Yugoslav economists, the Foreign 
Ministry's note reads, believe that for the complete revival of 
economic productive departments one needs a minimum of 18 years, 
something that from a social viewpoint is inconceivable. 
  In these conditions, one hopes for Serbian-Romanian 
cooperation, mainly in the areas of metallurgy, machine 
building, electrical engineering, electronics, chemicals, and 
the pharmaceuticals industry. By starting with these actions as 
soon as sanctions are lifted, the exchange might reach a volume 
of 1 billion dollars by 1995. In this way, the revival of the 
Yugoslav economy could be completed by the year 2000 and the 
Romanian economy could make up for the losses suffered as a 
result of the dismantling of the CEMA market and loosening of 
relations with the CIS. 
  The aforementioned note also mentions that the Romanian side 
expressed agreement with the cooperation projects presented by 
the Serbian guests. However, it insisted that they should take 
place only when sanctions are lifted, because currently the UN 
Committee 724 sometimes shows a totally unjustified rigidity 
toward any commercial operation with Yugoslavia. 
  At the meeting of the two countries' presidents, when the 
sides examined the results of the talks, the Serbian side 
launched the idea of building a free trade zone along the Bega 
Canal [which crosses Timisoara], as soon as international 
political conditions permit it. Considering that the idea of 
creating certain free economic zones is a long-standing wish of 
President Iliescu's, it was regarded with great interest and 
will be implemented as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Ion Cristoiu: "A Dangerous Precedent for the </F>
Social Democracy Party of Romania"] 
  [Text] One cannot say that the new ministers who emerged 
after the latest governmental reshuffle have started on a left 
foot. At least this applies to their relations with the press. 
At the Ministry of National Defense, Minister Gheorghe Tinca, 
for instance, boosted up the press bureau, which is now holding 
news conferences on a weekly basis. If we also consider the 
fact that they appointed a young lady whose looks are crushing 
the male journalists as the ministry's spokesperson, we can see 
that we are dealing here with an attempt by the diplomat 
Gheorghe Tinca to seduce the press by all means. Even if the 
charm cast by the lady officer (with the grade of major) can 
seriously affect the professionalism of the journalists, the 
shrewdness of the new minister of defense is to be preferred 
over the obvious hooliganism of other dignitaries vis-a-vis the 
press. The decision to do everything possible in order to have 
excellent relations with the press can also be noticed in the 
case of the other two dignitaries appointed in the wake of the 
recent governmental reshuffle. At his latest meeting with the 
press, Doru Ioan Taracila, the minister of interior, satisfied 
the journalists' taste for the sensational. Minister of Justice 
Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian tried hard, along political and 
journalistic lines, to convince the journalists that they have a 
friend in him. But there is another interesting thing about the 
three newly appointed ministers. Immediately after their 
appointment, each one of them became the target of some press 
attacks. At least the Ministry of National Defense came under 
all sorts of attacks. In spite of all that, none of the new 
ministers resorted to violent replies or, even worse, to banning 
the access of adverse journalists to the departments they are 
heading. Are we dealing here with people who are more 
intelligent that their government colleagues? Are these people 
more aware of the fact that the press is a power in today's 
Romania? Regardless of the answer, one can only welcome their 
attitude toward journalists, since it proves that they are aware 
of journalists' vanity and also concerned with their public 
image. Of course, the three are but at the start of their road. 
It is not excluded that, following the example of other 
dignitaries, they might lose their smiling kindness toward the 
press after it continues to criticize them rightly or wrongly. 
Anyhow, until there is proof to the contrary, we do not err in 
stating that the new dignitaries seem determined to turn the 
press into their ally. During his broad campaign of trying to 
win over the journalists to his side, Iosif Gavril Chiuzbaian 
held a long news conference yesterday, where he announced, among 
other things, that he plans to propose Judge Corneliu Turianu 
for a leading position in the justice department. The new 
minister seems determined to repair all the mistakes made by his 
predecessor, Petre Ninosu, prominent leader of the Social 
Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Yesterday's announcement is 
a serious blow to one of Ion Iliescu's most humble servants. 
First came his unexpected dismissal. Then came his failure at 
the vote in the Senate [for the position as Senate vice 
president]. Now, the new minister is canceling a decision taken 
by Petre Ninosu. We are thus witnessing a happy moment of 
justice being done to a wronged man. Corneliu Turianu was 
illegally removed from the presidency of the Bucharest Military 
Court by the former justice minister. A certain part of the 
press jumped, so to say, to Corneliu Turianu's defense. Petre 
Ninosu's political friends violently reacted to this rightful 
stand taken by the independent journalists. Now, life is giving 
credit to those who condemned Petre Ninosu's decision. Another 
act of destiny seems to be the downfall of Iosif Gavril 
Chiuzbaian's predecessor. In real life, all sins must be paid 
for. Petre Ninosu is also paying for the injustice he has done. 
Nevertheless, aside from all this, the PDSR is faced with a 
most pressing problem, which belongs more to the realm of 
metaphysics than politics. In spite of everything, Petre Ninosu 
is one of their people. I realize that they could do nothing to 
keep him in the post of minister of justice. I realize that 
they could not promote him to the position of vice president of 
the Senate. However, what I cannot understand is why they do 
not jump now to defend the decision taken by Petre Ninosu with 
regard to Corneliu Turianu's case. This because the statement 
of the new minister of justice is extremely ominous for the 
PDSR. It demonstrates to all present ministers that a time may 
come, after their departure from their posts, that their 
decisions can be canceled. Not by opposition ministers, but 
even by other PDSR ministers. This might make quite a few of 
these dignitaries think twice before they place their party's 
interests before the interests of the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Oana Stanciulescu: "The Mangalia Navy Harbor and </F>
the Kogalniceanu Airport Will Be Put at NATO's Disposal"] 
  [Text] During the 5-6 April meeting held by NATO General 
George Joulwan [supreme commander of the Allied Forces for 
Europe] and National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca, the 
principal issue that was approached was the modernization of the 
Romanian Armed Forces, said sources at the National Defense 
Ministry. 
  Currently Romania has seven battalions of paratroopers that 
will be the nucleus of the future Rapid Deployment Force, which 
is a NATO military structure. Within the next 20 months Romania 
will have to reorganize and enlarge those forces so that finally 
they will consist of three rapid deployment brigades each made 
up of three battalions of paratroopers and one battalion of 
special operation forces, namely mountain infantry, marines, and 
reconnaissance. Each brigade will also have its own logistics 
support battalion, said the aforementioned sources. Those 
forces have to be able to intervene within 12 hours anywhere in 
Europe. 
  In NATO's assessment a considerable part of the Romanian 
Army's current equipment cannot be used in the future. That is 
why they suggested that it should be modernized. Thus, as a 
conclusion of the talks, NATO pledged to offer credits to 
Romania to buy transportation means (trucks), complete the 
general overhauling of the Navy's equipment, and improve its 
antiaircraft weapons. 
  General Joulwan suggested to the Romanian party that its 
military communications system should be fully redone, because 
similarly to the radar watch network, during the 1989 December 
events it did not prove to be reliable. During the 
aforementioned talks they also approached the experience 
accumulated from the modernization of the Slovak Army 
communications, which was done with the assistance of German 
experts, the modernization programs designed to update the 
antiaircraft defenses of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech 
Republic, and the necessity of establishing a "joint air space." 
  Another issue they discussed referred to the access of NATO 
to Romanian military facilities -- more precisely, to the Navy 
harbor at Mangalia, the Constanta port, the [Air Force] airport 
near Kogalniceanu [Constanta County], the firing range near 
Sibiu, and the air-to-air and airplane practice field near 
Midia [Constanta County]. 
  During the meeting the Romanian party was briefed by the 
NATO 
general about the fact that the current level of the Russian 
conventional forces exceeds, by 2,100 armored personnel 
carriers, 400 tanks, and 620 artillery pieces, the level 
established by the arms reduction treaty, and that the majority 
of those forces are concentrated in the rayon of Kaliningrad, as 
a threat to the Baltic states.

  [Text] We have just received a report from the spokesman 
of the Albanian Foreign Ministry: 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Arian Starova, at a meeting today, 
informed Greek Ambassador in Tirana Tsalikis that the Albanian 
side welcomes the Greek proposal for a meeting at the foreign 
minister level in Zurich, Switzerland on 3 May. 
  By responding in this way, Albania is showing that it 
respects the choice of dialogue and is committed to finding ways 
to normalize relations with Greece. 
  While this meeting was held in Tirana, it has been learned 
that the Greek Foreign Ministry summoned Albanian Ambassador 
Hysen Cabej to an urgent meeting at the Greek Foreign Ministry 
and notified him that the diplomatic staff should be reduced 
from five diplomats to four. 
  Such a fact, which runs counter to statements by Greek 
Government officials on finding a way to dialogue and 
cooperation, cannot but surprise anyone. After this, it is 
somewhat difficult to understand the messages coming from Athens.

  [Text] The Foreign Ministry issued a statement today 
regarding developments in the situation around the Bosnian town 
of Gorazde. The statement recalls the Bulgarian viewpoint 
stated on 12 April 1994, which expressed alarm regarding the 
possible development of a chain reaction of military actions and 
an escalation of the conflict. Unfortunately, this chain 
reaction is now a fact. 
  The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry once again appeals to the 
warring parties to halt their military actions and show greater 
flexibility and realism in the search for solutions. A 
compromise on Bosnia-Herzegovina's present and future can be 
found only at the negotiating table, only within a broader 
European framework, with active cooperation and coordination 
between the United States, the European Union, and Russia, and 
with the assistance of the United Nations. 
  Bulgaria is ready to play an active part in the discussion 
of 
any international plan leading to the attainment of these goals; 
it is also ready to make its diplomatic and political 
contribution toward halting the bloodshed. 
  The Foreign Ministry is glad to welcome the initiative for a 
summit meeting of representatives of the Russia, the United 
States, and the European Union on the situation in Bosnia, and 
hopes that a solution to this conflict may be found within the 
framework of this meeting. The holding of such a meeting in a 
country in the region in the immediate vicinity of the conflict 
will constitute a clear signal that the participants in the 
meeting are ready to commit themselves to an even greater extent 
to restoring stability, security, and cooperation in the 
Balkans, the Foreign Ministry statement says in conclusion.

  [Text] The deputy chairman of Hungarian Radio [Laszlo 
Csucs] has terminated the program "Sign of Thought." According 
to a report by PESTI HIRLAP, Laszlo Csucs explained his decision 
by stating that the editors of the Sunday cultural program -- 
Gabor Ocsovai, Miklos Gyoerffy, and Julia Varadi -- have been 
producing programs which were biased and have incited passions. 
  The deputy chairman expressed the view that the producers of 
the last edition did not adhere to even the most elementary 
ethical requirements. In Laszlo Csucs's judgment, further 
experimentation would be an abuse of the patience of the 
audience, and although the radio's cultural weekly was still 
needed, it would be produced not by the current staff and 
probably not under its current name.

  [Text] The Sejm has adopted a presidential veto against the 
parish councils' electoral law. The president refused to sign 
the law on the ground that its rules banning the election 
campaign in churches had violated the principles of the 
democratic state of law, equality before the law, and the 
separation of church and state. 
  The president also considers lowering a threshold for 
proportional representation as leading to the politicizing of 
the local self-government elections.

We are meeting the entire demand for electricity. If it stops 
coming from lignite-fired power stations, we still have other 
sources of energy." 
  The extraction and consumption of lignite dropped in recent 
years from 73.8 million tonnes in 1988 to 66.8 million in 1992. 
Power and heat and power-generating plants located near lignite 
mines are using approximately 98 percent of all extracted 
lignite.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Radical Party leader Vojislav Seselj </F>
by Mimmo Lombezzi in Belgrade; date not given: "We Will Attack 
Italy With Our Missiles"] 
  [Text] Vojislav Seselj is in Belgrade. He is the leader of 
the Serbian Radical Party, the extremist faction of the Serbian 
nationalists, and is the political referent and ideologue for 
the chetnik terrorists who are fighting on the Bosnian front. 
This interview is with "Studio Aperto" [news bulletin on Italia 
1 TV channel]. 
  [Lombezzi] Yeltsin's envoy, Vitaliy Churkin, has said that 
Russia must not support a group of Serbian extremists that is 
dragging the other Serbs into war. 
  [Seselj] Vitaliy Churkin is applying American politics in 
the 
Balkans. We do not care what he said, Churkin asked [Serbian 
President] Milosevic to destroy the Serbian Radical Party and 
Milosevic said that he will do all that he can to satisfy him. 
However, I am telling you that we are indestructible. And that 
neither Churkin nor Milosevic can do anything. 
  [Lombezzi] It seems that NATO is planning other raids. What 
solutions do you propose for the Muslim enclaves and for Gorazde? 
  [Seselj] I would advise them to make their pilots fly a 
little lower so that they can see the Serbian posts and so that 
even ours can see them better through the antiaircraft finders. 
They will end up like the British aircraft that was shot down a 
few days ago. The Serbs are certainly not scared of an air 
attack; we have already won this war. The Americans can get as 
angry as they please but the territories that we have taken over 
will not be returned. 
  [Lombezzi] Some right-wing parties in Italy would like to 
rediscuss the borders of Istria and Dalmatia... 
  [Seselj] I personally would like to see that what was once 
Italian -- that is Zara and some islands in Dalmatia, Istria, 
Fiume, and Carnaro -- will be returned to Italy. Hundreds of 
thousands of Italians were chased away from Croatia. According 
to the principle of justice all this must be returned to Italy. 
We were very happy when we heard that [Forza Italia leader] 
Berlusconi won, I think he is a real patriot. We hope that his 
policy in this issue will be reasonable and that his government 
will act effectively in returning to Italy that which is 
Italian. We Serbs are willing to help him. 
  [Lombezzi] How will 2 million refugees be able to live? 
  [Seselj] Why should this worry us? They wanted this war, 
they lost this war, and the direct consequence of this is losing 
territory. They should have thought about this before when they 
would not accept any compromises; they wanted all of Bosnia and 
now they will have 10 percent of the territory. 
  [Lombezzi] According to the UN human rights commission, your 
men have become responsible for the ethnic cleansing and 
massacres in Bosnia. 
  [Seselj] Crimes bearing the signature of the Serbian Radical 
Party have never been proven. This demonstrates that its 
accusations are completely unfounded, as are those of the West, 
which does not know what is happening here. 
  [Lombezzi] If the international court on war crimes in the 
former Yugoslavia wants to put you on trial, will you present 
yourself? 
  [Seselj] I do not recognize the legality of this court, but 
I 
am telling you that if they accuse me I will present myself 
voluntarily. I really do not want to miss this show. 
  [Lombezzi] Will Italy be at risk if NATO launches other 
raids? 
  [Seselj] Italy has already exposed itself to a terrible risk 
because the American aircraft leave from Aviano air base to bomb 
our positions. This time we have not reacted against Italy 
because we appreciate and respect Berlusconi, who has still not 
succeeded in forming a government, but we believe that he will 
not allow somebody to tread on Italy's national interests and to 
push Italy into a conflict with its friend Serbia. We are 
waiting to see how the Italian Government will be composed, and 
then we will decide whether to attack or not. However, I am 
telling you that this can lead to the most serious consequences 
because we have very powerful weapons. Our SS-20's can reach the 
Italian coast and even further inland. NATO is fully aware of 
this; all these missiles are hidden underground and cannot be 
destroyed, not even with nuclear weapons.

  [Text] The tragedy of Gorazde goes on. Thousands of shells 
have been destroying the center of the town while from the 
surrounding hills the chetniks are using their snipers and 
anti-aircraft weapons to monitor every movement in the town. No 
one can tell how many casualties there has been in the town. 
From all directions tanks are closing on the town center. 
According to as yet unconfirmed reports reaching the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] headquarters in Zagreb, Serb tanks 
are moving in the direction of part of the town which contains a 
munitions factory currently in Muslim hands.

  [Excerpts] The latest information from the outskirts, with 
which contact was lost, is that the situation in Vitkovici is 
dramatic. Yesterday alone, 11 civilians, six of them children 
under 10, were seriously wounded. They were wounded in attacks 
by portable rocket launchers and tanks from (Dilje) hill. These 
people cannot be helped, as the road to Vitkovici is completely 
cut off. They cannot be brought to the hospital or the medical 
center. The situation in the city center resembles the worst 
scene from a horror film. [passage omitted] 
  We have also just received information from the official 
bodies that Maljutka guided missiles have hit the prison camp 
with 22 captured members of the fascist army. Six captured 
chetniks have been killed and eight seriously wounded in this 
barbaric attack. We have also received information from the 
clinic that 19 of our citizens have been wounded by sniper fire 
so far. Two of them, Milinkovic Dusan and his wife, have died, 
despite being given urgent aid.

<F P=106> [Article by Alessandro Marzo Magno: "That Cursed Bridge"] </F>
  [Text] It has been nicknamed "the Jansa road," from the 
name of Ljubljana's former defense minister, a pacifist 
converted to military uniform. It runs along a river that the 
Slovenes call the Kolpa, and the Croats the Kupa -- the river 
that marks the border between the two republics born from the 
ashes of Yugoslavia. 
  The road is used to transport freight that is best kept 
hidden from prying eyes. Mainly weapons. And even the maps have 
been modified in order to facilitate this traffic. Thus a bridge 
has "disappeared," though in fact it still exists, and it is 
quite possible to cross it, even with heavy vehicles. The 
bridge joins Slovenia to Croatia at a place called Bosljiva 
Loka. It is a border crossing, but the fact is marked by only a 
couple of road signs. 
  The one on the right bank reads, "Republic of Croatia," 
while 
the Slovene notice reads, "Warning, state frontier." But in 
between there is not the slightest trace of any border post. 
There are no barriers, and it is possible to pass easily from 
one country to the other without being stopped by police or 
customs officers. 
  Along the road there are other bridges across the river. On 
those there are fixed border posts for passport controls. Only 
over the bridge that has "disappeared" is it possible to cross 
the border freely. Last Sunday, as tourists crossed on their 
way to the nearby Osilnica riding school, a Croatian police car 
parked at the end of the bridge and the policemen in it glanced 
wearily at their passports. On Sundays and holidays and at 
night neither the Croats nor the Slovenes carry out checks. 
  This strange fact is explained by looking at the map. Across 
the bridge, the road runs for some 10 km through Croatian 
territory. It is almost all surfaced, apart from a stretch of a 
few kilometers of dirt road, which is nevertheless perfectly 
passable. After passing through some tiny peasant villages, the 
road ends at Brodna Kupi. Here there is another bridge joining 
Croatia and Slovenia -- this one equipped with police, customs 
officers, barriers, flags, and everything necessary for a border 
post. 
  Brodna Kupi is the first Croatian town on the road to 
Delnice 
and Ogulin, two towns on the Lika front, where Serbs and Croats 
have waged a bitter struggle. A small turning leads to the road 
to Bihac in Bosnia. In this area Slovenia and Bosnia are no 
more than about 100 km apart. The road in question is the 
shortest route for bringing weapons to the Bosnian Muslims. 
  The inhabitants of the villages around Bosljiva Loka say 
that 
there is a fairly steady flow of vehicles, considering the fact 
that it is a country road. They include covered trucks with no 
identifying markings. 
  On the Slovene side, near the bridge that "disappeared," 
there is the area of Kocevska Reka. It covers 76,000 hectares 
and includes 1,400 km of roads. Under Yugoslavia it was 
entirely off limits, a military zone. Under the mountains there 
are outright citadels where the Belgrade government was supposed 
to take refuge in the event of a war. 
  But Ljubljana always regarded Kocevska Reka as its own: Only 
the commanding generals were Serbs; all the other officers and 
men were Slovenes. The Yugoslav Federal Army, whose officers 
were prevalently Serbs, was forced to accept this unpleasant 
fact. 
<H5>  Muslim Volunteers Come From Fiume [Rijeka] </H5>
  After Ljubljana became independent from Belgrade in summer 
1991 part of Kocevska Reka was turned into a nature reserve. 
This pleased the inhabitants of the village that gave its name 
to the area; since then they have no longer needed a special 
permit to leave their homes. Another part remained a military 
zone. 
  The main difference from Yugoslav times is that the Slovene 
soldiers serving in the area have changed their uniform from 
that of the Belgrade army to that of Ljubljana's armed forces. 
And the inhabitants of the villages remaining within the 
military zone still suffer restrictions on their freedom of 
movement. 
  A kind of weapons bazaar has apparently been established in 
the military bases of Kocevska Reka, from which the Bosnian 
Croats and Muslims equip themselves. Moreover, the area -- 
strictly controlled and far from prying eyes -- is apparently 
also used to train the volunteers on their way to the combat 
zone. These are mainly people originating from the Middle 
Eastern Islamic countries, who join the Bosnian Muslims in the 
name of their common faith. 
  They reach the port of Fiume, where they mix with the 
Bosnian 
refugees. The capital of the Quarnero region is some 40 km away 
from Delnice. A further 12 km away is Brodna Kupi, and the 
start of the "Jansa road," which leads to Slovenia. 
  The weapons reach Kocevska Reka chiefly along two routes. 
The first and shortest runs through the port of Capodistria 
[Koper], where there are a number of warehouses -- which it is 
inadvisable to approach -- under constant surveillance by armed 
guards. The second route is from Hungary and brings 
Soviet-manufactured weapons that used to equip all the armies of 
the East, including the Yugoslav Federal Army. 
<H5>  Germany and Austria Arm Slovenia </H5>
  There is a third route, from Austria and Germany. The 
Slovene 
economy has been taken under the protective wing of the Deutsche 
mark area, and it is no secret to anyone that Ljubljana's armed 
forces are equipped with Austrian vehicles: It is enough to 
look at the off-road vehicles and trucks that comprise the 
military convoys. However, there is no proof that weapons from 
Vienna or Bonn reach the bazaar at Kocevska Reka. 
  However, behind all this weapons trafficking, there is 
apparently former Ljubljana Defense Minister Janez Jansa, who 
was thrown out of the Slovene Government three weeks ago. 
  It is he above all who should be given credit for the rapid 
Slovene victory over the federal-Serbian troops between the end 
of June and the beginning of July 1991. Independence cost 
Ljubljana some 10 days of war and seven lives. There were 46 
casualties on the Serbian side -- a trifle, compared to what has 
happened in Croatia and in the massacres in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Slovenia continued for a while to accumulate weapons, but 
soon the war shifted far from its borders. Then Ljubljana was 
able to begin a profitable trade. Its main clients are Croatia 
and Bosnia. But there are people willing to swear that weapons 
from Ljubljana have gone to Serbia too. Certainly, Serbian 
goods, having passed via Hungary, do end up in Slovene stores, 
and Slovene goods supplement Serbian contraband. 
  A few months ago a couple of Serbian traders introduced 
themselves to the Slovene concessionaire of a very well known 
American sports shoe manufacturer; they bought 3,000 pairs, paid 
for them in cash, loaded them onto a truck, and left for Serbia. 
  Nepalese and Ukrainian soldiers monitor the UN blockade 
along 
the Hungarian-Serb borders. Many people maintain that these 
soldiers, who suffer chronic poverty in their own countries, are 
not unresponsive to the rustle of dollar bills. In other words, 
just as shoes get by, so too could rifles. 
  The fact that not everything was clear in relations between 
Jansa and Belgrade is confirmed also by the Belgrade daily 
POLITIKA, which has been cited at length by Ljubljana radio. 
The police of the Serbian-Montenegrin confederation arrested 
Bazodar Spasic, apparently a senior agent of the UBDA, the 
former Yugoslav secret service. 
  He was in possession not only of photographs showing a 
number 
of Slovene leaders in the company of prostitutes, but also of 
documentary evidence of contacts between Ljubljana's defense 
minister and the Serbian secret services. This information 
comes from a Serbian source and is unconfirmed, but it is 
somewhat significant if set within the broader context of secret 
relations between the republics of the former Yugoslavia. 
  Sometimes the arms trafficking mechanism breaks down. This 
happened, for instance, when 11 containers carrying 120 metric 
tons of weapons destined for the Bosnian Muslims were seized at 
Maribor airport. This caused a considerable political scandal 
in Slovenia, involving Jansa and former Interior Minister Igor 
Bavcar. 
  According to reports in the Slovene press, the VIS 
(Ljubljana's secret service) strongly "advised against" checking 
and monitoring consignments of "humanitarian aid" leaving 
Maribor airport for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  There was an attempt to blame everything on the VIS chief in 
Maribor, Silvo Komar, and on Bosnia's representative in 
Slovenia, Hasan Cengic. Former VIS Director Miha Brejc said 
that he knows absolutely nothing about any arms trafficking. 
But then he added a remark that directly implicates Jansa and 
Bavcar: "Is it conceivable that in such important and delicate 
matters anything could happen without the agreement of the 
political leadership?" 
<H5>  "I Acted in the Interests of the Slovene State" </H5>
  Komar was described by Jansa as the "owner of the 120 tons 
of 
weapons." But after a long silence, Komar replied in the weekly 
MLADINA: "All my actions," he argued, "and those of our service 
were carried out on the basis of a rigid hierarchical 
responsibility and on the instructions of the head of the 
service at the time. I was told that everything that went on 
was in the interests of the Slovene state. Since the weapons 
were discovered, I think that Jansa and Brejc know much more 
about them than I do." 
  When questioned as a witness by the court in Maribor, Jansa, 
not knowing what to say, accused the investigating magistrate of 
misdirecting the inquiry and of being ill acquainted with the 
Slovene laws governing arms exports. 
  Jansa also accused the magistrate of having indirectly 
helped 
the Bosnian Hasan Cengic, an arms dealer "against whom the 
Slovene bodies concerned have issued an international arrest 
warrant." 
  It may have been a coincidence, but two days before his 
statement Jansa received a letter from the president of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Alia Izetbegovic said that he was surprised 
by the arrest warrant issued against Cengic and pointed out that 
the Slovene Government leaders were fully aware that Cengic was 
Bosnia's authorized representative and was acting on the 
Sarajevo government's behalf within the context of Slovene laws. 
So it was not private trafficking on Cengic's own account, as 
Jansa maintained. 
  According to the official account, the seizure took place 
because Ljubljana's Defense Ministry received an anonymous 
message identifying the location of the secret consignment. 
According to Croatian sources, however, the Slovenes thus got 
themselves out of trouble after selling the same consignment of 
weapons twice -- to the Bosnians and the Croats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Eva </F>
Martinkova; place and date not given: "Some Parties Are Playing 
False Cards"] 
  [Text] [Martinkova] In your view, what is the objective 
of the Litomysl meeting of presidents? 
  [Klaus] This provides yet another means of communication 
with neighboring countries. We desire this communication, we 
are striving for it, and we are pleased that it is going to 
happen. Moreover, the meeting has another important 
aspect--breaking down the incessant polarization of the world 
into West and East. The fact that the presidents of Austria and 
Germany will also be there is, I think, a step in the right 
direction. 
  [Martinkova] In the wake of Wednesday's [13 April] 
government session, do the ambiguities within the coalition over 
the jurisdiction of the higher territorial units still persist? 
  [Klaus] There is no fundamental dispute among the coalition 
parties in the actual issue of jurisdiction. When we begin to 
discuss whether the new regions may conclude international 
treaties or announce their own taxes or smog alert levels, or 
build their own theaters or galleries, any overpoliticized 
dispute will evaporate. The government coalition ministers, in 
closed ranks, are looking for ways to define jurisdiction. The 
problems lie somewhere else. In the political game, that is 
being played beyond the matter-of-fact element of this issue. 
  I repeat: This is not a matter-of-fact dispute. Some parties 
are still pulling false cards from their sleeves. I would hope 
that they do not play with them. 
  [Martinkova] The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is 
one of the lowest in the world. Apparently, only Luxembourg, 
Japan, and New Zealand are doing better. Nevertheless, the 
government is often the target of criticism because of this. 
Can we in the Czech Republic talk about false employment, 
employment that interferes with natural economic relations? 
  [Klaus] Unemployment in our country is the way it is; no one 
is holding it back or speeding it up. Each month the government 
awaits with anticipation the figures on its movement, without in 
any way attempting to manipulate it. Its low level is a major 
success, which, on the other hand, is the subject of various 
worst-case scenarios and elaborations on the artificial curbing 
of unemployment. What I mean is the criticism from some 
economists from the postcommunist countries. However, even 
Western states are a little envious of our low unemployment 
rate. The current level is a consequence of our economy's 
exceptionally high absorption capability. For example, in the 
Louny District, where the unemployment level is one of the 
highest--it is touching 8 percent--there are about 3,000 
unemployed. However, three years ago, 7,000 people lost their 
jobs due to the collapse of the large agricultural enterprises. 
Where are they? In new jobs. 
  [Martinkova] You say that the enterprise sphere is the trade 
unionists' domain, not collective bargaining at the 
macroeconomic level. The Maastricht Treaty, however, even takes 
into consideration supranational collective bargaining within 
the framework of the European Union. 
  [Klaus] I have never made a secret of my criticism of the 
Maastricht Treaty. The social democratic authors who 
participated in drafting it have left their mark in certain 
points. The social sphere is one of them.

  [Text] [Announcer] A meeting between Romanian President 
Mr. Ion Iliescu, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres took place at Cotroceni Palace. The 
meeting concluded a short while ago. 
  Before that, another meeting took place at noon between PLO 
Leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
According to ROMPRES, the head of the Israeli diplomacy said the 
following, at the end of the meeting: The negotiations are not 
yet over. For the time being, there is nothing to announce yet. 
Asked whether he is optimistic, Shim'on Peres said, quote: I 
am always optimistic. This optimism is also shared by Yasir 
'Arafat. [no reference to close of quotation as heard] 
  We have now received from our correspondents the statements 
made by the three participants in today's talks at Cotroceni 
Palace. First, the statement made by President Ion Iliescu. 
  [Begin Iliescu recording] We will not make any special 
statements now. Another meeting will take place at 1700, 
whereby Chairman 'Arafat and Mr. Peres will briefly report on 
the stage of the negotiations conducted last night and this 
morning and the prospects for finalizing certain positive and 
concrete aspects related to the ongoing negotiations in Cairo. 
I would like to point out the political significance of these 
meetings and talks in Bucharest as well as the effort and 
political determination of the two leaders to achieve something. 
If one usually talks about courage and heroism in the military 
struggle, I believe that one needs no less courage and heroism 
to build peace, overcome conflicts, and struggle against the 
trend of hatred and immobility accumulated over a long period of 
time. I believe that this was a display of true courage from 
the politicians of both Israel and the Palestinian side. What 
both Chairman 'Arafat and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Minister Peres are striving to achieve these days is an act of 
courage, which we appreciate as such. I believe it is in the 
interest of the international community to support these 
realistic and brave politicians in their efforts. [end 
recording] 
  [Announcer] Then, Mr. Yasir 'Arafat said: 
  [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English with superimposed 
translation into Romanian] We have to thank His Excellency, the 
president, for his contribution to the progress of the peace 
talks, by arranging the meeting between myself and His 
Excellency Mr. Shim'on Peres. We hope to enjoy your 
hospitality, in Bucharest this time, to continue our talks and 
negotiations, so that we can finally implement the agreements 
reached last September at the White House. I repeat, we need 
courageous people. Mr. Rabin and Mr. Peres are the courageous 
leaders who are making this peace. We are not doing it for our 
or their sake, but for all the people in the region and the 
Middle East, something which will have a positive impact on the 
entire world and on peace throughout the world. I am convinced 
that we are at the end of this long march. Thanks to this hard 
work and our feeling of duty, we will be able to finalize this 
long and difficult process. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Here is Shim'on Peres' statement: 
  [Begin Peres recording, in English with superimposed 
translation into Romanian] I would like to thank Mr. 'Arafat 
and Romania's president for having facilitated this meeting. It 
seems that there is something in Bucharest's air that enables us 
to sit down and calmly talk over the peace process. I know that 
Mr. 'Arafat is leading the Palestinian people toward a new 
destiny, toward something they have never had in the past. We 
wish, from the bottom of our people's heart, that we will be 
successful and that we will see the end of violence, terror, 
death, and suffering. We hope to see the Palestinians as 
neighbors, embarked upon the road of success and prosperity, 
following their historical destiny. As Chairman 'Arafat said, 
we are at the beginning of the end of this process and we are 
trying to find a way to conclude this great historic road of the 
Palestinian and Israeli peoples. This is a new relationship and 
a new beginning. I would like to thank Chairman 'Arafat for the 
attempt he has made, together with us, to end our difficulties. 
We would also like to thank the president for his kind 
hospitality. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli </F>
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres with domestic and foreign 
correspondents at the Parliament Hall in Bucharest -- live; 
'Arafat and Peres speak in English with simultaneous translation 
into Romanian] 
  [Text] [Announcer] The news conference is starting. From 
my position here, I can see Mr. Ion Iliescu, PLO Leader Yasir 
'Arafat, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and Mr. Viorel 
Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the Romanian Government, taking 
their seats in the Presidium. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] [words indistinct] the 
Bucharest talks, and whether you fixed a deadline for the 
signing of a future agreement. 
  ['Arafat] We are still continuing our negotiations and it 
seems that, this evening, we will continue these talks, thanks 
to the president's kindness. We hope to unite all the bridges 
of understanding and solve the differences between us. I am 
sure of that, particularly in view of the goodwill shown by Mr. 
Peres, and we will make progress in the peace process. 
  [Manea] Magdalena Manea of EVENIMENTUL ZILEI. Mr. 'Arafat, 
Mr. Peres, would you say that there are similarities between the 
conflict in Bosnia, former Yugoslavia, and the current conflict 
in your region? Are you maybe waiting for the Bosnian conflict 
to be resolved first? 
  ['Arafat] Definitely we are eager to see the Bosnian 
conflict resolved. I do not like to call it Bosnian, I would 
like to call it a part of the Balkanization process. This is 
not the first time that a Balkanization is going on in this 
region, after World War I and World War II. Therefore, here we 
are faced with a third kind of war, a hot and cold war. We are 
doing all our best to find a solution to this conflict. 
Actually, I do not like to call it conflict. After all, can 
there be a conflict among brothers? 
  [Peres] I do not know enough about the conflict in 
Yugoslavia, but Tolstoy said that all happy families are happy 
when they are alive. If they are unhappy, they can be unhappy 
in different ways. Consequently, Yugoslavia's unhappiness is 
different from the unhappiness prevailing in the Middle East. 
In Yugoslavia, you had an aggressor and a victim, while in the 
Middle East, you have two negotiators striving to end this 
conflict. 
  ['Arafat] If you will permit to butt in, I have good 
relations with all the sides and I am doing all my best for a 
solution, without propaganda. I am trying to do all my best, 
but without too much fuss. This is my mission. 
  [Iliescu] The conflict in Bosnia has [words indistinct]. 
  [Correspondent] AFP. There are rumors that Rabin and 'Arafat 
will sign an accord around 3-4 May. Can you confirm that you 
have reached an agreement with Mr. 'Arafat in this respect? Can 
you specify the day when the aforementioned accord will be 
signed? The question has already been put to you, I believe. 
  [Peres] I believe that Chairman 'Arafat has already said 
that we will try to find the time for further consultations 
tonight. I do not think that we can announce a date in this 
respect. First of all, we would like to be very sure in this 
respect. Any deadline should be observed, consequently, we 
should properly prepare the latest chapter of our negotiations. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I would like to ask both Mr. 
'Arafat and Mr. Peres whether they have made any headway during 
their talks in Bucharest and what are the specific fields where 
progress was made? And a second question -- what, in your 
opinion, are the most difficult obstacles to overcome in 
connection with the agreement signed in Washington? 
  [Peres] Well, we have the following problems. One has to do 
with the present schedule for the withdrawal, since there will 
be an overlapping period. We do not know exactly how to solve 
these parallelisms. In the meantime, we will hand over the 
administration and security to the Palestinian side and we are 
trying to resolve this in the most pragmatic possible way. As 
far as I am concerned, I have learned from Mr. 'Arafat about his 
priorities and we will obviously take his feelings and 
preferences into consideration and try to satisfy them. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] I have two questions for Mr. 
Peres. The communist regime has made that today's Romania 
should be the country of (?immigration) [words indistinct]. How 
do you see the further evolution of the Jewish community in our 
country? [words indistinct] The second question: What is the 
Israeli Government's policy regarding the issue of the Jewish 
assets confiscated by the (?communist) regime? 
  [Peres] Well, to answer the first question, each Jew has the 
right to say where he wants to live, here or in Israel. We are 
very glad that 400,000 Jews had the possibility to emigrate to 
Israel. We are grateful to the Romanian people for enabling this 
emigration and I told Romania's president that Romania has made 
an investment of friendship in Israel, where there is a 
sentiment of friendship toward Romania. Both the Romanian side 
and we ourselves share the same sentiments. If there are still 
some 60,000 Jews left in Romania, the majority of them are 
elderly people and I am convinced that the Romanian Government 
-- and I hope the Romanian people, too -- will consider them as 
equal citizens, without antisemitic sentiments. On the issue of 
compensations, I believe that the Jewish agency will negotiate 
this matter and will solve it. 
  [Correspondent] JOURNAL DE GENEVE. Chairman 'Arafat, what 
is stage of the installation of the PLO administration in the 
respective territories and of the preparations for the 
forthcoming arrival of individuals and authorities from the 
Palestinian diaspora in Gaza and Jericho? 
  ['Arafat] It is very difficult to give an answer to this 
question, because it a lot depends on Israel, in this respect. 
When they withdraw, we will start the takeover process. Hence, 
the need for this overlapping period of taking over and giving 
up certain prerogatives, after which the police force will have 
to intervene, in the presence of certain international bodies. 
I hope, that if I have the opportunity, I will go there myself. 
  [Jaganaru] Ana Juganaru from the JURNAL NATIONAL. I have a 
question for Chairman 'Arafat. Can a final agreement be reached 
without the consultation of Syria and Jordan? I also have 
another question for Foreign Minister Peres. Can the Israeli 
Government return the territories without the approval of the 
Knesset or a plebiscite? 
  ['Arafat] I see that you are worried about the approval of 
our brothers, the Syrians. We have contacts with all our 
brothers in the Arab world and they are present even here, at 
this conference. We are coordinating all our actions with the 
Arab League. 
  [Peres] As a matter of fact, Prime Minister Rabin submitted 
these agreements to the Knesset and the Knesset approved them. 
Therefore, we were empowered by the Knesset to continue our 
efforts and implement these agreements. Therefore, you should 
not be worried about this. The Knesset has already endorsed 
them. 
  [Dumitrescu] Rodica Dumitrescu. Will Mr. 'Arafat leave 
Romania this evening, tonight, or tomorrow morning? 
  ['Arafat] I see that you would like to know the exact date. 
I am sorry, but I cannot give you the list of my appointments. 
I like this friendly country and people and, for the sake of 
his excellency, I would like to sojourn here as long as 
possible, but then, as you probably know, I have a lot of other 
things to do. 
  [Duma] Mircea Duma from CATAVENCU ACADEMY. I just want to 
make an announcement. According to our information, Mr. 'Arafat 
left the country last night. [laughter, applause] 
  [Ionescu] Victor Ionescu from Romanian Television. Mr. 
Peres, Mr. 'Arafat, if you were the counselor of the other side 
in the current stage of your negotiations, what advice would you 
give to the other? If you were Mr. 'Arafat's counselor, for 
instance, what advice would you give him? And the other way 
round. 
  [Peres] Well, I would advise him to accept the Israeli 
proposals. [laughter] Actually, we have to find the common 
ground. I would like to give you a serious answer. There is an 
Israeli opposition and a Palestinian opposition to this process 
and our task is not to force the Palestinians to accept our 
views or the Palestinians the oblige us to accept their views. 
We are striving to find common ground that is acceptable to 
both sides. 
  ['Arafat] The most important thing is to reach a conclusion 
and an agreement between the two sides. To be an adviser of one 
or the other side, well, I hope that in either case I would hope 
that an urgent withdrawal takes place, as well as a quick 
implementation of the already signed accords. 
  [Peres] As far as Israel is concern, we would like to leave 
Gaza and never go back there again. We are extremely serious, 
and I would like to express my hope and desire that this plan 
becomes a successful reality and that Chairman 'Arafat can 
accomplish that. 
  [Hudginson] Chris Hudginson from THE NEW YORK TIMES. I would 
like to ask Chairman 'Arafat, now that the withdrawal has been 
delayed so much, once the agreement is finalized, how long do 
you think the Israelis will remain in Gaza and Jericho? [words 
indistinct] What are the main points which are still hampering 
the progress of the agreements? 
  ['Arafat] If there is a will, there is a way. This is the 
most important thing. If there is an agreement, time will not 
be an obstacle. We have many experiences from the past. Well, 
it should not take longer than a few days. I was told this 
clearly by the generals that accompanied Mr. Peres at the latest 
meetings and talks in Davos, Oslo, and Cairo. 
  [Hudginson] Mr. Chairman, what do you find most frustrating? 
You have said many times that you are ready, you are ready to 
go in, but the talks were still delayed and people are talking 
about another two weeks. What is most frustrating in the 
negotiations with the Israelis? 
  ['Arafat] It is very difficult to give you such details when 
we are in the middle of negotiations. I think that the actions 
will speak for themselves. 
  [Text] [Martalogu] Victor Martalogu of ROMPRES. My 
question is also directed to the two distinguished guests. Two 
years ago, in 1991, at the time when the declaration of 
principle was signed in Washington, the press in Romania and in 
other countries referred to Romania as the major, unjustified 
absentee. Now, at the Crans Montana Forum conference, a forum 
that generally and primarily approaches economic issues in 
democracies that are undergoing the process of transition, the 
issue of Middle East comes up and the officials involved in it 
are invited to Bucharest. Do you see or do you admit that there 
is a connection between Romania's role of mediator -- which has 
not always been recognized -- 5-6 years ago and the current 
situation, and do you see the possibility that Romania will 
receive a more active role in this process? 
  [Iliescu] I believe that any country that can (?relaunch) 
contacts and negotiations is welcome to do so. We could also 
see it in a more distant past. Even a small country with 
limited potential such as Romania, but which has the advantage 
to maintain normal and open relations with Arab countries and 
with Israel, could at the respective time facilitate such 
contacts. More recently, a country such as Norway offered to 
host the negotiations and talks between the two sides, which 
resulted in the Washington accord. Today's example, the 
opportunity given by the Crans Montana Forum, shows that if it 
is based on good will -- and this good will was shown by the 
representatives of the two sides -- this opportunity can be used 
to support the positive progress of contacts. Thus, Romania is 
open to offer all kinds of such support for the continuation of 
dialogue and the promotion of the peace process. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Actually I am....[pauses] 
Okay, I think I have the possibility of asking two questions. 
My name is [words indistinct] and I am the editor of a 
Palestinian newspaper published in Jerusalem. First I want to 
ask President 'Arafat a question in connection with his recent 
trip to Moscow and Eastern European countries. We are currently 
noticing a new development in relations between Palestinians and 
Eastern Europe. We hope that this new development will lead to 
positive results both in the political and peace process and in 
the economic relations that we hope to establish between Eastern 
Europe and the future Palestinian state. We hope that 
Romania... and this is a question for Romania's president, is 
there going to be a development of economic relations as well as 
commercial relations between Palestine and Romania? Now a 
question for Mr. Peres: We are now seeing two important 
economic conferences. There are high hopes of progress for the 
implementation of the Oslo Agreement. These high hopes were 
dashed at the Davos meeting. I would like to ask you which are 
the problems that have been left for the last chapter, as you 
call it, to be discussed and how long will it take until these 
issues are solved? Then, there is the question of land and 
territories. According to the peace process, a new check point 
is being built at the moment between Jericho and the rest of the 
West Bank. According to the time table, the Palestinian 
authority will be established within six months in the rest of 
the West Bank. Are we going to face the same problems or are we 
going to move faster in the future? 
  [Peres] Both sides made very serious efforts for progress. 
It is possible that we are going to conclude the negotiations 
with a two to three week delay, but do not forget that we have 
to take into account the complex nature of problems that we are 
facing and certain unfortunate events. And I want to say, on 
behalf of my government, that any victim on the Palestinian side 
is considered by us with the same pain as any victim on our 
side. An end should be put to this. Extremists should not stop 
the peace process and I have the impression that we are very 
close to the beginning of new relations. There are many issues, 
but many of them are of a technical nature and some of them are 
of issues of principle and, as Mr. 'Arafat said, we do not want 
to hold negotiations in the open but behind closed doors and on 
friendly terms. Thus, about the continuation of negotiations, 
to answer your question, there will be two continuations. One, 
the so-called early empowerment, namely turning the 
responsibility in many areas over to the Palestinian authorities 
in the Gaza strip. This will be done in the same framework in 
which we negotiate the overall Gaza-Jericho arrangement. 
Parallel, we will open negotiations soon, we hope, in 
Washington to conclude this problem of authority. I believe 
that the presidents who helped a great deal will also help in 
accelerating the talks within these negotiations. Because it 
has been very difficult for both sides to pave the way for 
something Chairman 'Arafat said was unprecedented, and I know 
that many of our Palestinian friends are concerned in their 
hearts that we are delaying things. But it is not so. I want 
to tell you that we know each other from Jerusalem and Israel, 
and I would like to tell you very openly that our government is 
determined to conclude the negotiations and to respect the 
Palestinian decisions represented by Chairman 'Arafat, namely to 
depart from declarations and confrontation and to proceed to the 
world of reality. Thus I am indeed convinced that Chairman 
'Arafat will be the first Palestinian leader who will bring home 
not a declaration, not simply a gesture, but real peace, 
authority, and solutions in geographic terms in all of the 
Middle East. We are going to work together and I also 
appreciate the expression Chairman 'Arafat made this afternoon, 
which is normal, namely we said farewell to the use of guns, 
terror, violence, and war and we are going to negotiate only for 
the future, as we also convened in Oslo, through diplomatic 
means. 
  ['Arafat] We should not forget that Russia is one of the 
cosponsors of this accord. We have very good relations with 
them. We have had a joint committee and a standing bureau since 
we participated in the Madrid conference, and they are still 
functioning now. We had very positive and constructive talks 
with President Yeltsin two days ago. They promised to continue 
their efforts aimed at giving an impetus to the peace process. 
Regarding my visit here, you should not forget that I am an old 
visitor to this country, this is not the first time I am here. 
I have had a very long-standing relationship with the 
president, from the times when we were both students, in 1956. 
Can you imagine that? He was the boss. I was not the boss, he 
was [as heard]. We have to thank His Excellency for his 
coordination and cooperation, not only in bringing me and Mr. 
Peres together for continuing our peace efforts, but also in 
promoting multilateral ties among us at all levels. We have 
very many students here. We are looking forward to further 
developing our economic relations. We are hoping to receive 
assistance in our country's reconstruction. 
  [Iliescu] In this respect, I would like to add that, in my 
talks with Chairman 'Arafat, we tackled this issue of 
reconstruction, the problem of infrastructure, and the 
participation of Romanian companies in this process. Apropos 
our cooperation, we also have very good ties with Israel, and 
this joint cooperation can be a good example of joint 
participation in the reconstruction efforts, to the benefit of 
all sides. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Israeli Radio-Television. I 
would like to put a question to Mr. 'Arafat. Do you share Mr. 
Peres' assessment that the negotiations will conclude in two to 
three weeks? And a second question. Do you believe that the 
latest news from Cairo is good and satisfactory? Do you have 
anything positive to say in connection with the latest news from 
Cairo and the developments of recent days? Would you say that 
the situation is good, or rather bad? 
  ['Arafat] We hope, but I do not have concrete information 
about what happened today in Cairo. What I was told is that the 
talks were suspended this afternoon, to be resumed next Sunday. 
We hope that we will have some concrete results in the 
following week. Likewise, we can say that we hope to have a 
final agreement. We hope so. 
  [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the news conference is 
over.

<F P=106> [Report by Turhan Ipek] </F>
  [Excerpts] Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has 
stated that the Israelis and the Palestinians are in agreement 
over Turkey's participation in the international police force 
which is to be positioned in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
[sentence as heard] Cetin, who is in Bucharest to participate in 
a conference of the international Crans Montana Forum, met 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Palestinian Head of 
State Yasir 'Arafat. TRT correspondent Turhan Ipek reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ipek] Cetin arrived in Bucharest on a 
private plane this morning to participate in the conference. 
Cetin was received at the airport by (Ioan Goritza), Romanian 
deputy foreign minister [name and title as heard], and other 
officials. [passage omitted] 
  Following the opening ceremony of the conference, Cetin met 
with 'Arafat and Peres separately. Cetin, Arafat, and Peres 
later held a tripartite meeting. In a statement after the 
meeting, Cetin said that both Peres and 'Arafat expressed their 
goodwill and wish regarding the conclusion of the 
Israeli-Palestinian part of the Middle East peace process by the 
end of this month. Stating that the subject of Turkish 
contribution to the international police force -- the next stage 
in the process -- was also raised during the meeting, Cetin 
added: 
  [Cetin] I met Peres while he was visiting Turkey and, then, 
he had asked Turkey to participate in the international police 
force -- to be established in the next stage. 'Arafat, whom I 
had previously met in Cairo, also made the same request. During 
the tripartite meeting both of them reconfirmed their request, 
stated their acceptance, and that they can now announce it. 
Both of them together asked for Turkey to contribute in the 
international police force that will be established in the 
coming days. 
  [Ipek] Cetin pointed out that they discussed with Peres the 
establishment of a Middle East security and cooperation system, 
an issue which was also brought up during Peres' visit in 
Turkey. Explaining that both 'Arafat and Peres support this 
project, Cetin added: I told them that I will send them the 
draft when the work regarding this issue is concluded. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

Yasir 'Arafat "shortly after midnight" on the morning of 22 
April upon his departure from Bucharest Otopeni Airport -- 
recorded, in Arabic with superimposed translation into Romanian; 
translated from the Romanian] 
  [Text] I nurture feelings of gratitude and appreciation for 
President Iliescu, his government, and the friendly and 
fraternal Romanian people, whom we thank for everything and for 
whom we nurture feelings of greatest affection. 
  We express thanks for this important invitation which 
offered 
an opportunity for us to assemble a large number of important 
businessmen, experts in economy, and politicians from the whole 
world in this world economic forum. During my stay here I have 
had a number of important, constructive, and positive talks. 
During those talks we approached a large range of problems 
connected with the peace process. This important role played by 
President Iliescu in the meeting organized between myself and 
Mr. Peres is not unusual. On this occasion, we discussed and 
approached the problems of peace and the installation of this 
peace. 
  President Iliescu has made very big efforts and Mr. Peres 
and 
myself were impressed with his points of view. These efforts 
will be reflected positively in the talks and negotiations 
between us that will take place either in Paris or in Cairo. 
  We thank again President Iliescu, the Romanian Government, 
and the friendly Romanian people, to whom we extend our 
gratitude and we thank all of them for this position toward the 
Palestinian people. We are convinced that the Romanian people 
and the Romanian Government will grant us support and assistance 
in the future establishment of our state which we hope will take 
place soon. Thank you.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item by Borislav Lalic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (TANJUG) -- Only a few days 
following the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions and civil 
targets around Gorazde, Russian diplomat Vitaliy Churkin said in 
a sharp and threatening manner that he is cutting off all 
dialogue with the Bosnian Serbs and called on his country to do 
the same. 
  One would not have expected something like this from a 
diplomat who was considered the most persistent and competent 
mediator in the search for a peaceful settlement to the Bosnian 
war. It was believed that no one could put out of joint this 
diplomat of fine manners and notable tolerance. 
  Many news analysts have tried to explain the motives and 
grasp the background of his outburst and believe that the 
popular Russian envoy has made a diplomatic blunder and simply 
"cracked." 
  By his nervous and explosive reaction to the Bosnian Serbs' 
behaviour, even if things had really occurred as he said, 
Churkin has failed both as a politician and diplomat. 
  As a negotiator and mediator, he did what was the easiest 
and 
what a good politician would never do -- he gave up Bosnia in a 
moment of personal frustration. 
  Time, which eventually reveals all, will show whether 
Churkin's outburst has cut short his brilliant diplomatic career 
which was developped mainly owing to his efforts in the Yugoslav 
crisis. Churkin has managed to score more diplomatic points in 
his mediating mission in Bosnia than anyone else, including Lord 
Owen. It appears, however, that the burden of such a fame was 
too much for him. 
  Time will also shed more light on some other issues and 
motives of such a reaction. For instance, why was outburst 
caused only by the Serbs' conduct. Previously there were also 
dramatic events and all sides broke their promises, but Churkin 
never got upset. Not even when the Bosnian Serbs were bombed 
without consultation with his country, although this could have 
been the right moment to tell the NATO leaders that they should 
realize once and for all that Russia is a big state and not a 
banana republic, as he told the Serbs. 
  Nevertheless, the most important question now is about the 
further role of Russia in the resolution of the Bosnian drama 
and overall Yugoslav crisis. It should not be crucially 
influenced by Churkin's outburst and by Russia's "brotherly 
feelings" towards the Serbs. 
  In any case, Russia has not given up Bosnia. This is evident 
from the latest peace initiatives of President Boris Yeltsin who 
has announced serious Russian engagement, including cooperation 
with all factors of the international community and negotiations 
with all warring sides in Bosnia. 
  The problem is so serious that it cannot be resolved at the 
level of deputy foreign ministers, the Russian defence minister 
said yesterday in a rather rough allusion to the position of 
Vitaliy Churkin in his country.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "A Conflict in Kosovo Would Be 10 </F>
Times the Size"] 
  [Text] "The situation with human rights in Croatia is very 
worrying because of the war being misused not only for 
liberating the Croatian territories under occupation, but also 
for settling differences with what I often call statistical and 
mathematical minorities, that is, with the people who think 
differently. This is, above all, the opposition involving a 
group of people who think differently. Finally, there are 
different national minorities," Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, chairman of 
the Croatia Helsinki human rights committee, says in an 
interview to KOHA, a newspaper in Albanian. 
  "The Serbian ethnic minority is usually the one accused -- 
at 
the level of collective hatred due to the frustration caused by 
the war and the Serbian aggression on Croatia -- for the war 
with Croatia," Cicak went on to say. "I think that this is not 
good because it means accepting the model of generalizing 
collective guilt that now justifies Serbs' claims that the whole 
of the Croatian people is responsible for the war that was waged 
in the World War II when, in the name of Croathood, certain 
idiots committed massacres. The Serbs are now doing similar 
things in the name of Serbianhood. In this respect, I think 
that it is important to individualize guilt, ranging from the 
ideological level -- such as the ideological level of guilt in 
Serbia that above all lies on the group of people around the 
Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, which produced the 
"Memorandum," in fact the MEIN KAMPF of the second half of the 
20th century. 
  [KOHA] What does the new Croatian democracy under Tudjman 
look like? 
  [Cicak] As a man of modest intellectual capabilities, I 
jokingly "punished" myself by wishing to live in an ordinary 
democratic state. During communism, we lived in a state that 
proclaimed itself to be the most democratic state in the world. 
I would not like to live in the most democratic state in the 
world. I would like to live in an ordinary democratic country 
and nothing else. This is neither too much nor too little. 
However, this is the most difficult thing -- to find a 
democracy in which communist ways of thinking prevail is very 
difficult. 
  At the moment, a restriction of, above all, freedom of the 
media is featuring on the political scene in Croatia, for there 
is no legal possibility in Croatia for free radio or television 
stations. Moreover, a great pressure is exerted recently toward 
taking away frequencies from local radio stations where 
opposition parties are in power. Therefore, room for democracy 
is being narrowed down in connection with the most recent 
events, a new strike against Manolic and, in my opinion, against 
Mesic as well. I think that the Croatian authorities will use 
the Washington agreement above all for a showdown with the 
internal opposition. Mesic and Manolic are only a beginning, 
and I think that the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the kind 
of agreements that are on now topical in fact mean rewarding the 
people who are, objectively speaking, to be blamed for the war. 
This means opening the door for them to turn the Balkans into 
South America to an even greater extent, that is, to create 
small puppet South American-type states for whom decrees of the 
Croatian authorities will more and more boil down to telephone 
messages from Washington. Of course, this increases 
Washington's responsibility for the policy here and I think that 
they should be told this clearly. 
  [KOHA] What is the fate of the Muslim-Croatian federation? 
Could something else perhaps be done? 
  [Cicak] We have again been brought into the situation of 
guinea pigs in an experimental laboratory of the U.S. politics 
that has been producing catastrophic results from Somalia to 
Iran. I do not believe in such things, above all because I 
think that the people who led to the war cannot lead to peace. 
Causes of war have not been removed. I was in Sweden when I 
received the new Bosnian Constitution. One of the new things 
that are being envisaged is the "ombudsman" and the human-rights 
tribunal. When it was recognized, Croatia signed a document 
obliging itself to form a human rights tribunal, but it has not 
done so to date. How can we have any right to ask another 
country to establish a human-rights tribunal and "ombudsman" and 
we are not complying with international obligations within our 
own country. 
  [KOHA] What is the political influence, above all of the 
Albanians, on the solving of the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia, including Kosovo? 
  [Cicak] When I am thinking about events in the Balkans, I 
often remember Tolstoy's "War and Peace" that I read in prison 
three times. He had excellent thoughts about politicians being 
only labels on wine bottles with the and wines inside being 
good, bad, overfermented, or underfermented. Therefore, I think 
that the names of the people on the Kosovo political scene at 
the moment are simply names that represent the situation at the 
moment. I think that the new times and new events will make new 
people surface. Just as is the case in Croatia. Many people 
were wiped out by political events in 1971. Likewise many names 
on the Kosovo political scene of today will simply be wiped out 
by new events and I think that these events will bring in some 
far more radical people. Unfortunately, Albanians cannot avoid 
the process of radicalization that, in my opinion, will be 
brought from outside. The moment the Serbs need it, they will 
set off on a showdown with Kosovo, as this is simply the only 
way they can function. They need war primarily to strengthen 
the system and not only to create a greater Serbia. 
  In this respect, I think that the most horrible events will 
take place in Kosovo, because the amount of hatred between 
Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo is 10 times as great as that in 
Croatia and Bosnia. And I think that the number of conflicts 
and events in Kosovo will also be 10 times greater. I do not 
want to play a prophet, but I have, so far, correctly predicted 
a lot of what has, unfortunately, happened in Kosovo. The 
conflict in Kosovo will provoke a global conflict in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] that will 
cause 1 million deaths in a short time. This is my own opinion 
and I have also spoken with a Swedish strategist. The amount of 
hatred and brutality, particularly on the Serbian side, is such 
that it is awful. 
  If there is such an explosion in Kosovo, people will start 
fleeing down toward Tetovo en masse, because all this is a 
valley and that would simply be the most natural thing to do. 
The demographic situation in Macedonia will thereby change and 
that will cause a chain reaction. Albania, as well as Bulgaria 
and Greece will not watch from the sidelines. What the world is 
afraid of is the greatest cynicism of the West. In fact they 
are not bothered much by the conflict taking place in the 
Balkans between us: the Croats, Serbs, Muslims, Albanians, and 
others. They are afraid of the NATO breakdown that has begun 
with the conflict between Greece and Turkey and this is why they 
are acting at the level of prevention. However, I do not think 
that their prevention will work. To quote [Serbian writer] 
Filip David, one should strike and thereby prevent that budding 
neo-nazism in Europe, which is blend of bolshevism and an 
extreme chauvinistic nationalism, something that can best be 
seen in Russia. I think that the only way this process can be 
stopped is by demystifying those people who have begun their 
nazi projects, projects summed up in the following sentence: 
"One blood, one soil, one leader, one people." I do not like 
to lecture anybody, any peoples or groups, but the message I 
would send to the Albanians is that everything should be done to 
avoid deaths. Because, there has been only one case of 
resurrection in history. 
  [KOHA] What do you think about the Kosovo setup, 
"reflecting" the present attempts in Bosnia, that is, about the 
Kosovo setup in the present Yugoslavia? 
  [Cicak] This will be the worst catastrophe. The Albanians 
are going to swallow the idea, reckoning that it is important to 
acquire the status of federal units in Serbia or Macedonia and 
afterwards join Albania. I would call that a mistake in the 
long run and I will tell you why. What is involved is the 
project of first having a federation of Croats and Muslims in 
Bosnia, then confederal links with Croatia. Following this is 
the federalization of Croats and Muslims with the Serbs and then 
confederalization between that confederation and Serbia. After 
that, the Americans will try to apply that model to the 
federalization of Kosovo and linking that into a confederation 
with Albania. This would be one more reason for even greater 
war clashes in a certain number of years. Therefore, this does 
not solve the essential question again. And the essential 
question is how to stop the way of thinking that is 140 years 
old and that assumes the existence of a greater Serbia, a 
greater Croatia, and a greater Albania. 
  [KOHA] What can the international community gain for Kosovo? 
  [Cicak] The first step that the international community 
should gain for Kosovo is the degree of autonomy that it had on 
the basis of the 1974 [SFRY] Constitution, which was abolished 
against the will of the Albanian population. A great dilemma 
that the Albanians will certainly then face is how to preserve 
the ethnic rights of the Serbian ethnic minority, because the 
Serbs who are a constitutive nation would thereby turn into an 
ethnic minority. This is not because a constitution would have 
it that way, but it is from a mathematical point of view. They 
will simply be a minority from a statistical point of view and 
regardless of any constitutional provisions. A climate of 
intolerance and hatred between Albanians and Serbs cannot be 
avoided. It will not be possible to avoid revanchism. 
  The problem is how long that would be possible to endure. 
  How can this Balkan knot be later untangled is a question. 
According to what I have learned, Albania itself is hardly 
delighted with joining Kosovo soon. Kosovo is at the higher 
level of development in all social spheres, ranging from the 
cultural sphere to the economic basis. In this respect, after 
the reports and talks I had, I was very surprised when, in talks 
with people from Albania, I realized that they are not 
particularly delighted with that idea, fearing an overall 
domination of Kosovo Albanians in a future Albanian state. This 
fear of the Albanians is a fact. I think that Kosovo Albanians 
also know this very well. Terrible problems ensued with the 
union of East and West Germany because, in 45 years of living 
separately they became two separate bodies.

<F P=106> [Article by Christopher Lord, professor of </F>
international politics, Charles University, Prague: "The West 
Europeanization of `Not Western Europe'"] 
  [Text] The following is based on an address delivered 
March 10 at an international conference titled "Civil-Military 
Relations in a Democracy" in the National Assembly of 
Slovenia. 
  First I must excuse my clumsy title. Originally I wrote "The 
Europeanization of the Balkans," which seems on the face of it 
easier to understand. But as I reflected on the problem a little 
more, it occurred to me that this political question affects not 
just the Balkans, but the entire post-Soviet complex of 
countries and territories, some "European," some "Asian" and 
some lying somewhere in between. Many writers these days use 
expressions such as "Central and Eastern Europe" or "Central, 
Eastern and Southeastern Europe," but it seems to me that these 
expressions are actually dishonest. They are used to suggest 
that a place called "Eastern Europe" does exist somewhere or 
other, but that the particular country or countries being 
discussed are not necessarily part of it. 
  The only thing that really unites all the countries we might 
want to talk about is that they are not--not so far, anyway--in 
Western Europe. For that reason, then, I have decided to adopt 
the term suggested by Michelle Bertelli: "Not Western Europe." 
  The difficulty of locating Eastern Europe on a map these 
days--does any country now identify itself as East 
European?--leads me to suspect that "Europe" itself is merely 
the figment of our political imagination. But "Western Europe" 
anyway does seem to have a real meaning, even if the West 
European identity, too, is vague in places. 
  So I hope this is enough to explain my title. What I want to 
analyze is the spread of the political culture of Western Europe 
to countries formerly under Soviet Marxist-Leninist, Titoist, 
Hoxhaist and other so-called "socialist" regimes. 
  As a resident of the Czech Republic and a visitor to 
Slovenia, I am struck by the fact that these two countries both 
now look like very good candidates for integration into Western 
Europe at an early date. This naturally leads to self-satisfied 
self-congratulation from the populations, and also maybe some 
envy from neighboring states. 
  But apart from these emotional reactions--and I would say 
that most of the political rhetoric we hear about "peace," 
"security," "democracy" and so on is in reality merely 
emotional--perhaps we can suggest some objective reasons why 
this might be the case, and this will then help us to understand 
some larger issues. 
  There are, I think, three factors that link the Czech 
Republic and Slovenia. The first is the preservation of the 
broadly liberal intellectual habits of the professional people 
in society; the second is a more or less homogeneous population 
(in terms of national self-identification, anyway); and the 
third is the existence of appropriate borders isolating that 
population from neighboring groups. 
  First, the intellectual culture. It should be obvious to 
anyone with the smallest knowledge of "Not Western Europe" that 
only a few people had any serious involvement in its political 
structures. While many people felt compelled to use Party 
jargon, and maybe attend some "political" social and sporting 
events, most people simply tried to get on with their lives and 
pursued private interests. For educated, professional people, 
these interests were reading, writing, playing chess or a 
musical instrument, visiting the theater, the ballet or the 
opera--the kind of intellectual interests, in fact, that sadly 
have decayed in the West. Now, these people, who are mostly 
still just trying to get on with their lives and struggling to 
make sense of the chaos of transition, represent a reservoir of 
civilized values that is crucial for the process of cultural and 
political regeneration we can call "democratization." 
  Without naming names, countries that abandon these values 
and, instead of preserving some version of this intellectual 
culture, seek to set up some more fanatical, extremist set of 
values, are not likely to be accepted into Western Europe. So 
this is one factor. 
  The second and third factors are related to the idea of the 
nation-state. Countries hoping to join Western Europe will have 
to resemble West European countries first. And to do that they 
need to fulfill two conditions: have a homogeneous population 
and be isolated in their own territory. This is a 
political-cultural demand made by the West European countries, 
which are apparently not able or willing to deal with other 
countries on any other basis. 
  France is the territory where the French people live; 
Portugal is the land of the Portuguese. And Western Europe as a 
whole, with a common political-cultural origin in the successor 
state of the disintegrated Western Roman Empire, is now 
searching blindly for its own reflection in the turbulent waters 
of the very large and very chaotic political-cultural complex on 
its eastern border. 
  According to these criteria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia 
come out pretty near the top of the list--though, of course, we 
can add some remarks and qualifications. Czech bourgeois 
intellectual values look as solid as ever. The Czechs tolerate 
some political extremism, certainly, but this is a sign of 
political maturity and not of failure or incompetence. There is 
a characteristic style of skeptical intellectualism which, 
whatever other defects it might have, is unlikely to provide a 
basis for ideologies of hatred and fanaticism. 
  The territorial question is closely bound up with the 
"divorce" with Slovakia. This was accepted, in the end, as a sad 
necessity, though it disrupted life for many people. It was most 
difficult for those caught on the "other side," but now that the 
situation is more or less stable, we can say that the Slovaks 
now living in the Czech Republic are living as Czechs--either as 
actual Czech citizens, or at least as permanent members of the 
Czech population. Since they share a common recent history and 
Czechoslovak political culture, this means that the criterion of 
homogeneity is more or less fulfilled--adding the qualification 
that the smaller populations of Romanies, Germans, Poles and 
others are not numerous or well-organized enough to have a 
material effect on political life. 
  The same thing cannot be said for Slovakia, where there is a 
large and politically active Hungarian population. The division 
of Czechoslovakia has created an imbalance as far as my two 
criteria are concerned--and so we see that the Czech Republic is 
closer to integration, for these objective reasons, than the 
Slovak Republic. The mismatch between borders and populations 
means that Slovakia will have to solve its problems with Hungary 
before it can look like an acceptable nation-state as far as the 
West is concerned. 
  Hungary is locked in a similar situation with Romania, and 
other countries meshed into this "Not Western Europe" type of 
cross-border politics will find it significantly more difficult 
to reorient themselves to the political-cultural values of the 
West. 
  Slovenia is also in a "proto-nation-state" condition, but 
for 
very different reasons. Having escaped the Yugoslav wars by a 
whisker, the Slovenes now find themselves in a state of their 
own. There are no significant enclaves of "foreign" populations 
inside Slovenia and no significant exclaves of Slovenes outside 
the country. Business seems to be booming, even if most of it is 
probably black (or at least dark gray), and the language of 
everyday politics is calm and professional--definitely not the 
case in some other former Yugoslav republics one could mention. 
  To take the argument a little further, let's look at 
Kazakhstan, the only post-Soviet state in which the titular 
population, the Kazakhs, is actually a minority. The approximate 
figures are 40 percent Kazakh, 38 percent Russian and 22 percent 
others, including 5 percent Germans and, bizarrely, a small 
minority of Czechs. Although the borders of this very large 
country (2.7 million square kilometers) may roughly correspond 
to the boundaries of the territories over which the originally 
nomadic Kazakh tribes once roamed, the territory is not at all 
homogeneous, since in many areas Russians and Kazakhs live 
separate if parallel cultural lives. 
  Kazakhstan is very far from being a "nation-state." And if 
we 
put Kazakhstan at the far end of the spectrum of integration, we 
can at last compare the prospects of the various candidates for 
West Europeanization according to objective criteria. 
  Estonia, say, despite its very civilized population, must be 
placed closer to the Kazakh end of the spectrum. Its territory 
is at present also home to a large population of Russians, most 
of whom are certainly not living as Estonians, but still enjoy 
the vodka-and-misery lifestyle of the dear old USSR. 
  If we want to find another country to put somewhere near the 
top of the list, Poland looks like a good bet. Its population is 
pretty much homogeneous, but it doesn't quite fulfill the border 
requirement, since a significant number of Poles reside in 
neighboring countries. This problem is most serious in 
Lithuania; but while this makes Polish-Lithuanian relations a 
bit sticky it does not actually create any serious international 
difficulties for Poland. 
  By the same logic, we could put Hungary and Albania on the 
list, but significantly lower down, because of the difficulties 
experienced by Hungarians and Albanians living in other states. 
Readers will be able to fill in the names of whatever other 
states they may be interested in. 
  What are the consequences of this analysis for practical 
policy? Let's take a look at two other countries with extremely 
serious and difficult problems: the Russian Federation and the 
rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  It is quite clear that these tow countries at present fail 
to 
fulfill our three criteria, and by wide margins. In the case of 
Russia, though, I think we must still be patient, since it is 
still in a phase of transition, and the wide swings in Russia's 
internal politics illustrate the instability of its general 
situation. The populations and borders bear little relationship 
to one another, and due to the enormous expansion of the various 
incarnations of the Russian state, there are many enclaves of 
other populations still living on their ancient homelands within 
what we tend to think of as "Russia." Add to this mix the 
effects of the large population movements of the Soviet period, 
and the result if a Russian-speaking federation that is actually 
polycultural and polynational. 
  I would like to draw one important conclusion from this in 
connection with the rump Yugoslavia. In the USSR, there was an 
attempt to create a synthetic Homo sovieticus Soviet 
nationality; Marshal Tito made a similar effort with the 
so-called Yugoslavs. When the Yugoslav Federation began to break 
up, under complex and tragic circumstances, the West, in a 
political reflex action, tried to find a Yugoslav nation-state 
to bargain with. This had the immediate effect of giving 
international legitimacy to the factions in the Yugoslav 
People's Army and elsewhere who were soon to bring the phrase 
"ethnic cleansing" to the ears of a horrified world. 
  It would be too much to suggest that the West is responsible 
for the wars of the former Yugoslavia; but the blind policy of 
seeking West-European-type nation-states where none existed 
before has definitely contributed to the tragedy. 
  What is the alternative? It is to deal with states and 
populations as they actually are, and not as we might like them 
to be in some "European" fantasy world. The fact that 
Kazakhstan, for example, does not have the population structure 
of a West European nation-state does not mean it should 
automatically and permanently be excluded from the political, 
cultural and economic life of the international community. 
  What right do we have to penalize states just because they 
are culturally pluralistic? We should develop a political 
culture sophisticated enough to deal with the objective 
complexities of the problem concerned. 
  And lest anyone think this is just a theoretical or abstract 
problem, let me leave you with this thought: 
  The political and cultural structure of Yugoslavia had many 
things in common with that of the USSR, to the point that many 
analysts speak of Yugoslavia as the USSR in miniature. Apart 
from differences of scale, though, there is also the difference 
that the former USSR still has a formidable nuclear arsenal at 
its disposition. If the Soviet successor states, by the same 
logic, and supported by an indifferent "Europeanizing" Western 
policy, begin to follow the same path of expulsion and genocide 
in the name of national purity, then I for one will be moving to 
Africa.

    [Editorial Report] Lezhe KOHA JONE in Albanian on 20 April 
on pages one and two carries three 500-word correspondents' 
reports from Tirana, Korce, and Gjirokaster under the general 
headline "Greek Minority Leaders Detained by the Police." Bari 
GAZETA SHQIPTARE in Albanian on 20 April carries a 300-word "Fa. 
Ba." report from Sarande entitled "`Omonia' Activists From the 
South Detained." Tirana RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE and ZERI I 
POPULLIT in Albanian on 20 April make no mention of the 
detention of Greek minority leaders. 
  T. Cela writes in KOHA JONE, "According to information 
reaching our editorial office late in the evening of 18 April as 
well as yesterday morning, the main leaders of Omonia and the 
Human Rights Defense Party (PDNJ), which is represented in 
parliament, have been detained by the police in some southern 
districts and in Tirana." 
  Cela later continues, "It seems that interstate tensions 
have 
this time not spared these two organizations, whose leaders have 
taken up the defense of the Greek minority in Albania. Only a 
few days ago, in one of the zigzags that have characterized the 
Albanian official attitude, President Berisha stated that the 
deterioration of relations between the two neighbors would not 
influence the Albanian Government's attitude to the Greek 
minority." 
  Interviewed by Cela, PDNJ Chairman Vasil Melo is reported as 
declaring, "I cannot say anything or give any explanation of 
what has happened. I have been told on the phone from 
Gjirokaster about some detentions. I know that Mr. Andrea 
Marto, deputy chairman of Omonia in Tirana, was detained on 
Monday [18 April] evening, and that documentation was taken from 
the Omonia offices." 
  Reporting from Korce under the headline "Omonia Chairman 
Detained by the Police," Z. Dule writes: 
  "The homes of the leaders of Omonia in the districts of 
Devoll, Pogradec, and Kolonje have been searched. Mrs Ermioni 
Andrea, Omonia chairwoman in Korce; Jani Mulas, Omonia deputy 
chairman; Kostandina Tushi, Omonia secretary; Niko Mongoleci, 
chairman of the Albanian-Greek Friendship Association; Gjerkji 
Leka, chairman of the PDNJ; and Stefan Papa, member of the PDNJ 
Presidium, all became the targets of a large scale operation by 
the ShIK [National Intelligence Service] and the police in the 
early hours of the night of 18-19 April. It was 2200 on Monday 
evening when a group of ShIK agents and policemen knocked at Mrs 
Ermioni Andrea's door. `After we opened the door, seven people 
-- five civilians and two policemen -- came in,' Mr. Sotiraq 
Andrea, husband of the chairwoman of Omonia in Korce, explained 
to KOHA JONE, 'After identifying themselves, they started 
searching the apartment, ransacking everything. They took with 
them books, magazines, and dictionaries in Greek. When they 
left, the ShIK agents also took Mrs Ermione Andrea, on the 
pretext that they wanted to search the Omonia office.' On 
Tuesday Mr. Andrea learned of his wife's fate when he asked the 
police. `They told me that they had set off for Tirana at 1400, 
having found compromising material in the office,' Mr. Andrea 
said, not excluding the possibility that the ShIK itself might 
have planted material with anticonstitutional contents in the 
office. The apartment of Mr. Niko Mungoleci, chairman of the 
Albanian-Greek friendship Association, was searched, and he was 
also detained. Searches were also carried out of the family of 
Mr. Jani Mula, deputy chairman of Omonia; in the family of 
Omonia secretary Kostandina Tusha, wife of the well-known 
painter Vangjush Tusha; in the homes of PDNJ Chairman Gjergji 
Leka and PDNJ Presidium member Stefan Papa, etc. `We are 
worried about our father,' Mr. Stefan Papa's son told KOHA JONE. 
When the search was carried out on the night of 18 April, he was 
in Salonika. He reported to the police on the morning of 19 
April. Besides this, the Omonia chairmen in Devoli, Kolonje, and 
Pogradec have been subjected to searches and taken in for 
questioning. We did not succeed in obtaining any official 
confirmation because the operation is still continuing. Nor is 
the exact number of those detained known, because it is still 
unknown whether they will be arrested following their detention 
and accused of anticonstitutional activities." 
  An unnamed KOHA JONE correspondent in Gjirokaster writes, 
"The police made a series of detentions in some homes of Omonia 
leaders in Gjirokaster late on 18 April. We have learned that 
Theodori Bezhani, Omonia chairman for Gjirokaster District; 
Kosta Oirjako, resident of the village of Dervican; Irakli 
Sirmo, and others have been detained. We have also learned that 
there have been detentions of Greek-minority Albanian citizens 
in Tepelene and Sarande. On Tuesday, police officials arrived 
from Tirana and took the detainees to the capital. Trying to 
find out more about this operation and the reason behind these 
detentions, a police officer involved in this lightning 
operation confirmed to us, `A U.S.-type rifle and a considerable 
number of hunting cartridges were found in Mr. Behani's house, 
and it is not known whether he possessed a permit.' We have 
also learned that his home contained a considerable amount of 
literature covered by the Law on Anticonstitutional Activity. 
This literature included calendars showing maps of the 
so-called Vorio-Epiros of 1914, and maps showing this area's 
borders as mentioned in the aforementioned literature. A few 
bullets and anticonstitutional literature were also found in 
Kosta Qirjako's house. Nevertheless, the police have still not 
confirmed the precise reason for these citizens' detention. 
Similarly, nothing is known about the detentions of the 
Greek-minority citizens in Tepelene and Sarabde except that they 
are connected with the work of the Greek-minority political 
organization in Albania. News of these detentions was followed 
with very great interest in Greece yesterday. All the 
television stations and daily papers gave reports, without 
explaining the charges behind these detentions. Nor have the 
Omonia leaders issued any statement about the reasons for the 
detentions, despite our correspondent's insistence."

  [Excerpt] Budapest (DDP/ADN) -- German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl has promised Hungary support in its efforts for full 
membership of the European Union. Germany would accompany 
Hungary on this path "with advice, but above all with actions," 
Kohl said at a news conference in Budapest today at the end of 
his official visit to Hungary. Without Hungary, Europe is only a 
torso and such a Europe is undesirable. 
  He will use Germany's EU presidency, which begins on 1 July, 
to win support in the EU for Hungary's admission, as he has done 
with Spain and Portugal, among others, the chancellor said. He 
will moreover place on the table the "proposal, as yet not 
popular in Europe" that Hungarian deputies should enter the 
European parliament in an advisory capacity. 
  This is naturally above all help for self-help, said Kohl. 
The key to EU membership lies with Hungary itself, which is 
today a "notable example of stability in a difficult period of 
transformation." The Budapest government is the only one in 
Eastern Europe to last a full legislative period and can point 
to considerable successes in spite of all its problems. 
  Germany supports the French proposal of reaching a joint 
stance on the Bosnian issue, as well as President Yeltsin's 
warning to the Serbs. The Russian president must also be 
included in future developments. 
  Kohl spoke against the idea, voiced in Budapest recently by 
Bavarian Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber, of introducing partial 
EU membership. The principle still holds that the chancellor is 
the one who determines the main direction of policy, Kohl said 
in response to a query. The best preparation for EU membership 
is closer links between the community and those states that wish 
to join. To this end "the terminology has to be sorted out," 
Kohl stressed. For example, Poland is not in eastern Europe, as 
is so often said, but in central Europe. 
  Prime Minister Peter Boross indicated that Hungary will 
shortly be approaching the UN in connection with possible 
compensation for the losses it has incurred from the blockade 
against Serbia. The close cooperation with Germany is an 
important factor in involving his country in Europe's economic 
system. He expressed the hope that with German help Hungary 
will become a full EU member by the year 2000 or perhaps even 
earlier. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert of the </F>
Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP, by Eszter Radai; place and date 
not given: "Room for Maneuver and Economic Policy -- The MSZP's 
Technocrat"] 
  [Text] After internal debates, he was put in the 
third place on the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] national 
list. The realistic nature of his program is seen as a 
negotiating basis even by those people who would reject 
coalition with the MSZP out of hand. He is often the topic of 
conversations and many guesses can also be heard about him while 
he does not give many interviews. What are his views on the 
party's tasks in the near and distant future, and what are his 
views on his own role? Eszter Radai interviewed Laszlo 
Bekesi. 
  [Radai] The politicians of rival parties and even 
independent political analysts claim that [MSZP Chairman] Gyula 
Horn is using you to make the MSZP appear presentable and 
suitable for coalition -- while there is a tough struggle 
between the two of you. What are your views on this? 
  [Bekesi] If this was true, I would find it flattering that I 
can make a whole party presentable or suitable for coalition. 
Naturally, no one ever denied that there are a number of trends 
in the MSZP. It is usually me who represents the technocratic 
views that are based on rational facts, which place the economy 
in the forefront, and push the ideological considerations into 
the background. 
  [Radai] Assessing the coalition possibilities, leaders of 
other parties have recently been stating that they would not 
have any objections to the Socialists if you determined the 
party's image and it could be guaranteed that your program would 
be implemented. For example, [Federation of Young Democrats, 
FIDESZ Chairman] Viktor Orban said that "Bekesi's program could 
be a basis for negotiations." 
  [Bekesi] A party that has any self-esteem does not normally 
accept conditions that are set for it by its rivals. The 
program that is known as the Bekesi program was accepted by the 
MSZP and this is our official program. Seeing this as a 
negotiating basis means a potential partnership. However, it 
lacks seriousness to tell us in a message whom we should replace 
and where we should place people. As matter of fact, not much 
later we learned from the FIDESZ's other statements that no 
matter what kind of program the MSZP has, relations between 
these two parties will not be formed on the basis of the 
programs, rather, on the basis of the sentiments of the two 
parties' leaders toward each other, on the basis of the past, on 
prejudices, and I do not know what else.... 
  [Radai] Is it certain that the Bekesi program will remain 
the MSZP's program? In the past years, we have had plenty of 
chances to see that it is possible to deviate from programs. 
Will you be able to resist the pressure, especially if it is 
exerted by the trade union leaders who are in the coalition? 
Are you not afraid that you will be blackmailed regularly? 
  [Bekesi] The election alliance with the National Federation 
of Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] does not imply the dangers 
that are often mentioned. For example, the dangers that, in the 
government position, the MSZP's ability to act will be hampered 
by the dominance of trade unions; the economic policy based on 
modernization will be replaced by an economic policy based on 
distribution; trade union demands can be asserted much better 
from within than from outside; or that politics and interest 
representation will be mixed up. These dangers do not 
automatically follow from an election alliance. 
  [Radai] However, we are talking about a prominent place on 
the MSZP's list; [MSZOSZ Chairman] Sandor Nagy is on the second 
place, ahead of you. 
  [Bekesi] This certainly has a negative message, but I would 
not like to discuss this just now. However, if the danger of 
setting up a trade union type government was in the background 
of the election alliance then I would be the first one to 
protest most decisively. In fact, I would not even participate 
in this. This would be just as bad for the country as the 
confirmation of another conservative governmental cycle. 
  [Radai] Nevertheless, I do not understand why you exclude 
the possibility of this. 
  [Bekesi] Because the MSZP accepted a modernization program 
on which its whole political program and campaign is based, and 
on the basis of which it decided its coalition principles and 
laid them down in writing. Otherwise, the program would have 
been modified, its modernization goals would have been softened, 
and actual trade union demands would have been included in it 
that -- if this is what the electors wish -- then could be 
implemented as a government program. However, this did not 
happen. On the other hand, we never denied -- in fact, I 
usually emphasize this -- that, in the course of implementing 
the program, a government that includes the MSZP will fight 
tough battles with the interest lobbies, in spite of the 
election alliance with the MSZOSZ. Therefore, we are not to 
prepare for some kind of a peaceful coexistence based on 
concessions, rather, the chance for the self-restriction of 
trade unions will increase, and the basis for this will be 
established precisely by the good relations between the MSZP and 
the trade unions. 
  [Radai] In your view, are people who will vote for the 
Socialists aware that they will also be voting for a very strict 
economic program that is much more liberal than social 
democratic? 
  [Bekesi] It only makes sense to describe an economic 
program in economic philosophy terms if a government or country 
has a choice. However, today in Hungary, the room for maneuver 
is so narrow and the path is so determined that a realistic 
economic policy necessarily has to have more liberal than 
conservative or social democratic elements. Rather than meaning 
that the MSZP is promoting a liberal economic policy, this means 
that in this situation, being realists, the MSZP is also 
accepting the goals that have a liberal content. In fact, I do 
not even protest against being called a liberal economic policy 
maker because I am convinced that for decades, this will be the 
only realistic economic policy in Hungary. 
  [Radai] Has your move from the original eighth place to 
third got anything to do with the fact that the Bekesi program 
has become the official party program? 
  [Bekesi] The official explanation for the eighth place was 
that the party leadership adhered to two basic principles when 
it made up the party list, namely that it should reflect the 
party hierarchy, and that it should ensure the agreed positions 
of election allies. In this context, my eighth place was 
justifiable because I do not participate in the work of the 
party's leading bodies, I am only a simple parliamentary deputy. 
However, the national list can, at the same time, be seen as a 
kind of party message as to what programs and people it 
considers important for itself. Therefore, my eighth place was 
unacceptable for the party's majority and naturally for me, too. 
The election committee that made the original proposal 
obviously had not properly assessed the situation and the power 
structure. It would have been a strange decision that would not 
have strengthened respect for the party if a politician who 
played a major role in drawing up the program had been pushed 
into the background. The assessment of the power structure was 
mistaken because it was based on the assumption that the 
congress and the party's majority that is to make the decision 
would accept this. It did not accept this, in fact, there was 
an grassroots outcry. 
  [Radai] [Prime Minister] Peter Boross recently said that the 
MSZP is deceiving its electors by not naming its prime 
ministerial candidate. Why and for how long do you wish to keep 
this issue pending? 
  [Bekesi] Until the elections, or even further. We will 
decide this at an extraordinary congress after the elections but 
before the coalition talks. Social-liberal, Christian-social, 
or broad social-liberal-conservative coalitions require a 
completely different prime ministers. A concrete person can even 
prevent and exclude certain possibilities. As we do not wish to 
limit ourselves and do not wish to prevent the establishment of 
an efficient coalition, we are now waiting, and we do not 
exclude the possibility of finding a suitable person, who enjoys 
the confidence of the other possible coalition partners, from 
outside the party. 
  [Radai] Is it also possible that the MSZP will win the 
elections with a big majority, reaches very good results, and 
still offers the prime ministerial chair to someone else? 
  [Bekesi] No, this is impossible. A party that plays a 
determining role after the elections and generously offers its 
prime ministerial function to someone else does not exist 
anywhere in the world. 
  [Radai] An increasing number of people, including some 
Socialist politicians, have been saying that they are afraid 
that the MSZP will win too well, and it will find it difficult 
or impossible to find coalition partners. 
  [Bekesi] It is undoubtedly true that a strong imbalance in 
the power structure can make it difficult to form a coalition. 
It is unlikely that we will reach more than 50 percent. 
Therefore, it has to be a coalition. However, if the MSZP's 
majority is so big that the partners would be in a subordinate 
position, they might prefer to be in an opposition role. Of 
course, this is only speculation. On the basis of various 
assessments and my personal experience, I do not exclude the 
possibility that we will win the elections. However, I am not 
expecting a landslide victory. Should this nevertheless happen, 
it will present a new situation. 
  [Radai] What are your views on [Alliance of Free Democrats, 
SZDSZ campaign chief] Balint Magyar's recent statement according 
to which the SZDSZ is only willing to enter into a coalition 
with the MSZP if the liberals can be the leading force of the 
coalition? 
  [Bekesi] This stance is a bit difficult for me to accept. I 
am not saying that we cannot talk about this, but ultimatums 
should not be made, because this is a very delicate and 
complicated issue. 
  [Radai] Is it possible that you will be the prime minister? 
  [Bekesi] Hardly. This is very unlikely because the MSZP's 
leadership has completely different ideas. I do not know what 
most people in the party think about this issue because I have 
never been assessed this way. 
  [Radai] Would you object to Gabor Kuncze being prime 
minister? 
  [Bekesi] Not at all. Kuncze is a nice person, calm 
politician, and I have a very good relationship with him. It is 
a different matter what kind of political power structure, 
election results, and coalition agreements are needed for 
Kuncze's name to be put forward. It is certain that I could 
work very well with him, I think he is an excellent person. 
  [Radai] What will the MSZP do if it wins the elections but 
does not find any coalition partners? 
  [Bekesi] If it does not find any coalition partners because 
all parties distance themselves from it then it will have to go 
into opposition. This is the only case when a victorious party 
has a political and moral basis to go into opposition. In 
theory, it is also possible -- although I cannot imagine this -- 
that we accept governing in a minority. This would probably 
only last a very short time. We would probably be turned out of 
office on the first possible occasion. In that case, new 
elections would have to be called.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Ivan Szabo by Miklos </F>
Merenyi; place and date not given: "Deficit Is the Cost of 
Growth"] 
  [Text] The upset economic balance is a harbinger of growth, 
states Ivan Szabo, with whom we also tried to draw the balance 
of his barely more than one year in the Finance Ministry. 
According to Szabo, growth increases the demand for investment 
goods, therefore, we have to expect a deficit in the payment 
balance for years to come. This will establish the foundations 
for the long-awaited boom. 
  [Merenyi] Nowadays, the biggest economic policy debates are 
induced by the attempts to find out what the upset macroeconomic 
balance indicates: The fact that the crisis is prolonged or 
that growth has started. What is your view? 
  [Szabo] The truth is somewhere between the two. The same 
figures can indicate different phenomena. At the end of 1992 
and the beginning of 1993, the primary cause of the decline was 
our reduced exports, which in turn was mainly caused by the 
recession in Western Europe. However, now, the same figure of 
balance deficit indicates something else. The bigger half of 
imports consisted of investment goods in 1993, too. 
  The payment balance will continue to be negative for another 
three to four years and Western recession will play a decreasing 
role in this. The main cause will be the investment needs of 
growth. 
  [Merenyi] This has never been questioned by anyone. At the 
same time, the statistical data give the impression that the 
decisive section of imports is used for stocking up raw 
materials and for consumer goods. Some of the foreign resources 
cover public consumption. 
  [Szabo] It is undoubtedly true that public consumption has 
increased to a certain extent. However, this was not decisive 
in 1993, either. If I disregard the fighter planes bought from 
Russia in exchange for the Soviet state debt, then half of the 
remaining amount consisted of engineering imports. Half of the 
consumer goods imports consists of pharmaceutical products which 
again is not in the luxury category. Therefore, the proportions 
are increasingly shifting toward investments that are the basis 
of growth. 
  I admit that stockpiling in the enterprises is an existing 
phenomenon, however, the 4.3 percent industrial growth consumes 
this: The industrial sphere began to grow already in 1993 and 
the agricultural sphere will do this in 1994. The GDP may rise 
by as much as 1.5 percent. This will not, of course, be an even 
growth, but it is certain that we are over the worst. It is 
possible that the point is that the state of the economy is 
better than can be shown by statistics. 
  [Merenyi] The balance of payments deficit ultimately means 
the import of foreign resources because it is only partially 
covered by the inflow of working capital. In other words, the 
debt is increasing. For how long? 
  [Szabo] We also have to add here that the repayment of debts 
means a huge withdrawal of resources from the Hungarian economy. 
Therefore, the real question in my view is if the incoming 
resources do actually serve economic growth. In other words, 
whether there will be some gain from it or will it only help to 
finance the budget deficit. In 1991, the budget situation was 
much better, perhaps we should have taken on more loans for 
modernization at that time. However, at that time, everyone was 
very cautious about increasing the foreign debt. 
  [Merenyi] And mainly the Hungarian Democratic Forum was 
cautious. 
  [Szabo] Not only. The attitude that the requirements of the 
balance have to be placed above growth was generally accepted in 
financial circles. This was partly justified by the need to 
suppress inflation. Nevertheless, it might have been worthwhile 
increasing the debt by a few billion U.S. dollars at that time. 
  [Merenyi] Has the government decided on any measures that 
will improve the balance? 
  [Szabo] The cabinet is very seriously dealing with the issue 
that once we managed to induce some growth, it should not be 
quashed by a general suppression of consumption which also cools 
off investments. We have to find methods to curb the 
population's consumption, especially the luxury consumption. 
  [Merenyi] Is it not shortsighted that in December 1993, at 
the Finance Ministry's initiative, the limit that defined to 
what extent the Hungarian National Bank [MNB] can finance the 
budget deficit was lifted? 
  [Szabo] In my view, the formulation of the central bank law 
proved shortsightedness because it did not detect the negative 
processes in the economy, and it remained insensitive to the 
budget difficulties. Raising the former 4-percent financing 
limit to 80 billion forints meant that economic reality was 
taken into consideration. Naturally, in the long run, it is 
best if the central bank simply does not participate in 
financing the budget. I am now expecting a quiet breakthrough 
on this. The central bank as a foreign currency authority has 
just given permission to the Finance Ministry to issue forint 
bonds to people classed as foreigners under the Foreign 
Exchanges Act. This is the first step. 
  [Merenyi] Has the Finance Ministry's relationship with the 
MNB improved since the bank started to conduct a less strict 
financial policy and personnel changes were also implemented? 
  [Szabo] This is not an issue of personnel. All institutions 
protect rock solidly their power positions. The central bank, 
for example, protected its foreign exchange monopoly while the 
commercial banks began to issue bonds on the international 
capital and money markets. However, at the time, the MNB did 
not give permission to the state to do this. 
  [Merenyi] The debate on the forint devaluation also 
accompanied the government's operation. What are your views on 
this now? 
  [Szabo] If the pressure of wage increases above the level of 
inflation is not removed through a social agreement, devaluation 
only has a short-term benefit and much rather helps the prices 
than exports to increase. 
  [Merenyi] Among the many contradictory indicators, there 
is a clear one: The budget deficit is at the planned level. 
This has not happened before. What is the reason? 
  [Szabo] Although occasional "blows" exist on both the 
revenue and expenditure sides, we managed to keep them in 
balance. In addition to this, we have also had a change of 
attitude: When we calculated the 330-billion-forint deficit, we 
tried to produce a realistic figure. We have also achieved 
positive results in the area of tax discipline. In addition to 
this, for the first time this year, the issuance of bonds is 
scheduled which eliminates the liquidity problems of the central 
budget. 
  [Merenyi] So the taxpayers are better at paying. Has the 
management of publicly financed institutions become stricter? 
  [Szabo] This is a question of the reform of state finances. 
We are not working on an overall program, rather, we are 
examining the duties of the central sphere. We will be able to 
include the results of this in next year's budget. 
  The discipline of management has to be strengthened and has 
to be newly regulated in laws. From financing in proportion to 
time, we have to progress toward financing that is linked to 
performance. It is important to regulate anew the management of 
treasury assets, and to accept the law on public purchases; we 
will hand over the draft bill on this to the next government. 
It is also unavoidable to reduce the number of special funds, 
at least to the level that is used in the European Union. 
  [Merenyi] These are obvious facts for experts. Why have 
these measures not been taken in the past years? 
  [Szabo] Measures have certainly been taken. However, they 
are very difficult to implement. The deficit of state finances 
is so big now that necessity will force the implementation of 
these measures.... 
  [Merenyi] Why is the government's decision being delayed on 
the second step of bank consolidation? 
  [Szabo] The government decided in 1993 that the capital 
injections have to be completed by 31 May. Concrete technical 
preparations are in progress, and this does not require further 
government decisions. The government will receive reports after 
the general meetings. 
  [Merenyi] At what stage is the report that you will hand 
over to your successor on the work of the Finance Ministry? 
  [Szabo] The report on the Finance Ministry's personnel and 
structural situation will be completed by the end of May. In 
addition to this, we are preparing an overall report on the 
processes that have been completed and the ones that are at the 
preparation stage. I am convinced that my successor will 
receive a well-arranged and clear report whichever party he 
should represent. I would have been very happy if I had been 
able to take over the leadership of finance in the same way. 
Unfortunately, I found nothing but empty drawers. I did not 
receive anything from my predecessor. I learned from this and I 
know how inconvenient it was. 
  [Merenyi] Will this summary include the list of guarantees 
taken on by the government? 
  [Szabo] On the basis of end-of-March data I can say that we 
are maintaining 48 guarantees based on individual government 
decisions and these amount to 122 billion forints. At the most, 
some 22 billion forints will apply to 1994, however, it is 
unlikely that the whole amount will be drawn. The final 
scheduling of the guarantees will be contained in the bank 
contracts, and a significant amount of them can only be drawn 
after a five- to 10-year wait. Therefore, I believe that if we 
adhere to the 3-percent limit defined in the law on state 
finances then we are not taking on a big risk. At the same 
time, we are helping the development of industrial capacities 
suitable for export production for which it is justified to give 
guarantees.

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Apr--According to First Deputy Defense 
Minister Jerzy Milewski, the Polish Army must adapt itself to 
joint actions with the NATO states' armies. When Poland becomes 
a member of NATO, its entire Army or a part of it may find 
itself under foreign command, Milewski said today during a 
meeting with journalists in Warsaw on Poland's defense policy. 
  Milewski and other high-ranking representatives of the 
National Defense Ministry emphasized that Poland will not be 
able to defend itself in anything greater than a local conflict. 
According to them, there is no great threat of an outbreak of a 
global conflict or a great conventional war in Europe today.

<F P=106> [Article by "an" and "knysz": "Cease-Fire at the Top; </F>
Neither Rosati Nor Borowski for Finance Minister?"] 
  [Text] During yesterday's meeting with the deputies' 
club of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], Lech Walesa agreed 
to the introduction of deputy ministers from the coalition to 
the Defense Ministry [MON], the Internal Affairs Ministry [MSW], 
and the Foreign Ministry [MSZ]. But he did not change his mind 
on Rosati. 
  Up to now, the president has successfully resisted attempts 
by the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who want to have 
their deputy ministers in the so-called Belweder ministries. "We 
cannot have a situation where every coalition will have its own 
ministers," Walesa repeated yesterday. 
  SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski responded: "Does that mean 
you have nothing against this coalition's presence in MON, the 
MSZ, and the MSW?" 
  "You are taking shortcuts," Walesa defended himself. But, in 
the end, he gave in and agreed to coalition deputy ministers 
being in MON and the MSW, but "using the MSZ as a model." That 
means that political deputy ministers from the SLD and the PSL 
will join MON and the MSW, but they will not administer the 
ministries. 
  The SLD did not manage to get anything done regarding 
Rosati. 
Walesa reminded them again that Professor Dariusz Rosati, who 
is being promoted by the SLD for finance minister and deputy 
minister for economic affairs and who was rejected by the 
president, used to be on the governing board of the Foreign Debt 
Service Fund. "Do you want people to go around and say that he 
got the post to cover up the affair?" the president yelled. 
  Marek Borowski, deputy chairman of the SLD club, asked the 
president bluntly: "Rosati is an honest man. Will you sign his 
nomination?" "I am not pressuring you [the SLD], so don't 
pressure me, either. If we are to return to anything, it should 
be you [Borowski]," Walesa replied. He also admitted that "even 
though I had quite a few disputes with Borowski, as far as his 
expertise is concerned, there are no reservations." 
  While talking with GAZETA WYBORCZA, Kwasniewski did not rule 
out that, in this situation, the SLD might give up Rosati, but, 
until talks with the PSL, Rosati continues to be the coalition's 
candidate. "Of course, I would like Borowski to be finance 
minister, but you just don't enter the same river twice," 
Kwasniewski explained. Another SLD politician said it is not 
very likely because Pawlak does not get along with Borowski. 
  We asked Borowski whether he would like to be finance 
minister again. "There are at least six reasons for which I 
would not agree. For now, it is enough to list one of them--no 
offer has been made to me," Borowski replied.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the </F>
Democratic Left Alliance, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio 
Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Excerpts] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is 
Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD]. Good morning to you, Sir. 
  [Kwasniewski] Good morning. 
  [Woyciechowski] I have read all of the press commentaries 
after yesterday's historical meeting between the SLD Sejm 
deputies and the president, and there are two titles: GAZETA 
WYBORCZA says "Cease-Fire," whereas TRYBUNA says "Agreement, 
Agreement, Agreement." Is it more like a cease-fire or more 
like an agreement? 
  [Kwasniewski] I certainly would hesitate to say that this 
was a historical meeting because I would rather reserve such 
assessments for a few months from now. But what definitely did 
happen was the establishment of contact between the SLD Sejm 
Deputies Club and the president. Such contact was missing for a 
long time, and, if there was any, it was just through the press 
and in a rather sharp tone, too. I believe the meeting may be 
more like a cease-fire as far as political issues are concerned 
in 1994, and also the possibility of focusing on the most 
important issues like preparing a constitution and necessary 
economic measures. I think there is agreement on some detailed 
issues. I mean we came to an agreement about the coalition's 
participation in the presidential ministries and also a certain 
procedure associated with the issue of the finance minister. So 
I think that on these specific issues... [Kwasniewski pauses] 
We also agreed on cooperation regarding constitutional issues. 
So on these issues, there is agreement. 
  [Woyciechowski] A cease-fire is something where people shoot 
at each other and then say: Why don't we stop for a moment 
before we resume shooting? 
  [Kwasniewski] You know, I think the conversation was 
important and honest because, among other things, neither side 
has any illusions; by the way, I began the meeting by saying 
this. The SLD is made up of a group of people and voters who 
have never voted for Lech Walesa, neither in Solidarity times 
nor in political times [sentence as heard]. On the other hand, 
Lech Walesa, coming as he does from a different camp, has never 
spared his remarks addressed at us, which were often very 
critical or, I would even say, malicious. And this situation is 
a fact and nobody can expect that even if very close cooperation 
takes place, there will be feelings--love or falling in love. 
But what is important is that, as a result of democratic 
decisions after 1993, both the president, who was elected in 
1990, and we, who constitute the coalition's main core after 
1993, are burdened with responsibility. This was a conversation 
between partners who are aware of the responsibility and who are 
aware that people do not wake up in the morning to read about 
new conflicts at the top of the power structure, but they would 
like to wake up in the morning to good music and positive news, 
then go to work in peace and return from work with a feeling of 
safety. It would be good to have a job at all. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Woyciechowski] Having seen the short pieces on the 
television newscast last night--we could see a very cordial 
atmosphere, laughter and relaxation--does that mean that Sejm 
deputies for the SLD, those who were there and their electorate, 
will vote for Lech Walesa in the next presidential election, or 
will they vote for Aleksander Kwasniewski? 
  [Kwasniewski] You know, I think your forecasts are too 
far-reaching. Let me begin with yesterday's atmosphere. I 
think it was one of [hesitating] seriousness. The questions were 
tough, and part of the meeting was conducted in silence, which 
is hard to.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And the television did not 
show that? 
  [Kwasniewski] I do not know what it showed. I have not seen 
it. The meeting lasted almost two hours, so I do not think that 
the television could have shown it in its entirety. But one 
must remember that holding the audience's complete silence and 
interest, where you have 200 Sejm deputies plus about 100 
journalists and television teams--that is not easy to do. There 
were moments of very serious conversation. [passage omitted] 
  As far as the presidential elections are concerned, I think 
that--by the way, this was the goal behind the meeting--the 
election campaign should not start too early unnecessarily. We 
are condemned to it, anyway--I mean in a positive sense--in 
1995, which is the scheduled time for the presidential 
elections. I think it is unavoidable that, just like any other 
political campaign, this one will be filled with confrontation, 
disputes, and strong words. I would also like the campaign to be 
about merits, but I realize that such appeals often are really 
wishful thinking instead of having to do with reality. It would 
be good if the campaign were to begin at a specific point in 
time, not sooner than.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] It has already begun at a 
certain point in time--several months ago. Who initiated the 
campaign? 
  [Kwasniewski] I think the campaign is a result of the fact 
that one person in Poland is determined, and it is no wonder. I 
mean Lech Walesa, who is eager to be reelected. He spoke out 
about it for quite a long time yesterday. And he spoke in a 
tone of self-confidence, saying that he at least has no doubt 
that he will indeed be reelected president. But he did speak 
about some seven years many times, so I am not sure how to... 
[Kwasniewski pauses] I think he meant seven years from today. 
From time to time, he mentioned seven years, so it was clear 
that he is interested in both a full implementation of his tasks 
in the current term, which is quite understandable, and in 
running in the 1995 election. But, like I said, the goal behind 
the meeting was to have 1994.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And what about yourself? 
Would you like to be president? 
  [Kwasniewski] I have spoken about this many times before. 
On this issue, neither I nor my political party has made any 
decision yet. Of course, we are not blind. We can see that 
there are all sorts of opinion polls published in which my name 
appears. Of course, I would be lying if I said it gives me no 
satisfaction that I rank high or even in first place. But I 
want to be clear on that: I have not made any decision, and I 
think that a year in Poland--and this is what is needed more or 
less to make a real decision on initiating the presidential 
campaign--is such a long time that there will be all kinds of 
events that will either increase such [hesitating] pressures on 
me or will weaken them and my readiness to make the decision. 
That is why I do not discuss this right now at all, and I admit 
quite frankly that I go to sleep without dreaming about the 
presidency, and I wake up after a good night's sleep also 
without thinking about the presidency. There are simply other 
issues I think are more urgent right now. 
  [Woyciechowski] How do you evaluate the results of the 
meeting now that more than 10 hours have elapsed? Are you 
satisfied with the results? 
  [Kwasniewski] I believe that the most important thing that 
was achieved was the return to communication between the 
president and.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That simply means talking, 
something that has been missing for how long? 
  [Kwasniewski] Well, as a matter of fact, I have not had the 
opportunity to talk with the president since the Sejm and the 
Senate started their work. It was our last meeting. After 
that, we had contacts related to all kinds of state celebrations 
or other; however, these were not occasions to hold talks. 
Thus, communication was established, and, in my opinion, it is 
the most important thing. As I said, as a consequence of the 
elections, both the president and we--participants of the 
coalition--bear responsibility for the same. I have often 
opposed, also here at Radio Zet, the concept, imposed by some 
advisers of the president, that the president is in opposition 
to the coalition. This is impossible. We are in the same 
configuration of power of the very same state. Therefore, it is 
impossible to... [Kwasniewski pauses] The president may 
cooperate with us well or not so well. He may or may not like 
the coalition. However, we are obliged by the Constitution to 
cooperate with one another. Thus, in this sense, there is a 
chance to improve cooperation, to make it more efficient, to 
avoid conflicts. 
  [Woyciechowski] Yesterday afternoon, after this two-hour 
meeting with the entire Parliamentary Club of the SLD, a 
face-to-face meeting, as the press called it, was held between 
you and the president. Was it really a face-to-face meeting, 
between you and the president only, or were there also 
presidential ministers and your SLD colleagues at the meeting? 
  [Kwasniewski] It was a meeting between only the president 
and me. I think that.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Without a microphone, 
without.... 
  [Kwasniewski, interrupting] That is right. I think it was a 
face-to-face meeting, that is certain. Now, I can only hope 
that no one heard that, but I cannot bet on that.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] How long did the talk last? 
  [Kwasniewski] Probably a half-hour or so. 
  [Woyciechowski] Did you drink coffee, mineral water, or 
something better? 
  [Kwasniewski] No, no, there was nothing better. There was 
no coffee or mineral water, either. It was a talk during which 
we tried to come to agreement on.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What was the talk about? 
  [Kwasniewski] First of all, about what the channels of 
cooperation and information should look like. Aside from that, 
there were also a few other issues that we discussed. However, 
it was a face-to-face talk, with no witnesses, so I believe that 
this must be borne in mind. 
  [Woyciechowski] It was a confidential talk, and you cannot 
speak about it. Do I understand you correctly? 
  [Kwasniewski] Well, it was not confidential. I think that 
sometimes such talks are held between people, and they want to 
discuss certain issues between themselves. This is actually 
what happened. Now, because it was a talk after a longer period 
of not talking, the meeting was all the more important. That 
is, at least I attach great importance to this talk. I believe 
that such talks with the president will be held now and then. I 
would really like that. 
  [Woyciechowski] What did Walesa really promise the SLD 
yesterday afternoon, or last night? 
  [Kwasniewski] This was a public meeting, and we not only can 
but also should discuss it. I believe that among the elements 
that were agreed upon... [Kwasniewski pauses] elements about 
which, one can say, there is agreement, is first of all that a 
very important issue, or even the most important issue, in 1994 
will be to prepare the constitution jointly. 
  [Woyciechowski] That means that the Small Constitution will 
not be amended after all? 
  [Kwasniewski] No. The Small Constitution is the second 
stage here, as it were. This means that we cooperate in line 
with the existing law within the framework of the Constitutional 
Committee of the National Assembly. Participating in it will 
also be representatives of the president. They will propose 
their ideas and concepts. This is their inalienable right. I 
believe that we will try to.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that the year 1994 
will be the year of the constitution? 
  [Kwasniewski] That is right. I would.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When will the constitution be 
adopted? In December? 
  [Kwasniewski] I believe that December is a good time--before 
Christmas. It is a good idea to finish this year with something 
very specific.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And, until that time, the 
Small Constitution will not be amended? 
  [Kwasniewski] I will even say more. I believe--and this is 
how I understand our joint decisions of yesterday--that we will 
not change the Small Constitution at all, and, without any 
changes, it will exist until the new constitution is adopted. 
We can imagine that, because rather little time will elapse 
from December, when the constitution will be adopted, to 
March--that is, to the nationwide referendum--I believe that we 
should not really make any experiments with the Small 
Constitution. Now, all of the correct motions... [Kwasniewski 
pauses] Because many motions are correct, I believe that even 
the recently discussed deputies' motion is rational. I think 
that these motions should be discussed during work on the big 
constitution. 
  [Woyciechowski] As you say all this, these are all enormous 
decisions, of historical importance. These decisions were made 
by the president on the one hand and the SLD club on the other. 
What will happen if the club of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] 
does not agree to that? 
  [Kwasniewski] Well, I do not think we should fear that 
because we happen to have identical views on the issue of the 
constitution. The cooperation that we have had so far with the 
PSL club has been absolutely full, and I cannot see any dangers 
here. However, I think it is really important to finish the 
work on the constitution after five years of talking about it. 
The participation of the parliament and the president, as well 
as our invitation of other, extraparliamentary groupings--all 
this creates the indispensable infrastructure to finally do 
this, to present it to the people. The nation should decide 
whether it accepts or rejects this constitution. The point is 
that we are finally discussing specifics; so far, we have been 
wondering how the constitution should be prepared, but we have 
not been discussing the heart of the matter--we have not been 
discussing the constitution. 
  [Woyciechowski] What else did Walesa promise? The 
presidential ministries--the Ministry of National Defense [MON] 
and the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MSW]? 
  [Kwasniewski] That is right. That is.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] These will be deputy ministers 
who... [Woyciechowski pauses] They will be there but they will 
do nothing? 
  [Kwasniewski] I believe that these comments are entirely 
unfounded. If there were to be ministers who dealt with 
nothing, I would have to say that we are not supporters of 
wasting taxpayers' money in such a silly way. We have proposed 
this concept all along. It has now been most fully included in 
the proposals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MSZ]. It lies 
in the following....[Kwasniewski pauses] and I believe that it 
is the direction of changes in the state administration in 
general. We have a group of civil servants who have signed 
contracts, who cannot be removed as the government changes. 
However, there is also a political group--the minister and his 
deputies, who come and go as governments change. In the 
presidential ministries, it would look like this: The 
minister--that is, the number-one person--is a man who is agreed 
upon with the president and his deputies, who deal with various 
issues, but who also participate in preparing the strategy of 
the ministry.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, they know 
everything that is happening.... 
  [Kwasniewski, interrupting] They both know it and exert 
influence on it, and they can.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] They are members of the 
coalition. What will it be like? MON and the MSW. Where will a 
PSL man go, and where will an SLD man go? Has this been 
established? 
  [Kwasniewski] No, it has not. I believe that the 
construction proposed in the MSZ is available to both coalition 
members; this means that such representatives will be appointed 
by both parties, and they will be in all three ministries. 
  [Woyciechowski] The last issue: Rosati. Will Rosati 
certainly not be the finance minister? Will Borowski return? 
  [Kwasniewski] I want to say one thing. I also discussed 
this with the president during a private moment in the meeting. 
It would be very bad if the issue of Professor Rosati ended up 
in an unclear atmosphere that is related to slander. One of the 
questions was: Can decisions be based on slander? Incidentally, 
the president is a man who has often been slandered himself. 
Thus, caution and, first of all, protection of a good name 
should be required here. I believe that, in this sense, it 
should be stated clearly that Prof. Rosati is an honest and 
competent person, whose abilities should be taken advantage of 
in Poland. Of course, one can discuss whether today's political 
configuration allows us to do this. A lot seems to suggest that 
it is not this moment. However, I want to say clearly that Prof. 
Rosati is an outstanding man, and I believe that we will be able 
to take advantage of his talent more than once. Now, as for 
filling the post in the Finance Ministry, the issue is 
definitely becoming increasingly urgent. [passage omitted] 
  [Woyciechowski] If I understand you correctly, after 
Rosati's candidacy, there will be no other candidates. For the 
time being, Borowski, and then we will see. Did I get you right? 
  [Kwasniewski] I believe that very serious talks will be held 
on this issue very soon. This should be dealt with. As the 
recent developments, such as the issue of the popiwek [tax on 
excessive wage increases] have shown, there must be a person 
coordinating the economic issues who would make risky and 
difficult decisions. It is good that the economy is working as 
it is without the finance minister, but, really, we all need 
real decisions, made by someone, to feel better. I often find 
myself in a situation of a man who is supposed to make decisions 
but who does not have the necessary information and knowledge on 
a given issue. 
  [Woyciechowski] The last question: What will the situation 
be like in Poland over the next few months? Will it be peaceful? 
  [Kwasniewski] I believe it will. I believe that we have 
ensured at least several months of peace, concentration on 
economic issues and the constitution. However, we will also have 
elections on 19 June. These will be local elections, so they 
will certainly not whip up great political emotions. 
Nonetheless, they will make our lives more colorful until the 
summer holidays. 
  [Woyciechowski] If there are going to be a few months of 
peace, was yesterday's meeting historical or not? 
  [Kwasniewski] If we manage to end 1994 with the 
constitution, and if we manage to avoid many disputes at a time, 
I believe it was an important meeting. Now, whether this was a 
historic meeting--I am rather cautious about such evaluations. 
I hope it was. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Kwasniewski] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Karol Malcuzynski under the "Points of View" </F>
rubric: "An Unavoidable Conflict"] 
  [Text] It is only a question of time before another 
conflict breaks out between the coalition and the president. 
And that is not because the coalition is left-wing but, rather, 
because it is strong. 
  I do not agree with the atmosphere of relief and the sense 
of 
success associated with the agreement between the coalition and 
the president, and with the alleged overcoming of the crisis. 
The conflict will return, and its impact will be double what it 
has been up to now, creating a danger for the principles of the 
state's functioning. 
  The president gave us another portion of his political ideas 
and intentions, which are quite disturbing. The contents of 
this wave of conflicting ideas and incoherent statements are 
harmful and insulting, given that they were voiced by the head 
of state. 
  What did Lech Walesa offer us? 
  First, that he will adopt a constitution outside of 
parliament (even though this is nonsense), that he will 
personally dissolve parliament, and that he will undertake 
measures that are outside the law. Lech Walesa has made a 
decision that possible amendments to the Small Constitution 
amount to attempts to bring down the political regime, and 
everyone is supposed to hold his breath. Walesa wants to build 
some mystical force that will destroy the current arrangement, 
and he also thinks that people who say he destabilizes the state 
should be brought to justice. In a normal country, such views 
would mean the end of a political career. Public opinion would 
completely destroy such a politician. 
  Well, I am going to take a chance and say this: Lech Walesa, 
not just over the past several weeks but throughout the majority 
of his term of office, has not only been destabilizing the state 
but has also been trying to blow it up. Under the pretext of 
maintaining some abstract kind of balance, he destructs every 
arrangement that is not to his liking, while ignoring the 
disastrous, long-term effects of his policies for Poland. He 
incites and initiates conflicts among parties and different 
groups that have managed to gain even the slightest balance. He 
demoralizes part of society by coming up with unrealistic ideas 
and promises, and he sets in motion some forces that he is not 
capable of controlling later on. 
  All of this is done with just one purpose in mind: to gain 
and maintain for himself the widest possible powers not subject 
to anybody's control (the president makes the impression that 
only he, perhaps with the aid of the Holiest Virgin, is capable 
of ruling the country). It is only a question of time before a 
very major conflict between the coalition and the president will 
take place, and it is not because the coalition is left-wing. 
Even if it were right-wing or centrist, the situation would be 
the same. The reason the conflict will occur is because of the 
strength of the coalition, which not only can implement its 
policies without the president's permission and without his 
ideas but is also a direct threat to Walesa because it may come 
up with its own, strong candidate for the next president, and, 
in this way, it can take away from Walesa what he has been 
taking for granted up to now--that he will rule Poland for 
another five years. 
  The coalition, by making threats to implement changes in the 
Small Constitution, is trying to limit the president's powers 
because, in reality, these powers paralyze the state's 
functioning. It is not an attempt to change the political 
system because the system itself has not been defined. In 
reality, the Small Constitution is a compromise solution--some 
say it is a rotten compromise, which the president imposed on 
the previous weak parliament and weak government in order to 
widen his powers. The Constitution is a provisional document 
that regulates the system until a regular constitution is 
adopted through the usual procedure. The Constitution is not a 
dogma. One can make amendments through lawful procedures in 
such a provisional document. Walesa himself thinks the Small 
Constitution is imperfect, and he wants to amend it, but the 
only direction of changes he wants is to widen his own powers 
and, in effect, to establish a purely presidential system that 
he would like. In that sense, we should be grateful to 
President Walesa for having himself led to a loss of face by a 
system he wants to introduce. 
  I also think President Walesa has been demonstrating some 
very disturbing states of mind. He is convinced about his 
mission and about not making any mistakes. It is not hard to 
believe the latter because sometimes he pronounces completely 
contradictory views or forecasts on a given day, and one of them 
is bound to come true in the end. 
  Walesa sometimes comes through as a mixture of Nikodem Dyzma 
and the gardener from Kosinski's novel Wystarczy Byc 
[Being There]. Many people will be bitter over such a 
statement, and for many reasons. He is such a terrible 
disappointment to all of us. Many of us voted for the man. 
"Historically speaking," Walesa deserved that. But was there 
an alternative? Did the majority of Walesa's voters not think 
that that they were choosing the lesser evil? 
  In his good times, Walesa was famous for his sayings. In one 
of them, he compared people he was getting rid of to horses one 
selects, depending on the task. He would say: "You are a race 
horse and you are good, but right now we need draught horses," 
or "Right now we are crossing the great water, and we are 
looking for horses that can swim well and not those that jump 
over hedges and obstacles." 
  Lech Walesa used to be good and he used to win. But we have 
a different type of race now. The style of executing the 
presidency by Lech Walesa has exhausted itself, and he should 
resign--whether at the end of the term or before is up to him. 
By leaving on his own, he will spare us the view of a fall and 
probably also of humiliation.

  [Text] The National Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Council [KRRiT] has reported that the government, the Belweder 
Palace, and political parties will not have a guaranteed right 
to present their activities in special television programs on 
public television. The council will next week issue a decree 
that says news programs will be the place for presentation of 
politicians' current activities. Television heads will be able 
to grant time slots to the government, the president, or the 
Sejm, but they will not be obliged to do so. 
  [Begin recording] [Correspondent Lukasz Perzyna] In news 
programs, television ought to maintain balance in the 
presentation of the main political forces. Yesterday, the draft 
decree was commented on by the Polish Television Program 
Council. Its members wished the formulations contained therein 
be made more precise, but, in the view of the KRRiT, general 
principles ought to suffice. 
  [Lech Dymarski for KRRiT] It was proposed that this balance 
be substituted by a formulation as to political parties that 
have real significance in political life. But someone 
immediately asked how real significance can be measured. 
Further, can this be limited to the political parties that 
exist in parliament? Well, it cannot be. A party that is in 
parliament will, perhaps, after some election or other, function 
outside of parliament. 
  [Perzyna] Those who make programs will be responsible for 
them; that means the board of television, the editors of 
particular programs, the journalists themselves. Everyone ought 
to be directed by the principles of professional ethics. 
  [Dymarski] The journalist has an obligation to know a lot 
and 
to be responsible. So this decree does not contain any such 
formulation as to what a journalist may not do. 
  [Perzyna] The National Council will next week specify the 
principles in force in radio and television for the campaign 
before the June self-government elections. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by G. Mihajlovski: "Orthodox Messages to the </F>
Americans"] 
  [Text] What was Yuriy Trushin, a representative of the 
Russian Federation in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], doing at the news conference of the 
Democratic Christian Party? If his intention was to impose 
himself on the Macedonian public opinion or send an indirect 
message to the Americans, whose additional troops have just 
landed at Skopje airport, then why did he not do it at the news 
conference of a larger minor party and in the presence of 
politicians more-or-less heard of by the people? Particularly 
because, only a day before, the same Russian diplomat held a 
news conference with yet unclear motives in the Russian offices 
in Skopje. 
  Trushin was diplomatically silent, while his host, the 
president of the party, Vasil Ristevski, was explicit: "The 
arrival of the U.S. soldiers in Macedonia means acceptance of 
the position of a protectorate!" He also said that Trushin 
would speak to the Macedonian authority about including Russian 
soldiers in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops in 
Macedonia. 
  The journalists got no further information at this news 
conference except for the profitable knowledge about Macedonia 
as a protectorate and the Russian soldiers who are going to save 
our Orthodox religion. Trushin did not say much about 
Russian-Macedonian relations, because "there were more questions 
than answers." He does not know when the Russian Embassy will 
be opened in Skopje, because it was a "technical question." 
Trushin also does not know if Macedonia is threatened by Serbia 
"because he has been here for only three months, and accurate 
facts are needed for that." It is true that he told us that it 
was necessary to have a border between us and Yugoslavia as with 
all the other neighbors, because Russia recognized us as a 
sovereign state and it also advised us to make an agreement with 
Serbia, because the border is "still administrative, that is of 
a conditioned character." 
  In order to do it all in the frameworks of the religious 
name 
of the party, there were also discussions about the relations 
between the Russian and the Macedonian Orthodox Church. It was 
all "in the name of spiritual unification of the Orthodox world." 
  The Russian diplomat confused us on Tuesday when he called 
us 
to a news conference where he spoke about Bosnia. Yesterday, he 
confused us because he was the one to determine the agenda of a 
news conference of a Macedonian party. If Mr. Trushin thinks 
that his appearance yesterday is not a kind of interference in 
the internal political life of Macedonia and if he announced 
that "all groups and parties that wish to cooperate with us can 
call us to a news conference," it means that in a few days we 
can see the Russian diplomat [whose embassy had to be opened at 
the beginning of March, as Vitaliy Churkin announced during his 
unexpected visit to Macedonia] at a news conference held by 
Dragisa Miletic from the Democratic Party of the Serbs, or with 
a new communist movement collecting signatures against the 
Americans. Like Vasil Ristevski, they also think that the 
Americans will make a protectorate out of us, and they want the 
Russians on the border with Serbia! 
  Here is another question for consideration: How will the 
Macedonian state react if tomorrow, for instance, the diplomatic 
representative of Albania holds a news conference within the PDP 
[Party for Democratic Prosperity] or the party of Taci [PDP 
faction]?

    [Editorial Report] An article entitled "Does the Private 
Sector Have an Appeal for Albanians?", published on page 6 of 
the Skopje Albanian-language paper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT on 2 
March 1994, reports that 529,827 persons are currently employed 
in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, and that 
170,000 are looking for jobs. An additional 3,800 workers will 
soon be unemployed as a result of the Stabilization Program, the 
article notes. According to data on nationalities from the 
Republic Office of Statistics, 80.6 of the employed are listed 
as Macedonian, 10.4 percent as Albanian, 2.3 percent as Turkish, 
1.6 percent as Gypsy, and 2.3 percent as other nationalities. 
  According to the data mentioned in the article, some 87.6 
percent of the workers are employed in the public sector and 
12.4 percent in the private sector. The public sector employs 
92.4 percent of the Macedonians, 58.6 percent of the Albanians, 
66.8 percent of the Turks, and 62.3 percent of the Vlachs. The 
private sector employs 7.6 percent of the Macedonians, 41.4 
percent of the Albanians, 33.2 percent of the Turks, and 47.4 
percent of the Vlachs. 
  The ratio of Macedonians to Albanians employed in the public 
sector is 85 percent to 7 percent, while it is 49.3 percent to 
34.8 percent in the private sector, the item reports. 
  As for professional education, the paper states, 75.4 
percent 
of the persons employed have at least a middle school education, 
while 24.9 percent have no professional education. The ratio for 
Macedonians is 68.8 percent to 31.2 percent; for Albanians, it 
is 48.1 percent to 51.9 percent; for Turks, it is 44.2 percent 
to 55.8 percent; for Gypsies, it is 29.7 percent to 70.3 
percent. Some 30.7 percent of the Macedonians seeking jobs do 
not have the appropriate training, the article points out. The 
figures are 61.5 percent for Albanians and 97.6 percent for 
Gypsies.

    [Editorial Report] The following items on the employment of 
Albanians in internal security units in The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, were published in recent issues of 
Skopje FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, the most widely circulated 
Albanian-language newspaper in FYROM. 
<H5>  Competition for Police Openings Announced by Ministry </H5>
  In a notice aimed at ethnic Albanians who are FYROM 
citizens, 
the Interior Ministry announced openings for 150 police officers 
(both male and female) in Skopje, Kumanovo, Tetovo, Gostivar, 
Ohrid, Struga, Kercovo, Debar, and Resnje. The applicants must 
be under 25 years of age and physically fit, and must not have 
any criminal record. They also must have completed their 
military service. The notice makes no mention of nationality. 
According to the notice, successful candidates are to be 
assigned to internal security units in the regions mentioned, 
regardless of their place of residence. The competition was 
scheduled to end eight days after the announcement was 
published. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 6 March 94) 
<H5>  PDP Spearheads Drive To Get Albanians Into Police Jobs </H5>
  An appeal by the ethnic Albanian Party for Democratic 
Prosperity, PDP, urges "all candidates interested in employment 
in the Interior Ministry" who have recently filed documents at 
the "Headquarters" branch of the PDP in Skopje to retrieve these 
documents, complete them in accordance with the competition's 
requirements, and present them at the regional units of the 
Interior Ministry -- the police stations. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 
11 March 94) 
<H5>  Albanians Object to Treatment by Kercovo Internal Affairs </H5>
Units 
  At the request of PDP council members, a meeting was held 
with representatives of the Directorate for General Juridical 
Operations and the Sector for Internal Affairs in Kercovo to 
discuss the mistreatment Albanians have encountered when they 
request legal documents, according to an article. The PDP 
representatives demanded the employment of more Albanians in 
these organizations. "Albanians in the northern part of Kercovo 
are not at all satisfied with the service of the Macedonian 
employees in the internal affairs offices of the country. 
Citizens must wait for days to get ordinary documents or 
certificates, while Macedonians are able to get them with just a 
telephone call," the PDP representatives are cited as saying. 
Because of such delays, the representatives asked that the 
offices in Osllome (Oslomej) and Zajas be staffed by Albanians, 
as more than 9O percent of the residents of these areas are of 
Albanian nationality. Even though the new passports are written 
in the Latin alphabet, some letters are replaced by Cyrillic 
letters, causing some ethnic Albanians employed outside the 
country to demand new passports, the article notes. It goes on 
to point out that the representatives of the Directorate General 
and of the Sector for Internal Affairs declared that the 
appropriate ministries would be informed of these controversies, 
but they also asked that citizens not request documents that are 
not needed, pointing out, for example, that new identification 
cards are not required because the existing ones will be valid 
until the law is approved. There was also a discussion of the 
need to train Albanian youths for the police force, the article 
concludes. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 25 February 94) 
<H5>  Struga Interior Ministry Unit Urged To Hire More Albanians </H5>
  A group of PDP council members met with Stefan Perdulloski, 
head of the regional unit of the Interior Ministry in Struga, to 
urge that the procedure for registering the population be 
accelerated and facilitated, another article reports. They also 
called for the proportional employment of Albanians in the 
Interior Ministry unit in Struga, for the acceptance of 
Albanians into the police force in proportion to their 
percentage of the population, and for more Albanian students to 
be admitted to the Interior Ministry secondary school, the 
report notes. In addition, PDP representatives presented a 
demand for the employment of Albanians in offices in places such 
as Veleshte, Ladorisht, Drasllajce, and Struga to Faruk 
Qazimoski, chief of the Officers Service. (FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT, 
6 March 94)

  [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said on Thursday [21 April] that 
the latest statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton concerning 
the Bosnian crisis was an escalation of the war of words at the 
very least and could not help put the peace efforts back on the 
negotiation rails. Speaking on Belgrade Radio, Jovanovic 
described Clinton's statement as "unfortunate and unwelcome in 
the extreme." 
  Clinton on Wednesday announced a new U.S. plan for Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, which envisages for massive NATO air strikes 
against Bosnian Serb positions, command points, supply lines and 
warehouses, and a tightening of international sanctions against 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro). 
  Jovanovic expressed special concern at the emergence of 
outdated thinking about sanctions as profitable in dealing with 
the crisis in former Yugoslavia, although so far they have been 
counterproductive. 
  The U.N. Security Council has clamped comprehensive and 
mandatory sanctions on Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in 
the war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina among the local 
Moslems, Serbs and Croats. 
  "We can only guess at the reasons for the punitive policy 
being pursued blindly and obstinately when it neither benefits 
America nor brings a prospect of ending the Bosnian war and 
establishing peace," Jovanovic said. "We wish to believe that 
this is the last gasp of a policy which has failed, and that the 
latest tough stance towards us will be followed by a more 
rational period in the U.S. policy, which will signal its 
joining the rational forces on which the world can rely in the 
efforts to put the final stop to the Bosnian war," Jovanovic 
said.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav economy 
is making a slow headway after three months of implementation of 
a programme for monetary reconstruction and the country's 
overall economic recovery. A poll conducted by the Belgrade 
Institute for Market Research (IZIT) in 200 industrial firms 
showed that 84.4 percent of the polled firms have made 
perceptibly better results under the new conditions. Since 
January 24, when the Yugoslav Government launched its programme, 
the world's record hyperinflation dropped from a monthly rate of 
313 million percent in january to below zero. 
  The national currency, the dinar, was stabilized and pegged 
to the German mark (one dinar selling one mark). Fifteen 
percent of the polled, primarily firms oriented to imports and 
exports, said the economic reform has not improved their 
business. Revival of their production depends on the lifting or 
easing of the international economic sanctions, which the United 
Nations Security Council imposed against Yugoslavia on May 30, 
1992. Production increase in the period between mid-March and 
mid-April was reported by 58 percent of the polled firms, while 
15 percent said their production decreased. The poll showed 
that the number of industrial firms without sufficient orders 
for normal functioning has dropped from 81 percent in 
mid-February to 44 percent. 
  For the first time after nearly two years, some firms 
increased the use of their production capacities, mostly those 
producing consumer goods (6.7 percent) and equipment (5.9 
percent). This mostly results from an improved supply of raw 
materials and primary products. At the beginning of the year, 
70 percent of industrial firms complained of insufficient stocks 
of raw materials while in April it dropped to 59 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Ivkica Bacic: "Strike Wherever You Can"] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade (From VJESNIK's permanent correspondent) -- 
Electric shock, beating with billy clubs on the palms of the 
hands and the soles of the feet, sexual abuse with a stick, the 
beating of bound arrestees, the striking of all parts of the 
body with metal objects, the binding of arrestees to objects 
which prevent movement, pressure, rubbing the ears, karate blows 
to sensitive parts of the body--these are only some of the cruel 
methods in the excessively rich repertoire of abuse and 
harassment to which Sandzak Muslims have been exposed in Serbian 
prisons from the end of last year to March of this year. 
  The Belgrade Fund for Humanitarian Law the other day 
presented to the public extensive documentation giving testimony 
to systematic torture of Muslims by state agencies of Serbia, 
most of all those in Novi Pazar, Sjenica, and neighboring 
villages, who for months have been the victims of extraordinary 
police violence, who have been imprisoned and arrested without 
any pretext whatsoever, even without warranted suspicion that 
they had broken the law in any way. The fund's representatives, 
led by Natasa Kandic, have visited Sandzak several times and 
talked to Muslims who are the victims of police violence solely 
because of their nationality and religion, whose elementary 
human and civil rights have been threatened to such a degree 
that Natasa Kandic did not hesitate to say in a recent news 
conference that it is a question of large-scale systematic 
violation of their rights that "can be compared only to what 
people have been experiencing in the bloody Bosnian war." 
<H5>  Provinces Swallowed Up </H5>
  Those words of hers, backed up by the statements of the 
harassed Muslims (some of them have even complained to Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic, who then ordered Police Minister 
Zoran Sokolovic to see "internally" what his subordinates are 
doing in Sandzak), certainly have not been made public in any 
government medium (something was written only by BORBA), 
presumably in order not to disturb the ceremonial atmosphere 
that prevails in Serbia because of 28 March, proclaimed 
Statehood Day. It was that day five years ago that "Serbia again 
became a state," as all the media euphorically recalled on 
Monday when they carried the comment for the occasion from the 
state agency TANJUG. It was on that day in 1989 that Serbia 
changed its constitution, that is, swallowed up the two 
provinces (which had been constituent parts of the former 
six-member federation), threatening the former Yugoslav 
republics with that same "constitutional ingestion," all of this 
under Milosevic's well-known slogan "Serbia will be whole or it 
will not exist," which was in fact the beginning of the war, an 
unambiguous announcement of what by the force of arms has been 
represented as "Serbian defense of its own" these past four 
years. In the TANJUG comment, this is referred to as "the tough 
struggle of Serbia, its leadership, and a great majority of the 
people for sovereignty," for "integrity of the state from Horgos 
to Dragas," a struggle without which Serbia "would perhaps now 
be even smaller than Serbia proper, reduced only to the Belgrade 
Pashaluk," TANJUG concluded. 
<H5>  "Expel, Kill..." </H5>
  And that "Serbia wanted nothing but equality with the other 
nationalities and republics," as indicated by the documentation 
of the fund referred to, which proves with numerous examples 
that Serbia is not only not a civil state, as its constitution 
states, but is markedly discriminatory "from Horgos to Dragas," 
to the detriment of all except the Serbs, specifically those 
Serbs who "represent statehood." Many among the Muslims from 
Novi Pazar and Sjenica (just from the end of January to the end 
of February of this year, there were more than 400 of them in 
prison) were arrested in the drive to confiscate arms like the 
one in Prijepolje, during which the alleged arms were sought 
only from the Muslims, a practice, as asserted by the staff 
members of the fund, that encourages the Serbs and Montenegrins 
to continue to arm themselves. There is evidence of this in the 
fact that the government agencies have done nothing concerning 
the datum made public that at least 7,000 members of Seselj's 
party are armed (a statement by Zivota Panic, former top man in 
the Yugoarmy). But on the other hand, even those Muslims not 
found to be possessing arms or those who possessed arms with 
proper permits (most were in this category) were exposed to 
unprecedented torture by Sokolovic's police, who as they beat 
them called them "backward Muslim peasants, Turks, mojahedins," 
for whom "there is no place in Serbia" and who should be "driven 
out or killed," as stated in the extensive report of the 
Belgrade Fund for Humanitarian Law.

<F P=106> [Report by R. Barjaktarevic: "Montenegro Is Not a Serbian </F>
State"] 
  [Text] Pristina -- "It is obvious that I cannot have a 
favorable opinion about any proposal that turns Montenegro into 
a region. This means that the proposal, which comes from 
Belgrade, that would lead to Montenegro losing its statehood is 
unacceptable to us. The authors of such ideas and projects are 
mistaken, since Montenegrin statehood has been forged by the 
nation through burdensome history, and that is why the current 
Montenegrin generation has the moral duty to take a dignified 
patriotic stand toward such tendencies that are aimed at 
obstructing the revival of Montenegrin statehood. I regard as 
frivolous all the theories about a new constitution based on 
regionalization." 
  This is what Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic said 
in an extensive interview for the Pristina ZERI. 
  Asked about the possibility of creating a union of Serbian 
states, which would also include Montenegro, Lekic said: 
  "We are discussing ideas, thoughts. However, they not only 
have not been discussed and verified at the official state 
levels, but they have not even been defined. In any case, in 
connection with our position, that is, the Montenegro's 
position, there are many open questions. As for an association, 
that is links between the Serb Krajina and the republic of 
Srpska, I can see some difficulties in Montenegro participating 
in such a creation. To start with, Montenegro is not a Serbian 
state, but a state of the people who live in it, that is, a 
civil state." 
  The Montenegrin foreign minister said that there were "no 
secret connections between Montenegro and Italy," and he also 
said that relations with Albania were better since "whenever I 
travel abroad, I fly from the Tirana airport." As for Kosovo, 
he said: "The basic thing is to start a serious dialogue, but 
it is hard to say what kinds of solutions will be found. In any 
case, it would be best if the solutions were to reflect the will 
of all the citizens. I support certain rights for Kosovo, 
autonomy, certain subjectivity."

  [Text] Podgorica, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- The latest situation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina indicates that the most critical stage of 
the crisis has not ended and that the war threatens to spread. 
So says a statement sent to TANJUG by Montenegro's Foreign 
Minister Miodrag Lekic. In his opinion, these are the latest 
tragic consequences of the proclamation and recognition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina without securing a consensus of all three 
constituent peoples beforehand, a principle that was explicitly 
defined in the constitution of that republic at that time. 
  Lekic, however, notes that the fundamental causes of the war 
do not exonerate the warring adventurers belonging to the sides 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina from responsibility for the activities 
which not only continue to cause further suffering among the 
innocent population, but also further diminish the possibility 
of finding a peaceful solution. To unquestioningly give in to 
everything that comes from the top brass cannot be in the 
national interest. This particularly refers to those things 
which irresponsibly undermine the efforts aimed at restoring 
peace. True patriotism, he adds, can be seen in those who, in 
addition to promoting national interests, advocate peace and 
respect for the rights of others and an end to the suffering of 
the population. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of 
Kosova, is holding meetings with foreign diplomats. Mehmet 
Haziri: 
  [Haziri] The Kosova Information Center reports that today, 
President Ibrahim Rugova received three countries' CSCE 
representatives -- (Laura Mehatian), charge d'affaires at the 
Italian Embassy; (Goran Jacobson) and (Thorsten Petren), charge 
d'affaires at the Swedish Embassy; as well as (Andreas Vinzel), 
charge d'affaires at the Hungarian Embassy in Belgrade. 
President Rugova informed the CSCE diplomats of recent 
developments and the grave situation in Kosova. Also, in a 
meeting with Mrs. (Ann Brulant), charge d'affaires of the 
Norwegian Embassy in Belgrade, and (Siri Ovre), they talked 
about the present situation in Kosova and recent developments in 
the region. 
  In both of these meetings, President Rugova spoke of the 
continuing aggravation of the situation in Kosova due to the 
constant increase in Serbian repression and violence against the 
Albanian population. The CSCE diplomats and the Norwegians 
stayed in Kosova to complete their fact-finding mission on the 
present trends and efforts of Albanian political parties and 
individuals in attempting to resolve all problems peacefully and 
through dialogue.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Milan </F>
Rusko; place and date not given: "I Do Not Feel I Have To 
Compete With Soldiers"] 
  [Text] The minister of defense of the Slovak 
Republic is not, as he used to be in the past, a professional 
soldier. Pavol Kanis, historian and philosopher, combines in 
the present post his civilian views on the defense of the state 
with the reality of military practice and, together with the 
experts in the department, seeks the way toward the goals that 
stand above all narrow partisan or group interests. We asked 
him for an interview on the subject of the first weeks of his 
work in the present post. 
  [Rusko] Sir, although you have occupied the ministerial post 
for only a month now, you have held talks already with several 
partners who have occupied their posts much longer. How would 
you assess these meetings? 
  [Kanis] That month--i.e., one-sixth of the government before 
the next parliamentary elections--passed very quickly. I have 
tried to fill the empty shelves I "inherited" as quickly as 
possible. The understanding of the important problems and 
integral ideas of their systemic solutions require much more 
time. The things are better in the sphere of foreign-security 
policy. It is possible to build on the long-term orientation 
trend of the Slovak Republic toward the transatlantic and West 
European security structures. Similarly, the efforts at a good 
relationship with the neighboring states and armies continue 
uninterrupted. My meetings with Hungarian Defense Minister Fur 
and Polish Defense Minister Kolodejczyk were carried out in this 
spirit. The talks with these two partners concerned the 
problems of security in Central Europe, cooperation between the 
defense sectors of the Visegrad Four countries, and the 
implementation of individual stages of the Partnership for Peace 
plan. They included very stimulating exchanges of views on 
cooperation in the military sphere and specific possibilities 
for cooperation in special production. I also consider the 
visit to Israel and the meetings with Prime Minister and Defense 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Sim'on Peres a 
success. They proved that there are no fundamental points of 
contention between the Slovak Republic and Israel. The approach 
of Slovak foreign policy to the Israeli-Arab relations is 
balanced and conforms to the criterion of rational detachment 
from the Middle Eastern disputes and conflicts. Concord and 
cooperation between the Slovak and Israeli military experts and 
manufacturers and exporters of special technology could be very 
interesting. 
  [Rusko] You are a civilian. What do you feel when you 
decide on issues that have always been dominated by soldiers? 
  [Kanis] It is true that I am the first civilian defense 
minister in this country. It has its advantages and 
disadvantages. The advantage is, above all, that I do not feel I 
have to compete with professional soldiers and that I can deal 
with the issues much more forcefully, regardless of the rank. 
Our Army is a young army. It needs numerous concepts and 
regulations that are a part of the legal basis for the operation 
of the army in a democratic state. This provides a lot of room 
for a defense minister, a civilian. I focus, above all, on the 
foreign-security dimension of the defense sector and the 
society-wide context of the mission and operation of the Army of 
the Slovak Republic. 
  [Rusko] What is the orientation of the Defense Ministry in 
the sphere of foreign contacts? 
  [Kanis] The Defense Ministry will base its plans in the 
sphere of foreign relations and international cooperation on the 
foreign political line of the Slovak Republic, the Defense 
Doctrine of the Slovak Republic, which is to be submitted for 
approval in the government and the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic, and the Presentation Document, which is a 
specific derivative of the framework Partnership for Peace 
document. The security of the Slovak Republic is a component of 
European and world security. Therefore, in our efforts to 
guarantee our own security, we orient ourselves, above all, 
toward the North Atlantic Alliance, the Western European Union, 
the CSCE, and the United Nations. We consider stable, 
conflict-free, and fair relations with our immediate neighbors, 
with an emphasis on the development of multilateral cooperation, 
an important aspect of our national security. Cooperation in 
the military sphere with the countries of the Visegrad Four 
Group is of particular importance. 
  [Rusko] What specific steps will the Defense Ministry take 
in the implementation of the Partnership for Peace (PFP) plan? 
  [Kanis] The main purpose of the participation of the Slovak 
Republic in the Partnership for Peace plan is in cooperation 
with the NATO-member countries to gradually create the basic 
conditions for obtaining full membership in the North Atlantic 
Alliance. All of the consequential political entities in the 
Slovak Republic in principle agree on this step. Nonetheless, 
we are realists and are aware that the Partnership for Peace 
plan is also a result of considerations for the geopolitical 
interests of the Russian Federation in the Central European 
domain. At this time, after the signing of the framework 
Partnership for Peace plan by the individual states, we have 
reached the stage of the drafting and adoption of the 
Presentation Document, and this will be followed by the 
formation of the individual program of specific cooperation of 
each signatory with the North Atlantic Alliance. According to 
the adopted government policy statement, we will submit the 
Presentation Document to the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic. The individual plan, which expresses our joint will 
and specifies join actions, will be something like a bilateral 
agreement between the Slovak Republic and NATO. The main 
objective of military cooperation within the Partnership for 
Peace plan is the achievement of the degree of compatibility of 
the Army of the Slovak Republic particularly on the tactical and 
operational levels needed for its problem-free international 
cooperation. 
  [Rusko] One can hear about our obligations (PFP) and the 
modernization of the Army. There are certainly some budget 
limitations that must be overcome. Is it at all feasible? 
  [Kanis] We must apply two criteria in the defense sector, 
particularly in the process of building the Army of the Slovak 
Republic--economy and military strategical efficiency. In the 
drafted Presentation Document, we reckon with designating 1 
percent of the 1994 Defense Ministry budget--i.e., 104 million 
Slovak korunas--to cooperation within the PFP. How much longer 
can the needs of defense be reconciled with the limited budget 
possibilities of the Slovak Defense Ministry? Not much longer.

<F P=106> [Unattributed item carried in the "You Ask, We Answer" </F>
column: "When Will We Join the European Union?"] 
  [Text] A reader, J. H. from Povazska Bystrica, would like 
to know why, of the Visegrad Four states, it is Poland and 
Hungary that are making haste with their applications to become 
full-fledged members of the European Union [EU]. The Foreign 
Ministry Press department has issued a statement on this matter 
from which we have selected the following: 
  "On 13 April, Foreign Minister E. Kukan received in 
Bratislava the ambassador of the Polish Republic, J. Korolec, 
who, on behalf of the Polish Government, requested support from 
Slovakia for the Polish Republic's official application to join 
the EU, which Polish Foreign Minister A. Olechowski had 
submitted in Athens on 8 April to the current Greek chairman of 
the EU. Minister E. Kukan welcomed the submission of Poland's 
application to become a full-fledged member of the EU. At the 
same time, he said that Slovakia will also submit its 
application for EU membership following the completion of the 
ratification process for the European Association Agreement in 
all of the parliaments of the EU member countries. Until then, 
all of the necessary measures will be taken in order to achieve 
such standards in political, economic, legislative, and social 
development that, along with the other applicants for EU 
membership from Central Europe and the assistance of the EU and 
its member states, the Republic attains full-fledged membership 
in the EU as quickly as possible." 
  It is also necessary to point out that Poland and Hungary 
have already gone through the ratification "sieve" of approval 
for their association agreements and, therefore, were able to 
submit their applications to become full-fledged EU members.

<F P=106> [Alena Borovickova, Milan Rusko dispatch from Litomysl, </F>
Czech Republic: "Views Presented in Debate; Meeting of Seven 
Presidents Ended on Saturday"] 
  [Excerpts] A debate before television cameras in the 
Reception Hall of the Litomysl chateau on Saturday after 1300 
was the highlight of the two-day meeting of the presidents of 
the Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Poland, Austria, Slovakia, 
and Slovenia. [passage omitted] After the television debate, 
Slovak President Michal Kovac met with Slovak journalists. He 
briefed them on the bilateral talks he had conducted in 
Litomysl. With Vaclav Havel, he spoke about the present state 
and prospects of relations in the cultural and civic spheres and 
about ways of preventing mutual alienation [between Czechs and 
Slovaks]. At the meeting with his Hungarian counterpart, Arpad 
Goncz, the two presidents agreed that the "Slovak card" should 
not be played in the coming election campaign in Hungary, and 
vice versa. Michal Kovac informed the Hungarian president that 
the present government would carry out adjustments to the 
designation of names of communities and surnames but that the 
issue of territorial and administrative arrangement would be 
postponed on the basis of an agreement reached with the 
Hungarian parties [in Slovakia]. While meeting the German 
president, Michal Kovac asked him to mediate a meeting between 
the German chancellor and the Slovak prime minister. With the 
Slovene president, they agreed that Milan Kucan would pay a 
visit to Slovakia in the second half of the year. 
  According to Michal Kovac, the meeting in Litomysl was 
significant because vitally important issues of relations and 
the integration of the Central European region were discussed. 
As he noted, meetings like these can contribute to overcoming 
tension and possible disagreements that occasionally result from 
intergovernmental talks. 
  [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 April on page 
1, 
in the "Single Question" column, carries the following reply by 
President Michal Kovac to Maria Sisulakova's question about his 
meeting with Hungarian President Arpad Goncz in Litomysl: "We 
agreed on further meetings, but, above all, we reaffirmed that 
we must not slacken the efforts to establish a good atmosphere 
at home and in relations between our states. We realized that 
the results of elections in Hungary and, subsequently, Slovakia 
might bring new and, it is hoped, positive aspects in this 
regard, in that they may establish prerequisites for us to also 
address other outstanding issues. We believe, however, that 
many issues could be tackled even now, before the elections in 
Hungary. This concerns problems of a specialist nature that 
have been needlessly politicized. In this regard, however, we 
had to take into consideration the fact that, in the matter of 
Gabcikovo, for example, the Hungarian parliament is bound by its 
previously adopted position. These issues can be partly 
clarified before the elections, but the more serious 
aspect--that is, the overall attitude toward the hydroelectric 
power project--can be changed only after the Hungarian 
elections."]

<F P=106> [Article by Martin Krno: "Rather Vague Indications; The </F>
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia Presidium Decided on the Head 
of the Election Campaign Team"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Saturday [16 April] meeting of the 
National Presidium of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS], held behind closed doors, as has by now become a 
tradition, dealt with the assessment of the political situation 
in Slovakia and the policy statement of Jozef Moravcik's 
coalition government, the movement's strategy for the coming 
elections, and the election of new members of the HZDS Political 
Board. 
  The meeting, which was chaired by HZDS Chairman Vladimir 
Meciar, decided that Viliam Sobona, former minister of health, 
will become head of the election campaign team. So far, the 
Farmers Party of Slovakia [RSS] is the only party to have 
officially expressed its readiness to form a preelection 
coalition with the HZDS. As HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej Kozlik 
told a briefing after the HZDS Presidium meeting, talks on 
closer cooperation with other political entities are under 
way--for example, with the Slovak National Party and the 
Christian Social Union, whose substantial part, however, now 
seem to be inclined toward cooperation with Cernak's National 
Democratic Party. Kozlik characterized the tone of the speech, 
with which the prime minister introduced his policy statement in 
parliament, and the contents of the document itself as 
confrontational. He said that the coalition government's main 
goal was to discredit the preceding cabinet of Vladimir Meciar 
and warned against concessions to Hungarian political parties in 
the spheres of culture, education, and the water regime at 
Gabcikovo. Deputy Katarina Tothova considers the fact that the 
government parties are not doing anything to prepare the 
elections slated for late September or early October to be an 
indication that this election date is jeopardized. On the basis 
of an interview given by Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Simko to 
Radio Free Europe, she also voiced the serious suspicion that 
the "provisional" government is seeking constitutional changes. 
When asked by PRAVDA, however, she was not able to specify those 
changes. Another indication, she said, was the intention to 
lower the present 5-percent threshold for political parties to 
win seats in the National Council, even though no representative 
of coalition parties has officially discussed this issue yet. 
  [Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 April on page 2 
carries a 200-word TA SR report on a meeting of the All-Slovak 
Executive Committee of the Farmers Party of Slovakia, held in 
Zvolen on 17 April. The report notes that members of the 
Executive Council "unanimously approved the formation of a joint 
electoral coalition with the HZDS."]

<F P=106> [Article by Jana Dorotkova: "Meciar's Corrupt Legacy"] </F>
  [Text] In the end, it was President Michal Kovac's damning 
revelations of Vladimir Meciar's blatant abuse of state 
ownership for political gain that pushed Parliament to toss the 
perpetually staggering ex-boxer out on his ear. 
  After the president's March 9 speech, a seemingly shocked 
Parliament agreed--for the first time in more than 12 months of 
loose talk--to hold a no-confidence vote. Two days later, Meciar 
was dethroned from his three-headed job as premier, 
privatization minister and chair of the National Property Fund, 
leaving in his wake an internationally discredited 
decentralization process that has been more of an exercise in 
power than an instrument of reform. 
  Through Valentine's Day of this year, Meciar's government 
had 
managed to privatize just 108 companies (91 through public 
tender, 17 through direct sale) since the June 1992 elections 
swept his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) into power. 
  The ex-factory lawyer's oft-repeated claims to be making the 
privatization process more "transparent" were widely interpreted 
by reform advocates as a more palatable way of saying 
"nonexistent." 
  Then Feb. 15, on the eve of what was expected to be a 
no-confidence vote in the next day's Parliament session, 
Meciar's government suddenly approved a whopping 27 direct sales. 
  As Parliament deputies were tossing in their sleep, deciding 
whether or not they should chuck Meciar's minority government, 
the Privatization Ministry was working around the clock, selling 
off chunks of the state-owned sector. 
  "I always stay here this late," insisted deputy 
Privatization 
Minister Ivan Lexa at 11:30 p.m. Feb. 15. Lexa's secretary and 
the secretary for the ministry's economic director both said 
they never worked that late, but didn't want to be quoted. 
  When the dust cleared Feb. 17, with the opposition once 
again 
failing to unify and set a date for new elections (which would 
have paved the way for a no-confidence vote), the disheartened 
deputies began to question just what had happened on the night 
of Feb. 15-16. But HZDS deputies and the handful of Meciar 
loyalists from the splintered Slovak National Party (SNS) saw 
nothing abnormal in the sudden massive activity. 
  "You blame us because we speeded up privatization at the 
last 
Cabinet session? You've been asking for it, you've been 
criticizing us for slow privatization," said then Environment 
Minister Jozef Zlocha. 
  The opposition was sufficiently alarmed to launch an 
investigation Feb. 18 and ask the Prosecutor General to rule on 
the legality of two of the 27 sales. 
  Ivan Miklos, the pre-HZDS privatization minister, said the 
privatization projects approved during the Feb. 15 fire sale 
fell far short of meeting the basic requirements mandated by 
law, such as approval by the Anti-Monopoly Office. 
  While the ministries that owned the properties (which makes 
them responsible for initiating privatization) in many instances 
recommended public tenders, the government ignored their 
requests and sold off the businesses to pre-selected people, 
Miklos said. 
  Former Economics Minister and ex-SNS Chair L'udovit Cernak, 
who resigned from Meciar's government a year ago, summed up the 
prevailing view on the Parliament floor Feb. 17: "What else but 
a plunder can we call the process going on here these days?" 
  "The fact that the Privatization Ministry worked all night 
from Feb. 15 to Feb. 16 suggests a lot about the way Vladimir 
Meciar's government approves direct sales," said Miklos, once a 
member of the now-defunct Public Against Violence, the broad 
movement that spearheaded the 1989 revolution in Slovakia. 
  During Miklos's last six months in office, the Slovak 
government approved a total of 676 projects (181 direct sales, 
eight public tenders and 407 in coupon privatization). After 
HZDS took over, Meciar vowed to improve on Miklos's record. 
  "The government will push through legislative changes to 
speed the process and dampen the negative side effects...and 
will give preference to competitive principles in order for 
privatization to be more transparent," he promised. 
  But in three times as long, Meciar's government privatized 
less than one-sixth as many companies as its predecessors. 
Coupon privatization, a runaway success in the Czech Republic, 
was dropped because the Slovak government said, it couldn't 
provide the cash infusion necessary to revive Slovakia's 
suffering economy. 
  HZDS Vice Chair L'ubomir Dolgos resigned as privatization 
minister in June 1993, accusing the government of deliberately 
stalling the decentralization process because it was unwilling 
to give up power. In place of Dolgos, Meciar nominated his close 
ally Lexa, but President Kovac refused (he had previously 
rejected Lexa to head the Slovak Information Service, the 
country's intelligence agency). So Meciar himself took the helm 
of both the Privatization Ministry and the National Property 
Fund. 
  "Privatization, warped beyond recognition by Meciar's 
ambition to shape the new market economy, has ground to a halt," 
wrote Chandler Rosenberger, an American journalist who lived in 
post-revolution Bratislava for three years, in the fall 1993 
issue of WORLD POLICY REVIEW. 
  Meciar's "scheme," Rosenberger and a chorus of observers 
say, 
had much more to do with leverage and power than concern for the 
economy. "Deputies from the [SNS] and Meciar's own [HZDS] drove 
an efficient privatization program through a meat grinder of 
special interests," wrote Rosenberger. "Meciar's coalition is a 
clumsy alliance of special interests and privilege. Meciar's 
success depends not on enforcing open competition between 
companies, but rather on managing a vast array of alliances, 
information and threats." 
  Kovac's dramatic allegations March 9 on the Parliament 
floor--all of them hotly denied by Meciar--stated the equation 
in simple terms: Meciar saw privatization as a way to stuff 
HZDS's campaign war chest, and that's why he wanted his good 
buddy Lexa running the Ministry of Privatization. 
  "His reasons were that HZDS had no money even for salaries, 
that early elections would probably happen soon, and that HZDS 
just needed money," Kovac said. "He further said that no one but 
Lexa could provide him with that service." 
  International financial institutions have taken notice. Both 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
and the European Union have recently come out with reports 
slamming Meciar's mishandling of the economy. 
  The premier's penchant for flexing the state's muscle to 
keep 
the media in line has attracted even more international 
headlines. Several critical individuals have been removed from 
state-owned television, radio and print media; privatization of 
the newspaper printing and distribution monopolies were put off 
indefinitely; state subsidies to publications have been openly 
based on editors' political stances. 
  "Over the past year, the government has shown a strong 
propensity to hold on to whatever control it has over the 
media," wrote Jeremy Druker in a July 1993 report for Freedom 
Forum. 
  The Feb. 15-16 deal that raised the most eyebrows was the 
cheap sale of the successful Skloobal Nemsova, a glass bottle 
producer where Meciar worked as company lawyer from 1974 to 
1989, to its current managers. 
  Last year, Skloobal had profits of 22.2 million Sk ($700,000 
US), according to the Slovak economic weekly TREND. Its assets 
were estimated at 726 million Sk ($23 million US), including 66 
million Sk ($2 million US) in the bank, according to government 
documents. 
  Since there was no public tender, a competing privatization 
project that had lined up foreign investors from Italy, France 
and Germany, was left out in the cold. Skloobal management, 
under the name Obalsklo Ltd., purchased 67 percent of the 
company for 120 million Sk ($3.7 million US). 
  Under the purchase agreement, the company management must 
pay 
the government 27 million Sk ($850,000 US) the first year, with 
the rest spread out in installments over the next 10 years. 
Obalsklo was asked to invest 500 million Sk ($15 million US) by 
January 1995, but the agreement was written without any 
provisions for penalizing the company if it doesn't live up to 
its end of the bargain, TREND reported. And the conditions for 
further payments have not yet been set. 
  So, essentially, a bunch of Meciar's old comrades privatized 
a profitable company for less money than the company itself has 
in its bank account. 
  "That is not just a handout of state property, it is the 
liquidation of all the competitors," wrote TREND deputy editor 
in chief Oliver Brunovsky in a commentary. "The privatization 
projects of last week revealed the true privatization policy of 
the HZDS." 
  Privatization has been at or near the center of the manifold 
political dramas that have rocked Slovakia into its current 
status: a 15-month-old country with a troubled reputation, a 
grim economic outlook and a populace that has faith in neither 
its elected officials nor the concept of market reform. 
  Meciar's demand that Lexa be appointed as part of a November 
1993 HZDS-SNS coalition and Kovac's angry refusal launched the 
power struggle between the country's top two officials which the 
president eventually won. 
  The opposition complained for months that the minority 
government spelled instability for the country, but actual 
gridlock did not occur until Feb. 2, when Meciar loyalists 
stormed out of Parliament to protest an opposition bill that 
would have given the legislature oversight of the privatization 
process. (The law passed, but Meciar refused to sign it.) From 
then on, the only real debates Parliament held dealt with the 
questions of early elections, referendums and no-confidence 
votes. 
  Through it all, Meciar has convinced many people that he is 
the only man with enough moral purity to ensure that the 
privatization process--and government as a whole--will be run 
cleanly. The premier has waged public campaigns against 
corruption (accusing, for instance, at least three political 
parties of trying to bribe him), while privately saying that 
political support is best won through state gifts. (In December, 
for instance, Meciar bragged of giving the 600-million-crown 
Neografia publishing house to the nationalist organization 
Matica Slovenska for just one crown. "They won't support anyone 
else but HZDS anywhere," he said. "They gave us this promise.") 
  When campaigning against the "federalists" of Jan 
Carnogursky's pre-HZDS government, Meciar pounded home the 
lasting image of a corrupt government selling off the state 
interests of the Czech Republic. 
  "Those who own companies will decide the fate of Slovakia. 
Will it be the unbribable and honest Meciarist entrepreneurs or 
the corrupt Czechoslovakist Mafia?" asked Jan Smolec, editor in 
chief of the government-owned nationalist daily REPUBLIKA in a 
Feb. 15 open letter to Carnogursky, who chairs the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH). 
  "The only party with anything resembling a sensible economic 
program is [KDH]," Rosenberger argued in his WORLD POLICY REVIEW 
article. "But it labors under the weight of false but effective 
rumors that Carnogursky's family, prominent on the Slovak 
political scene for most of the 20th century, is corrupt." 
  Meciar remains convinced that his ear for what Slovaks want 
to hear will deliver him once again to the promised land. "Those 
of you who are even slightly realistic," he told Parliament 
shortly before getting the ax, "you know we will win those 
elections."

14th Mechanized Division in Presov yesterday. He met with its 
commander, Colonel Jan Cmilansky, and with the Division's corps 
of commanders. During their discussion, he briefed them on the 
current situation in the Slovak Army. The defense minister 
said, among other things, that the number of personnel in our 
Army should be reduced to 46,667 by November 1995, in accordance 
with the Vienna Agreements. "For this reason, procedures have 
to be adopted to ensure that the state's defense capability is 
not weakened. This is also necessary because the Army has 
already been reduced by 32 percent due to its division following 
the breakup of Czechoslovakia." At a meeting with reporters, 
Kanis said, in connection with the Army's professionalization, 
that "preparations are already under way in this regard. 
Professionalization is proceeding in the two mechanized 
battalions in Bratislava, and it will be enough to 
professionalize 390 noncommissioned officer posts in order to 
make a significant positive change."

  [Text] Bratislava--Some 370,493 job seekers, of whom 
98,666 were receiving social security, were registered at labor 
offices in Slovakia at the end of March. According to a report 
from the Ministry of Labor, Social Affairs, and the Family, the 
unemployment level in March fell from 14.76 to 14.54 percent. 
  The highest unemployment level, 26.3 percent, is in the 
Rimavska Sobota District; it is followed by the Spisska Nova Ves 
and Vranov nad Toplou Districts. The lowest unemployment level 
is still being recorded in the Bratislava-City (4.27 percent), 
Trencin, and Kosice-City Districts. 
  The number of vacancies increased in March, but, despite 
this, there are 40 job seekers per vacancy.

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the past two years, the 
number of explained crimes declined sharply. No wonder that only 
2 percent of the people trust the police corps, while it was 80 
percent two years ago. 
  By providing large bribes, many gangs succeeded in getting 
close to politicians, judges, and the police. At present, a case 
of an "entrepreneur" who owes 800 million korunas in taxes from 
oil deals is being closed. 
  Two weeks ago, a group of Slovaks living abroad tried to 
offer an advantageous loan of $7.3 billion. Investigations have 
shown that money laundering was involved. 
  Why has the democratic system brought such a monstrous 
increase in crime? 
  "Before 1989, we were a police state, with 12,000 State 
Security agents plus tens of thousands of police collaborators. 
We will need three generations to really become a democratic 
state," Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. 
  There are 18,000 foreigners living legally in Slovakia, 
mostly former Soviet Union citizens and people from Yugoslavia 
and Vietnam. Some 20,000 to 30,000 foreigners live here 
illegally and are committing crimes. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] This morning's attacks, which started at 0540, 
intensified at about 0800. The entire city is again targeted, 
but the area around the hospital and the hospital itself, half 
of which is almost completely demolished, are exposed to the 
heaviest attacks. It is impossible to provide aid to the 
wounded, what with the constant attacks with tanks and rockets 
and the lack of all kinds of medicine and sanitary material. 
The lives of the wounded and the medical staff are in constant 
danger. 
  The tanks on the right side of the Drina River are only 
several hundred meters from the hospital. At 0845 they moved a 
bit closer to the center of the city, demolishing it house by 
house on their way. At 0910 the chetniks opened heavy small 
arms fire from all their positions on the right bank. However, 
the front lines have not moved and the entire city is still 
under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. 
  The chetniks are attacking fiercely on the left bank. The 
district of (Obarac) is under attack, while tanks have been 
demolishing the 1 May Street from the direction of the city 
stadium. The attacks are also intensifying at the defense line 
toward [word indistinct], where the aggressor has been bringing 
reinforcements. [Word indistinct] missiles have been fired from 
Ustipraca at the eastern sector, and from (?Stubiste) at the 
southern sector.

  [Text] Cajnice, April 21 (TANJUG) - With NATO aircraft 
buzzing overhead, Moslems launched a violent artillery attack 
from Gorazde on Bosnian Serb positions on the right bank of the 
Drina river on Thursday [21 April] afternoon. Three Serb 
soldiers were wounded in the shelling, which has set fire to a 
large tract of forest, two kilometres south of gorazde, the 
local command of the Bosnian Serb Army has said. The Moslems 
were again using schools, hospitals and residential buildings 
for their operations against the Serbs, the Serb Army command 
said. The Moslem media have alleged that the Serbs are 
attacking these locations, and the falsehood has been picked up 
by many world media. 
  Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday unilaterally declared a ceasefire 
and agreed to the deployment of two platoons of U.N. 
peacekeepers in the area, in line with an agreement struck with 
U.N. officials on Tuesday. The Moslems have once again spurned 
the peace offering and are continuing to attack. Moslems are 
continuing to attack Bosnian Serb positions on other fronts in 
Bosnia as well, and are bring in reinforcements to Brcko in the 
north, which they are keeping under constant artillery fire. 
  In the Doboj area, also in the north, the worst Moslem 
attacks have been from small arms, hand grenades and mortars at 
Teslic. Bosnian Serb positions at Teslic, south of Doboj, have 
come under a steady stream of mortar fire, eliciting a response 
in kind, which has effectively put an end to the Moslem 
operations. Moslems were also opening small-arms and sniper 
fire at the Serbs on the Trebava front, east of Doboj, Bosnian 
Serb sources reported.

  [Excerpt] Cajnice, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Muslim military 
and civil leadership from Gorazde has rejected the Serbian 
side's offer whereby all combat activities would be halted and 
the warring parties would be separated by a demarcation line 
running along the Drina, TANJUG reporters have learned from 
Serbian military sources. The Serbian side's proposition was 
rejected late last night. Heavy fire from all weaponry was 
opened on Serbian positions shortly afterward. Fighting resumed 
this morning along the demarcation lines on the left and the 
right banks of the Drina, the Herzegovina Corps [of the Bosnian 
Serb army] reports. It adds that one Serbian fighter was killed 
and several were wounded in last night's clashes. [passage

  [Text] Geneva, April 22 (AFP) -- Herewith is the latest 
radio message received Friday [22 April] morning from two women 
doctors working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
[UNHCR] in the besieged Moslem enclave of Gorazde, in eastern 
Bosnia, and released by the organisation here. "The last two 
days here are a living hell. I'm sure you have all the casualty 
figures and do not need them again. I want instead to give a 
picture of the daily lives of the people here. Both residents 
and refugees are crowded into crumbling buildings waiting for 
the next shell. When it hits, many are killed as there are such 
crowds in each building. It is usually many from the one 
family. The wounded lie for hours in the debris as it is 
suicidal to try and bring them to the hospital. One UNHCR local 
worker said he could hear the cries of the wounded in the 
houses, on his journey to our cellar yesterday. All 3 UNMO (UN 
military observers) cars are now engaged in ambulance service. 
There is no safety of effective treatment in the hospital. 
  ``Shells batter down the walls there and machinegun fire 
rakes the wards. Twenty people were confirmed killed in one of 
the hospital apartment yesterday. The Serb excuse for 
targetting it, is that it is a military institution. I've been 
in all parts of the hospital a hundred times in the last month 
and can assure the outside world that this is a lie. The 
theatres and all sterilizing equipment were destroyed by a shell 
yesterday morning, so no further operations can be carried out. 
Now the hospital has little more to offer the patients who get 
there alive, than sympathy. The dead are hastily buried at 
night by covering them with a thin layer of sand. If it ever 
gets hot here, there would be epidemics of disease. Our 
refugees have increased in numbers to approximately 100 now, 
mostly women and children. As yet, we are lucky in that only 
one child was wounded and is still alive. They pack the stairs 
to our cellar and when the shelling gets particularly heavy, we 
bring them into our living quarters. They are so quiet and 
leave again for the upper floors when things get quieter. It 
was some of these children we asked to send their plea to Geneva 
last night and gave us these messages from their hearts. 
  ``They have little food and we cannot help them as our 
rations would be gone in one hour if we tried. At least we can 
give this little band water when ours is running but God knows 
how long they will last. They all have terrible stories to 
tell, but I cannot speak to them or look them in the face as I 
am too ashamed at how little we can do for them. Only 
occasionaly, as when dressing some of their wounds, do we hear 
these stories. One old lady cried for her relative, an eight- 
month's pregnant lady who was killed together with her three 
children by a direct hit on their apartment on April 19. 
Another man with burned hands was the only survivor of the fire 
that burned the UNMO's worker and three others to death the same 
night. 
  ``Presidents (Bill) Clinton and (Boris) Yeltsin want to hold 
talks about the future of Bosnia next month. There will be 
little left in Gorazde by then, but corpses and rubble". 
  ``With best regards"... xxx and xxx (names retained by 
UNHCR for reason of safety)

  [Text] Paris, April 22 (AFP) -- The UN High Commissioner 
for Refugees (UNHCR) and the French-based humanitarian aid group 
Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) launched a joint "urgent appeal" 
Friday [22 April] for a ceasefire in Gorazde to allow first aid 
and evacuation of the wounded. Medecins sans Frontieres 
(Doctors without Borders) said it asked French President 
Francois Mitterrand Thursday to intervene on the matter and 
Mitterrand expressed his full support for the initiative, a 
spokesman said. 
  "The situation has worsened tragically in Gorazde in the 
last 
few days," the group said in a statement. "Most of the wounded 
are dying from lack of care, the hospital is partially 
destroyed, water and electricity have been cut and food stocks 
have been shelled." Most of the 1,324 people wounded since the 
latest Serb offensive started against the Moslem enclave on 
March 29 are "civilians, women, children and old people," it 
said.

<F P=106> [Report by Mediha Colo] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Begin recording] [Colo] [words indistinct] 
This is best proven by the information that was this afternoon 
forwarded to us by Esad Ohranovic, president of the Executive 
Council of the Gorazde District: 
  [Ohranovic] We have over 100 dead today. Nothing is known 
any longer. We are constantly counting. Nobody knows anything 
here any longer. [passage omitted] Today, we had more than 20 
children killed. Is there anyone to stop this? 
  [Colo] In several localities within the town, whole groups 
of people were killed by the chetnik grenades. One massacre 
also occurred in the direct vicinity of the hospital: 
  [Ohranovic] The hospital is small and a great number of 
patients are lying outside it, whom we cannot admit [word 
indistinct] in the hospital, even though the hospital is not 
safe either. We have been forced to accommodate patients in the 
nearby [words indistinct]. This place, that is to say, 
accommodation, was attacked with various arms, from tanks and 
guns, on several occasions today. First, tank grenades 
destroyed a protective wall around it and then shells started 
flying directly at this dispensary. There were 35 patients in 
the dispensary, and out of these 35 only 7 people were pulled 
out alive. Therefore, regarding all others, we do not know 
anything as everything is in ruins. However, we anticipate that 
28 have been killed. The people from the nearby buildings and 
shelters tried to approach this locality to pull out the 
survivors, however, they could not reach them as they were 
opening fire from antiaircraft machine guns, antiaircraft guns, 
snipers, and tanks, and nobody can get there. There is chaos, 
and only sporadic cries can be heard, which are probably their 
last cries. The entrance from where the people were coming to 
help this site was hit directly by a tank grenade and five 
people were killed there instantaneously. Two nurses were 
immediately killed, too. [passage omitted]

relevant factors about this, including [UN envoy] Mr. Akashi, 
[UN Protection Force] General Rose, Washington, and naturally, 
we have sent a letter to the chairman of the UN Security 
Council, demanding urgent actions to prevent a new catastrophe 
in Gorazde. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- President of the Serb 
Republic Radovan Karadzic today sent an open letter to the 
leaders of Russia, the United States, China, France, and the UK 
saying that an opportunity has now arisen to reach a final 
solution to the crisis in Bosnia. 
  In his letter to Presidents Yeltsin, Clinton, Jiang Zemin, 
Mitterrand, and Prime Minister John Major, a copy of which has 
been forwarded to TANJUG, the president of the Serb Republic 
said that Serbs unilaterally proclaimed a cease-fire, but 
Muslims did not want it. 
  "Both sides, not only one, must support peace and end this 
war," Karadzic said. "In its effort to attain a balance of power 
on the ground, the international community is only prolonging 
the war. At the same time sanctions and threats against Serbs 
are encouraging Muslims to remain on the war path." 
  In his letter to the five statesmen, Karadzic says Western 
countries keep repeating that their approach to the conflict was 
a mistake, even that some mistakes were repeated, some of them 
being even more serious. 
  "The latest American initiative was a fatal mistake, because 
the starting point was a presupposition that the Sarajevo model 
of pacification could be applied to all safe areas. However, 
this is not possible because of geographical and other reasons. 
The American initiative could create a situation of 'neither 
war nor peace'; it would lengthen rathen than end the conflict." 
  "We believe the only way of achieving instant peace would be 
to proclaim the entire territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina a 
safe area, taking into consideration two realities -- one is the 
Muslim- Croat federation and the other is the Serb Republic," 
said Karadzic. 
  The Serb proposal, stressed Karadzic, aims to establish a 
general cessation of hostilities. This means, he adds in the 
letter, an instant cease-fire and the cessation of all military 
actions, followed by the separation of forces and by 
negotiations. 
  "The end of the war is only possible through a political 
agreement," Karadzic said, adding that the agreement could only 
be possible if the fighting stopped. 
  "The general cessation of hostilities is therefore the only 
solution," said Karadzic in his letter to the five statesmen 
whose countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council.

  [Excerpts] Jagodina, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the assembly of the republic of Srpska in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, stated today that he supports the idea of 
holding a U.S.-Russia-EU [European Union] summit on the Bosnian 
crisis. "As far as we are concerned, the summit can be held 
immediately, but I doubt that the Muslims' protectors wish the 
same," Krajisnik told Jagodina radio. The republic of Srpska 
assembly speaker said the new U.S. plan for Bosnia as presented 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton last night, if implemented, would 
mean "a catastrophe not only for this region, but also for the 
whole of Europe." Krajisnik said he hopes the international 
community will display enough wisdom and political 
resourcefulness, and will not allow these threats to 
materialize. [passage omitted] 
  According to Krajisnik, by his statement Clinton has 
announced a total war and a crisis that would certainly spill 
over the borders of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Text] Karadzic's fascists are continuing with their 
attacks on the Bihac region, particularly on Buzim and the 
surrounding area, and the free Bosanska Krupa territory. The 
shelling of residential areas and the defense lines has 
continued throughout the night and this morning, particularly 
from the territory of the Republic of Croatia, that is, from the 
so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina. These areas 
have been attacked from the back, while the local rebels and 
traitors have been shelling them sporadically from their 
strongholds in Golubovici and (?Travnica). During the night 
they fired at the Cazin outskirts, trying to instigate infantry 
clashes. Their main target is still the [word indistinct] 
production facilities. 
  On the Bihac part of the front, in the operative zones of 
the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps and the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO], and on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, the 
chetniks have been behaving in their usual manner, which means 
unselectively shelling the defense lines, firing with 
antiaircraft weapons and small arms, and infiltrating smaller 
sabotage groups that keep trying to penetrate well inside our 
territory. The chetniks have continued to bring in equipment 
from the occupied Croatian territory, deploying it in the hills 
surrounding the Bihac commune. They are also carrying out 
engineering work and digging in.

[word indistinct] has reported that Karadzic's Serbs have 
offered to exchange 11 humanitarian workers from this 
organization, whom they have held prisoner for two weeks, for 11 
Serbian prisoners in Sarajevo. The association received this 
proposal in a letter from Dragan Kalinic, so-called health 
minister of the Bosnian Serbs. Kalinic wrote that among the 11 
imprisoned Serbs are five doctors and two nurses, and added that 
the French humanitarians were caught when they tried to deliver 
non-humanitarian aid to the Muslims. The French Ambassador to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina informed the organization that the 11 
humanitarian volunteers could be tried soon.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kresimir Zubak, official of the Croatian </F>
community of Herceg-Bosna, by Dragan Marijanovic; place and date 
not given: "The Agreement Is an Achievement of the HDZ, Rather 
Than Komsic and the HNV!"] 
  [Text] Kresimir Zubak, chairman of the Presidential 
Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, erstwhile 
employee of a Doboj magistrate, recently appeared on the 
political stage, having risen from an official of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] in his native village of Usora, to a 
presidential candidate for the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
As he himself puts it: "From the mud of Usora I ascended to 
the White House," suggesting that he was a protagonist and 
cosignatory of all the relevant talks and undoubtedly historic 
documents, be it in Mostar, Sarajevo, Vienna, Geneva, and 
finally -- in Washington. 
  This unobtrusive 47-year-old politician has returned with 
his 
aides from Sarajevo, where he took part in a new round of talks 
with the Bosniak-Muslim side regarding the successful 
implementation of the federal constitution, of which he is 
himself a cosignatory. 
  [Zubak] We went to Sarajevo following my telephone 
conversation and agreement with Silajdzic. That meeting was 
necessary because we had to discuss the reconstruction of the 
government, who will put whom forward as candidates for the 
offices of president, vice president, prime minister, and deputy 
prime minister of the federation. The highest officials of 
Herceg-Bosna also accompanied me to Sarajevo: Jadranko Prlic, 
prime minister; Ivan Bender, chairman of the chamber of 
representatives; Mariofil Ljubic, vice-chairman of the Assembly 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina; Mile Akmadzic, minister in the Government 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina; and Zoran Buntic, chairman of our 
Judicial Council. We prepared a series of questions for our 
Muslim colleagues that should be answered. 
  The most important thing was to distinguish which 
institutions are, actually, authorized representatives of both 
peoples, which institutions are authorized to sign political 
agreements on the highest level. 
  [Marijanovic] What is your stance in that respect? 
  [Zubak] Clearly, those are the Croatian Democratic Community 
[HDZ] and the Party of Democratic Action [SDA], because the 
Assembly had been constituted on the grounds of the 1990 
election results, and these two parties, each among its own 
people, had won an absolute majority. That fact makes the 
authority of those parties' officials unconditional. I stress 
this because certain individuals and newly founded political 
institutions are pushing themselves as legal and legitimate 
representatives of one or the other people, so people from those 
and such organizations are being put forward as presidential 
candidates. In Sarajevo it was determined that we, the Croats, 
should ensure as great a degree of political unity as possible 
within our national-political corps, and within our deputy's 
club in the parliament. Which is to say, we shall include in 
our talks not only HDZ deputies and political representatives of 
the Croatian people, but also those from other Croatian parties 
represented in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while 
additionally, we shall involve also the Croats who are 
independently politically organized. 
<H5>  HDZ Sets the Rules of the Game </H5>
  [Marijanovic] It seems that Croats have much more problems 
with their political unity in Bosnia-Herzegovina than other 
peoples, particularly Muslims. At the first session of the 
Assembly, that fact could not be denied, and the most novel 
thing is that the Croatian National Council [HNV] is putting 
forward Dr. Ivo Komsic as its presidential candidate. 
  [Zubak] At that session we also held a meeting of all 
Croatian deputies, we failed to constitute a compact club of 
Croatian deputies, but we were quite unified regarding our 
voting for the constitution. Our deputies voted for the 
proposal anticipating me as the president of the federation. 
According to the constitution of the federation, the Croatian 
deputies' club is the only competent body to put forward 
candidates, and no other body. If the HDZ has a majority, in 
that case it is the HDZ that sets the rules of the game. So, 
there is that much about the legality. 
  However, we have nothing, absolutely nothing against the 
HNV. Our orientation is democratic, and any individual or party 
should be allowed to express its political stance, to organize 
itself, and call itself by whatever name it wants. There is 
nothing we can deny the HNV in that respect. What we do deny is 
the right assumed by the HVN to claim that it is the only 
political body of the Croatian people that represents it 
legitimately. And we think that the HVN does not have such an 
authority. The platform on which the Washington agreement is 
based is also the platform of the HDZ, and nobody can lay claim 
to it. We simply shall not allow that. The content of the 
frequently ignored issue of Livno, when the Croatian people 
decided that it would support the independent and sovereign 
Republlic of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a complex state, is basically 
founded on the political platform of the HDZ, and the results of 
such an attitude cannot be denied now by individuals who held 
quite opposite political views at the time and long afterwards. 
If that is so, then we rightfully deny the right of the HNV to 
politically influence the Croatian people in such a way, to 
choose and appoint its own people to government posts. It is 
not fair, and according to the new constitution the HVN is not 
competent to propose its own candidates at all. 
  [Marijanovic] Did you definitely confirm the aforementioned 
legitimacy at the latest meeting with Muslims? 
  [Zubak] That was one of the issues. We were present there 
as the delegation of Herceg-Bosna, involving its most 
responsible officials, and according to the HDZ Statute, all 
those who perform highly official duties are at the same time 
members of the party's council. The Bosniaks also had a highly 
competent delegation, headed by [Prime Minister] Silajdzic, who 
is, at the same time, the vice-chairman of the SDA. Also, all 
of his aides who took part in the talks with us, his ministers, 
are for the most part engaged in the leadership of the SDA. 
Komsic was also present when we declared, so to say, the verbal 
legitimacy of the two delegations, he also agreed with that, but 
later on, he still opposed it. Now it is clear to me that his 
candidacy was being prepared. 
<H5>  New Times, New People </H5>
  [Marijanovic] The choice of candidates for president and 
prime minister of the federation is eliciting a great interest 
in the public, however, most probably an agreement on that issue 
also failed to come about this time, did it not? 
  [Zubak] We think that the president of the federation must 
be a Croat. We acquainted our partners in the talks with legal 
and political reasons for that. In that case, the Bosniaks 
would designate the vice president and the prime minister, while 
we would have a right to designate the deputy prime minister, 
who would be defense minister at the same time. When I say 
political reasons, I refer to the fact that, for four years 
already now, the president of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been a 
Muslim. On the other hand, in view of the fierce clashes raging 
between Serbs and Bosniaks-Muslims, we think that the Serbs 
might be more willing to accept the association with a Croat at 
the head of the federation. As for legal reasons, we refer to 
the existing constitution, that, in wider terms, may be applied 
to this situation. The constitution stipulates that successive 
presidents cannot be of the same nationality. Since Izetbegovic 
has been the president so far, then everything is clear.... We 
do not want, by any means, to complicate the implementation of 
the constitution, we are even ready, if Silajdzic happens to be 
put forward by the Bosniaks as a presidential candidate, to 
accept and discuss that combination as well. Not because we are 
against Izetbegovic, but rather because it is understandable 
that new times, new circumstances suggest new people. 
  [Marijanovic] What did you agree upon regarding the 
government? What will it eventually be like? 
  [Zubak] As for the government, we made an agreement 
regardless of any other documents. It will be reconstructed on 
the basis of the new constitution of the federation, and in that 
case we shall avoid parallel, dual governments. At that stage, 
our opinions slightly collided, because our views did not 
automatically harmonize, so we turned for help to experts. 
Their Minister of Justice Kasim Trnka is also an expert on the 
constitutional law, so we agreed that he works out an expert 
opinion in the form of a legal document. Because, we also 
proposed that the government could involve nine departments, 
while the existing government in Sarajevo involves more than 20 
members at the moment. I think we shall reach an agreement on 
that issue next week as well, and when we finish that, then we 
shall discuss which ministerial office is to be performed by a 
member of which people. One has to keep in mind that the 
government will have to involve representatives of other ethnic 
groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well. 
  [Marijanovic] Did you discuss military issues as well? 
  [Zubak] We have not yet completely tackled that question. I 
have already said that in the new government the deputy prime 
minister will also be the defense minister. We assessed that 
the current heads and commanders of both armies have been quite 
successful in their cooperation, so it is also they who should 
state their views and opinions on the situation. True, we also 
discussed the special purpose production in war conditions, and 
some other things. Regarding those issues, we have not yet 
reached the phase when conclusions are to be made. 
<H5>  So Far, So Good </H5>
  [Marijanovic] Is there a little truth in some unofficial 
information according to which General Ante Roso of the HVO is a 
candidate for the commander in chief of the federal army? 
  [Zubak] There will be no federal army. At least at this 
transitory stage. There will be a joint army composed of the 
two existing army structures. A joint staff will be 
established, but we have not yet discussed who could possibly be 
its commander. Like all other things, that will depend on a 
solution of the issue of defense minister. You see, everything, 
the entire national chain, is bound up with who will be elected 
president of the federation. Which means, if the defense 
minister happens to be Croat, then the commander-in-chief of 
that joint staff cannot be Croat. But the chief of the staff 
can be Croat. In any case, we have proposed General Roso for 
all the highest military functions in the federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Marijanovic] What will happen with the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in view of these changes? 
  [Zubak] It will function as usual until the next elections, 
just as Herceg-Bosna will, in political terms. New elections 
should resolve that issue, they are expected to take place in 
six months, but I personally doubt that the deadline will be 
met, in view of everything that is happening in the field. 
  [Marijanovic] What are the most concrete results of the 
latest talks? 
  [Zubak] There are many. The best results have been achieved 
in terms of guarantees given that all kinds of communication 
through the territories controlled by the HVO and the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be made possible. In addition, we shall 
establish customs and monetary systems quite soon, the media war 
is already abating, the refugees and displaced persons will 
return to their homes, prisoners on both sides are already being 
released. A lot of such things have been agreed upon, and 
results can already be seen in the field. Some things are 
developing unbelievably smoothly. Principles had already been 
established at the ministers' meeting in Mostar, before the 
Sarajevo meeting. So far, so good, but now it is impossible to 
enumerate all the fields that we discussed. 
  [Marijanovic] What currency will be used in the federation? 
  [Zubak] For the time being, the valid currencies in 
Herceg-Bosna are the Croatian dinar and German mark. The 
government of Bosnia-Herzegovina has accepted the German mark as 
their currency. 
  [Marijanovic] There is frequent speculation about the 
possibility that, if the kuna becomes the official currency in 
Croatia, and if the possible confederation between the Republic 
of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina comes about, then the kuna may 
also become the official currency in the federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Zubak] Financial affairs will be the most sensitive issue. 
As for the official currency, that will depend on agreement 
between the federation and the Republic of Croatia. Everything 
is regulated and foreseen by the confederal agreement. Among 
other things, it also foresees a common monetary policy, and 
many other common things. We, Croats, would like the kuna to 
become the official currency in the federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as well. 
  [Marijanovic] When will the constituent Assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina resume its work, and who will chair its 
meetings in the future? 
  [Zubak] The Assembly will meet again on 28 April, and by 
then we shall have settled all the questions we have discussed 
so far. In the first place, those connected with the election of 
president and prime minister. That will not be so difficult a 
job if political harmony functions. At that meeting we expect a 
formal confirmation of everything that we have politically 
agreed upon so far. 
<H5>  Tudjman's Historic Visit </H5>
  [Marijanovic] Pressures that were put on the Croatian 
representatives, and also some publicly stated insults, 
particularly on the part of the representatives of the Bosnian 
political opposition, have left a rather bad taste in the 
Croatian public. Do you expect such things to happen further? 
[Zubak] Well, some unpleasent things happened, that is true. 
I guess it is the war that caused them to happen. We have 
settled all that. Actually, it is only the bad examples that 
the public has been familar with. There are Bosnian 
representatives who were very happy to see us in Sarajevo, even 
though we carried the flag of Herceg-Bosna. Safet Isovic, the 
famous singer and SDA deputy, publicly acknowledged that. 
  [Marijanovic] By your activities, you and your aides are 
expected to ensure the equal status for, as people put it, both 
the Croatian lieutenants and the Croatian dead [as published]. 
Are you aware of that? 
  [Zubak] All those who will perform duties in the 
federation's administration on behalf of the Croatian people, 
must ensure the equality of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, of 
course, in compliance with law. Particularly in the field, in 
practice. We shall struggle for that with every breath. We 
shall struggle for the prosperity of the federation, and our 
people in it. The struggle of our living and dead in this war 
is and will remain morally, and in any other way justly valued. 
  [Marijanovic] The historic visit by President Tudjman to the 
federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina is to take place quite soon. 
How do you feel about that visit, and how do you assess its 
eventual effect on and significance for the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Zubak] A general assessment is that the upcoming visit by 
President Tudjman to Sarajevo, and perhaps to some other regions 
of the federation, will be yet another step by which the 
determination of the Republic of Croatia and the Croatian people 
to implement what was signed in Washington, is shown. By that 
visit Tudjman confirms that in a symbolic way. The readiness of 
the Republic of Croatia, the greatest symbol of which is 
President Tudjman, to earnestly and thoroughly implement 
everything that was agreed upon in Washington, is very important 
for the future of the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
What will that mean for the suffering Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, will be seen in the way in which they will 
welcome President Tudjman. The Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
have never concealed their national feelings. That will be an 
extraordinary occasion for them to show their feelings again.

  [Text] Knin, 21 Apr (TANJUG) -- At a session in Knin this 
afternoon, deputies of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] 
assembly elected a government of national unity proposed by 
Borislav Mikelic. Fifty deputies voted in favor of the 
government, 14 were against, and nine abstained. The election of 
the government was preceded by a brief discussion during which 
the deputies gave overall support to the program and composition 
of the government. 
  There will be no representatives of the Serbian Radical 
Party 
in Mikelic's cabinet, but Mikelic himself said that a 
reconstruction of the government could be expected very soon 
because of the construction of new ministries. Mikelic added 
that the first government session will be held tomorrow to put 
the new program into action. 
  RSK President Martic told TANJUG that the election of the 
new 
government greatly contributes to the stabilization of internal 
affairs in Krajina.

<F P=106> [Statements by Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F>
Serbian Krajina, and Borislav Mikelic, prime minister of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina, in Knin on 21 April -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Martic] I am (?firmly) convinced that the 
government will be capable of rising to the task before it. It 
is composed of all parties -- only the Radicals did not join 
owing to some reason of theirs, but I do not wish to elaborate 
-- however, regardless of the parties in question, and judging 
by the individuals, I believe that the government is quite a 
good one and that the people and the parliament will very soon 
be able to assess the work of this government. Personally, I 
think that it [the government] will be a good one. 
  [Mikelic] I think that we are now a entering a phase in the 
peace process that has been signed, and that means that we need 
to make this connection selectively, from people who are going 
from their positions toward production [sentence as heard]. On 
the other hand, we must see which companies we will tackle 
first, in individual municipalities where they have a 
perspective; at the same time we need to stop certain declines, 
particularly in areas where state-owned property suffered 
significant damage [sentence as heard]. I am extremely glad 
that this program was given general support today. I am also 
glad that the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS], and its president, 
Milan Babic, have managed to rise above the parliamentary 
coalition that used to exist in the assembly, and that he 
[Babic] has now truly placed the national interest of the 
Serbian people at the forefront. I am glad that he came alone 
to this post of foreign minister. The remaining ministers will 
surely be capable of shouldering the burden I mentioned earlier 
in my address.

  [Text] Zagreb, Apr 21 (TANJUG) -- Josip Manolic, president 
of the Croatian parliament upper house, has accused President 
Franjo Tudjman of a plan to merge with Croatia the southern part 
of the ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  This plan was the core of Tudjman's policy over the last two 
years, said Manolic, who has become leader of a new party -- the 
Croatian Independent Democrats (HND), a breakaway faction of 
Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). 
  Manolic, in an interview to the Zagreb GLOBUS weekly, 
accused 
Tudjman of having succumbed, in his expansionist policy, to the 
strong influence by Croat mps from southern Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Manolic said "a division of Bosnia may lead to one of 
Croatia," but "history would never forgive" Tudjman any such 
"strategic mistake." 
  Manolic laid all blame on Tudjman for a one-year 
Croat-Moslem 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina which ended under U.S. pressure last 
month when the warring sides agreed on a Croat-Moslem federation 
to be set up in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The new party, HND, would strengthen the opposition in 
breaking Tudjmans power monopoly as the "biggest obstacle" in 
the way of what he called the "functioning of democratic 
institutions" in Croatia. 
  Tudjman was responsible for the split in his party (HDZ), 
from which the HND originated, said Manolic, the ex-chief of the 
secret police, because, "with the HDZ as it is now, it is quite 
impossible" for Croatia to become "a genuinely democratic 
state."

<F P=106> [Interview with presidential adviser Ivic Pasalic by Tihomir </F>
Dujmovic; place and date not given: "Manolic Convicted Himself"] 
  [Text] The time has come for those who have adhered 
to firm communist positions, as well as those who have adhered 
to extreme right-wing positions, to give way to those who will 
build Croatia and the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] on 
centrist positions. Accordingly, one can speak of a certain 
decommunization of Croatia in both the state administration and 
the ruling structure. 
  Josip Manolic's departure from all duties in the ruling 
Croatian political party is certainly one of the biggest 
personnel changes in the Croatian state since its emergence. 
That is why we asked Ivic Pasalic, the republic president's 
adviser on domestic policy and a member of the HDZ Presidency, 
and the party's new "personnel officer," as some better informed 
journalists claim, for a more detailed interpretation of 
Manolic's departure. 
  [Dujmovic] Why did Josip Manolic have to leave? Are the 
newspaper analyses correct which are emphasizing three possible 
reasons for Manolic's departure these days: the open conflict 
with Gojko Susak, the revival of the old divisions between the 
winners and losers from 1945--which was mentioned in one of 
Manolic's controversial interviews--or a real and open conflict 
with the republic president? 
  [Pasalic] Josip Manolic did not have to leave. Everything 
that has happened is his choice, and the motives are primarily 
known to him personally. The decision on removing Mr. Manolic 
from his party duties clearly cites the reasons, namely 
disagreement with the HDZ's policy. In the last few months, on 
several occasions he has publicly, as a party official, 
expressed positions contrary to the established party policy and 
to the decisions of central party policy. Since Mr. Manolic even 
said very clearly at the last meeting of the HDZ Presidency that 
he was not retreating from his political positions, and he did 
not accept a compromise offer from President Tudjman (that he 
would remain an HDZ deputy in the Chamber of Parishes, but not 
its president), the decision that was adopted by the party 
leadership is completely logical and based on the HDZ Statute. I 
am mentioning this because this does not have anything to do 
with any sort of personal conflicts, or conflicts between the 
"left" and "right," but rather an attempt to impose a parallel 
policy contrary to the one conducted by the president and the 
HDZ Presidency. 
  [Dujmovic] What is the difference between the political 
positions of Mr. Manolic and the HDZ Presidency? Manolic is 
stubbornly emphasizing that he advocates a law-governed state, 
an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina.... 
  [Pasalic] Those are mere political phrases. Every policy 
occurs in a specific time and area, and is governed by domestic 
and international circumstances. When someone says now that he 
advocated an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the following 
question arises: Who did not advocate an integral 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? The HDZ's fundamental goal, very clearly 
expressed in the first multiparty elections, was the 
establishment of an independent and sovereign Croatian state. At 
the same time, our policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina was 
conducted by ensuring the strategic interests of the Croatian 
state, and by ensuring for the Croatian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina the rights of an equal constituent people 
within the internal order of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a complex 
state, without calling into question Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
territorial integrity. The situation, however, was such that it 
was questionable how that policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina could 
be carried out, especially since the solution to that problem 
did not depend and still does not depend solely on Croatian 
political positions and interests. Therefore, there simply had 
to be a back-up possibility in circumstances in which the 
Muslims wanted to create their own state, in which the Serbs did 
so, and in the event that the international community adopted 
different solutions. Croatia was simply in a situation in which 
it also had to be prepared for that possibility. In spite of all 
that, in all the international plans that were offered Croatia 
did not aim for a single moment at the partition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We accepted Cutilheiro's plan, the 
Vance-Owen plan, and the plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union 
of republics, but we did not want to accept in any way the 
establishment of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a civil (Muslim) state. 
Consequently, when Mr. Manolic wants to show today that the 
policy of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is "his" policy, 
contrary to any other policy, then it is obviously just throwing 
dust in people's eyes. 
  [Dujmovic] When it is said that Manolic was in conflict with 
the established state policy, what, specifically, does that mean? 
  [Pasalic] Consequently, if we are talking about 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, then the conflict is evident in the fact 
that Mr. Manolic, in all his statements in the last few months, 
has said that Croatian policy turned around after Washington, 
and "that that policy first had to run up against a wall" and 
only then could be changed. You see, that is quite incorrect; it 
is petty politics, and in the end, it is directly contrary to 
the policy that we really did conduct toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
We conducted a principled but realistic policy in the given 
framework. Consequently, that assessment of Manolic's is simply 
not true. Furthermore, at the Presidency meeting, Josip Manolic 
took Mr. Susak solely as a symbol of that mistaken policy in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Consequently, if Mr. Susak is only a symbol 
of a mistaken policy, that means that the president of the 
Republic is conducting a mistaken policy! Accordingly, he spoke 
out directly against the policy that President Tudjman is 
conducting! All of the statements made by Manolic in support of 
this were incorrect, and this was simply a case of manipulating 
the facts. Next, Mr. Manolic was also stating that he advocated 
a law-governed state. Putting the matter that way indicates that 
the Croatian state leadership presumably does not advocate a 
law-governed state, and that the Croatian authorities are 
opposing it!? In one interview, Manolic said that the 
perpetrators of crimes are not prosecuted in Croatia, and that 
the state has a tolerant attitude toward violence, smuggling, 
drugs, and planting explosives, which is untrue, which can be 
verified, after all, by comparing the data of the Interior 
Ministry, the State Attorney's Office, and the courts. 
  Furthermore, Mr. Manolic was the prime minister, he was 
chief 
of the Office for Protection of the Constitutional Order, from 
the beginning of the party's establishment he was the vice 
president of the HDZ, and if we are talking about a law-governed 
state, it is precisely Mr. Manolic who was in the most sensitive 
positions, where a law-governed state had to be realized. 
Accordingly, even if what Mr. Manolic is saying is true, then 
that also indicates his own irresponsibility, since for three 
years he was in jobs that regulated those issues. In one 
interview, I think directly before leaving the position of head 
of the Office for Protection of the Constitutional Order, he 
stated that he was not satisfied with the military and civilian 
police! But that was his job then! The third thing that Mr. 
Manolic is talking about is his disagreement with how the party 
was being led. You see, the HDZ's supreme party body is the 
party congress. At the last congress the HDZ's statute and 
program were adopted, and arguments and different political 
solutions and different personnel solutions could be confronted 
and clarified at that congress. At that congress President 
Tudjman openly invited Mr. Manolic, as the alleged head of the 
so-called left wing in the party, and Mr. Seks, as the alleged 
head of the so-called right wing in the party, to campaign 
openly as candidates opposing President Tudjman, if they did not 
agree with the declared policy. Accordingly, if Mr. Manolic 
thought that that policy was not the policy that was backed by 
the membership at large, then he could have verified that by 
presenting himself as a rival candidate. He did not, however. 
The congress occurred partly because an atmosphere of dissension 
had started to be created within the party, and when a program 
is adopted at the congress, then the only thing left is to carry 
it out, or else to leave the party. 
  [Dujmovic] Manolic is mostly criticizing the conduct of the 
policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Talking about the Washington 
agreement, he is expressing fear that people will start to 
obstruct it. After all, the opposition is also emphasizing that 
the same people cannot support a Bosnia-Herzegovina union and a 
cantonal Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that personnel replacements are 
logical. 
  [Pasalic] Those are all political insinuations. The 
Washington agreement was signed by President Tudjman on behalf 
of Croatia, and by Kresimir Zubak on behalf of the leadership of 
the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What are the arguments that 
would indicate anyone's opposing implementation of that 
agreement? Accordingly, this assessment of his once again 
suffers from a lack of arguments, but unfortunately, in some 
political circles it will be interpreted as a statement by 
someone who was at the very top of the Croatian government. Even 
though that assessment is completely wrong, it can inflict both 
damage and problems on Croatian interests. With respect to 
Herceg-Bosna, for the most part the same people there have been 
conducting policy since 1990, and as the political situation 
changed, because both the Serbs, the Muslims, and the 
international community changed their positions, they also had 
to adapt to that. The whole problem is that he is stubbornly 
insinuating that there has now been some sort of reversal in 
policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, and from that fundamental 
distorted viewpoint he is deriving conclusions that necessarily 
have to be wrong. 
  [Dujmovic] Is is true that at the HDZ Presidency meeting the 
departure of Mesic, Greguric, and Valentic was mentioned? 
  [Pasalic] That is completely untrue; there was not a word 
about it. Of course, all the Presidency members, in their 
statements, supported the established party policy and appealed 
to Mr. Manolic to take a reasonable step. 
  [Dujmovic] How do you view the assessment that this is the 
beginning of a schism in the HDZ? 
  [Pasalic] Those are the wishes of certain people who want to 
strengthen their own political position in that way, but 
unfortunately for them, and fortunately for the HDZ and Croatia, 
none of the preconditions for that to happen exist. It is worth 
noting, however, that different political and interest groups 
have attempted and are attempting to bring about a schism within 
the HDZ. Their goal is to bring about a split within the 
parliamentary majority in order to achieve a different balance 
of power and a different parliamentary majority in the Assembly. 
Then they would probably either aim at early elections or at 
changing the constitutional position of the president of the 
Republic. Certain opposition parties have held this political 
platform, and even made plans to cause such a situation. The 
immediate occasion for carrying out those plans was supposed to 
be a universal staged uproar, even within the HDZ, over the 
failed policy toward Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those who are more 
intelligent and politically experienced enough gave up those 
ideas, because of the obvious successes of Croatian state 
policy, but some people are obviously on a path of no return and 
are still acting in accordance with the planned scenario. The 
HDZ came out of the second general congress stronger, the 
membership fully accepted the program, and the parliamentary 
majority is completely stable. The proof is the voting in the 
deputies' club in the Chamber of Parishes, where 36 deputies 
were in favor of replacing Mr. Manolic as president of the 
Chamber of Parishes, and only three were opposed. Of those 
three, two deputies clearly stated that they would respect the 
party decision and vote for replacement at the meeting of the 
Chamber of Parishes. Certainly the HDZ majority in the Chamber 
of Deputies is absolutely stable, and thus those estimates that 
about 30 HDZ deputies would go over to certain other political 
options turned out to be completely wrong. Accordingly, there is 
no schism in the HDZ, there is no parliamentary crisis, and 
there will be no early elections. 
  [Dujmovic] That would mean that the newspaper ideas about 
the 
possible counterbalancing departure of Minister Susak are 
unfounded? 
  [Pasalic] The defense minister enjoys the confidence of the 
republic president, and thus I do not see any arguments in favor 
of those ideas. 
  [Dujmovic] I would like to go back to the functioning of a 
law-governed state. The fact is that every day we can follow 
some sort of financial scandal in the press. In spite of what is 
occasionally quite solid proof of financial embezzlement, I have 
not yet heard of anyone being held accountable. If everyone in 
the leadership really is equally supportive of a law-governed 
state, how is that phenomenon possible? 
  [Pasalic] I would like to see any solid proof of 
embezzlement 
that has not been followed by sanctions. Specifically, we have 
insinuations and slanders among our political public before 
those issues come to trial, and even before an investigation is 
conducted. I maintain that the law-governed state is 
functioning, while one has to take into account the conditions 
in which we are living and the situation that we inherited. 
  [Dujmovic] So there is no financial embezzlement in Croatia? 
  [Pasalic] I did not say that. After all, there is no country 
in the world where those things do not happen. 
  [Dujmovic] For several days now, the slightly improbably 
news 
has been spreading in Croatian political circles that there is a 
certain list of internationally objectionable Croatian 
politicians, a list that was compiled at the Vatican. Is there 
any truth to that? 
  [Pasalic] No, I am hearing that for the first time. It is 
well-known what His Holiness the Pope has said on several 
occasions and it is known that he sent a thank-you letter to 
President Tudjman. Possibly someone might draw certain 
conclusions from that, because it says that it is difficult for 
the new democratic states to establish themselves on the ruins 
of atheistic socialism. Perhaps this part sends certain hidden 
messages to some people, and they can draw certain conclusions 
from it, but there are no lists that came from the Vatican with 
the names of objectionable Croatian politicians. But, you see, 
we really have created a state on the ruins of atheistic 
socialism. The idea of the reconciliation of all Croats, 
however, has been woven into the foundations of the creation of 
Croatia, and that must not be forgotten. At the same time, those 
who have adhered to firm communist positions, as well as those 
who have adhered to extreme right-wing positions, have to be 
told that the time has come when those who have not accepted the 
HDZ's centrist policy have to give way to those who will build 
Croatia and the HDZ on centrist positions. Accordingly, one can 
also speak of a certain decommunization of Croatia in both the 
state administration and the government structure. 
  [Dujmovic] It is also said that Manolic's departure is the 
outcome of a conflict between the Drava basin and Herzegovina 
lobbies. 
  [Pasalic] Those are political terms by which people have 
tried to depict the situation within the party for a long time. 
That is said because those whose positions have not been 
accepted choose stories about lobbies in order to obscure the 
essence of the problem. 
  [Dujmovic] Does Ivic Pasalic belong to the Herzegovina 
lobby? 
  [Pasalic] No, Ivic Pasalic does not belong to any lobby. 
  [Dujmovic] How much truth is there in the rumors that Mr. 
Mesic could also leave his position, in view of the similarity 
between his views and Manolic's? 
  [Pasalic] I would not like to be a prophet, but I personally 
think that it will not happen. Specifically, my opinion is that 
there will not be any sort of chain reactions, as people want to 
insinuate now, and instead I think that we will all learn 
certain political lessons from these circumstances. 
  [Dujmovic] Taking into account the way in which negotiations 
are being conducted with representatives of the Serbs in the 
UNPA's [UN Protected Areas], as well as Churkin's idea of a 
"state within a state," doesn't it seem to you that a back-door 
attempt is being made to impose the federalization of the state 
upon Croatia? Specifically, even the U.S. representative is 
talking about the UNPAs as an area with "significant" autonomy. 
  [Pasalic] With respect to the Croatian areas under UN 
protection, there are certainly different desires: from Greater 
Serbia to the confederalization of Croatia. The Croatian 
position is quite clear, however: Any sort of federalization or 
confederalization of Croatia is out of the question. It is the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia, and we will do everything 
possible to return those parts to Croatia's constitutional and 
legal order through political negotiations. 
  [Dujmovic] On several occasions, Mr. Galbraith has 
diplomatically and cautiously mentioned his own impressions that 
the Serbs are particularly bothered that they have been "left 
out of the constitution." In the context of these negotiations 
with the Serbs, is it possible that the Croatian constitution 
may be changed along those lines? 
  [Pasalic] No, that is out of the question, because the Serbs 
cannot be a constituent people in Croatia.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Gazde: "Inaugural Congress of HSLS (Croatian </F>
Social-Liberal Party) for Split-Dalmatia Zupanija: A Year of 
Peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia!"] 
  [Text] The chairman of the Croatian liberals, Drazen 
Budisa, emphasized at the congress that there is certainly no 
Croatian political party that will not wholeheartedly support 
the recently signed document on a Croatian-Bosnian federation; 
1994 is a year of peace for both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, 
because there is real hope that the temporarily occupied 
Croatian territory will be reintegrated into the Republic of 
Croatia [RH]. 
  "There is certainly no Croatian political party that will 
not 
wholeheartedly support the recently signed document on a 
Croatian-Bosnian federation," the chairman of the Croatian 
liberals, Drazen Budisa, said at the inaugural congress of the 
HSLS [Croatian Social-Liberal Party] for Split-Dalmatia Zupanija 
on Saturday, adding that he believes that the HSLS assembly 
scheduled for May will be held under conditions of peace. 
According to Budisa, 1994 is a year of peace for both 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, because there is real hope that 
the temporarily occupied Croatian territory will be reintegrated 
into the Republic of Croatia. 
  Drazen Budisa sees the reality of these hopes in the efforts 
by the great powers to solve the territorial problem of the 
former Yugoslavia through political means; paraphrasing U.S. 
President Clinton concerning "building destroyed bridges, but 
also bridges between people," Budisa noted that there should be 
support for the expressed flexibility of the Croatian political 
leadership which, Budisa reminded, recently adopted in the 
Croatian Assembly a declaration on foreign policy with a 
different approach. Thus, there can also be no talk of 
"continuity in policy," because the viability of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state was questioned. Emphasizing his 
conviction that the Bosnian-Croatian federation will be joined 
by Bosnian Serbs as well, Budisa added that it is necessary to 
wait before building a confederation between the RH and the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, because even without a confederal 
framework, good political, economic, and other relations can be 
developed. In Budisa's opinion, what has happened is not a new 
Yalta in this region; indeed, international players, especially 
the United States and Russia, are trying to stop the war, and he 
noted that it is realistic to expect pressure from Moscow on the 
Bosnian Serbs to join the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  "Responsibility for the fighting between Croats and Muslims 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina is shared by Croatia, because we in the 
HSLS have long said that this senseless and unnecessary fighting 
should be avoided. Thus, in order to introduce the principle of 
responsibility for wrong assessments and policies to Croatian 
political life, I believe that the question of political 
responsibility for this fighting as well must be placed on the 
agenda," Drazen Budisa asserted, suggesting that the liberals 
include the signing of the Geneva document on normalizing 
relations with Serbia as one of the wrong moves. Explaining that 
the HSLS considers that move premature, the leader of the 
Croatian liberals asserted that they are in favor of the best 
possible relations with neighbors, but only after the 
Serbo-Montenegrin federation recognizes Croatia's 
internationally recognized borders. 
  As far as the liberals' organizational structure is 
concerned, Budisa announced that branches of the HSLS will be 
founded in Croat cantons of the future federation as well, 
because during the war such a move, he says, would have 
contributed to the chaos. In Croatia, the liberals are already 
organized by zupanija, and Budisa noted that there will be no 
radical changes in the party. Candidacies will be announced by 
the end of April, and besides his own candidacy for president, 
each member of the HSLS has the right to run for office. 
Complementing his party colleagues "for being in the good 
company of honorable and capable people," Budisa said that 
"attempts to destroy the party from within will not succeed." 
  At the same time, the inaugural congress of the liberals of 
Split-Dalmatia Zupanija did not get a leader of its own. The 
votes of those in attendance were evenly divided between Ante 
Beljan (Trogir) and Niksa Viskovic (Makarska), so that until new 
elections are held the duties of chairman of the HSLS Zupanija 
Committee will be performed by vice chairman Ante Skeljo, who 
received the largest number of votes of support. Also elected as 
vice presidents were Edo Boban, Josko Dujmov, and Roko Vuletic, 
while the secretary is Petar Krolo and the treasurer is Marija 
Stambuk. 
  The gathering of the zupanija's liberals was also greeted by 
Split Mayor Nikola Grabic, who acquainted the attendees with the 
difficulties the city faces in articulating its policy, since 
all that remains of the proclaimed local self-rule is a few 
words on paper. He also emphasized that he expects support from 
the zupanija level because, he said, he hopes that this 
dimension of political support will be a critical factor in the 
upcoming elections. 
  The HSLS zupanija congress was also attended by 
representatives of the HSS [Croatian Peasant Party], the HNS 
[Croatian People's Party], and the SDP [Party of Democratic 
Changes], who also greeted their colleagues, whereby Josko Kovac 
(HSS) noted that there are 53 registered parties in Croatia, but 
only three of them came to greet the liberals. Endorsing 
cooperation with the liberals, with whom an coalition election 
victory was won in Split, Miro Granic (HNS) asserted that this 
success would be repeated on the zupanija level as well. Also 
participating in the HSLS congress were Goran Granic, Damir 
Zoric, Tereza Ganza-Aras, and HSLS Assembly deputies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Antun Vujic, chairman of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Croatia, by Sinisa Kraml in Osijek; date not 
given: "Yugoslav Orthodoxy Can Be No Part of Us"] 
  [Text] If the aspiration for greater social justice 
and broader democracy means that you are a communard, then that 
is what I am, but so is the vast majority of people. On the one 
hand, communards are persistently anathematized, while on the 
other hand factories are being stolen, whereby the former serves 
to ensure that no one objects to the latter. 
  The recently announced unification of the Social Democratic 
Party [Stranka] of Croatia [SDSH or SDH] and the Social 
Democratic Party [Partija] of Croatia [SDPH; formerly SDP, Party 
of Democratic Changes] has been a frequent subject of newspaper 
articles and commentaries in recent days. Regardless of the 
connotations of the more or less well-intentioned articles, it 
is a fact that the unification of the local right, and then of 
the left as well, means that the Croatian political scene is 
experiencing the beginnings of a process of fermentation and 
crystallization of the numerous representatives of the political 
will of the nation into a few basic parties that are 
recognizable in civic democracies. 
  We discussed the unification of the SDH and SDP with Antun 
Vujic, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia, 
during his recent visit to Osijek. 
  [Kraml] What does the unification with Racan's party mean 
for 
the SDH and for you personally? 
  [Vujic] The unification of the SDH and SDP is a constructive 
act which should finally give Croatia a democratic left and a 
democratic right. There is no center. For example, the HDZ 
[Croatian Democratic Community] is not the center, but rather a 
way of organizing power. In addition, the unification has made a 
reality out our expectations, meaning that the former League of 
Communists of Croatia has been social-democratized and the 
preconditions for much broader activity have been created, 
whereby the SDSH contributes an additional, authentic, social 
democratic image, while the SDPH contributes the best features 
that "settled out" from the last multiparty elections. 
  [Kraml] What are the essential and organizational points of 
reference under which the partially united Croatian left will 
act, and who all can become a member of it? 
  [Vujic] Our essential task is to represent labor and 
workers, 
because we are in fact all united on the question of the state. 
  If the aspiration for greater social justice and broader 
democracy means that you are a communard, then that is what I 
am, but so is the vast majority of people. On the one hand, 
communards are persistently anathematized, while on the other 
hand factories are being stolen, whereby the former serves to 
ensure that no one objects to the latter. 
  Our doors are open to everyone, except those who have not 
yet 
cleared up the issue of an independent Croatia and who think 
that social democracy is some other form of ideological 
labeling. To be more precise, there is no room in the unified 
left for Horvat's SDU [Social Democratic Union] and Suvar until 
they fully separate social democracy from Yugoslav orthodoxy and 
old-style communism. 
  [Kraml] What does the recent announcement of a confederation 
with Bosnia-Herzegovina mean for the SDH? 
  [Vujic] The problem is not the confederation, but rather the 
question of why we have not fought for that, together with the 
Muslims, over the past two years. Naturally, part of the blame 
rests with the Muslim side, but also with many people on our 
side. We are now getting a trimmed-back version of what we 
should have gotten together as a whole. 
  Someone is to blame for one of the most tragic political 
mistakes in Croatian history. It is the people to whom 
destroying bridges is more important than moving forward across 
them, together. Everyone should have known that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is older than the idea of its partition. 
  [Kraml] What does a unified Croatian left offer Croatia? 
  [Vujic] It offers the notion that everything will be 
different, i.e., normal. That workers will have workers' rights, 
businessmen businessmen's rights, that science will be 
autonomous, that people will not be evicted from their 
apartments, that farmers will finally get the land that belongs 
to them, not to Hapsburgs and to people who fled Croatia, only 
for their patriotism to awaken at a moment when they thought 
that they could acquire something quickly. The left can also 
resolve all national issues on a higher-quality basis so that 
the Croatian state remains whole and internationally recognized. 
  [Kraml] What human resources is the Croatian left counting 
on 
in the future in executing its program goals? 
  [Vujic] Once the left finally gets going, it will be joined 
by half of the HDZ members and half of the HSP [Croatian Rights 
Party] members, because they too are Croatian workers--in larger 
numbers than all those who are currently regarded as majority 
Croats.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by Viliam </F>
Buchert in Ho Chi Minh City on 19 April: "Minister Zieleniec: 
We Have a Good Chance in Vietnam"] 
  [Text] Ho Chi Minh City--According to Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec, the Czech Republic is well on the way toward 
emulating other countries and orienting itself more toward 
Vietnam. The head of our diplomatic corps does not see this as 
a major problem. For this reason, MLADA FRONTA DNES asked him 
for an interview at the end of his visit to this country. 
  [Buchert] Was it not a political mistake to reduce contacts 
drastically with Vietnam at the beginning of the 1990's and thus 
also affect economic relations? 
  [Zieleniec] There was no political decision. Vietnam was 
simply pushed aside by our interest in other countries, 
especially Western ones. There was a certain easing off, but 
now, on the other hand, there are far greater opportunities 
because this state only reached the stage of more rapid reforms 
in the past two years. 
  [Buchert] So, this was not a mistake by our side? 
  [Zieleniec] It was determined by developments. I repeat, 
there was no political decision, and, therefore, there could not 
have been a mistake. 
  [Buchert] In the wake of their recent visits to Hanoi, for 
example, Philippine President Ramos, Swedish Prime Minister 
Bildt, and Australian Prime Minister Keating all left with 
specific agreements. Why did this not happen in our case? 
  [Zieleniec] You are not looking at the issue correctly. 
Agreements are only an element of overall relations. 
Incidentally, agreements will be signed soon. 
  [Buchert] So, neither the Vietnamese nor the Czech side is 
disappointed by the outcome of the visit? 
  [Zieleniec] On the contrary, the two sides were satisfied. 
In my opinion, it is better to carry an issue through 
thoroughly, right to the end. 
  [Buchert] Officials from the Hanoi government spoke with you 
about the possibility of trading in arms. Were they successful? 
  [Zieleniec] Their military hardware is compatible with ours. 
This issue, however, was a marginal one, and they came up with 
it. Therefore, they did not receive an answer, and our response 
will be a matter for political consideration. 
  [Buchert] The former Federal Government released 400 million 
korunas as compensation for the Vietnamese working in the CSFR 
who had to return home early. The money was supposed to be used 
to aid projects for these people. Apparently, this did not 
happen. Has anyone been monitoring the flow of these finances? 
  [Zieleniec] This was an agreement between governments and 
not between the former federal cabinet and individual 
Vietnamese. We provided the money. According to agreement, 
however, its fate was in the hands of the Hanoi government. 
  [Buchert] According to polls in the Czech Republic, the 
Vietnamese are not exactly popular among our citizens. Does 
this not harm mutual relations? 
  [Zieleniec] If the Czech Republic's citizens could see what 
the Vietnamese are really like, I think they would change their 
views. This will in no way harm relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "There Are Disputes Going On </F>
Regarding Exports of the Tamara System"] 
  [Excerpts] Prague--Despite the various disputes regarding 
the details of the operational results of the Tamara radar that 
are going on, the world is interested in this system that is 
capable of monitoring all types of aircraft. The Defense 
Ministries interested in buying the system include those of 
India, China, Iran, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. 
  Nevertheless, some military officials are skeptical about 
the 
export of this top-ranking product. It is rumored in military 
circles that the United States is interested in the 
nonproliferation of this equipment because, as one of a very few 
systems, it has the capability of detecting the "invisible" U.S. 
Stealth reconnaissance aircraft. If Iraq, for instance, owned 
Tamara, the billions spent on the development of Stealth would 
be wasted. [passage omitted] 
  Tamara is an original Czech discovery that was 35 years in 
the works. It is a system that, as opposed to other radars, 
which emit radio waves and evaluate their reflection, only 
receives radio impulses. Regarding the usage, it neither 
competes with nor replaces radar but, rather, adds to the radar 
information such important data as recognition of the type of 
aircraft or ship, and facilitates the verification of the flight 
or navigation route by an alternative physical method. [passage 
omitted] 
<H5>  Its Predecessor Was Ramona </H5>
  At the end of the 1950's, a new, original method was 
discovered at the research institute of the then Czechoslovak 
Army that facilitated an immediate, unequivocal, and extremely 
precise determination of the location of electrical signal 
transmitters. The method is based on the so-called 
time-hyperbolic [casove hyperbolicky] principle. 
  The discovery did not remain just theory but was very 
rapidly 
applied. Already in the early 1960's, the Czechoslovak Army had 
at its disposal the precise PRP-1 Kopac [digger] radiotechnical 
finder; in the 1970's, the second generation of this technology 
under the name Ramona; and, in the 1980's, the third generation, 
called "Tamara." 
  Tamara is a passive radiotechnical system that provides an 
immediate survey of the activity of ground, water surface, and 
aerial sources of radiotechnical signals to a distance of 100 
km, determines their precise location, and is able to 
concurrently follow the routes and recognize dozens of types of 
aircraft or ships of practically all known categories. 
  Experts claim that, if the Tamara system were used, such 
tragedies as the downing of the KAL-007 airliner by a Soviet 
Su-15 fighter jet over Sakhalin in the night hours in September 
1983, or the downing of the Iranian transport Airbus-300 
aircraft by a U.S. Navy missile (from the Vincennes cruiser) in 
July 1987 over the Strait of Hormuz would not have taken place. 
Both instances were allegedly caused by errors. In the former 
case, the aircraft was confused with the U.S. F-16 
reconnaissance aircraft. One can safely assume that, in either 
case, there was no technical system available with the 
capability to recognize the types of aircraft with the 
determination precision needed. 
  More than 50 Ramona and Tamara systems have been produced in 
Czechoslovakia. The vast majority were exported to the then 
USSR, and one to the former GDR.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Staff Colonel Vaclav Prazak, </F>
commander of the 2d Mechanized Brigade, by Vlastimil Stana; 
place and date not given: "On the Difficult Road Toward 
Perfection"] 
  [Text] The very first unit of the Czech Army, which 
came into being on the basis of the new principles, is the 2d 
Mechanized Brigade. The preceding months were not overly calm 
ones, but nevertheless it was possible to create a military 
formation that is viable. Without exaggerating, the changes had 
an impact not only on the organization itself, but significantly 
on the lives of people. We spoke about it last week with General 
Staff Colonel Vaclav Prazak, who commands the brigade. 
  [Stana] What developments immediately preceded the 
establishment of the brigade? 
  [Prazak] We did not build our organization from scratch. We 
made use of a portion of our experiences and proven methods of 
work dating back to the time of the 2d Mechanized Division. But 
in no case was the introduction of changes a mere paper war 
involving numbers of soldiers and equipment. We attempted to 
create a body that will be far more flexible and viable. I 
believe that we succeeded. Some formations and units 
disappeared, particularly the larger groupings of troops at 
Klatovy and Vimperk. Currently, the brigade is deployed in the 
regions of western and southern Bohemia, specifically within the 
garrisons at Susice, Janovice nad Uhlavou, Strasice, Klatovy, 
and Vimperk. 
  [Stana] It is frequently said that the best people have left 
the Army. Do you hold the same opinion? 
  [Prazak] I would not agree that the best people have left 
our 
units. But I also do not claim that we are not concerned about 
some of those who did leave. There are enough people who, even 
though they have stopped wearing the uniform, are continuing to 
work at jobs set aside for civil servants. A lot of people also 
had to leave on the basis of the results of the extraordinary 
evaluations. But I say again--the overwhelming majority of those 
who are serving in our units today are good professionals who 
were afforded the opportunity to show their capabilities. 
  [Stana] Did senior commanders have the opportunity to decide 
with whom they wished to cooperate, who would be assigned to 
functions, let us say, at staff levels and at company levels? 
  [Prazak] This rule was one of the basic principles governing 
the work of commanders. I can say with a clear conscience that 
the General Staff truly gave us a certain amount of freedom of 
action in that direction and that we attempted to make the best 
use of it. After a long period of the most varied notions and 
verbal assurances, we were given the opportunity at the brigade 
level to work independently. I would like to see us have a 
similar opportunity even with respect to the preparation of 
training, in the everyday command and control of units. 
  [Stana] Does the same rule also apply to you with respect to 
the battalions? 
  [Prazak] Anyone who, as a commander, had experienced the 
previously constant controls and so-called assistance, which, 
however, did not benefit anyone in any manner, cannot act 
otherwise. Yes, people at battalion level enjoy the confidence 
of the brigade command, and our mutual professional 
relationships have an appropriate form. In my opinion, this is 
one of the significant and substantial changes. A number of 
commanders are already saying today that it is far more 
complicated. But it is one of the first and essential steps 
along the difficult road to perfection and professionalism. 
  [Stana] What do you expect of the new organizational 
structure at brigade level? 
  [Prazak] People in all positions, beginning with the brigade 
commander and ending with the soldiers at company level, should 
be closer to each other. This could exert a decisive influence 
not only on mutual relationships, but also on the level of 
training and, last but not least, on one of the most problematic 
areas, which is behavior or, if you like, discipline. An 
improvement in command and control would then follow as a matter 
of fact. While we have already experienced a little of the 
command and control in practice, we have a lot more to learn 
with respect to discipline. 
  [Stana] If the Army lacks anything, it is undoubtedly a 
professional corps of noncommissioned officers, so-called career 
soldiers. The situation is not even favorable with respect to 
platoon commanders. Are you thinking, at brigade level, how to 
change the currently unfavorable situation? 
  [Prazak] We have a long way to go before we reach the ideal 
situation, and, in the immediate future, I do not believe that 
much will change in this direction. We are badly in need of good 
noncommissioned officers, but interest in service as a 
noncommissioned officer is minimal for several reasons. One of 
these is the fact that, even if we have an interested 
individual, we have nothing specific we can offer him. In brief, 
appropriate legislation is lacking. And no one will swallow the 
bait of mere words. For the most part, people ask what is in it 
for them. It is true that we also have a shortage of platoon 
commanders. For the present, we will have to staff these 
positions precisely with the best noncommissioned officers. We 
are also getting ready to visit military schools to offer future 
military professionals the prospects of service in our brigade. 
We would like to have them come to visit our garrisons even 
before they make a decision. 
  [Stana] Naturally, systems changes also call for certain 
financial expenditures. Do you have sufficient resources to 
realize your intentions? 
  [Prazak] We are not bad off. The only thing we are short of 
are resources for construction and housing services. For 
example, there is a shortage of funds to complete the facilities 
at Janovice--the mess hall, the military enterprise kitchen, the 
dispensary.... The other limits are adequate for the brigade. 
  [Stana] What kind of equipment does the brigade have? 
  [Prazak] Our battalions have T-72 tanks, Models 1 and 2 
infantry combat vehicles, and the artillery has D-30 howitzers. 
The combined arms formations are, of course, equipped with 
special equipment.

    [Editorial Report] Bucharest Radio Romania Network in 
Romanian at 0811 GMT on 21 April carries a 76-minute live relay 
from the Mihail Kogalniceanu Hall of the Parliament Palace in 
Bucharest of the official opening of the Crans Montana Forum. 
  The opening session is attended by Catherine Lalumiere, 
acting secretary general of the Council of Europe; Jean Paul 
Carteron, chairman of the Crans Montana Forum Foundation; and 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu. Also attending, the announcer 
notes, are six heads of state, nine prime ministers and deputy 
prime ministers, five speakers and deputy speakers of 
parliaments, 12 foreign ministers, 12 general secretaries of 
international organizations, 20 other ministers, ambassadors, 
members of the diplomatic corps, political personalities, and 
businessmen. The session is also attended by PLO Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. 
  At 0815 GMT the session is opened by Jean Paul Carteron, who 
speaks in French with simultaneous translation into Romanian. 
He thanks the guests for attending this "important forum, whose 
activity is devoted to developing and boosting international 
cooperation," and the Romanian leadership, President Ion 
Iliescu, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, and the chairmen of 
the two chambers of Parliament, for the "extraordinary work they 
have done, without which we would not be able to meet here now." 
After praising Bucharest and Romania as the "beacon of 
Latinity," Carteron greets "Chairman 'Arafat and Foreign 
Minister Peres," who have "used this occasion to continue their 
negotiations to further the peace process." He outlines the 
main issues on the agenda, including the "Black Sea, the 
Balkans, Central Asia, and the North-West and South-West 
relationship in the Mediterranean basin" as well as the "free 
trade exchange and its contribution to overall political 
stability, regional cooperation, the European Union, the 
Partnership for Peace scheme, and preventive diplomacy." 
Referring to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, he says "hope 
has not yet been vanquished, since hope is so necessary now, if 
do not want to fall prey to despair." He invites President 
Iliescu to take the floor. 
  At 0830 GMT Romanian President Ion Iliescu begins his 
address 
in Romanian. He welcomes in particular "Chairman 'Arafat and 
Mr. Shim'on Peres, who have been negotiating since last night. 
The negotiations were resumed this morning, and we hope that 
this is a positive sign." 
  He proceeds to review Romania's history, reiterating the 
country's "long standing European vocation and awareness." In 
this context, the emphasizes the importance of Transylvania as 
"the cradle of the Romanian nation's formation, culture, and 
civilization," adding that, throughout history, "Romania's 
disadvantage has been its geographical placing at the confluence 
of the interests of various empires competing for domination in 
this region." 
  Returning to the present, Iliescu says that Romania is going 
through a "historical stage of profound and complex changes on 
all planes," adding that "the bases were laid for a democratic 
society and the state of law, which are reflected in the 
country's new Constitution." He points to the "difficult 
process of the restructuring of the national economy -- a most 
complex and painful process, with social costs, which is taking 
place against the background of economic crisis." He says that 
the interest of all political forces in Romania in this 
"difficult transition period" is the same, namely to 
"consolidate democratic accomplishments and ensure the 
development of the Romanian economy, on new, efficient, and 
dynamic bases." 
  Referring to the "deepening economic gaps at the world 
level, 
which are hampering the access of all countries to the benefits 
of the contemporary technological progress," he says that this 
is bound to lead to tensions, "including social tensions in the 
developed countries themselves" and to a "further polarization 
of wealth and poverty at the world level, which can provoke a 
new mass migration of hundreds of millions of poor people from 
Africa and Asia toward the rich countries of Europe and North 
America." 
  Iliescu emphasizes that the "fate of Europe, of those from 
the west, center, and east of the continent is the same, 
provided that we achieve an optimal framework of partnership 
among equals, not of subordination of the weak to the powerful." 
He adds that the "political and military barrier that separated 
our continent should not be replaced by an economic one." 
  Referring to the Partnership for Peace, he says that Romania 
is "looking with interest" to this scheme, which is meant "to 
ensure equal security for all states in the region and avoid 
discriminatory approaches, capable of generating new sources of 
tension at a regional level." 
  At 0843 GMT Catherine Lalumiere, acting secretary general 
of the Council of Europe, begins her speech, in French with 
superimposed translation into Romanian, by thanking the Romanian 
authorities for having organized the forum and praising the 
"long distance covered by Romania" in the past four years along 
the road of democracy. "You have even managed to tame this 
enormous palace, the megalomaniac's palace, which is a 
masterpiece of the Romanian people's toil." She then proceeds 
to discuss the "deep changes" currently taking place in Europe 
and their "particularly positive impact" on the rapprochement 
between East and West Europe, designed to achieve the 
"establishment of a common European home, as President Gorbachev 
called it, which should stretch all the way from the Atlantic up 
to Vladivostok." After assessing various trends currently under 
way in Europe, Lalumiere points out a number of "unavoidable" 
problems related to the transition period in East Europe that 
still need to be solved, such as the Western assistance granted 
to those countries, the democratization of their societies, the 
establishment of the rule-of-law state, and the fundamental 
changes in the people's mentality. She also refers in passing to 
other negative aspects, such as the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon" in 
Russia, the hardships faced by Ukraine, various obstacles raised 
to "political and economic reform" in the former communist 
countries, galloping unemployment, low living standards, popular 
discontent, and so forth. On top of all this comes a "crisis of 
values" determined by the loss of the "system of reference, 
which the vanquished Marxist-Leninist ideology represented," and 
the "fascination with the consumption society," which causes a 
run for "easy money." She stresses that the changes are not 
over yet and that there will be "many turning points this part 
of Europe will have to face yet." For instance, "Russia's 
opening to Europe is an accomplished fact, but the question 
remains what will happen in Russia after the latest elections," 
because that country seems to "oscillate between opening to 
Europe and returning to its own self." Catherine Lalumiere 
condemns the rise of nationalism in its extremist forms, noting 
that "almost no country has been spared this trend," which is 
manifest not only in Eastern and Central Europe but also in 
Western countries, such as Italy, Great Britain, Belgium, Spain, 
and France. Lalumiere emphasizes the need for "social justice 
and human rights," criticizing the widening gap between East and 
West, saying that "it would be a catastrophe if the iron curtain 
is replaced by a financial and economic curtain." She then 
proceeds to outline, in general terms, the efforts made in 
recent years by the Council of Europe to help solve these "huge 
problems, compared to which our means are totally insufficient." 
After pleading for the establishment of "coherence" among 
European countries and their international institutions and 
expressing her gratitude to the Romanian people, Lalumiere 
concludes her speech at 0926 GMT. She hands over the medal of 
the Council of Europe to President Ion Iliescu. The live relay 
ends at 0927 GMT.

  [Text] Warsaw, 22 Apr--Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
visited the National Power Distribution Center (KDM) this 
morning. He acquainted himself with the power supply situation 
in the country. The visit was linked to the lignite miners' 
strike, which might lead to cuts in the power supply. 
  "We told the prime minister that we are meeting demands for 
electricity in full but that we have no reserves and have to 
open all hard-coal-fired power stations and heat- and 
power-generating plants," Ireneusz Radzio, KDM deputy manager, 
told a PAP journalist. 
  According to him, if the lignite-fired power stations work 
at 
low capacity, using hard coal as they are today, there should be 
no problems with energy supplies this coming weekend. "If 
nothing changes on Monday, some power cuts might be expected," 
he added.

<F P=106> [Interview with Emil Constantinescu, president of the </F>
Democratic Convention of Romania, by Irinel Radulescu; place and 
date not given: "The Opposition Cannot Trigger Early Elections"] 
  [Text] [Radulescu] Professor, you are the president of a 
political force that achieved good ratings in recent public 
opinion polls and has great chances to gain access to power. 
How would you assess, from that new position, the current 
political, economic, and social situation in our country? 
  [Constantinescu] From the political angle, I believe that a 
simple qualitative and quantitative analysis of the current 
balance of forces could not be conclusive if it is done by 
ignoring the economic and social context. Currently the fact 
that three separate public opinion polls reached the same 
conclusions raises two issues: the CDR [Democratic Convention of 
Romania] is leading, closely followed by the PDSR [Social 
Democracy Party of Romania], and, contrary to all expectations, 
the audience for the extreme left parties has proved to be 
limited. I believe that the growth of the CDR occurred owing to 
mutations within the opinion of the workers while we also 
managed to keep our traditional electorate. That shift was 
caused by the fact that beginning in December 1993 the CDR 
accepted the trade unions' proposal to establish a real social 
pact that should be guaranteed by a coalition government set up 
by the major political forces in the country. The CDR did so 
while the PDSR delayed making a decision merely to opt, after 
four months, for a monochrome government pursuing a harsh policy 
with respect to the trade unions. The second issue concerns the 
number of the PRM [Greater Romania Party] and PSM [Socialist 
Party of Labor] followers and it consists in the fact that the 
aforementioned parties were unable to gain in their ratings 
because they could not use their principal weapons -- 
demagoguery and populism. Those weapons pulverized from the 
outset, in the very moment they decided to support a government 
that is distrusted by 70 percent of the population. Under such 
circumstances I believe that in the future a major role in the 
changes we all wish will be played by the peasantry. 
  [Radulescu] You said that the program you presented last 
week offers solutions and stages that have to be completed over 
the next 18 months. How should one interpret that deadline -- 
is it signalling that you have given up the idea of early 
elections, is it an offer made to the current ruling party, or 
is it neither of them, but rather a third solution found by the 
CDR? 
  [Constantinescu] We pondered all possible variants because 
Romania's current situation is so grave that one cannot afford 
to hesitate or perform experiments. The deadline of 18 months 
was believed to begin the moment a new government begins its 
activity. That government should be an anti-crisis one and if it 
were to be set up by the opposition alone, it might well be a 
sacrifice government with a mandate that is limited in time to 
18 months. But even in such a case agreements should be reached 
with the PDSR and the unions. No serious policy can be 
conducted without dialogue and agreements based on mutual 
respect and trust. 
  [Radulescu] This means that there is no firm CDR option to 
hold early elections... 
  [Constantinescu] The opposition cannot trigger early 
elections. That can be solely achieved by the president of the 
country in cooperation with the parliamentary majority. The 
opposition should be prepared for elections. I would like to 
point out the PDSR's cynical way in which they approach this 
issue, on the one hand, by saying that early elections would be 
a catastrophe for the country, and, on the other, they launch 
the electoral campaign. Probably, they want to trap us by luring 
us into an electoral campaign in which the material means and 
the possibilities are unequally distributed and thus distract 
the attention of public opinion because currently they cannot 
offer them bread so they offer them circus shows. In the short 
run the opposition will continue to protect the interests of the 
citizens, while in the long run it will protect national 
interests. Our priority is not to gain victory, as a political 
force, but rather to halt the decay of the economic and social 
situation. 
  [Radulescu] The CDR, as an alliance, is currently facing a 
number of internal difficulties, such as the recent problems 
with the PAC [Civic Alliance Party], the "convulsions" of the 
liberals within and outside the CDR, and, generally, the 
multitude of ideologies condensed within the alliance. Is this 
formula still viable? 
  [Constantinescu] Over the last one and a half years everyone 
has been predicting the disintegration of the CDR. However, 
that event has not occurred and now it is hard to anticipate 
that any political grouping belonging to the CDR could afford, 
despite lesser fits of vanity, to secede from the alliance. Of 
course, life is not easy inside the CDR, but reality has proved 
two things: We managed to elaborate a program that suits all 
doctrinal and ideological tendencies and we managed to have all 
our documents adopted by consensus. My creed and my role is to 
maintain our unity. 
  [Radulescu] Mr. President, about a month ago the "battle" 
for Transylvania also began. The PDSR and the PD [Democratic 
Party] have conquered very important positions in that area. 
What is the CDR's offer regarding its national policy and its 
policy with respect to its ally, the UDMR [Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania]? 
  [Constantinescu] All that agitation has been generated by 
the weakness of the PUNR [National Romanian Unity Party], by its 
erosion caused by its long cooperation with the current rulers 
and its participation in gambling schemes. As far as the CDR's 
relations with the UDMR are concerned, things have not always 
evolved smoothly, but eventually most of the disputed issues 
could be settled. I believe that the national issue is a very 
serious one, but one should also keep in mind that merely 8 
percent of the population is concerned over the inter-ethnic 
issue, whereas a much larger percentage focuses on economic and 
social issues. As a matter of fact, running on separate lists 
in the last elections, the CDR obtained the most votes in 
Transylvania. 
  [Radulescu] How do you assess the future evolution of the 
CDR's relations with the state power? 
  [Constantinescu] The CDR's intention, which was also 
expressed in the manifest published a fortnight ago, is to 
replace general and theoretical discussions by talks intended to 
spot practical solutions to overcome the crisis situation. 
However, the PDSR is currently blocked by its electoral pledge, 
namely implementing a reform that does not hurt, as well as by 
its nature of being a party of cadres, which makes it be the 
defender of a group of interests made up of the political, 
economic, and administrative bureaucracy, which is not 
interested in reform. This makes it difficult for us to give it 
a blank check in the form of a PDSR government enjoying the 
support of the opposition. Cooperation is still possible, but 
first we have to conclude very precise agreements regarding a 
number of concrete measures to be taken before exact deadlines, 
as solely this could make us selectively support them in 
Parliament. 
  [Radulescu] You are the personality that obtained the best 
ratings among the opposition. However, within the CDR there are 
also strong pro-monarchy tendencies. Is that not a 
contradiction? 
  [Constantinescu] The pro-monarchy options of some of the CDR 
member parties do not contradict the constitution. Abiding by 
the constitution, there is a complicated procedure to change the 
state order, the whole process requiring at least two 
referendums. The whole campaign that was waged against me and 
the CDR was based on allegations that we want to change the 
constitution. However, no one in the CDR has raised that issue. 
The largest part of the percentage of votes obtained by the 
PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] might 
coincide with the one of the pro-monarchy option, but one has to 
respect the freedom of opinion of a certain part of the 
population.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- Yasushi Akashi, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's special envoy for the 
former Yugoslavia, arrived in Belgrade this morning for a 
meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, immediately upon 
his arrival, we have learned unofficially. The meeting of the 
three in Belgrade is attracting a great deal of attention, 
particularly because of the Gorazde drama and the latest NATO 
threats to the Serbs in Bosnia. Only a few days ago Akashi told 
Butrus-Ghali that he would not talk to Slobodan Milosevic and 
Radovan Karadzic unless, as he said, the attacks on Gorazde were 
to cease and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] members were to be 
released. 
  Akashi also made his meeting in Belgrade conditional upon a 
total cease-fire in and around Gorazde. At the moment the only 
thing that is certain is the fact that the Serb Republic has 
declared a unilateral cease-fire, so the question now arises as 
to whether this move was sufficient for Akashi to change his 
mind. [passage omitted]

  [Text] At a meeting with UN Deputy Secretary General 
Marrat Goulding on Thursday [14 April], Slovak Foreign Minister 
Eduard Kukan stressed that Slovakia's integration into Europe 
was the goal of Slovak foreign policy. He provided information 
on bilateral Russian-Slovak relations and underlined the fact 
that the Slovak Republic is interested in good political and 
economic relations with Russia. 
  Kukan also described the current relations between Slovakia 
and Hungary. He said that the level of emotions has stabilized, 
and Hungary has positively accepted Signals coming from 
Slovakia. Goulding was interested in whether Hungary had 
territorial claims. Kukan's reply was negative. Both officials 
agreed that the concept for changing borders in the Balladur 
plan was erroneous. Kukan also said that both countries were 
willing to sign a treaty under the European Union's auspices. 
The Slovak minister appreciated the fact that the Gabcikovo 
issue has been depoliticized, to a certain extent. Kukan also 
discussed the visit of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali 
in Bratislava. 
  Kofi Annan, UN deputy secretary general for peacekeeping 
operations, appreciated, during a meeting with Kukan, the Slovak 
Republic's approval of the UN demand according to which 
Pakistani members of the peacekeeping forces will be trained at 
Slovak Republic facilities. 
  Eduard Kukan and Besley Maycock, Barbados's permanent 
representative at the United Nations, signed a protocol 
yesterday on establishing diplomatic relations. Both officials 
expressed their conviction that the development of mutual 
relations is in the interest of both countries.

  [Text] Knin, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- At a session today of the 
assembly of the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) Prime 
Minister-designate Borislav Mikelic proposed a new Krajina 
government and outlined its program. 
  According to Mikelic's proposal for a multiparty cabinet, 
Milan Babic would become a new foreign minister, Rade Tanjga 
defense minister, and Ilija Prijic interior minister. 
  Milivoj Kricka, minister of energy and mining, and Ljubisa 
Budic, minister of urban planning, construction, and housing, 
who were in Djordje Bjegovic's cabinet, are expected to keep 
their posts in the new government. 
  Boro Rasuo has been proposed for the post of information 
minister and Uros Funduk for the post of justice minister. 
Stevan Djuric and Ratko Veselinovic have been proposed for the 
posts of health and development and industry ministers. 
  Other candidates are Dragutin Polic (culture and religion), 
Milan Padjen (transport and communications), and Stevan Ratkovic 
(education). 
  Milos Vojinovic has been proposed for the post of sport and 
physical education minister, Simo Sijan for the post of 
agriculture minister, and Mile Bosnic for the post of trade 
minister. 
  Mikelic proposed the assembly nominate three deputy prime 
ministers, while several vacated posts leave a possibility of 
including representatives of the Serbian Radical Party in the 
government. 
  Addressing the deputies, Mikelic said that "at a time 
between 
war and peace in which Krajina has found itself, the priority 
tasks are defense and the economic recovery of the country." He 
stressed that the most difficult phase was "behind us," which 
does not mean that there will be no more pressures on the RSK. 
  Speaking about Krajina's foreign policy, he said that a 
political solution for relations with Croatia could be found 
only through negotiations, and that at the end the people of 
Krajina would decide about their future in a referendum. They 
will no doubt decide to live together with other Serb countries, 
i.e., states, Mikelic stressed. 
  In connection with that, he stressed that the reintegration 
of Krajina into Croatia is only wishful thinking on Tudjman's 
part. Mikelic believes that a speedy international recognition 
and the division of assets between the RSK and Croatia mark the 
path toward the end of the state of war. 
  Mikelic spoke in favor of the Serb Army of Krajina becoming 
a 
professional army. When an effective defense system is 
established, many experts will be have more time to help 
relaunch production, which is currently employing only 36,000 
workers. Before the war, 127,000 people worked in industry, 
agriculture, and other branches of economy. This figure best 
illustrates the current state of the economy. Therefore, 
speaking about the economic policy for this year, Mikelic 
specified steps that need to be taken, especially in agriculture. 
  He paid particular attention to the strengthening and the 
building of a law-governed state, the efficiency of the 
administrative and judicial bodies, and the creation of 
conditions for a market economy and entrepreneurship. 
  As regards pensioners, he will urge that one of the 
conditions for the resumption of the process of negotiations 
with Croatia be that Croatia should pay out pensions to those 
people who were contributing to the pension fund of the Republic 
of Croatia; these number 40,000. As the second condition for 
the resumption of the process of negotiations, he demanded the 
abolition of UN Security Council resolution 820. 
  Mikelic also urged the creation of conditions for the return 
of around 350,000 refugees from the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia and abroad. 
  Mikelic's economic program is based on close links with the 
Republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia. In this connection he said 
that the republic of Serb Krajina must harmonize its laws with 
Yugoslavia, so that the process of the overall economic, social, 
and spiritual integration should speed up. 
  The assembly is continuing the session by discussing the 
program and the government appointments.

<F P=106> [Article by Dj. Ognjenovic: "From Slavonia Bank-Djakovo </F>
Branch: Stock Shares From Old Foreign Exchange Savings"] 
  [Text] Djakovo--In accordance with the decision by the 
government of the Republic of Croatia under which stock in 44 
companies is offered from the portfolio of the Croatian Fund for 
Privatization [HFP] to people who have claims against the public 
debt of the Republic of Croatia--i.e., old foreign exchange 
savings--Slavonia Bank-Djakovo Branch has begun collecting bids 
from interested clients. 
  The bank will carry out for depositors all transactions 
associated with this major campaign, which began on 28 February 
and will last 90 days, according to directions from the HFP. 
  The first auction, at which authorized brokers will buy 
stock 
on behalf of buyers, is scheduled for 28 March. 
  Depositors who decide to use old foreign exchange savings to 
become stockholders in one of the proposed companies can get all 
the information they need at the Djakovo Branch, Ulica Hrvatskih 
Velikana 4. They will be provided with an explanation of all 
details connected with the transaction and the relationship with 
the HFP, and if they decide to be represented on the Zagreb 
Stock Exchange by one of the bank's authorized brokers, the 
Djakovo Branch will give them the opportunity to talk with 
brokers in order to get a more complete picture. 
  The Slavonia Bank brokers will not charge a fee to their 
depositors, they will represent them at the public auction, and 
they are contractually bound to protect their interests, to act 
with reasonable care and diligence, and to apply the highest 
standards of the profession. 
  The offered stock can also be acquired by those who do not 
have old foreign exchange savings, i.e., by all legal and 
physical persons who want to buy shares. They too can turn to 
the bank, which in that case will be an intermediary between 
them and the depositors who want to sell their old foreign 
exchange savings. 
  The procedure is very simple. The seller of the old foreign 
exchange savings submits his offer to the bank with an 
indication of the amount that he wishes to sell and the discount 
(concession) that he is offering. The buyer submits his offer of 
the amount of old foreign exchange savings that he wishes to 
buy, with the discount that he is willing to accept. 
  From the offered terms of buying and selling, the bank 
chooses the most favorable for both the buyer and the seller. In 
these deals, the bank again acts as an intermediary offering 
full service. 
  Those who are a little more daring will recognize the 
opportunity of investing their own money and the inception of 
real stock exchange dealing--something that was inaccessible 
until only recently, and in which this time Slavonia Bank, in 
addition to its depositors, is involved.

  [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO--Former Czechoslovakian 
Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier said Friday [22 April] he is 
opposed to giving Russia a membership to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU) as a 
factor that could threaten European security. 
  "We cannot add a (politically) unstable country to (those 
multi-national organizations)," Dienstbier said in an interview 
with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. 
  Russia, if it becomes a member of those organizations, will 
not work as reinforcing security in Europe, but rather will 
become a disturbing factor, he said. 
  Dienstbier is in Japan to attend a symposium cosponsored by 
the United Nations University and a non-governmental 
organization. 
  Pointing out that there is danger of a revival of a policy 
favoring great powers in Russia, the Czech Republic will 
continue monitoring movements toward democracy under the regime 
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic became 
independent 
states with the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia 
Federation in January 1993 following the collapse of the former 
Soviet Union in 1991. 
  The former Warsaw Pact nations led by the former Soviet 
Union 
invaded the Czechoslovakian capital of Prague in 1968 to crush a 
reform movement there. 
  In August 1993, Yeltsin flew to Prague, now the Czech 
capital, to sign friendship treaties with Czech and Slovak 
counterparts, but neither of treaty includes a direct apology 
for the 1968 invasion. 
  Dienstbier served as foreign minister for the former 
Czechoslovakia from December 1989 to June 1992. 
  He said the republic will keep a close watch on how Russia 
will establish relations with other former Soviet republics as a 
test case to see its policy toward the middle European nations. 
  On Czech politics, he predicted that people will voice 
opposition to the present government led by Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus in the expected election of the upper senate 
chamber within this year. 
  On relations with the Slovak Republic, he said it is 
possible 
for the two republics to unite again in line with expansion of a 
unification of European nations.

visiting our country, signed a joint political declaration of 
the two countries' Foreign Ministries. According to Mr. 
Daskalov, the document specifies the main directions for 
bilateral cooperation, but the important thing is that these are 
refracted through the prism of our common aims to integrate us 
in the European and Euro- Atlantic structures. 
  Prior to this, Acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev talked 
for almost two hours with Netherlands Prime Minister Ruud 
Lubbers and Foreign Minister Peter Kooijmans. During the 
meeting they discussed the difficulties of the transition and 
the possibilities for stimulating our bilateral relations, 
especially in the sphere of investments and cooperation in 
providing financial credits. 
  Through its representatives, the Netherlands assured us that 
in the near future it will ratify the interim trade agreement 
between Bulgaria and the European Union. The guests expressed 
the Netherlands' readiness to invest in our transportation 
projects, including the new Danube bridge.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- "There are no 
opposing interests between the Russian Federation and Romania, 
both states sharing the same European values and ideals," Yuriy 
Fedorovich Yarov, deputy prime minister of the Government of the 
Russian Federation, said during an interview held Thursday [21 
April] evening in Bucharest with Romania's Prime Minister 
Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  Appreciating the conditions set forth by the new 
Constitution 
of the Russian Federation as favorable for expanding bilateral 
ties, the guest said that they could and should be expanded not 
only between Romania and the Russian Federation, but also 
between Romania and the states in the federation that are 
enjoying full freedom to build up their own international 
economic ties. 
  In the opinion of Yuriy Fedorovich Yarov, the two 
governments 
are called to ensure as soon as possible the legal framework for 
expanding cooperation in the economic, commercial, trade, and 
scientific fields. 
  In his turn, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu pointed out the 
similarities of the stages crossed by the two countries on their 
road towards market economy, saying that to get out of that 
specific crisis implies strengthening of ties on multiple 
planes. Nicolae Vacaroiu also considered that the Crans Montana 
Forum was a good opportunity to foster new contacts that would 
lead to an expansion of bilateral exchanges. Romania's premier 
also expressed hopes in a rapid expansion of economic ties 
between Romania and the Russian Federation.

<F P=106> ["Crans Montana Forum: President Ion Iliescu's Statement -- </F>
Abridged, Unofficial ROMPRES Translation" -- ROMPRES headline] 
  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- In a statement 
released in Bucharest on 20 April, President Ion Iliescu 
assessed the initiative of the Crans Montana Forum to hold an 
international conference in Bucharest as a proof of Romania's 
readiness and wish to promote international political and 
economic dialogue, to give new dimensions to the cooperation 
with all states of the world and of the role Romania -- an isle 
of peace and stability in an extremely troubled zone -- can play 
in the development of this region. 
  The Romanian head of state assessed that the themes to be 
debated, referring to cooperation and security in the Black Sea 
area, the political context in Central and Eastern Europe, the 
prospects of a stable peace in the region, offered the 
possibility of establishing concrete steps toward the promotion 
of political dialogue and encouraging the cooperation among and 
with the countries in Central and Eastern Europe. "In order to 
attain this purpose, the first-hand knowledge of the deep 
changes come about in this area in the last four years can 
eliminate the reserves sometimes shown towards our countries," 
he stated. ``I hope that the conference participants will have 
the opportunity these four days to get an image of today's 
Romania, a country where democracy has been entrenched and where 
foundations have been laid to the state of law but that, 
unfortunately, is still living through many economic 
difficulties. We have committed ourselves to a structural 
reform, to the end of using to advantage the country's 
substantive human, industrial, technological and scientific 
potential. This target can be attained completely and rapidly 
only through international cooperation and a more sizable 
presence of the foreign capital in the Romanian market. In this 
respect, we see that after a period when the realities in 
Romania were gravely distorted by international mass media, 
nobody doubts today any longer that Romania has committed itself 
firmly and definitely on the road to democracy, observance of 
human rights and specific values of a free world. Besides, the 
facilities offered to foreign investors rule out any reticence 
in coming toward the Romanian economy. 
  ``In another sequence of ideas, we hope the Bucharest talks 
will be a signal for the international community, to the end of 
assisting the countries in the area, by establishing peace, for 
avoiding the extension of the conflicts or the emergence of new 
hotbeds of war. Romania's situation is not an easy one, as it is 
surrounded by zones of permanent unrest. Therefore, like all 
countries in Central and Eastern Europe, we are interested in 
our security," the Romanian head of state said. ``I am taking 
this opportunity to recall the fact that, by our opinion, the 
signing of the Partnership for Peace cannot be reduced only to a 
simple extension of the NATO a few kilometers farther to the 
East. 
  It means the turning of the North-Atlantic Alliance into a 
factor of security for all countries in the region, meant to 
avert the danger of new and arbitrary discriminations among the 
countries of this region, giving them the opportunity to think 
out ways of implementing a partnership for development, proposed 
by us as an extension of the Partnership for Peace in Europe. 
For European development to become a fact, we should overcome 
the suspicions and confrontations and understand that the common 
difficulties can be overcome only through opening and 
cooperation''.

welcome for they occasion, through interviews and talks, an 
extensive exchange of opinions on current issues confronting our 
countries, especially regarding the process of transition to 
market economy," is the opinion of Mechyslaw Hryb, president of 
the Supreme Soviet of the Belarus Republic. 
  "I view this meeting as a beneficial one, proving Romania's 
wise policy towards openness. It will undoubtedly yield best 
results for expanding Romania's cooperation ties with other 
countries, especially economic ones. Romania has overcome the 
stage of expectations. What we have done here by organizing the 
Crans Montana Forum comes to prove Romania's real potential. We 
are seeking for an image much closer to the real one that would 
open new ways for our country. We are convinced that the Crans 
Montana Forum would reflect Romania's real potential which could 
attract foreign investors to our country," stated Romanian 
Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- Upon arrival in the 
Parliament Palace, Romania's President Ion Iliescu, surrounded 
by the press, was the target of a salvo of questions, starting 
from his always congenial mood, and the impressions about 
Placido Domingo's concert, and to the Crans Montana Forum 
conference topics. 
  The Romanian president found Domingo's concert "a good 
overture to this conference," and said he hoped the presence at 
the conference of the Israeli foreign minister and the PLO 
leader is a "good omen," showing optimism about the possibility 
of direct contacts these days in Bucharest. 
  Challenged by a journalist with the supposition that an 
agreement might be signed, the president said: "I do not know if 
the stage of signing an agreement will be reached, because 
negotiations are in progress. They will be coming with fresh 
information from the negotiations under way in Cairo, but we do 
hope that their meeting in Bucharest marks a positive step, 
stimulative for the ongoing of the negotiations." 
  President Iliescu also expressed the hope that the 
conference 
might contribute to the settlement of the Yugoslav crisis and to 
stopping the conflict in that area.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- The president of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasir 'Arafat met on 
Wednesday evening at his residence in Bucharest with Petre 
Roman, the president of the Democratic Party (PD). After the 
meeting, Petre Roman told ROMPRES: "I have understood President 
'Arafat's arguments regarding the situation of the Palestinian 
people, the necessity of an objective understanding of the 
importance of the peace in this hot zone as a strategic pole of 
the maintaining and developing of a long-lasting peace and of 
the development of the Arab world societies in accordance with 
the strengthening of the democracy and liberty in the whole 
world." 
  During the same day, the PLO leader met also with Emil 
Constantinescu, the president of the Democratic Convention of 
Romania (CDR). The CDR Press Office said that the talks had 
approached the latest evolutions in the international life, 
underscoring the peril represented by the extremism and the 
beneficial role of the dialogue and cooperation.

President Ilie Verdet, met on 20 April evening with a delegation 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization, headed by Yasir 
'Arafat, PLO Executive Committee president, now in Romania for 
the Crans Montana forum proceedings.

relations between Romanians and Palestinians, the fact that the 
Palestinian movement has always enjoyed full support, as 
regarded the right to self-determination of the Palestinian 
people and the negotiated settlement of the issue. 
  President Yasir 'Arafat said he felt encouraged by that 
meeting with the Romanian socialists.

possibility of expanding the relations between the two parties 
on multiple planes and the economic relations as well, to the

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- The 
Romanian-Israeli official talks on Thursday, April 21, between 
Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu and Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shim'on Peres, consisted mainly of an analysis of the 
present bilateral relations. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mircea Geoana 
said 
at the end of the talks that both parties had concentrated upon 
the economic issues and had analyzed some projects regarding the 
financing of some credit lines for industry and agriculture as 
well as the backing of the recently founded joint 
Romanian-Israeli Bank. The two parties agreed upon future 
negotiations of some credit lines at governmental level to be 
made available by Israel to Romania. In accordance with the 
governmental accord between the two countries, the two foreign 
ministers approached new possibilities of personnel training, 
including exchanges of journalists specialized in tourism issues. 
  The international life was another subject of the dialogue 
between the two foreign ministers. Romanian Foreign Minister 
Teodor Melescanu said that the Middle East was one of the "poles 
of interest" for Romania. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
informed that the chief of the Romanian diplomacy had asked 
support from Israel to Romania's seeking participation in the 
multilateral groups established in the peace process. In this 
respect, the Romanian party showed its interest in joining in 
the concrete projects in Gaza and Jericho. The two dignitaries 
approached also issues concerning the evolution of the conflict 
in Bosnia. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said also that 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres had talked with his 
Romanian counterpart in an "amicable" manner about the occurance 
in Romania of "several isolated cases" of anti-Semitism. The 
Israeli chief-diplomat said that, in spite of the correct 
decisions and positions taken by the Romanian Government which 
had been well received in Israel, he had to ask, because of the 
sensible subject, the authorities in Bucharest to continue their 
actions in the same spirit. The Romanian chief diplomat said 
that such situations were "isolated" and explained that the 
phenomenon could be linked to the transition period as well as 
to the freedom of expression manifesting in Romania.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- (Unofficial, 
abridged ROMPRES translation of Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor 
Melescanu's speech made at the Crans Montana Forum) 
  ``The very fact that Romania has the privilege of playing 
host to this conference of the Crans Montana Forum, one of the 
catalysts of the process of providing new bases to the European 
and world order, is a convincing argument that our irreversible 
option for democracy, pluralism, the state of law, the 
observance of fundamental human rights and freedoms, as well as 
for an economy of free enterprise is acknowledged as such by our 
partners in Europe and in the world," said Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu in his address to the plenary session 
on "Security and Cooperation in the Black Sea Region" of the 
Crans Montana Forum proceedings opened in Bucharest on 21 April. 
  ``Recognized in this way is also Romania's characteristic as 
a Central-European country close to the Balkans, bordered by the 
Danube and the Black Sea, a junction of the connections among 
the various zones of the old continent, as well as between 
Europe and the regions in its proximity,'' the speaker said. 
  Highlighting the fundamental option of the Romanian foreign 
policy of integration into West-European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures, of building good-neighborly relations with the 
states with which Romania has common frontiers and with those in 
its proximity, the Romanian foreign minister also stressed the 
importance of the sub-regional cooperation pursuing the curbing, 
as much as possible, "of the tendency of fragmentation of 
Central and Eastern Europe, as a characteristic of the evolution 
of this zone over the last few years." 
  ``That is why the countries participating in sub-regional 
cooperation ought not to depart from the framework of the 
principles and norms consecrated by the CSCE and, the least 
desirable is that they promote principles and norms contrary to 
the above. 
  ``This is the philosophy underlying the emergence and 
development of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone, a group 
participated in by 11 states totalling 322 million inhabitants, 
within which the cooperation is preponderantly economic,'' the 
Romanian chief diplomat said, adding: 
  "The natural connection existing between the Mediterranean 
Sea and the Black Sea, as well as the fact that the latter is 
the shortest way between Europe and Central Asia largely explain 
the interest shown by more and more numerous states that do not 
have Black Sea coasts in participating in our group's 
activities." 
  The Romanian minister recommended to "those concerned -- be 
they government factors, private enterprises, or representatives 
of similar groups in Europe or in other continents -- to apply 
for detailed information on the rules of procedure and 
functioning of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone and on 
the projects already under operation or only under 
consideration, to the standing secretariat with headquarters in 
Istanbul." He hoped that this year already the Black Sea Trade 
and Development Bank would open at Salonika and that, in the 
future, the current Balkan Center for Small and Medium 
Enterprises, existing in Bucharest, might extend its activity 
throughout the Black Sea zone. 
  In concluding his address, Teodor Melescanu said: 
  ``By its geographic position and its tremendous potential of 
raw materials, labor, productive capacities, and outlets, the 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone is an attractive space of 
collaboration. 
  ``On the other hand, it is just as true that the vast Black 
Sea region includes also areas of deep instability and even of 
open military conflicts. 
  ``That is why, the fastest and peaceful settlement of the 
conflicts on the east coast of the Black Sea deserves to be 
included in the CSCE and UN priorities''

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- Opening the debates 
of the Crans Montana Forum conference's second plenary session 
on "Economic Perspectives for the Middle East in the Aftermath 
of the Israeli-PLO Peace Accord," PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat said 
that from its side, the PLO "has always viewed the declaration 
of principles signed at the White House as the first step in the 
peace process which started in Madrid in 1991, in order to open 
a new chapter in the Middle East based on peaceful coexistence, 
relations of good neighborliness, cooperation, solving problems 
by peaceful means, dialogue, and arbitration." 
  "To arrive at this stage," said the PLO leader, "we have and 
still are conducting arduous, long, and difficult negotiations 
with the Government of Israel in many places, in Washington, 
Oslo, Paris, Davos, and Cairo." 
  "Today, we are meeting at this forum in Bucharest, the 
capital of Romania, which was among the first countries that 
have worked forcefully and that made constructive proposals and 
creative initiatives to realize just peace in the Middle East 
region and to find a negotiated settlement and just peace to the 
cause of Palestine," said Yasir 'Arafat. 
  The PLO leader added that since his arrival in Bucharest he 
had concluded important and constructive negotiations with 
President Ion Iliescu, negotiations which dealt among other 
things with fostering the peace process, its success and the 
implementation of the agreements signed between the PLO and the 
government of Israel. 
  PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat concluded his speech with an 
appeal: 
"I call for the carrying out of the requirements of this 
agreement and its articles on all the Palestinian, Arab, and 
Israeli bilateral and multilateral tracks. Any delay in 
implementing this agreement will gravely endanger the peace 
process and will open the way in front of the extremists, no 
matter what their identity is or their beliefs are, to destroy 
the peace process, and to be the reason behind causing the fall 
of more innocent victims on both the Palestinian and Israeli 
sides."

  Referring to the fact that the Black Sea is a region in a 
part of the world where conflicts exist, especially in the 
Balkans and in the Caucasus, Hikmet Cetin, minister of foreign 
affairs of Turkey, stressed in his address to the Crans Montana 
Forum proceedings that the interdependence and regional 
collaboration have become more necessary now than ever. He 
highlighted his country played an important role in the 
promotion of a system of cooperation in the Black Sea region, a 
system relying upon economic relations, joint investments, and a 
free trade. 
  Cetin said the purpose of the setting up of the organization 
of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone was rather economic, 
but that did not mean that political difficulties cannot be 
overcome through economic cooperation and development. 
  The organization will develop economic and technological 
cooperation in every domain, but especially in 
telecommunications, transportations, and tourism. 
  The organization was not set up as an alternative to the 
existence of the European Union, but it was rather a step toward 
achieving the European architecture.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1993 -- The second plenary 
session of the Crans Montana conference started on Thursday [21 
April] afternoon, on "Economic Perspectives for the Middle East 
in the Aftermath of the Israel-PLO Peace Accord," which had 
President Ion Iliescu as moderator for Romania. 
  The other moderators were: Jean-Paul Carteron, president of 
the Crans Montana Forum Foundation, Yasir 'Arafat, president of 
the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, Shim'on Peres, Israeli minister of foreign 
affairs, and Fathi Surur, president of the People's Assembly of 
Egypt. 
  Opening the session, President Ion Iliescu expressed his 
satisfaction at the privilege to be the moderator of the 
discussions of the two politicians who have assumed the 
difficult task to break the deadlock and start negotiations that 
should give shape to peace in the Middle East. Stressing in 
this respect the courage and realistic-mindedness of 'Arafat and 
Peres, President Iliescu highlighted also the contribution of 
Egypt, an important promoter of the peace negotiations in the 
Middle East. He considers that new ways are about to be found 
for the overcoming of the conflict situation, suggesting to the 
international community to back the efforts of the two, who are 
currently under powerful pressure. 
  President Iliescu recalled Minister Peres' saying that one 
would find money more easily for weapons than for building 
peace, and stressed it was the duty of the international 
community to back these two politicians in their constructive 
effort. Also, he hoped the Bucharest meeting would help the 
attainment of the desideratum of peace for which 'Arafat and 
Peres worked.

  [Text] bucharest ROMPRES, 21/4/1994 -- In an address on 
Thursday [21 April] to the Crans Montana conference meeting in 
Bucharest, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said that his 
meeting with the PLO leader [Yasir 'Arafat] at the Crans Montana 
Forum was not incidental because Bucharest had a peculiar 
significance for Jews and Arabs, as this was the place where 
essential contacts had taken place some years ago on the way of 
building a real peace in the Middle East. 
  The Israeli minister reminded that Israel had recently 
established diplomatic relations with the Vatican and 
appreciated that as an event of the category of those occurring 
once at two thousand years. This model of understanding with 
the Catholic world could be followed by closer relations with 
the Moslem world, said Shim'on Peres. "The historic decision" 
taken by Yasir 'Arafat to negotiate the peace with the Israeli 
was not an easy decision to make in a world dominated by hatred 
and suspicion, said the Israeli foreign minister. 
  Shim'on Peres added that Israel could not afford to remain 
an 
island of prosperity in a sea of poverty because only a new 
standard of living must be the answer to the fundamentalism. 
This is the moment to finalize the peace and not the war, said 
Shim'on Peres, who added further that one could not win through 
battles, but rather through toils in schools. The Israeli 
minister concluded that the "hunting season" was over and it was 
high time that the "creation season" should start. Shim'on 
Peres said he thought the peace bay was near.

  [Text] Tirana April 20 (ATA) -- On April 20 Albanian 
ambassador in Athens, Hysen Cabej, was called to the Greek 
Foreign Ministry by the vice director of Balkan political 
department, Mr.Ralis, who presented the Greek request that the 
Albanian diplomatic staff be reduced by one more person. The 
present staff of the Albanian Embassy in Athens is composed of 
five diplomats. 
  Strangely enough, this fact runs counter to the statements 
uttered by the Greek government members themselves on finding a 
way to dialogue and cooperation. As a result, the message from 
Athens is difficult to be understood, says a statement of the 
spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Albania 
regarding this event.

Public Order reported recently that several people have been 
detained for keeping arms without permission and criminal acts. 
The detention are in conformity with the law. 
  During the sudden controls the police organs have detained 
citizens from Vlore, Pogradeci, Delvina, Gjirokaster (south of 
Albania), Shkoder, Hasi, Bulqiza (north) and from Tirana 
(central Albania). The police has taken from them tommy guns, 
pistols, knives and munitions. 
  Besides the arms, the police has also confiscated a lot of 
anticonstitutional documents which proves the expansionist and 
annexionist Greek intentions toward Albania and the Albanian 
territories, as well as the flagrant Greek endeavour to make 
Greek the southern part of Albania. [sentence as received]

  [Excerpts] Tirana, April 21 (ATA) -- The chairman of the 
Democratic Party of Albania, Eduard Selami, accompanied by Mr. 
Tritan Shehu and Ali Spahia, held a press conference April 20 in 
the presence of reporters of the press, radio-television, and 
representatives of the diplomatic corps accredited to Albania. 
  At the beginning Mr. Selami read a message for the press 
which says that: "Practically, Albania has embarked on one of 
the most significant stages of the economic reform, that of 
profound privatization, full liberalization of prices, as well 
as preparation of vouchers. [passage omitted] 
  The very tense situation in former Yugoslavia is also being 
doubled with the provocative acts of Greece, practically current 
leader in turn of the European Union. The April 10 incident, 
the gravest of the latest ones, is part of the policy pursued by 
certain circles of influence in the Greek Government. There are 
circles in Greece which base their policy with Albania on 
Hellenism, and this is dangerous. The military provocations, 
the antihuman stand against the Albanian emigrants, the stance 
towards Cameria, the anti-Albanian propaganda, the policy of 
preventing Albania's integration into the international 
community, a policy which has been applied for several times by 
Greece, testify to that Hellenizing policy of likely 
consequences for all the Balkans," Selami's message for the 
press says. 
  Asked about the effectiveness of coalition and remarks in 
its 
regard, Mr. Selami said that the DP [Democratic Party] stands 
loyal to coalition because it has yielded positive results both 
in the victory of March 22 elections and later. Coalition, Mr. 
Selami said, is dynamic therefore the demands of the SDP [Social 
Democratic Party] and RP [Republican Party] have been 
reasonable. We have discussed them and have been successful in 
resolving our problems. But, naturally, there are things in the 
coalition we do not agree upon, something quite normal. But I 
want to stress once again that we favour coalition and this is 
also in favour of democracy, Mr. Selami confirmed. 
  In response to a question on outlawing the CPA [Communist 
Party of Albania], the DP secretary general, Tritan Shehu, said 
that in Albania not only the CP but also the fascist party is 
illegal, as there is likeness between each other as regards 
crimes at the expense of the people. Asked about the Greek 
Government's responsibility for the April 10 incident, Mr. 
Selami said that "the stand maintained by the Greek Government 
does not release it from responsibility because the band has 
come from the Greek territory and has fled in the same 
direction. We uphold that it has been a terrorist act, and 
under international standards, it bears responsibility for not 
pronouncing itself about the incident." 
  Asked about statements on the Albanians as a destabilizing 
factor in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM], Mr. Selami answered that such statements are uttered 
by circles really interested in Macedonia's destabilization, as 
a very sensitive region in the Balkan crisis. "We consider the 
Albanian factor in Macedonia as a factor of stability and 
believe that the resolution of the Albanians' question in 
Macedonia is a matter of concern not only for the region but 
also for Macedonia itself." 
  Regarding DP's relations with the right front of the 
Albanian 
political parties, whose idea is being propagated in the press 
of this parties, the DP chairman said that creation of new 
parties and alliances in pluralism is quite normal. "We 
maintain a clear cut stand towards the extreme right, which we 
disassociated from the party in our latest assembly." 
  Regarding the possibility of cooperation of the DP with the 
Italian right which has come to power in Italy, Mr. Selami said 
that "we have always been in favour of close relations with 
Italy. We have hailed the victory of the right of center in 
Italy because we consider it as a facility to cooperate with 
parties of the same political spectre. We have asked contact 
with Berlusconi and demanded close relations not only at party 
level but at governmental one."

  [Text] Tirana, April 21 (ATA) -- In the course of his 
visit to Albania, Norman Anderson, the chairman of CSCE mission 
in Skopje, met the Albanian President Sali Berisha, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Arjan Starova, public order and transport 
ministers, Mr. Musaraj and Mr. Bitincka respectively, on April 
20. In these meetings Mr. Anderson was interested in knowing 
Albanian views in reference to the Albanian-Macedonian 
relationship in general. 
  They focused mainly in the situation of Albanians in the 
Macedonian Republic [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM]. They pointed out in the meetings that Albania will 
continue to demand the respectability of the rights of Albanian 
people in Macedonia and wherever they are, which constitutes one 
of the priorities of Albanian foreign policy. The 
respectability of the Albanian rights constitutes an important 
element of stability in the whole region. 
  Firstly, in this framework Albania is interested in 
achievement in conformity to the international laws as soon as 
possible of the population census and the demands of the 
Albanians should be taken seriously by the census law. 
  At the same time was stressed the good will of the Albanian 
side to offer its territorial advantages for the passing of 
goods, because Macedonia suffers from Greek embargo. Not only 
for this reason but also foreseeing the future development of 
economical and commercial relationship with Macedonia, Albanian 
authorities pointed out the readiness for the further 
intensification of the relations, making concrete proposals to 
specific fields.

<F P=106> [Article by Stacy Sullivan: "Albania's Frightened Press </F>
Under Siege"] 
  [Text] Tirana, Albania -- When 25-year-old 
Aleksander Frangaj, editor in chief of the most popular daily 
newspaper in Tirana, left the courthouse in the nation's capital 
in the first week of March, a crowd gathered outside the police 
van that drove him back to Tirana Prison. 
  "Sander! Sander! Sander!" they chanted. 
  Frangaj, who had been in prison for a month awaiting trial 
for exposing state secrets, held up two fingers in a V. This 
victory gesture was often flashed in 1991, during the elections 
that toppled the Communist government and brought the ruling 
Democratic Party to power. But now, instead of a sign of 
allegiance, it was a symbol of ridicule. 
  After communism in Albania fell in 1991, the groundwork for 
a 
free press seemed to take hold. Three years after the Democratic 
Party swept into power, however, journalists complain they are 
once again feeling the symptoms of dictatorship. 
  Last October, the government passed a controversial press 
law 
that imposes high fines on offending journalists. Reporters and 
editors have also been punished under the country's recently 
amended penal code from 1977. Additionally, many journalists 
tell tales of harassment and even beatings after publishing 
critical reports on the government. 
  Frangaj was arrested after a reporter at his newspaper, KOHA 
JONE (OUR TIME), wrote that soldiers would be required to leave 
their weapons in the barracks when off-duty. The information was 
allegedly obtained from a top-secret Ministry of Defense 
document that a ministry official pilfered and released to the 
newspaper. 
  The crowd that gathered after Frangaj's court appearance 
consisted mainly of fellow journalists who had come to express 
their solidarity with the accused and protest the increasing 
pressure being brought to bear on journalists. 
  So far this year, a dozen reports of Albanian journalists 
being arrested, beaten or harassed have surfaced. Six media 
watchdog organizations -- the International Federation of 
Newspaper Publishers, the International Federation of 
Journalists, Reporters sans Frontiers, the Balkan Federation of 
Journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists and Article 19 
-- have sent protests to Albanian President Sali Berisha against 
the arrests of Frangaj and his reporter, Martin Leka. 
  Frangaj, who was acquitted of the same charge last year 
after 
reporting on tank movements near Albania's northern border with 
Yugoslavia, was found innocent again this time. But the court 
sentenced Leka to 18 months in prison for "collaborating to 
release state secrets," the harshest punishment against a 
journalist since communism fell. 
  The press in Albania is reeling from nearly 50 years of the 
most hardline rule in Europe. 
  Partly as a result of its past, most of Albania's main 
newspapers are mouthpieces of various political parties and are 
filled with propaganda and party polemics. Radio and television 
are still state-controlled. There are many independent papers, 
but they too are politicized and seldom separate opinion from 
fact. 
  Government officials say the press law was necessary to 
regulate a press that, they claim, is slanderous and 
unprofessional. 
  "In the papers I have been married several times and have 
kids, villas and property all over," said Edward Salemi, chair 
of the ruling Democratic Party. He is single and lives in a 
Tirana apartment. 
  Even though the Albanian Helsinki Committee has issued 
protests against the treatment of journalists, assistant 
director Kutim Casko complains about the press as well. 
  "Journalists don't have an awareness for the sacred mission 
they must do," he said. "Instead, they have become the 
politicized victims of party politics. They terrorize people." 
  At the time of passage, the widely contested press law 
provoked a 48-hour strike by many of Albania's leading papers, 
which printed only their mastheads, leaving their pages blank. 
Numerous international organizations lodged protests. 
  Ironically, however, it is the 1977 penal code, which has 
gone largely unchallenged, that has most gravely affected 
journalists. 
  The law, drafted under the late Communist dictator Enver 
Hoxha, was used by officials to arrest Frangaj and Leka. At 
least three others are now under arrest and awaiting trial for 
alleged violations of the law. 
  Illyrian Zhupa, editor in chief of the independent 
opposition 
paper POPULLI PO (PEOPLE'S YES), was arrested for slander 
February 9, after the newspaper ran an investigation of a 
scandal that Zhupa said implicated "several key figures in the 
government." 
  Zhupa, whose trial date has not yet been set, also complains 
that his offices have been broken into and documents have been 
stolen. 
  "It's too early for a free press in Albania," he said. 
  The staff at the newspaper of the main opposition party, the 
Socialists, also complain about the pressure they have come 
under. 
  In January, a worker named Luftetar Matohiti from the 
industrial city of Elbasan wrote a letter to ZERI I POPULLIT 
(THE PEOPLE'S VOICE) criticizing the government and reminding 
President Berisha of the time in the 1920s when a man became a 
national hero for killing an Albanian ruler. This was considered 
an insult to the president, and Matohiti was sentenced to two 
months in Tirana Prison. 
  ZERI I POPULLIT's second-highest editor, Shyqyri Meka, was 
fined $1,000 US for publishing an article that was critical of 
the "upper organs of the state." 
  After his colleagues at KOHA JONE were arrested, Gjergj 
Zefi, 
deputy editor of the ALEANCA (ALLIANCE), wrote an article the 
next day protesting the arrests and calling the government a 
"mafia band." 
  "The government has decided to attack all of its political 
opponents. This speaks of a mentally sick state. That is the 
only way to explain the arrests of the two journalists," he 
wrote February 1. 
  After his article was published, Zefi was placed under city 
arrest for criticizing upper organs of the state. He was allowed 
to travel only from his hometown of Skodra, in northern Albania, 
to his office in Tirana. 
  March 2, just a few days after his colleague Leka was 
sentenced, Zefi was found lying unconscious in the street in 
Skodra, after having been clubbed on the head. Zefi, who is also 
vice chair of the Democratic Alliance (a splinter group of the 
ruling Democratic Party) had written several articles about 
alleged smuggling of oil by local mafia into the former 
Yugoslavia in defiance of the UN embargo. 
  Zefi also organized a meeting of the Democratic Alliance in 
January, after which a gunman, firing into the crowd outside the 
building, killed one party member. No suspect was ever 
apprehended, although Democratic Alliance members claim they 
know who did the shooting. 
  Zefi had been the editor of the now-defunct LAJMETARI, based 
in Skodra. His predecessor at the paper was clubbed in the same 
way last year after reporting on the alleged mafia, and has 
since left the country. 
  Arben Imami, general secretary of the Democratic Alliance, 
said journalists at his paper are scared. 
  "We have survived so much -- you know, 50 years of a 
totalitarian regime, a press law, a penal code -- but now there 
is a real danger of being eliminated, physically eliminated, and 
law-enforcement authorities are not doing anything about it," 
said Imami. "We are facing a new period." 
  The attacks on Zefi and his predecessor are not the only 
cases of violence against journalists. 
  Last month, while trying to verify the charges against 
Frangaj and Leka, a journalist who reports for the cable 
television station WTN was punched in the face at the Tirana 
Prosecutor's Office. 
  In early January, a knife-wielding visitor lunged at Apollo 
Bace, a journalist for the independent paper DITA INFORMACION 
(INFORMATION OF THE DAY), when Bace answered his door. Bace said 
a cigarette lighter in his pocket saved him from injury. 
  That attack followed several articles Bace wrote about the 
Church of Scientology, as well as an article criticizing 
President Berisha DITA INFORMACION had run several days earlier. 
  The Association of Professional Journalists in Albania has 
lodged a protest against the attempted stabbing, and has 
appealed to the Albanian authorities to apprehend and punish 
those who attack journalists. 
  Albania's press law, based on a German press law from 
Rhineland-Westphalia, imposes fines on journalists ranging from 
$1,000 to $8,000 US. In a conference organized by the 
Friedrich-Ebert Foundation, which prepared the law for Albania, 
German media lawyer Kurt Braun defended the law, but said the 
fines were excessive in a country where journalists earn on 
average the equivalent of $40 US per month. 
  Braun also questioned whether Albania had the appropriate 
legal framework to ensure proper implementation of the law. 
  "This law leaves much open to misapplication," he said, 
pointing out Albania's lack of a constitution and its 
inexperienced judiciary. 
  Marcus Jaeger, a European Community lawyer, said, "If the 
Albanian public could be sure there would be competent judges, 
there would be much less fear of new laws." 
  "I think it's better to have a bad press law than to be 
without a law," said Beqir Skreli, a reporter at ZERI I 
POPULLIT. "The problem is putting this law into practice. 
We...are fined, while the journalists at RILINDJA DEMOKRATIKE 
[DEMOCRATIC REBIRTH, the daily of the ruling Democratic Party] 
haven't been cited for a single case," he said. "The knife has 
two edges. So far it has shown only one -- against the 
opposition."

  [Text] Sofia, April 22 (BTA) -- The summit meeting to be 
attended by representatives of the United States, Russia and the 
European Union may be convened in Sofia, Mr. Konstantin Andreev, 
head of the Southwestern Europe Department at the Foreign 
Ministry, told reporters today. 
  Mr. Andreev was asked to comment on the Foreign Ministry 
declaration of Wednesday on the situation in Gorazde. The 
declaration suggested that the summit should be held in a 
country adjacent to the area of the conflict. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Todor Churov confirmed that this 
part 
of the declaration could be interpreted as an application by 
this country to host the summit on Bosnia.

  [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben 
Berov today told a radio interviewer he is capable to work and 
will be back to his duties on Monday [25 April]. "I will be 
back (to work) on Monday and will not spare anyone," Prof. Berov 
said. He is planning to address parliament next week. 
  The prime minister is still in hospital recovering after a 
quadruple bypass surgery in March and an infectious disease 
alarm on April 13. During his stay at the hospital the prime 
minister held consultations on an upcoming cabinet overhaul. 
Asked whether he expects a consensus on the cabinet changes, 
Prof. Berov said: "When a man has a goal, he will attain it." 
  In the meantime it became known that Prof. Berov during 
consultations had told the New Union for the Democracy (NSD, set 
up by expellees or defectors of the Union of the Democratic 
Forces) he will approach parliament insisting that ministries of 
forestry and foreign economic relations be set up, the latter to 
be in charge of tourism as well; the Power Engineering Committee 
and the Committee of Geology and Mineral Resources be merged; 
and the Posts and Telecommunications Committee be transformed 
into an association. The prime minister also reportedly pledged 
to come up with a short- term plan of action on behalf of the 
cabinet. He further told the MP's of the NSD he will send a 
letter to National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov to ask 
for an April 27 parliamentary hearing on his ideas for cabinet 
changes. 
  The former Communists' Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) gave 
Prime Minister Berov a May 15 deadline to submit a new cabinet 
programme and a proposal for cabinet changes. The ethnic Turks' 
Movement for Rights and Freedoms, too, declared themselves "pro" 
cabinet changes. They were the party on whose mandate the 
incumbent cabinet was formed in late 1992. Socialist floor 
leader Nora Ananieva on Tuesday told journalists the BSP was 
unhappy with a number of cabinet decisions taken during Prime 
Minister Berov' absence. "The Council of Ministers has not 
given up its normal work despite the difficult circumstances," 
Prof. Berov told the radio interviewer today. 
  While speaking of cabinet changes, all political forces 
showed unambiguously they are preparing for early elections. 
The Union of the Democratic Forces (SDS) openly calls for the 
cabinet's resignation and early elections this autumn. 
Bulgaria's two major labour organizations -- the Podkrepa 
Labour Confederation and the Confederation of the Independent 
Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) -- also back the idea of early 
elections and level severe attacks against the cabinet. 
Podkrepa leader Konstantin Trenchev on a number of occasions 
said the cabinet has completely exhausted its capacity and is 
most likely to fall by the end of May. A week ago the KNSB 
called a rally under anti-cabinet slogans in Sofia. It 
scheduled a token strike for May 4 and a nationwide strike for 
mid- May. KNSB leader Krustyu Petkov said he will go to the 
negotiating table with the cabinet only if Prime Minister Berov 
personally guarantees that KNSB's demands, mostly social ones, 
will be met. According to KNSB Deputy Chairman Ivan Neykov, 
however, "it is not a matter of changing the cabinet but the 
approaches and methods applied by the executive."

<F P=106> [Report by Tanya Tsekova] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, April 20 (BTA) -- "It was time to come here 
to discuss the possibility of cooperation within the European 
Union as well as bilateral cooperation; the Netherlands and 
Bulgaria are at the two sides of Europe, but actually we think 
it very important to make Europe one whole," Dutch Prime 
Minister Ruud Lubbers said arriving on an official visit to 
Bulgaria today. He is accompanied by Dutch Foreign Minister 
Pieter Kooijmans. 
  The formal talks between the Dutch delegation and Deputy 
Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, now acting prime minister, 
lasted more than two hours. Bulgarian Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov also attended the talks. "It is the sides' 
shared opinion that there are still untapped possibilities in 
the field of economic relations which should be further 
developed based on the good relations the two countries 
maintain," the spokesman for the Bulgarian Government reported 
after the meeting. 
  Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev believes that it is possible 
to activate bilateral economic relations mainly in the field of 
investment, production, finance and lending. He thanked the 
Dutch side for its assistance in the stabilization of Bulgaria's 
balance of payments. Bulgaria expressed its readiness to accept 
Dutch investments in the construction of a transport corridor 
from the Black Sea to Bulgaria's western border, a transport 
corridor connecting the south and the north by building a tunnel 
under the Shipka Pass (in the Balkan Range), and the 
construction of a new bridge across the Danube. "The Bulgarian 
side hopes that the Netherlands will continue to support 
Bulgaria's efforts for integration with all the European 
structures and will ratify its Interim Agreement on Trade with 
the European Union at an early date," Deputy Prime Minister 
Matinchev was cited as saying. 
  The prime minister of the Netherlands described 
Bulgarian-Dutch cooperation within the framework of the 
International Monetary Fund as very successful and praised 
Bulgaria's joining the Partnership for Peace plan. Mr. Lubbers 
admitted there are many potentials for the advancement of 
bilateral relations, pointing out the need of updating all older 
bilateral agreements and creating a modern legal framework for 
the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments. He 
showed interest in the political and economic situation in 
Bulgaria at the moment, the problems of ethnic minorities in 
Bulgaria and human rights, Bulgaria's position on the conflict 
in ex-Yugoslavia, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
Balkan relations. 
  In Mr. Matinchev's opinion, the ongoing process of 
Bulgaria's 
settling its debts to the Paris Club of official creditors and 
the London Club of creditor banks is a light at the end of the 
tunnel. Mr. Matinchev sees the lack of an earlier settlement of 
Bulgaria's external debt problem and the Yugo-embargo as the 
main reasons for the slow progress of reforms in this country. 
According to calculations made by employing the methods of the 
world body, Bulgaria has suffered a loss of 3,200 million U.S. 
dollars as a result of the strict application of sanctions 
against the former Yugoslavia. The direct losses in the 
country's balance of payments since the beginning of this year 
only are estimated at 700-900 million U.S. dollars. Mr. 
Matinchev informed Mr. Lubbers about the political life in 
Bulgaria, stressing that despite the heated debates in 
parliament, the country is an island of peace free of 
interethnic or other conflicts. 
  Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov made a 
detailed 
analysis of Bulgaria's position on the Yugo-crisis and outlined 
the parameters of its Balkan policy and its relations with 
Greece, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] and Turkey. 
  After the formal talks the foreign ministers of Bulgaria and 
the Netherlands signed a joint political declaration between the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the two countries. "This is 
the first declaration signed by representatives of the two 
countries since the collapse of communism in Bulgaria," the 
media were told by Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans. 
"The document spells out everything that Bulgaria and the 
Netherlands have in common, the two countries are members of 
many international organizations and have many common goals," 
Mr. Kooijmans said. Listing those common goals, he stressed the 
stability and economic prosperity of Europe and cooperation in a 
lot of fields. "Most important is the prevention of conflicts, 
and stability also means security, the European countries should 
cross-cooperate in the military organization, it is very 
important to make the idea for peace a reality," the Dutch 
foreign minister said. 
  "The joint political declaration makes provisions for 
bilateral cooperation in economy, politics, trade and culture in 
the light of the two countries' common goals," Bulgarian foreign 
minister Daskalov specified. 
  Tomorrow the Dutch delegation will have meetings with 
President Zhelyu Zhelev and National Assembly Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov.

  [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- The Bulgarian-Dutch 
relations and the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina were high on the 
agenda of the talks between Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev 
and Netherlands' Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers now on a formal 
visit to this country accompanied by Foreign Minister Pieter 
Kooijmans. 
  President Zhelev during the talks stressed that the 
integration into the European structures is this country's 
foreign policy priority, the president's spokesman said after 
the meeting. Dr. Zhelev raised the issue of the ratification of 
the agreement for Bulgaria's association with the European 
Union. Commenting on this matter, Mr. Lubbers pledged that the 
Dutch parliament will ratify the document this summer. The 
guest also told the Bulgarian president that a group of 
businessmen from the Netherlands will visit this country to 
investigate the conditions Bulgaria has to offer to foreign 
investors and the possibilities for setting up joint ventures. 
  President Zhelev further briefed Mr. Lubbers on this 
country's stance on the Yugo-conflict and commented on its views 
against the sending of Turkish blue helmets to join the UN 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia. He said that this country 
believes an involvement of a country neighbouring to former 
Yugoslavia is likely to escalate the conflict and impede the 
peace process. 
  The Dutch delegation today met National Assembly Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov and the Parliamentary Committees on National 
Security and Foreign Policy. The talks again focused on the 
situation in the Balkans and the developments in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
  Speaking at a news conference later today, Prime Minister 
Lubbers said he was convinced that the two countries have 
opportunities to further promote their business cooperation. He 
also said he was aware of the obstacles arising from the 
painstaking transition to a market economy this country is 
currently going through. According to him, this is where the 
Netherlands can offer its help within the framework of the 
Council of Europe and the Partnership for Peace initiative. Mr. 
Lubbers identified positive trends in the development of the 
political contacts between the two countries and went on to say 
that the Bulgarian defence minister will soon pay a visit to the 
Netherlands. 
  Answering a journalist's question, Mr. Lubbers said the 
Netherlands would not oppose the idea of calling a conference on 
the Yugo-conflict on the territory of a neutral neighbouring 
country as long as this does not waste more time further 
postpone the end of the war. 
  This afternoon the delegation left Bulgaria.

  [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- Slovak Foreign Minister 
Eduard Kukan this evening arrived on an official visit to 
Bulgaria. Tomorrow he is expected to meet his Bulgarian 
counterpart Stanislav Daskalov, President Zhelyu Zhelev, 
National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and Deputy Prime 
Minister Evgeni Matinchev. The sides are expected to review the 
legal framework of the bilateral relations. Signing of accords 
is not envisaged. 
  The Bulgarian-Slovak ties date back to the 1939-45 period, 
the time of the first Slovak state. Bulgaria was the sixth 
country to recognize Slovakia after Czechoslovakia was divided 
and immediately after the two countries established diplomatic 
relations in September 1993. According to a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman, the current state of the bilateral relations can be 
described as very good. Experts are now intensively drafting a 
number of economic accords. 
  President Zhelev went to Bratislava during a February 1991 
visit to Czecho-Slovakia. In April 1992 then Slovak prime 
minister Jan Carnogursky paid a formal visit in Sofia. Informal 
meetings between the two parliaments' speakers followed in 1992 
and 1993. Slovak President Michal Kovac last August came to the 
Bulgarian Black Sea coast on a holiday. In the meantime he met 
Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and invited him to visit 
Slovakia. 
  The Bulgarian-Slovak commercial exchange marks an 
equilibrium 
with figures which are nearly identical in the two directions. 
According to experts, the effected levels are too low and do not 
correspond to the countries' potentials.

<F P=106> [Report by Kiril Vulchev] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- Macedonian President Kiro 
Gligorov will pay an official visit here on April 25 and 26 at 
the invitation of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev, the press 
office of the Bulgarian Presidency announced. This will be the 
first official visit of the Macedonian President to Bulgaria. 
Mr. Gligorov has visited Bulgaria twice -- on a one-day working 
visit in August 1992 and privately in October 1992 in connection 
with the premiere of a play by a Macedonian playwright here. 
Dr. Zhelev visited the Republic of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] unofficially in 
February 1993 to attend the presentation of his book "Fascism" 
published in Macedonia. 
  Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognize the 
Republic of Macedonia in January 1992, four months after this 
former Yugoslav republic proclaimed its independence. The 
decision to recognize Macedonia was taken by the government of 
the anticommunist coalition of the Union of Democratic Forces 
with prime minister Filip Dimitrov. President Zhelev supported 
this decision. 
  In June 1993 a Bulgarian premier -- Prof. Lyuben Berov, 
visited Macedonia for the first time. In November 1993 
Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski opened a 
Macedonian Consulate General in Sofia. In December 1993 the 
diplomatic relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia were 
upgraded to embassy level. 
  The recognition of the Republic of Macedonia by the 
Bulgarian 
Government marked the beginning of an intensive development of 
trade and economic relations. In 1991 commercial exchange 
between Bulgaria and Macedonia amounted to U.S.$50 million while 
in 1993 it was already U.S.$300 million of which almost U.S.$230 
million-worth Bulgarian export and over U.S.$60 million-worth 
import from Macedonia. Double taxation was abolished in June 
1993. The Bulgarian Government has granted two commodity 
credits to Macedonia -- for U.S.$20 million in August 1993, and 
in March 1994. An agreement was signed in December 1993 
regulating cooperation between the Bulgarian and Macedonian 
Agricultural Ministries. A direct telecommunications link was 
established between Sofia and Skopje in 1993. Prior to that the 
two capitals were linked through Serbia. A 110-KV power conduit 
between Bulgaria and Macedonia was completed this March. This 
is the second link between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian 
power generation systems. The oil refinery in Burgas 
(southeastern Bulgaria) is the main foreign trading partner of 
the only Macedonian company authorized to import fuels -- 
Makpetrol. Almost 50 Bulgarian companies attended the first 
Macedonian- Bulgarian fair in Skopje in late 1993. 
  Following Resolution 787 of the UN Security Council for 
tightening the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro, 
Macedonian Prime Minister Jovan Andonov said during his visit 
here in November 1992 that "Bulgaria is the Republic of 
Macedonia's last open gate to the world." Consultations have 
started on the construction of a railway between Bulgaria and 
Macedonia as part of the East-West Trans-Balkan Railway from the 
Adriatic to the Black Sea. There is no direct railway between 
Bulgaria and Macedonia, which are linked by three motorways. 
The issue of traffic arteries became particularly topical after 
the embargo imposed by Greece on Macedonia this February and the 
closing of the Greek port of Thessaloniki for Macedonian goods. 
Macedonia transferred its import and export to the Bulgarian 
Black Sea port of Burgas. In March 1994 the Macedonian 
Government confirmed the prime importance of the construction of 
a railway between Macedonia and Bulgaria for Macedonia's 
economic development and its guaranteed transport communications 
with the world. 
  In November 1993 the transport ministers of Bulgaria and 
Macedonia signed the first agreement for road toll-free freight 
and passenger transport. The ministers agreed that Bulgaria and 
Macedonia should jointly insist before the UN Sanctions 
Committee on a single transport corridor through Serbia. 
Bulgaria and Macedonia will ask the International Civil 
Aviation Organization (ICAO) to recognize the 
Tirana-Skopje-Sofia route a transit air corridor. The first air 
service between Skopje and Sofia dates back to May 1992. After 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia closed its air space to 
Macedonian airlines, Skopje Airport redirected all Macedonian 
aircraft through Bulgarian air space. 
  Bulgarian tourists rank first among foreign tourists in 
Macedonia, according to Georgi Danevski, secretary of the 
Macedonian Tourist Union. An agreement on cooperation in the 
field of culture is being drafted, proceeding from the accords 
reached during the visit of Bulgarian Culture Minister Ivaylo 
Znepolski to Macedonia last February. Early this month the 
Bulgarian and Macedonian education ministers failed to sign an 
agreement on cooperation because of the last-minute demand of 
the Macedonian side for the agreement to say that it has been 
drafted "in the Macedonian and the Bulgarian languages." 
Bulgarian Education Minister Marko Todorov insisted on the 
original wording "in the official languages of the two 
countries."

  [Text] Prague April 20 (CTK) -- Without a decision by the 
U.S. Congress and the U.S. Administration, the Czech Government 
cannot make any decisions concerning a lease of the former 
federal parliament building to the Radio Free Europe (RFE) 
station on a noncommercial basis, Czech Minister Igor Nemec told 
reporters today after a government session. Nemec said the U.S. 
authorities would have to give their consent to move the radio 
station from Munich to Prague and to fund it. Nothing is 
changed by the fact that on April 15 the RFE's Board of 
Directors and the Liberty radio station recommended the station 
to be moved to Prague, Nemec said. He added that RFE will be 
moved to Prague only after Congress's decision has been made and 
providing it is funded exclusively from the U.S. state budget. 
  "If RFE were financed from several sources and on a 
commercial basis, the Czech Government could not lease the 
federal parliament building on a non-commercial basis," Nemec 
said. 
  At present, the building is financed from the state budget. 
It costs annually 45 million crowns (about 1.5 million USD). 
The Czech Government recently decided that if Congress does not 
approve the RFE's move to Prague by the end of April the 
parliament building will be leased on a commercial basis. 
  Nemec said the government had postponed decision-making on 
the building three times, as it wanted to comply with RFE's 
wishes. The Prague Stock Exchange, the National Museum and 
several art institutions have shown interest in using the 
building, Nemec said.

  [Text] Prague April 20 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today 
approved a supplement to the payments agreement between the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia eliminating the old account, Deputy 
Premier Josef Lux announced. Payments on the old account of the 
trade payments clearing system served for settling transactions 
concluded between the two countries before the currency division 
on February 8, 1993 and were effected at an exchange rate of one 
Czech to one Slovak crown. Lux added that the government at the 
same time agreed to discuss a new agreement between both 
republics, under which non-government liabilities arisen before 
the currency division would be transferred to the current 
clearing account, used for the payment of liabilities arisen 
after the currency division at the rate valid on February 8, 
1993 -- 34.5 crowns (1.15 USD) to one ECU. State payments from 
the old account would continue to be paid at the one to one 
exchange rate. 
  According to data provided by the Czech Republic, Czech 
companies owed 2 to 3 billion crowns (70-100 million USD) at the 
end of the first quarter and Slovak companies 12 to 14 billion 
crowns (400-460 million USD).

  [Text] Hradec Kralove, East Bohemia April 20 (CTK) -- 
Czech Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde today described the 
government coalition's ability to agree on the method for 
elections to the Senate as a "test of its maturity." 
  At a press conference here today, Uhde (Civic Democratic 
Party -- ODS) said that ODS deputies had voted for a 
Constitution which embeds the creation of the Senate, the upper 
chamber of the Czech parliament yet to be established. 
  "If the coalition agrees on a principle for the election law 
to the Senate... the whole problem is over," Uhde said. Then it 
would only be necessary to "find a suitable term for the 
elections to take place -- 1995 or 1996." 
  From the outset, said Uhde, considerations were apparent 
that, if the Senate were not created, Czechs would "get 
accustomed to its absence." Uhde dislikes the idea of 
abandoning the creation of a Senate simply because of the 
failure to agree on an election method. 
  The government proposal of the election law to the 
parliament's Chamber of Deputies and the Senate envisages the 
creation of 81 constituencies, with one Senator being elected to 
each of them. Premier Vaclav Klaus's ruling ODS is pushing for 
this variant, but the other coalition partners -- the Civic 
Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) -- oppose it.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Milan Kucan in the State Chamber in </F>
Ljubljana-- live] 
  [Excerpts] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, honored ladies and 
gentlemen deputies, honored house: Your conclusion to invite me 
and thus allow me to explain my statements about possible 
scenarios of political events in Slovenia, of which I have 
allegedly spoken in public, demands a little explanation first. 
Nowhere have I ever spoken of any scenarios of political events 
in Slovenia and for this reason such an explanation is not 
possible. In light of the debate at the 28 March extraordinary 
session of the State Chamber, I presume that these were my 
statements made at the deputies' evening in Nova Gorica, which 
was on 23 February. Your conclusion, that is to say, demand 
allows me to use my constitutional right and duty to tell this 
high house, and through it the wider public, how I view the 
situation in Slovenia, that is to say, how I viewed it in Nova 
Gorica. I decided to appear in person because I feel firmly 
bound by my constitutional responsibility and the moral 
obligations that I have as a president of the state to draw 
attention to the issues concerning the observation of 
constitutionality and legality, the protection of human rights, 
and internal political stability and security of the state. I 
believe it is not sufficient for me to send my opinions, 
warnings, initiatives, and proposals only to the incumbent 
ministers, the government, and the State Chamber, but find it 
necessary and warranted to address the public, too, and warn it 
about the tendencies and the occurrences that are, in my 
opinion, deeply harmful for the interests of the citizens of our 
state, its stability and future, and its position and reputation 
in the world. I have no direct authority to resolve these 
issues. However, with a public word I wish to assist in a 
creative release of social tensions attached to the fundamental 
questions of the state and in the resolution of the existential 
problems of the Slovene citizens, especially the problems of 
their social and legal security. [passage omitted] 
  Even though I have explained the contents, the meaning, and 
the aims of this appearance [in Nova Gorica] in the media on 
several occasions I shall do this once again in front of the 
State Chamber. However, I do not understand why my appearance in 
Nova Gorica was not presented adequately in the media, if it 
really gave rise to so many doubts, questions, and also 
manipulations and misinterpretations. It is interesting to note 
that even those who concerned themselves the most with this 
message have failed to do so. Had this been the case, the 
Slovene citizens would have learned, as is their right, what the 
president of the republic actually said. They would form their 
own judgment about what was said, without middlemen and 
interpreters, especially those who can merely think in terms of 
dark scenarios and major conspiracies. This is a matter of 
conscience and responsibility of those people who are building 
their political work on deliberate falsification and disrespect 
for authenticity. If anyone recognizes his own pattern of 
thinking and behavior in my critical warning that a highly 
disturbing belief that objectives justify the means is gaining 
prominence in our political practice, then this is a matter of 
his conscience and also a matter of his responsibility for the 
damage done to society. This is a responsibility for deliberate 
falsification and violation of the authenticity of the spoken 
word, or to say it directly, some people have obviously taken 
lies for proofs. 
  My assessments and warnings put forward in Nova Gorica 
referring to cases of unlawful behavior and social anomalies and 
tendencies in political life were not the first of their kind. 
I have spoken similarly on several occasions before. However, 
because of the thoroughness and credibility of the information 
which was published publicly there were no manipulations, 
fabrications, and speculations with my words then. My speeches 
in the papers are accessible to anyone. In none of these 
speeches or writings is there any basis for the claims that I 
was announcing any sort of scenarios of events and liquidations 
and favored the use of all means to defeat a political opponent. 
Such interpretation of my words means perversion and deliberate 
imputation of what I have explicitly rejected. Quite the 
opposite is the truth. I demand that the politicians act as a 
cohesive factor, seek consensus of as many as possible segments 
of the society, and create the conditions for a peaceful and 
creative life of the people. I am opposed to politicians 
currently deepening the existing divisions or causing new 
divisions among the people. I am convinced that this is 
disastrous for the survival and the future of the Slovene nation. 
  Esteemed deputies! I have handed you an exact transcript 
of what I said in Nova Gorica. From it you will easily conclude 
that the message of my speech consisted of three essential 
parts. In the first part I, as the president of the state, 
again explained my political project. I strive for parallel 
coexistence of various beliefs, pluralism, and reconciliation. 
I understand reconciliation as an inevitable coexistence of 
various convictions about the truth, as a resistance against the 
repression of only one truth in the name of which it would be 
allowed to attack all other truths and liquidate their 
champions. Here I am also referring to the tragic experiences 
from World War II and the period directly after it. 
  In the second part I expressed my regret because the Slovene 
political scene has became so pronouncedly divided while 
confrontation and uncooperativeness have become the basic 
principles of the life on it. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the 
principle that he who is not with us is against us is winning a 
right of domicile on this scene. This logic transforms an 
opponent into an enemy and permits all means to defeat the 
enemy, even those that are absolutely contrary to the 
fundamental principles of democracy, therefore, 
disqualifications and liquidations, if necessary even physical. 
This is the merciless logic of this principle and it should be 
borne in mind. I, therefore, spoke of a political method that 
is striving to assert itself in Slovenia. I opposed it, and I 
warned where this method could lead. [passage omitted] 
  I would like to stress particularly that for almost a year I 
have been warning about the damaging processes that have cut 
deeply into the working environments, communities, and even 
families and have already had their fateful effect on the nation 
as a whole, dividing it. I believe that you can see this for 
yourselves. This is no longer about identification with one 
political leader and rejection of other political leaders, this 
is about undermining of credibility and trust in the legitimate 
institutions of the system, including the parliament, the 
government, and the legislation. Therefore, I did not announce 
any individual events but merely warned about the political 
circumstances that could lead toward incidents and political 
instability. 
  The State Chamber does not ask me directly about my alleged 
involvement in the Smolnikar affair. However, this question has 
been raised in public constantly by forces who would, in my 
opinion, like to shed their responsibility for it. With full 
responsibility I assure you that I am not connected with this 
affair nor are the people from my cabinet. This also applies to 
all other unlawful actions. For this reason I am furthermore 
interested in an expert and quick investigation. It would be 
most unusual if the fact that this constituted the biggest 
violation of human rights would finally become completely 
irrelevant. 
  In the third part I advocated that the standards of 
expertise 
and excellence should apply to professional performance of 
duties connected with the running of the state. In place of 
efforts to give prominence to a positive, that is to say, expert 
selection of cadres in the life of our state, we are constantly 
witnessing the attempts of self-praise and self-justification 
with the references to the so-called old structures, 
conspiracies, powerful secret organizations, icebergs, and so 
forth. It is primarily those who are incapable of forming a 
positive program of social changes themselves that talk about 
this, even though such positive changes are badly needed and the 
citizens demand them with full justification. [passage omitted] 
  Esteemed deputies! From the media and the events in Slovene 
society you and I could both learn about and ponder over the 
events of which I spoke in Nova Gorica, which testify of the 
violation of the principles of a law-governed and a democratic 
state. I spoke of a group calling itself the Civilian 
Initiative and its anonymous circulars, of constant threats with 
dossiers, of old and new mafias, and of illegal groups that 
function as para-intelligence services, illegally gathering 
information and tailing state and political officials, 
journalists, and public persons. Let me remind you that I 
warned last summer that our state was not sufficiently protected 
in the area of counterintelligence and that it would be sensible 
to form the National Security Council within the government, 
which would steer, coordinate, and supervise the work of our 
intelligence services in the parliament. The prime minister's 
political collegium also partially concluded so when it decided 
in March that as a matter of rule the prime minister will 
establish the necessary coordination between the departments, 
that is to say, services through the political collegium. I 
remain firmly convinced that we must immediately set up all 
legal and institutional bases and frameworks that would 
facilitate effective functioning of the supervisory mechanisms 
over the repressive apparatus of the state as a whole. It must 
be shielded from the temptation to accomplish goals and tasks 
with prohibited means. We must prevent that individuals or 
groups would misuse it for political purposes or even to morally 
disqualify political adversaries and different-minded people in 
general. [passage omitted] 
  I expect that the sensitivity of the public and the state 
offices toward any sort of arbitrary violation of human rights 
will increase. Namely, if we do not resist immediately any 
cases of unlawful bugging and surveillance of the post today, 
this will happen to somebody else tomorrow, and to all of us the 
day after. You know what Murphy's law says: If you are a 
paranoiac it does not necessary mean that you are not being 
followed. There will always be plenty of the so-called higher 
interests with which to justify such behavior. For this reason 
I believe that the prime minister's resoluteness in not 
tolerating any unlawful activities regardless of their 
perpetrators deserves the full support of the parliament and the 
public. I expect that everybody will act in this way. 
  Esteemed deputies! The State Chamber holds a report by the 
Slovene Government about the problems in cooperation between the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Defense Ministry, and the 
conclusions of the March political collegium with the prime 
minister. I did not have this information until the end of last 
week when I again explicitly requested it. I have based my 
assessments on official verbal explanations of the incumbent 
officials of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and their findings 
in the investigation about the Civilian Initiative, which I had 
proposed myself. I also based my assessments on other publicly 
recorded events and also numerous opinions and warnings put 
forward in the parliamentary debates. It would be irresponsible 
of me to be unconcerned by these occurrences and to remain 
indifferent. I expected an appropriate reaction from the 
incumbent state offices and the State Chamber commissions here. 
At the same time this was also a reason to invite the prime 
minister and the State Chamber chairman to discuss the political 
and security situation in the country and my public assessments 
of these circumstances. I believe that the cases of unlawful 
activity should be pointed out immediately, before they become 
daily practice. It is much easier to form an assessment about 
the security situation in the country on the basis of the 
government report, especially regarding the observation of 
constitutionality, legality, and protection of human rights. 
  I expect that the government will inform you of all the 
findings that it has uncovered or will uncover in the 
investigation of all events that have justifiably caused concern 
among the public for quite some time. This also applies to the 
arms with which Slovenia, also in the interest of its own 
security, helped Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the 
arms intended for the Slovene Army. The State Chamber and the 
public must get a thorough report about all this to clear all 
rumors about irregularities or even personal acquisitions and 
possible war profiteering. If this has happened, then the 
culprits must answer for it before a court of law. 
  I stick to my constitutional authorities. I do not interfere 
with the official procedures and actions of the state services, 
ministries, government, or the parliament except in the cases 
and in the spheres explicitly determined by the Constitution and 
the law. A duty to protect the constitutional order has 
compelled me to send numerous written warnings and proposals to 
the Slovene government. To illustrate, let me quote some of the 
issues to which the warnings referred and which, in my judgment, 
constituted a breach of the law and arbitrariness on the part of 
the state offices and their officials. In my opinion on the 
proposal of the Defense Law, which I sent to you at the request 
of the State Chamber on 3 December 1993, I pointed out the 
controversial nature both of the government decree on ranks and 
promotion in the Defense Ministry, as of the government's 
agreeing to the proposal for the dismissal of the commander of 
the Republican Headquarters of the Territorial Defense and the 
appointment of a new commander, the questionable awarding of 
honors and medals in the Defense Ministry, the intolerable 
interference of military personnel in the political sphere, 
failure to inform the president of the republic as the supreme 
commander about the actual situation in the defense forces and 
their combat-readiness, at the need to form a National Security 
Council of the government to steer, coordinate, and supervise 
the work of the entire security-intelligence and 
counterintelligence activity of the state and to safeguard the 
State Chamber's supervision over this activity and the entire 
defense sphere. I warned of the unlawful and arbitrary 
deployment of the guard of honor of the Territorial Defense and 
the unlawful usurping of the authority to discharge soldiers, 
where the minister even quoted consultations with the 
Constitutional Court. The essence of my warnings was that until 
the new laws are passed we must observe the prevailing ones and 
at the same time hurry up with the preparation and adoption of 
an overall, new Defense Law that will be harmonized with the 
Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  One should not overlook the fact that the government is 
responsible for the implementation of laws, for the management 
and direction of the state administration through ministers, and 
for the supervision of their work. 
  Regarding the anonymous writing of the so-called Civilian 
Initiative and its links with the foreign intelligence services, 
as it professes itself, regarding the supposed bugging in the 
Bank of Slovenia, and regarding the discovery of the arms on 
Maribor airport, I have urged, in writing and in personal 
contacts with the prime minister, the interior minister, and the 
chief of the Slovene Intelligence Security Agency, that matters 
be investigated thoroughly, that the interests of the state be 
protected, the safety of citizens safeguarded, and the domestic 
and international public informed about the conclusions. Let me 
here state also my opinion about the way in which the president 
of the republic is being informed -- not Milan Kucan, but the 
institution of the president of this country. Because of his 
constitutional duties, obligations in country's political life, 
and appearances on the international scene, it is definitely in 
the interest of all citizens and all institutions that shape and 
implement country's internal and external policy that the 
president of the state be promptly and thoroughly informed about 
all affairs that are important for the effective functioning of 
the state. My everyday experiences convince me that the present 
manner in which the president is informed does not perform up to 
this standard. I believe that in finalizing our legislation and 
its harmonization with the Constitution, it would pay to 
consider a suitable legal solution for these relations. The 
lack of a defined means of informing the president of the 
republic, who is elected directly, is a poor testimony for this 
country, the government, and the State Chamber. It is odd, to 
say the least, to wonder where the president of the state gets 
his information from, and not why the president of the state is 
not informed. Countries with parliamentary tradition have these 
relations defined by law. [passage omitted] 
  Esteemed deputies! Despite all the unquestioned and 
encouraging achievements and successes of the last two and a 
half, that is, almost three years of Slovenia's independent 
life, I still believe that the basic premises and goals of the 
plebiscite are as topical as they were at the time of their 
adoption. I believe and hope that this project will remain a 
common concern of the parliamentary and all other parties, all 
state offices and the institutions of the civic society, just as 
its demanding the first step -- the gaining of Slovenia's 
independence -- was a common concern. [passage omitted] 
  As in all countries, especially those that have broken off 
with their real socialist past, there are social anomalies here, 
too, that hurt the citizens in a material, political, and moral 
way and for which there is often no excuse. Here I refer to the 
state's being too expensive, the slow pace of property 
transformation and the accompanying abuses as well as the abuses 
pointed out in the debate about public debt that affect the 
workers who, having invested their efforts and labor in the 
companies for decades, are many of them now unemployed and 
concerned for their job, salaries, and survival. Also, I refer 
to the cases of corruption, inexplicable foot-dragging over 
denationalization, and the uncompensated injustices against 
those hurt by the old political regime, even perfectly simple 
ones, such as compensation for the time spent in prison, for 
suffering, the right to have a grave and be remembered, and so 
forth, which is all a matter of legislation and thus also a 
matter of this parliament. 
  I am also convinced that the regulation of relations between 
the state and the church is also not running as one would wish 
and as well as possible. The criticisms of the slow systematic 
replacement of old laws and their harmonization with the legal 
standards of the European Union and the Council of Europe, and 
the ability of the social institutions, especially the judiciary 
and the prosecutors' offices, to prevent breaches of the law 
more efficiently and promptly than so far, are justified. I 
have warned about this in my public appearances. It is my 
judgment that I must do so on this occasion in the State 
Chamber, which is a legislative organ. I again stress the need 
to resolve these questions faster because their remaining 
unresolved only exacerbates the often justified protests of 
dissatisfied citizens who will eventually try to achieve justice 
by themselves. I am convinced of this also by a great number of 
letters that I receive daily. The people's potential for 
protest and justified grief and hard feelings should not be an 
object of political misuse. A timely detection of the potential 
protest demands quick, timely, and convincing responses. For 
this reason I again urge the observation of the principles of a 
law-governed state, legality, and constitutionality, which are 
the bases of democracy, the safety of citizens, the basis of 
respect for their dignity and the protection of their rights. I 
also urge effective action against social anomalies and moral 
injury. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Prague April 20 (CTK) -- A fundamental disagreement 
on foreign policy views was revealed by the absence of the Civic 
Democratic Party (ODS) leaders from the recent Litomysl summit 
of seven presidents, Liberal Social Union [LSU] foreign policy 
secretary and former Czechoslovak Ambassador to Italy Jiri Holub 
told journalists today. Presidents of Austria, the Czech 
Republic, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia met in 
Litomysl, East Bohemia, on April 15-17. 
  The Czech Republic's image abroad is not helped when the 
invitation to take part in a meeting like that is turned down by 
Premier Vaclav Klaus and Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde, and the 
Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec is not present, Holub said. 
Klaus excused himself on account of preparations for his trip 
to Latin America, Uhde said he was going to a meeting with 
members of the public in Velka Bites, South Moravia, which he 
said he had agreed on seven weeks before, and Zieleniec was 
leaving for Vietnam. Holub said the Realistic Bloc (including 
the Czech Social Democratic Party -- CSSD, the LSU, the 
Christian Social Union -- KSU and the Czech Womens' Union) 
expert group's criticism of the government foreign policy was 
right. 
  "Without the presence of opposition representatives, the 
Foreign Policy Council cannot play its role of coordinating 
foreign policy," Holub said, adding that he was going to ask the 
Presidential Office for an explanation regarding the Litomysl 
meeting circumstances including the presence, or absence, of 
political representatives.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slovenia Thinks About Reconstruction </F>
of Bosnia-Herzegovina"] 
  [Text] Sarajevo, 7 April -- Slovenia is trying to evacuate 
another 200 citizens from Sarajevo. With this purpose in mind, 
officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of 
Labor, Family, and Social Welfare visited Sarajevo yesterday. 
  Representatives of some Slovene firms which would be able to 
participate in the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina or were 
already known in Bosnia-Herzegovina before the war were invited 
by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a meeting in Ljubljana 
yesterday. Representatives of more than 30 firms attended the 
meeting, organized as a part of preparations for the visit of 
the Slovene Government delegation to Sarajevo. All the 
businessmen present emphasized their willingness to participate 
in the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Many Slovene 
enterprises used to have branches or subsidiaries there, some 
having left there all their equipment and full warehouses. 
Slovene construction firms also have several thousand employees 
from Bosnia-Herzegovina, who could serve as a link in bidding 
for reconstruction contracts. Since many industrial facilities 
and power plants in Bosnia-Herzegovina were built by Slovene 
firms, it would be easiest for those firms to rebuild them.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Apr (MTI) -- In recent days, Slovak 
press reports and officials have hinted at an imminent 
Hungarian-Slovak prime ministerial meeting, to focus on the two 
countries' basic treaty. Slovak sources also suggested that 
they had cancelled the programme. MTI asked Foreign Affairs 
Spokesman Janos Herman if the meeting is on the agenda and what 
topics would be discussed. 
  "The Hungarian prime minister has never been unwilling to 
meet his Slovak counterpart and nor is he today," Herman said. 
"Preparations have been made for the summit but the Slovak side 
made the event conditional on issuing a joint communique on the 
topics to be fixed in the basic treaty. The Hungarian side 
could not accept this," Herman said, adding, "the statement that 
the summit would have focussed on the basic treaty is 
misleading." 
  "Prime Minister Peter Boross is prepared to hold talks with 
Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik to give another push to the 
development of bilateral ties and pave the way for the 
settlement of conflicts. Hungary, however, cannot accept 
preconditions and will itself not set preconditions. Hungary is 
prepared to negotiate even after Slovakia refused to accept the 
European Union's proposal for a temporary water division regime 
at a recent meeting between the two ministers of environment," 
Herman said. 
  "So Hungary regrets that the Slovak side, as they said in an 
official message to the Foreign Ministry yesterday, does not 
wish to take part in a working meeting. Hungary's proposal for 
a foreign ministerial meeting at the opening of a border station 
still stands," Herman concluded.

    [Editorial Report] The following biographic sketch of Jelko 
Kacin, who replaced Janez Jansa as defense minister of the 
Republic of Slovenia on 29 March, is a composite of information 
that appeared in DNEVNIK, a Ljubljana daily, and REPUBLIKA, a 
Slovene-language daily published in Trieste, Italy, on 25 March. 
  Jelko Kacin was born on 26 November 1955 in Celje, but since 
1956 he has lived in Kranj, where he attended elementary school 
and high school, graduating from the latter in 1975. He 
graduated from the Faculty of Sociology, Political Science, and 
Journalism of Ljubljana University in 1981, having specialized 
in defense studies. 
  Until 1985, Kacin served as a consultant and head of the 
civil defense department in the Kranj municipal government. 
Following the 1990 elections, he became Slovenia's deputy 
secretary of people's defense and gained a reputation for his 
expert commentaries on the Gulf war. According to some sources, 
he had to leave the Secretariat of Defense because he 
overshadowed Defense Secretary Janez Jansa. Because of his 
leadership and organizational skills, he was named information 
minister in April 1991, before the war broke out in Slovenia. It 
was through his efforts as information minister during the 
10-day war that the truth about the aggression by the Yugoslav 
Army reached the world and Slovenia's endeavors to achieve its 
independence gained international support. Kacin was the 
Democratic Party candidate in the 1992 presidential election. 
Having won only a few seats in the parliamentary election, his 
party did not join the governing coalition. After the election 
he left the civil service and became active in the business 
sector. (Ljubljana DNEVNIK in Slovene 25 Mar 94 p 3 and Trieste

  [Text] Budapest April 21 (CTK) -- The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry today said Slovakia's lack of interest in a working 
meeting between the two premiers, Peter Boross and Jozef 
Moravcik, was regrettable. 
  The ministry's spokesman, Janos Herman, said Budapest 
received Bratislava's statement through official channels on 
Wednesday [20 April]. 
  Herman did not specify who had initiated the meeting. He 
said that during the preparation of the meeting, Slovakia made 
it a condition that a joint communique be issued on the meeting 
which would deal with some of the questions to be embedded in 
the planned basic treaty. Hungary could not accept this 
condition, Herman said, adding that the treaty was not to be the 
main topic of the meeting. 
  In today's issue of the Hungarian daily MAGYAR NEMZET, its 
Bratislava correspondent wrote that the meeting had been 
initiated two weeks ago by Slovakia and that it was to have been 
held on Monday [25 April]. But Hungary replied too late, the 
paper wrote, and moreover Budapest allegedly "laid conditions 
that are unacceptable to the Slovak party." 
  It wrote that the Hungarian conditions allegedly included 
the 
demand that no joint communique be issued from the meeting and 
that the premiers do not hold any joint press conference. 
Slovakia, the paper writes, has said that such a "secret" 
meeting before the May parliamentary elections in Hungary would 
have no sense. 
  Herman said today that at the meeting Boross was ready to 
give a new impulse to the development of Hungarian-Slovak 
relations and help solve pending problems. 
  Hungary has laid no conditions and would not accept any from 
Slovakia. 
  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry's offer for the two foreign 
ministers to meet on the occasion of a new Hungarian-Slovak 
border crossing is still valid, Herman said. 
  Slovakia conditions the opening of new border crossings by 
the signing of a readmission agreement because it fears an 
influx of immigrants coming via Hungary from Romania and other 
countries.

  [Text] Ljubljana -- Mile Setinc, director of the Government 
Information Office, resigned yesterday. He denied that 
disagreement in the LDS [Liberal Democracy of Slovenia] over the 
adoption of the Law on Radio and Television was the reason for 
his departure. It is known that Setinc favored more 
representatives of civic groups and professional organizations 
without party affiliations in the state Radio-Television 
Council. The Assembly adopted an alternative, a compromise 
between his proposal and the proposal backed by the LDS, which 
would allow representatives of political parties to dominate the 
Council. Setinc said that he has "personal" reasons for his 
resignation.

    [Editorial Report] In its 7 April survey of Slovene parties 
titled "Three Slovene-Two Parties" DNEVNIK contends that the 
reason for the plethora of political parties and associations -- 
124 are currently registered in Slovenia -- is that only 20 
signatures are required to register a new party. The Ljubljana 
daily predicts, however, that the number of parties will be 
"drastically reduced" by a new law that, if adopted in its 
present form, will include the requirement that "at least 500 
adult Slovene citizens must sign charter statements and adopt a 
party statute and program" to form a party. The paper notes that 
this will not be an obstacle for the seven parties that have 
deputies in parliament, but will "probably be quite a hardship" 
for smaller parties with only a few hundred members. 
  The DNEVNIK article contains a "survey" of political 
parties, 
including information on their membership, organization, and 
dues. The paper observes that while none of the parties possess 
precise membership figures, all of them boast that their ranks 
are swelling. 
  The largest political party, according to DNEVNIK, is the 
Slovene People's Party (SLS), whose chairman is Marjan Podobnik, 
with 36,000 members organized in 51 county (opstina) committees. 
SLS Secretary Franc Feltrin claims that membership is growing, 
"especially in urban areas." Party dues are 1,000 tolars a year. 
The party rules do not bar membership in other political 
parties, except for members of the SLS leadership, and place no 
restrictions on admission. 
  DNEVNIK lists as the second largest political party the 
Slovene Christian Democrats (SKI), whose chairman is Lojze 
Peterle, with about 35,000 members, 20 percent of whom are also 
members of other parties. Members must be "adult Slovene 
citizens who accept the SDK statute and program." Among SDK 
members, however, are about 1,200 Slovenes who live abroad and 
are "not necessarily Slovene citizens." The party has 356 town, 
62 county, and 16 regional committees. A new member has to sign 
a special admission form and pay dues based on income. 
  The United List of Social Democrats (ZLSD), whose chairman 
is 
Janez Kocijancic, has 23,000 dues-paying members and about 
10,000 "sympathizers" who pay their dues irregularly, according 
to its secretary, Dusan Kumer. Dues are 1 percent of a member's 
net personal income or "as much as he or she can afford." The 
ZLSD averages seven town committees in each county (there are 
presently 62 counties in Slovenia) and has 13 regional 
committees. Several associations such as the Women's Forum, the 
Youth Forum, the Retirees Association, and the Workers 
Association are also included in the ZLSD. The new united 
Liberal Democracy of Slovenia (LDS), whose chairman is Janez 
Drnovsek, has 18,000 members, says its secretary, Andrej Novak. 
Formed on 12 March by a merger of four "left-of-center" parties, 
the LDS has "at least" one party committee in each county in 
addition to town committees. LDS members are not allowed to 
belong to other parties. Following the merger, it is expected 
that committees will be reorganized and the annual dues of 3,600 
tolars reduced. Party officials pay dues of up to 2 percent of 
their monthly gross incomes. 
  Branko Grims, secretary of the Social Democratic Party 
(SDSS), whose chairman is Janez Jansa, says that the party's 
membership has increased almost 10 percent due to the "recent 
political events"--Jansa's dismissal from the post of defense 
minister and the party's subsequent departure from the governing 
coalition. The party has about 6,000 members, mostly 
"nonagricultural workers." Membership in other parties is not 
allowed. The SDSS has committees in every county; it is 
"particularly strong" in Murska Sobota, Ljubljana, and Maribor. 
Annual dues are 1,000 tolars. 
  The Slovene National Party (SNS), whose chairman is Zmago 
Jelincic, has more than 4,000 members. The SNS statute 
stipulates that to become a member of the party "one has to be a 
Slovene and a Slovene citizen, must feel like a Slovene, must 
agree with the SNS statute, and not have been a member of the 
League of Communists of Slovenia or Yugoslavia." The last 
requirement can be waived by the SNS Presidency, according to 
DNEVNIK. Membership in other parties is not allowed. The monthly 
dues are to 200 tolars for persons who are employed; the 
unemployed, retirees, and students pay 50 tolars a month. 
  The Slovene National Right (SND), whose chairman is Saso 
Lapa, has about 1,000 card-carrying members organized in five 
provincial committees; each provincial committee is composed of 
eight regional committees. According to Saso Lapa, there are six 
requirements for becoming an SND member: "One must be a Slovene, 
behave like a Slovene, feel like a Slovene, and accept our 
culture, traditions, and rules of the game." One must never have 
belonged to the Communist Party or the League of Communists and 
never held an office in the Socialist Alliance or Socialist 
Youth League. Party dues are 100 tolars per month. 
  DNEVNIK lists three additional minor parties which do not 
have seats in parliament: the Freedom Party with 500 members, 
the Forward Workers Party in Idrija with 100 members, and the 
Slovene Christian Socialists with 150 members. They are 
preparing to merge into a "new, left-oriented Social Democratic 
Party."

    [Editorial Report] "Intensive" talks between Slovenia and 
Croatia have resulted in the signing by the Slovene and Croatian 
prime ministers, Janez Drnovsek and Nikica Valentic, of a 
package of agreements on cooperation in various fields (Zagreb 
Radio, 7 February). According to the 25 March Maribor daily 
VECER, seven of these Slovene-Croatian agreements were ratified 
by the Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly on 24 March. 
  Describing the proceedings in the Croatian Assembly, VECER 
reports that agreements on maritime fishing, reciprocal 
implementation of court decisions, legal aid to citizens, 
establishment and authority of joint bodies to examine and 
delineate borders, economic and trade relations and cooperation, 
employment, and cooperation in culture and education were 
adopted without debate. One deputy, the paper reports, raised 
the issue of layoffs of Croats working in Slovenia and another, 
a representative of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community 
[HDZ], requested an explanation regarding the rights of Croats 
living in Slovenia. Croats in Slovenia do not have the status of 
an ethnic minority, VECER points out, and are therefore not 
entitled to rights, such as education in their native language, 
granted to the recognized minorities: Italians and Hungarians. 
An article in the 31 March issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK 
analyzing Croatian-Slovene economic relations comments that the 
joint commission of the two countries' Chambers of Commerce "is 
not active enough." The article reports that this was also the 
opinion of a Slovene economic delegation headed by Vojka Ravbar, 
state secretary of the Ministry for Economic Relations and 
Development, that visited Zagreb in March to discuss "unresolved 
questions" of bilateral trade. Explaining the decline in 
bilateral trade, the Slovene delegation stated that Slovene 
firms had been looking elsewhere for partners, because of cases 
in which Croatian firms had failed to fulfill contractual 
obligations. The delegation cited the lack of an agreement on a 
free trade zone as another negative factor in economic 
relations, noting that Slovenia had signed such agreements with 
the Czech and Slovak Republics and was in the process of doing 
so with Hungary. The latter agreement was signed on 6 April, 
according to a Budapest Kossuth Radio report of the same day. 
  Judging by the statements of the Slovene delegation, VJESNIK 
concluded, the two sides agree that problems with 
denationalization and privatization had "slowed" economic 
development in both countries and contributed to problems in 
bilateral trade. The sides reported "dissatisfaction" with the 
state of bilateral trade and viewed the "politicization" of 
economic problems as especially detrimental to cooperation. An 
analysis of Slovene-Croatian economic relations in the 29 
January issue of the major Ljubljana daily DELO reports that 
trade with Croatia had declined from $8.2 billion in 1990 to 
less than $1.5 billion in 1993. Croatia is Slovenia's 
third-largest trading partner, following Germany and Italy; 
Slovenia holds the same rank among Croatia's trading partners. 
Trade is unbalanced, however, DELO notes, with Slovenia having a 
"considerable" trade surplus with Croatia. In spite of such 
negative trends, the paper observes, Slovene economists view 
trade with Croatia as important to Slovenia's own economic 
well-being. In this context, DELO cites economist Dr. Franjo 
Stiblar's observation that "Croatia remains an important and 
interesting trading partner for us... and it is to be hoped that 
Croatia will succeed in stabilizing its economy, since that 
would also have a favorable effect on the revival of Slovenia's."

  [Text] Budapest, 21 April (MTI) -- "If elected, the 
Socialists would choose the Alliance of Free Democrats and the 
Federation of Young Democrats as partners for coalition talks," 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] acting deputy chairman Imre 
Szekeres said in response to a reporter's question in Budapest 
on Thursday [21 April]. 
  "Only after knowing the election results can the MSZP think 
about (always assuming it is even in a position to) with whom to 
form a coalition," he added and cited four criteria for such a 
decision: Compatibility of party programs and an agreement on 
concrete government tasks for the first six months; consensus on 
the new government's composition and style; agreement to 
conclude a social pact; and partners' ability to create a 
constructive relationship with the opposition.

  [Text] Szczecin, April 22 -- President Lech Walesa paying a 
several-hour visit to Szczecin said that this visit is not the 
start of his election campaign but a "wise campaign of balance." 
  Asked if he intends to run for presidency if the Non-Party 
Reform Bloc (BBWR) wins the June 19 local elections, the 
president replied: "There are still the parliamentary 
elections," and explained that he would have to have "executive 
capabilities" to implement his programme. 
  Following a meeting with supporters and members of the BBWR, 
the president met with the Szczecin-Kamien metropolitan, 
Archbishop Marian Przykucki. 
  Next the president left for a local military unit for a 
meeting with officers and representatives of police, border 
guards and fire fighters.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 22 -- Ombudsman Tadeusz Zielinski was 
applauded by deputies in the Sejm on Friday when he told them 
that a country in which some amass unbelievable fortunes while 
others live on the edge of poverty "is not only an unjust 
country but is also undemocratic. Such a country has nothing in 
common with modern capitalism." He was making his ombudsmans 
report to parliament on the year 1993. 
  Zielinski saw the main deficiency in the process of 
improving 
the legal rights of Polish citizens as being the delay in 
passing a new constitution. He emphatically disagreed with 
those who thought that Poland could not afford to guarantee 
social and economic security, explaining that in constitutional 
legislation basic human rights could not be ignored because of a 
temporary crisis. 
  Referring to the letters that were sent to his office 
Zielinski said Poland was not a just country and would certainly 
not be one for a long time. As proof of his claim Zielinski 
listed rising unemployment, worsening health care, the failure 
to guarantee minimum housing requirements and above all the lack 
of a guaranteed social minimum income. 
  In Zielinski's view ideological conflicts were still going 
on 
in Poland. As an example he said that lawyers who wanted to 
freely state their opinions on the legal consequences of the 
concordat with the Vatican were unfairly accused of having an 
unfriendly attitude to the church. This was anologous to 
lawyers in communist times being expected to adopt an apologetic 
stance towards legislation passed in those days. 
  Zielinski said that nothing sowed so much mistrust in the 
public where the state was concerned as legislative impotence. 
Laws were passed which could not be executed because of 
insufficient finances. 
  Zielinski stressed that in the second year of his term in 
office he had not noted any important infringements of political 
rights such as freedom of assembly or the freedom to join trade 
unions. The removal of censorship meant that the right of free 
expression was being observed. However many newspapers were 
reluctant to correct false information. 
  A member of the parliamentary justice committee, Wojciech 
Lamentowicz, said that Zielinski's speech had been "a job very 
well done". This was proof of the ombudsman's office being 
staffed by courageous and thoughtful people, he added.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- "The Government of 
Romania, in whose programme the integration in the Euro-Atlantic 
political, strategic and economic structures is a basic 
component of its foreign policy, has expressed with clarity, 
ever since the signing of the European association agreement, 
through the authorised voice of its prime minister, Romania's 
option for progressive development and consolidation of its 
relations with the European Union, a course apt to eventually 
lead to its joining the union as a full member of this," runs a 
declaration by the Romanian Government, presented at the 20 
April press conference of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. 
  "The recommendations and decisions of the European councils 
in Edinburgh and Copenhagen, and the measures recently approved 
by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the `12', which, by their 
contents exceed the framework settled through the association 
agreements, mark a new stage in the development of growingly 
closer political and economic ties between the European Union 
and its associated partners from Central and Eastern Europe, 
reflecting, at the same time, a greater interest on the part of 
our community partners in supporting the latter's efforts of 
nearing and integrating in this European body. 
  "The Romanian Government has welcomed with outmost 
satisfaction these decisions which sanction, among other things, 
the principle of undifferential treatment of all associated 
partners, and which are capable to assure them that the process 
of their integration in the European Union -- a common target of 
both parties -- will follow its normal course, a rising course, 
free from influence from circumstantial situations. 
  "As far as Romania is concerned, we are fully aware that 
integration in the European Union is a complex process that 
requires time, especially in respect of alignment to European 
legislation and standards, of reaching the necessary level of 
economic performance. on the other hand, we must not forget that 
the European Union itself is still evolving and even 
reconsidering its institutional mechanisms, as required by the 
implementation of the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and by 
the widening of Union membership with four new West European 
states. 
  "The Romanian Government's view is that a document of such 
importance, as the application for admission to the European 
Union is, must take in consideration all these realities and 
occur when the conditions are met for starting effective 
negotiations, with the due consideration of interests and 
implications concerning both sides. 
  "While reasserting its firm option for the adherence to the 
European Union, the Government of Romania is sure that, by 
converging efforts of all political forces and segments of the 
Romanian society, the required performance levels can be 
reached, including those of economic nature, apt to make it 
possible for this country to fully accede to the status of union 
member in an as close as possible perspective. 
  "In the present stage, the Romanian Government pursues in 
its 
relations with the European Union the following objectives: the 
completion as soon as possible of the procedures for the 
ratification of the European agreement; the fulfilment by both 
sides of the commitments made under the association agreement; 
the obtainment of greater support from the European Union for 
the process of reform and for the reaching of standards as 
required for by integration purposes; amplifying the efforts for 
bringing domestic legislation in harmony with community 
legislation; the participation in all the great continental 
infrastructure projects; the active participation in the 
bilateral and multilateral political dialogue by capitalising 
all the opportunities offered by the association agreement and 
the decisions made subsequently at community level."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/4/1994 -- Foreign Ministry 
Spokesman Mircea Geoana made a few points on news items in the 
Romanian media on the Romanian-Hungarian treaty, during a news 
conference he held in Bucharest on 20 April. The news items 
claimed that "sources at the Foreign Ministry and the presidency 
said that, pursuant to U.S. and NATO pressures, the basic 
Romanian-Hungarian political treaty will be signed by 1 July, 
1994." 
  Mircea Geoana denied the existence of such an understanding 
and said that as far as Romania was concerned, it was interested 
to conclude the political treaty with Hungary the soonest. 
"Even before the Paris conference or 26-27 May, when the 
`stability' pact initiated by Balladur is launched, we would 
like to do it," said Mircea Geoana. He added that Hungary has 
not stated its stand on the proposals advanced long ago by the 
Romanian Foreign Ministry regarding the outstanding issues. "If 
we got an answer and were able to agree on a new round of 
negotiations, this would be a positive element in the actuation 
of the Romanian-Hungarian political dialogue," he said. 
  Regarding the issue of lifting the embargo against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, "from what we know this is not 
envisaged for now" -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana 
said, referring to the "official launch" of the joint demarche 
of Greece, Bulgaria and Romania in this respect. The Foreign 
Ministry spokesman said such a demarche ought to be made at the 
right time, when the process of political negotiations reaches a 
congenial stage. "In keeping with the evolution of the 
negotiations between the Bosnian conflicting parties, a decision 
will be analyzed and made by all parties concerned", he said, 
adding that Hungary showed interest in the demarche, while 
Ukraine did not state its stand. 
  The idea of a joint demarche of Greece, Bulgaria and Romania 
for the lifting of the embargo on the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia was launched during the Bucharest visit by the Greek 
foreign minister a few weeks ago. The initiative pursues the 
easing of the negative effects emerged following the application 
of the UN sanctions by the countries neighbouring ex-Yugoslavia. 
  The prime minister of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Jacques 
Smiter, will make an official visit in Romania over April 24-26 
at the invitation of the Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu, the Romanian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said. 
  The agenda of the visit includes official talks with the 
Romanian premier, interviews with Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu, Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Chamber of Deputies 
Speaker Adrian Nastase. 
  On the occasion of the visit, an inter-governmental 
agreement 
of cooperation in the fields of culture, education, science and 
sport will be signed. 
  The postponement of the signing of the basic political 
treaty 
between Romania and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, first 
scheduled to take place while Yugoslav Federal President Zoran 
Lilic was in Romania for the Crans Montana Forum, stirred the 
interest of the journalists who attended the Foreign Ministry 
briefing on 20 April. Confirming President Lilic would not 
attend the Forum because of the tense situation in Bosnia, 
Mircea Geoana said the official document would be signed only 
after the two parties agreed on all issues. "It is an important 
political document with a neighbour state, that has to fall in 
line with the whole of the political treaties Romania is 
concluding with other states of the world," he added. "It is 
not to be achieved upon conjunctural bases, statuting instead 
the format of bilateral relations in all spheres." 
  Referring to the conflict in Gorazde, the Romanian Foreign 
Ministry spokesman reiterated Romania's constant stand relying 
upon the principle of using the whole range of 
political-diplomatic means to induce the conflicting parties to 
go on negotiating. "We follow with worry the events in Gorazde 
and see the high rate of contacts and statements by all parties 
concerned, which leaves room for optimism," Geoana said.

  [Text] Bratislava April 21 (CTK) -- With its dismissal of 
26 district mayors, the government of Jozef Moravcik has started 
large-scale purges reminiscent of the 1950's, chairman of the 
opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) Jan Slota told 
journalists today. 
  The government dismissed the 26 mayors on Tuesday [19 April] 
on charges of disloyalty and professional inadequacy. The 
mayors had signed a statement condemning President Michal 
Kovac's speech of March 19 in which he criticised the then 
premier, Vladimir Meciar. 
  The SNS considers the government's approach to be a threat 
to 
democracy, and this was something especially serious in view of 
the coming elections (September 30-October 1), Deputy Chairman 
Eva Slavkovska said. 
  Slavkovska admitted that it was not usual for a state 
official to criticise the head of state. However, she stressed, 
"it is not usual either for the president to destablilise the 
domestic situation in his own state." Kovac's speech is 
generally considered to have provided the impulse for the 
dismissal by parliament of Meciar and his government. 
  Slota forecast that after changes in the leadership of the 
National Property Fund and the Supreme Control Office and the 
dismissal of the mayors, there would follow purges in the 
economic sphere above all, where the government parties would 
want to influence privatisation and finance. These changes 
would upset the Slovak economy further, he said. "I believe this 
state has now actually collapsed and will only go on through 
inertia," he added. 
  "We have a long way to go to democracy, even if our ears are 
full of it," Slota said.

  [Text] Bratislava April 21 (CTK) -- The directors of the 
district offices consider the decision by the Slovak Government 
to dismiss 26 of them an "awkward governmental farce," Frantisek 
Gaulieder, director of Galanta, South Slovakia, district office, 
told journalists today. 
  On March 19, the Slovak Government decided to remove 26 out 
of 38 directors of district offices for having signed a 
statement against the parliamentary speech by President Michal 
Kovac who criticised former Premier Vladimir Meciar. 
  The statement accused Kovac of gross offences against 
parliamentary democracy, malicious and false accusation against 
Meciar, expedient destabilisation of the political situation and 
discredit to the previous government. 
  The directors hold the view that Deputy Premier Roman Kovac 
proved by his arguments and positive attitude to their dismissal 
that he was incompetent to perform his post. As a result, he 
should contemplate his resignation from Moravcik's cabinet. 
  The directors consider their dismissal to be a political 
step. Some of them claim that the Interior Ministry attempted 
"moral corruption" because the state secretary, Roman Vavrik, 
who participated in appointing them, offered in private 
conversation that they can remain in their positions provided 
they resign from the HZDS (Meciar's Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia). 
  The director hold the view that if Slovakia's interests are 
jeopardised, they can make a statement. A director stated that 
Slovakia was not yet a stable democracy and the directors did 
not break any law by their criticism of Kovac's speech. "What is 
not forbidden, is allowed," he said.

  [Text] Bratislava April 20 (CTK) -- "I was assured in the 
USA and Canada that Slovakia was viewed as any other European 
state," Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told journalists today. 
He returned from a week-long visit overseas. 
  Kukan noted that in the past Slovakia had been omitted when 
the applicants for European integration were mentioned. "I was 
repeatedly convinced that this would not happen as Slovakia was 
considered an equal member of the international community, while 
no difference is made between Slovakia and Poland, Hungary and 
other European states," he added. 
  Kukan confirmed he was interested in establishing the 
Canadian Embassy in Slovakia. He assured the journalists that 
the non-existence of the embassy was not linked to the Quebec 
issue, but it was a question of money. 
  The Canadian Government will either accredit its Viennese 
ambassador to Bratislava, or transfer the consular part of its 
Prague embassy to Vienna, Kukan reported. 
  "We have scored lots of points," Kukan commented on the 
Slovak offer to train the Pakistani troops of the UN 
peace-keeping forces for Bosnia. He called naive the idea that 
the Slav states should present their own initiative to resolve 
the Bosnian conflict. "Let us be realistic, we have no means of 
forcing the Serbs to return to the negotiating table," he stated.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 21 (CTK) -- The Democratic Union 
of Slovakia (DEUS) will support small and medium-sized 
businesses, strive for the acceleration of privatisation, the 
maintenance of microeconomic stability and the speeding up 
restructuring in the Slovak economy, Slovak Deputy Premier Roman 
Kovac said today. 
  Speaking to journalists, Kovac said that DEUS was to be 
founded on April 23 through a merger of the government parties 
Alliance of Democrats (AD) of Milan Knazko and the Alternative 
of Political Realism (APR), the leadership of which includes, 
besides Kovac himself, Premier Jozef Moravcik. 
  Referring to DEUS's programme of economic transformation, 
Knazko said that certain of its principles were in general more 
similar to the Czech variant of transformation than to "what has 
been called economic transformation in the past 21 months 
(during the previous government of Vladimir Meciar, which fell 
in mid-March)". Differences between DEUS's programme and the 
Czech one lie in Slovakia's changed situation after it became 
independent on January 1, 1993, Knazko added. 
  Kovac said that DEUS would stress the right of citizens as 
the only people who can decide on the country's problems. DEUS 
will also strive to secure the economic development in Slovakia, 
as well as the development of the educational level. "A state 
which does not understand how important the education is, loses 
its chance to compete with the advanced world," Kovac said. 
  Reacting to the description of DEUS as a liberal party to 
the 
right of the centre, Kovac said that "there exists one 
millimetre distance to the right of the centre as well". 
  On the forthcoming merger of the AD and the APR, Knazko said 
that "it is a merger following on from certain political 
experiences." He said that the deputies' group of the two 
parties was today joined by a new member. However, he declined 
to give his name. "He will certainly announce it himself," 
Knazko said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Egon T. Lansky: "How Bad Can Things Get in </F>
Slovakia? Well, Don't Expect Any Improvement"] 
  [Text] Within the last four years, since the Communists 
turned capitalists, Slovakia has turned into a country that 
truly deserves the name "Absurdistan." Much of the credit for 
this dubious way of "visualizing" Slovakia belongs to Vladimir 
Meciar, the recently deposed Slovak leader who, as premier and 
interior minister, has been either at the helm or nearby since 
1989. But it would be wrong not to acknowledge the contribution 
of nearly all the politicians in Slovakia who have aspired for 
some room at the top level of decision-making. 
  Take Jan Carnogursky, the Christian Democrat and former 
dissident who, as a fundamentalist and nationalist, supported 
for quite some time the liberally oriented defenders of 
Czechoslovakia. At the same time, he stubbornly pursued his idea 
of "Slovakia's own little star and chair" within the structures 
of European politics. 
  As head of the Slovak government during the final years of 
Czechoslovakia, Carnogursky was the true creator of the 
impossible idea of Slovakia as a sovereign subject of 
international law and simultaneously part of Czechoslovakia. In 
his 1992 campaign, Meciar successfully planted this idea into 
the minds of a large part of Slovakia's electorate, which 
ultimately led to the end of Czechoslovakia. 
  Or take such outstanding stalwarts of Meciar as Milan Knazko 
and Jozef Moravcik, without whom Meciar hardly would have 
returned to power in 1992. Both served as foreign ministers; 
both were fired by Meciar. Both are today leaders of small 
splinter groups from the original Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS); both have lost most of their credibility in the 
eyes of potential coalition partners. 
  The same goes for Slovak President Michal Kovac, a one-time 
Communist turned Catholic nationalist, who turned against Meciar 
in the name of democracy. Or Peter Weiss, whose 
Communists-turned-Social Democrats (which is OK, almost) have 
helped Meciar attain and maintain power, first by cautiously 
maneuvering with middle-of-the-road nationalist policies, and 
then by continuing to negotiate with both the government and the 
opposition to find out whether it would be more opportune to 
support the government or to bring it crashing down. 
  The true nationalists at first supported Meciar silently, 
refusing to enter a coalition while their leader was a member of 
the Cabinet. They then signed a coalition treaty in order to 
obtain some fat posts within the government, even though it 
meant ridding themselves of their own leader, who in the 
meantime had a personal conflict with the premier, who had 
accused him of fraud. 
  So Slovak Parliament now has another splinter group of 
slightly less nationalist nationalists, not to mention various 
individual defectors and dropouts from the so-called Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia, until recently the party in power. 
  As a result of these assorted defections, splits and 
personal 
animosities, the coalition of the ultra-nationalist portion of 
the nationalist party with the HZDS of Meciar managed to stay in 
power. Not in their own right, since they have been in a growing 
minority for quite some time, but thanks to the deep discord 
among the opposition parties and groups. 
  Obviously, uniting against Meciar was not enough, and the 
lines dividing Communists and anti-Communists, nationalists and 
democrats (the few there are), as well as ultra-nationalists, 
Catholic nationalists and less nationalist nationalists, often 
run across rather than between political groups. Not to mention 
the Hungarians, whom everyone needs but few want to cooperate 
with. 
  At the end of the day, it was the president who forced the 
Parliament to its final effort: a vote of no-confidence in 
Meciar. He accused Meciar of serious mismanagement to the point 
of using the privatization process as a tool to fill the coffers 
of his own party, an accusation which in a Western country would 
be enough to bring a politician not only to his downfall but to 
court. The last straw, though, was the speech by the premier 
himself, demonstrating what Knazko, once one of Meciar's 
staunchest allies, has called Meciar's ability to "use a lie as 
a working method." 
  It is a measure of the irrationality of Slovak politics that 
with divisions and animosities as deep as described, chances are 
that even new elections will not bring a decisive change toward 
a stable, more democratic and, above all, viable government. 
  No matter who is going to constitute the future transition 
government, at best it can merely stabilize the social situation 
and organize early elections. Outside of the present Parliament 
there are, even after the recent mergers, at least two groups of 
democratic politicians partly bickering with one another. 
  Considering the complete lack of both political vision and 
personalities, chances are that what we will see in Slovakia 
after the elections is a weak government that is incapable of 
tackling the serious social and economic problems. It is 
possible that Meciar could return to power. 
  I am not sure which of the two alternatives is worse. But 
then, as my fellow commentator in the Austrian daily DIE PRESSE 
says, to analyze Slovak politics one needs a psychologist, not a 
political analyst. I would even say a psychiatrist.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, April 20 (CTK) -- The change in the 
leadership of the News Agency of the Slovak Republic (TA SR) was 
not caused by bad-quality work on the news desks but by the 
daily REPUBLIKA which it publishes, the new general director of 
TA SR Ivan Melichercik says in an interview for SME today. 
  The role and character of a news agency was not compatible 
with the publication of a paper of this type, Melichercik said, 
adding that REPUBLIKA had no place on the agency's soil. Asked 
if he was considering the departure of the paper's editors from 
the TA SR building, he replied "I think they'll do it 
themselves." 
  Former TA SR director Dusan Kleiman, who was dismissed 
yesterday by the Slovak Government, says in today's issue of 
REPUBLIKA that he considers his dismissal a "political, 
undemocratic act of administrative caprice." 
  Kleiman attacks the government's decision, which he says 
came 
before he could appear in front of the Slovak National Council's 
Committee for Education, Science, and Culture. It shows that 
the government did not need facts and objective investigation of 
the paper's publishing to make its decision, Kleiman says, 
adding that the act of his dismissal was a politically motivated 
purge against the paper. 
  SLOVENSKY DENNIK publishes a statement by Vladimir Miskovsky 
from the National Democratic Party-New Alternative which 
analyzes in detail the legal and economic aspects of REPUBLIKA. 
He says the weekly TREND pointed last May that in publishing 
REPUBLIKA the agency was breaching both the law and Finance 
Ministry decrees, but nonetheless the paper continued to appear. 
"It is the publication of REPUBLIKA above all which has caused 
the agency to owe Danubiaprint 18.5 million crowns, and analysis 
of the agency's economic results shows that under its current 
leadership the agency has had the worst results of all," 
Miskovsky says. 
  REPUBLIKA organized a collection to improve its financial 
situation, but this cannot be carried out without permission 
from the Finance Ministry, which TA SR did not ask for. The 
unauthorized collection took place all over Slovakia, and 
therefore the publisher could receive a fine of up to 200,000 
crowns ($6,600) from each area. 
  Miskovsky also points out that although REPUBLIKA was 
evaluated at 10 million crowns ($300,000), Kleiman agreed on 
March 18 with the free transfer of the publishing rights to the 
then editor-in-chief of the paper, Jan Smolec. "It is worth 
noting that for ten days the agency managed the newspaper of a 
private person, without even informing its business partners of 
the transfer of publishing rights," Miskovsky said (the rights 
were transferred back ten days later). 
  "If personnel changes take place in the leadership of TA SR, 
they cannot be called political purges but an attempt to find 
people for the top of the agency who would run it 
professionally," Miskovsky added. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bratislava April 20 (CTK) -- New Director General 
of the Slovak News Agency TA SR Ivan Melichercik singled out 
improving news services as his major task in an interview with 
CTK today. 
  "News services must be given absolute priority and the rest 
is nothing but a parasite, including publishing activities," 
stressed Melichercik who replaced Dusan Kleiman yesterday. 
  But he said that not the quality of the services, but "the 
case of the daily REPUBLIKA" had led the government to change 
the agency's director. 
  REPUBLIKA, the sole national paper supporting the current 
opposition led by ex-premier Vladimir Meciar, ran into a loss of 
18 million crowns (about 545,454 USD) last year. The law does 
not allow organisations partially funded from the state budget, 
which is the case of TA SR, to engage in business activities 
ending at a loss. 
  "It is clear that a paper of this type cannot exist on the 
soil of an agency which is striving for maximum objectivity and 
impartiality," Melichercik stressed. He added that 
privatisation of REPUBLIKA would solve the problem. 
  But Melichercik said this may take a long time because the 
debt plus the title's value of 13.5 million crowns made up the 
purchasing price and no prospective buyer had appeared as yet. 
  TA SR now has a staff of 350, including 130 journalists 30 
of 
whom work for REPUBLIKA. 15 correspondents work in regions and 
eight abroad, including two in Prague and one in Brno, South 
Moravia. The home and the sports desks each publish about 80 
news items per day, the foreign desk about 130, the economics 
desk 60 and the export desk 20-30. 
  Melichercik said he wanted to increase the number of 
staffers 
in the home and foreign desks and "to part with those who have 
not mastered agency work." 
  He said he regretted that cooperation with CTK had not been 
established yet while TA SR was cooperating with all agencies 
from the other neighbouring states. 
  But Melichercik added he was pleased with today's proposal 
from CTK Director General Milan Stibral to meet soon.

  [Text] Bratislava April 21 (CTK) -- Support for the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has risen by eight 
percent since March, meaning that if elections were held today 
they would win, with 32 percent of the vote, according to a poll 
taken in the first ten days of April by the Slovak Statistical 
Office. 
  Until the middle of March, when the government of HZDS 
Chairman Vladimir Meciar was dismissed, the HZDS was the 
governing party in Slovakia, in coalition with the Slovak 
National Party (SNS). The coalition has now gone into 
opposition. 
  Second would come the Democratic Left Party (SDL) with 13 
percent (14 percent in March) and third the Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH) with eight percent, as in March. 
  The Egyutteles-Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
(MKDH) 
would gain seven percent (nine percent in March) as would 
Premier Jozef Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism (APR). 
  Parties need five percent of the vote to enter parliament. 
The SNS has gone down from five to four percent, the Democratic 
Party (DS) from four to three percent, and the Green Party of 
Slovakia (SZS) from three to two percent as have the Alliance of 
Democrats (due to merge with the APR this weekend.) 
  Two new parties, Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic 
Party-New Alternative (NDS-NOA) and the Association of Workers 
of Slovakia (SDS) would also win two votes [as received] each. 
  Other parties would only win three percent of the vote 
together, a fairly large fall from last month when they would 
have received 15 percent. The number who do not know what they 
would vote stands at 12 percent, one down from March. 76 
percent say they would definitely or probably take part in 
elections if they were to be held this month, four percent more 
than in March. 
  The results mean that the HZDS-SNS coalition would receive 
36 
percent, the parties of the left-wing, SDL-SDSS-SZS, 18 percent 
and the right-of-centre parties 22 percent. The Hungarian 
minority parties would receive seven percent of the vote. 
  Elections will be held on September 30-October 1.

  [Text] Prishtina, April 20 (ATA) -- The Serb Government is 
closing down the private shops of Albanians because they do not 
want to change the inscriptions in Albanian language on their 
shops. Serbs have demanded from them to put the inscriptions in 
the Cyrillic alphabet. They also want to change the name of 
Ferizaj to Uroshevac, which is a Serb name.

<F P=106> [Speech by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to the Crans Montana </F>
Forum in Bucharest -- live, in Arabic with simultaneous 
translation into Romanian] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. Chairman of the conference: Please 
allow me to express my joy and satisfaction with my 
participation in this important international colloquium which 
reunites the elite of politicians, thinkers, and economic 
experts from various countries and continents. 
  The importance of this colloquium lies in the fact that it 
is 
a rostrum from which we will exchange ideas and we will 
deepen....[interpreter fades out] As you know, an international 
forum was organized over these days in Marakesh by the 
organization, the new world organization of commerce, and there 
they raised the issue of building a new world as we are entering 
a new century. It is necessary that we should act in the spirit 
of international justice, righteousness, and equality, and of 
not living in.... 
  [Announcer] There seem to be problems with the interpreter's 
microphone. The PLO chairman is referring to the struggle to 
fight the crises that are tormenting the world, creating 
explosive situations, and which led to local and regional wars, 
the phenomenon of hunger threatening to make whole nations 
disappear, and catastrophes threatening to make our planet 
perish. Large-scale blocs, large-scale groupings have emerged, 
which ignore the interests of....[announcer ends] 
  As far as our region, the Middle East region, is concerned, 
over the past half-century it faced many long-lasting and bloody 
conflicts and wars. We have now reached the threshold of a new 
era in that region, after having signed, together with the 
Israeli Government, the declaration of principles at the White 
House in Washington on 13 September 1993. That declaration was 
to be followed by the signing of other accords, in Cairo, in 
view of the implementation of the accord convened by the 
declaration. As you know, currently negotiations are taking 
place both in Cairo and in Paris. We consider that the 
continuation of negotiations has to be something that is 
progressing because the accord we have already concluded is a 
first necessary step on the road toward peace, the road that 
began in Madrid in 1991. 
  We have to open a new chapter, a new era in the Middle East 
region, based on peaceful coexistence and good neighborly 
relations, on cooperation, and the settlement of all conflicts 
by peaceful solutions, by dialogue and wisdom. We have to reach 
a stage....[pauses] In this sense we had many contacts with the 
Israeli Government, in various places: in Washington, Oslo, 
Paris, Davos, and Cairo. Besides the multilateral negotiations 
that took place in several capital cities of the world. 
  Today we meet at this international forum in Bucharest, the 
capital city of Romania, this country that was among the first 
ones to act vigorously and forward constructive proposals and 
creative initiatives aimed at achieving a just peace in the 
Middle East region and at finding a solution by negotiations and 
a just peace for the cause of [word indistinct]. 
  Since I arrived in Bucharest I have held talks, important 
and 
constructive talks, with His Excellency President Ion Iliescu, 
the president of friendly Romania. We approached issues related 
to strengthening of the peace process and ensuring its success 
by the implementation of the accords signed by the PLO and the 
Government of Israel. [words indistinct] attempt of His 
Excellency, what he had done, in this meeting between me and His 
Excellency Mr. Peres. We have to thank him with all our hearts. 
Thank you, thank you, thank you! 
  Mr. Chairman, ladies, and gentlemen, you doubtlessly share 
our opinion, according to which our region is one of the most 
important ones in the world and that it is a very sensitive one. 
There are very important energy resources there. That is very 
important for the great consumer markets, besides the strategic 
position of our region as a link in the chain linking Europe, 
Africa and Asia. Ancient Palestine, as you know, was the center 
of that region, where the Magreb and Mashrek, that is, the East 
and the West of the Arab world, met, where the three largest 
monotheist religions, the Mosaic, the Christian, and the Islamic 
ones met. They have spread over the world transmitting the 
message of love and the call for peace, cooperation, and 
brotherhood among all nations, regardless of their color, ethnic 
character, or sex. That is our deep conviction, and we assure 
you that the Palestinian people will continue to bear that 
humane message, especially considering that our people is one of 
the peoples that suffered most, that was confronted with very 
brutal wars and conflicts on the political, economic, social, 
and other planes. 
  However, we do not wish to be past-oriented, but rather to 
turn our experience to good account so that our people should 
exert its right to self-determination and the right to return to 
the territory of its homeland. The hope of our people is to 
build a new Palestine, a free country of the Palestinian people. 
The hope of our people is its right to erect an economy 
functioning on the basis of mechanisms able to make up for what 
happened during the occupation period. The hope of our people 
is to achieve security and safety for us and for all the peoples 
and states in the region, distant from any violence, 
violence-countering violence, and any other such reactions. Our 
hope is peaceful coexistence and cooperation on the basis of 
justice and welfare, progress, stability, and peace. 
  Mr. Chairman, ladies, and gentlemen, you doubtlessly wish 
to learn about the current idea, the configuration of the 
Palestinian economic, social, and political construction that we 
hope to be able to erect and for which we are acting on the 
basis of Palestinian national security. 
  Our regime will be based on the principles of democracy, 
political pluralism, and the freedom to set up parties, on 
nondiscrimination in public rights and freedoms, 
nondiscrimination among religions, ethnic groups, or skin 
colors, and nondiscrimination between males and females, on the 
basis of a constitution that stipulates the sovereignty of 
independent righteousness and justice, the observance of the 
human rights and democratic freedoms, and the erection of a free 
market. Such are the foundations on the basis of which we have 
begun to set up our national institutions, such as the Palestine 
Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, the 
elaboration of the systems, laws, and regulations by which we 
intend to achieve the infrastructure and develop it. We will 
also take the private sector into consideration so that it would 
play an important and fundamental frontline role in the boosting 
of economy in all sectors and especially in the sectors of 
production, tourism, and services. 
  We have already begun to elaborate all the aforementioned 
systems, laws, and regulations that open the way for the 
promotion of the private sector that is to play a vital role. 
We have Palestinian national economic development programs that 
have been drafted for a period of seven years, that is, for the 
1994-2000 period. The first two years are dedicated to the 
normalization of economy, to its reconstruction, and to the 
development of the infrastructure, while the following five 
years are intended for the development process, in which we hope 
to achieve an adequate growth to offer to the Palestinian 
individuals the prosperity and the stability they are craving 
for, and to achieve such prosperity after they have suffered 
occupation and constraint for such a long time. 
  The sum of the investments necessary for the Palestinian 
development plan is assessed at $13.045 billion. By those 
investments we intend to develop the institutions and the 
resumption of development, the reequipment and the modernization 
of the infrastructure [words indistinct] 
  We are convinced that we will be able to surmount all 
difficulties we will be faced with while accomplishing those 
projects, and we will salute everyone who gives us a hand, 
intending to help us and cooperate with us. We will positively 
respond, and we have positively responded when 44 states pledged 
to help us at the international conference, in October 1993, in 
Washington, of the countries that displayed readiness to offer 
us their help. Those states announced their pledge to offer us 
$2.2 billion. I wish to express my deep gratitude in the name 
of my people, our people, to all the states that have announced 
that they will observe that pledge. 
  However, I have to say that the aforementioned amount is far 
too little compared to the volume needed by the plan drafted by 
us for the development of our territory. That is why we are 
hoping for development assistance in the form of bilateral 
economic cooperation, regional economic cooperation, and 
especially the regional cooperation. I wish to state here that 
it is the right of the Middle East region, after such a long 
period of wars, to benefit from a Marshall Plan of a new type, 
to the well-being of our people, our peoples, and our countries. 
  We call upon the countries that offered to grant us help not 
to hesitate to give us the assistance needed by the Arab 
Palestinian territories, especially their development programs, 
their programs devised to set up their institutions, to create 
jobs, and also for the activity of the Palestinian Economic 
Council for Development and Reconstruction. 
  The Palestinian people, which has suffered much over long 
decades of oppression and persecution, because of the 
occupation, is firmly determined to exert its authority and will 
and to use its experience in the reconstruction and the 
development of its territory. 
  You know that during this forum, that in this new era we 
will 
be facing new responsibilities and major challenges both on the 
Palestinian plane and on [words indistinct] There will be the 
challenge questioning our institutions, such as the Palestinian 
security and police forces, the ensuring of the requirements 
needed to create an appropriate security and safety basis for 
the Palestinian citizens, and the ensuring of the stability and 
the development process, including all their dimensions, within 
the peace process. 
  To achieve economic and social development, one process has 
to be active and efficient: the training of our cadres in 
cooperation with international institutions and the group of 
countries that offered us assistance. 
  Currently, the great issue and responsibility is to complete 
the process of negotiations and especially the implementation of 
Security Council Resolution 904, which ensures our people's 
international protection, halts the terrorism coming from the 
Israeli settlers, and to proceed, with a sincere will, to engage 
in negotiations to lay down the foundations of just and global 
peace on the basis of international legality. 
  As far as our region is concerned, we are facing the 
challenge of achieving security conditions to ensure stability 
and peace, of laying down a foundation guaranteeing the 
elimination of any kinds of mass destruction weapons, and of 
achieving a basis for a peaceful regional cooperation, as a 
catalytic, boosting, and encouraging factor, to ensure stability 
and peace, based on equality, fair mutual conduct, reciprocity, 
the observance of human rights, and the use of creative talent 
to overcome obstacles still hindering the commercial flow and 
the circulation of individuals. 
  I outlined some of the broader ideas of our economic 
conception in the perspective of accomplishing direct national 
Palestinian authority following the conclusion of the first 
stage, that of the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from the 
Gaza and Jericho areas, in concord with the Palestinian-Israeli 
accord. 
  We hope and expect you to develop cooperation and 
collaboration with us, which will help us in achieving the goals 
established by our economic and social development plans drafted 
by the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and 
Reconstruction. 
  From this rostrum we clearly state that any postponements, 
any delays in the implementation of that accord, will not be 
beneficial for peace. Our way is menaced by extremists. They 
want to sabotage the peace process by triggering incidents that 
cause a great number of casualties. 
  I wish to emphasize once more our commitment to the peace 
process and to the accomplishment of a global and just peace, 
and our condemnation of all acts of violence, regardless of 
their source. The hour of peace has come and no one is allowed 
to ignore that truth, to maneuver or to speculate to the benefit 
of certain interests, in the same way as it is not allowed that 
certain interests, any interests should prevail over that of 
peace, of achieving peace.

<F P=106> [Speech by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres to the </F>
Crans Montana Forum in Bucharest -- live, in English with 
simultaneous translation into Romanian; translated from the 
Romanian] 
  [Text] Mr. Chairman, President Iliescu, Chairman Yasir 
'Arafat, Mr. Chairman of the Egyptian Assembly, ladies and 
gentlemen: When I took my first swimming lesson, my instructor 
told me the following: Look, try to cross the lake. If you 
cross 50 percent of the distance and you feel tired, do not 
return, continue swimming, because to finish the swim means less 
effort than to return. I have the feeling that Chairman 'Arafat 
and Mr. Rabin made the most efforts and as Churchill said, we 
are at the beginning of the end. 
  We are glad to be here in Bucharest. There is something 
about this town that makes Arabs and Israelis understand each 
other better here than in other places. [applause] 
  There is a precedent to this event. You know that this 
flirtation of ours started in Bucharest when former [Egyptian] 
President Sadat and President Begin [title as heard] had started 
negotiations and as a result of it peace with Egypt was 
achieved, which is very dear to our hearts and which was very 
highly regarded by the rest of the world. [applause] 
  I believe that in the same way, the fact that the chairman 
of 
the PLO, who represents the Palestinian people, and I are here 
and we are meeting, is not a simple coincidence. The conflict 
has lasted for 100 years. The Jewish people and the Palestinian 
people, two peoples that were born in the Middle East, are 
meeting in hopes of reviving themselves. 
  Unfortunately, instead of holding a favorable meeting and 
achieving an understanding, there was a bitter conflict, and not 
only there. The Palestinians are part of the Arab world and the 
Israelis are part of the Jewish world, and they meet on a small 
stretch of land where the conflict has become increasingly 
dangerous and terrible. We felt that our history is much more 
important than geography in order to solve problems. The 
conflict has continued and many young Arab people lost their 
lives. Many young Israelis lost their lives. Women and children 
were killed and their houses were destroyed. 
  It is not easy, within the middle of this history of hatred, 
suspicion, and dissatisfaction and among all the manifestations 
of extremism, weapons, arms, and guns, to try to rearrange the 
situation and reach a new understanding. If I may speak as a 
Jew, four months ago we signed an accord with the Vatican, with 
the Catholic world. This is an important diplomatic event that 
takes place once in 2000 years, but it happened indeed and the 
pope said that all of us -- Muslims, Jews, and Christians -- are 
Abraham's children. I told the pope that I believe that we are 
indeed Abraham's children but the journey that we have made cost 
us so much, my God, and I pray to the Lord, we do not want to 
create an accident in this journey. It is our wish to achieve a 
similar understanding with the Arab world. As you know, 
democracy is not only the right to be equal. Democracy is also 
the right to be different. We can be different and live in 
peace and understanding. 
  I know how difficult it was for Chairman 'Arafat to make 
this 
historic decision, while surrounded by this hatred and distrust 
in his leadership with so many demands. [words indistinct] a 
period in which the grand mufti of Jerusalem refused to offer 
his hand. I believe that for Chairman 'Arafat it was equally as 
difficult to offer his hand as it was for us. 
  And now we are trying something that one or two years ago 
seemed completely impossible. Allow me to make a remark in 
connection with the nature of the accord. What makes it so 
difficult are not only complications, the geographic layout, and 
national feelings and the interference of so many forces. What 
makes it so difficult is to draw permanent lines because we 
cannot establish a map under the current conditions. We are 
also talking about Europe now. The idea of sovereignty was 
introduced by the big thinkers of the world in the 17th century 
and since then all of them wanted clear borders, strong armies, 
strong customs barriers and each of them wanted to live in his 
own nest, separated from the rest of the world. Sovereignty 
justified walls, sovereignty justified armies and conflicts. 
But now we are trying to make things differently, following the 
example of the end of the Cold War. It is a unique step in 
diplomatic experience to try to establish new relations even 
before having permanent borders. 
  The big attempt on the part of the PLO and Israel is to be 
able to say: We agree, we do not have a permanent map yet, but 
we have a permanent goal, namely we have decided to start off on 
a journey from conflict to peace. But first of all, we agreed 
to start off together and create a new situation. The 
difficulties in our negotiations have two parts: When Mr. 
'Arafat is negotiating with us, we make difficulties for him, 
and when we negotiate with him, he makes other difficulties for 
us. But each party makes things look different. If each side 
had to negotiate with its own people there would be no problem. 
And they say, why do you make concessions, why are you so weak, 
why do you give in? And then again we have the third 
difficulty, and this difficulty lies in the fact that there is 
no precedent. We cannot go to a book, open it, consult it, and 
see how we can conclude peace between a movement that is called 
the PLO and a country that is called Israel, without deciding 
right away on sovereignty and borders. We want to achieve 
something new and promising and I believe it is both a moral and 
political decision. The Jewish people have never dominated 
another nation for 2000 years. We do not wish in our lifetime 
to dominate the lives of the Palestinian people. This is 
against our moral principles. [applause]. 
  Second, what the new age requires from us is to be separate 
from national viewpoints and to cooperate from an economic 
viewpoint. You can see what is happening in the Balkans, in 
Yugoslavia, and you know that in politics it is exactly like in 
your own kitchen. You can break eggs and make an omelet. But 
from an omelet you can no longer make a whole egg. Each 
politician has to be very careful not to make an omelet from 
each situation and create a situation in which nobody can live 
freely according to his wishes. On the other hand, let us 
cooperate from an economic point of view. As Chairman 'Arafat 
said, let us build an economic Benelux while each of us will 
follow his own path as people and nation. Thus we want not only 
to permit the Palestinian people to live in dignity, but to lead 
their own lives, choose their own leaders, and appoint their own 
judges and police. It is not our wish to be leaders, judges, 
and police officers of the Palestinian people. They have to 
lead their lives alone. But from an economic viewpoint, we wish 
to build a new Middle East. How should we do this? You know, 
the war has its own cost and the peace has its own price. The 
cost of the war for Europeans, for those in the Balkans, for the 
Russians is huge. In the Middle East in the past 10 years the 
countries of the Middle East have spent $1 trillion to purchase 
weapons, that is, $1,000 billion. There is no Marshall plan 
that could offer so much money and if we could reduce this 
[words indistinct].

<F P=106> [Question-and-answer session with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat </F>
and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by unidentified 
officials attending the Crans Montana Forum meeting in 
Bucharest; moderated by an unidentified official -- live; 
'Arafat speaks in English and Arabic, Peres in English and 
French, with simultaneous translation into Romanian] 
  [Text] [Moderator] The participants in the Crans Montana 
forum are going to ask questions of the two guests, PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat and and Shim'on Peres, minister of foreign affairs 
of the State of Israel. I see someone here on my right wanting 
to ask a question. 
  [Unidentified official] I would like to ask both Chairman 
'Arafat and Minister Peres a simple basic question, which 
requires not a complex answer but a sincere one. To what extent 
can we view the peace process as truly irreversible? In other 
words, will the peace process last and become reality, despite 
calls to replace the Palestinian leadership and the PLO or that 
of the Israelis? Can a 50-year-old person still hope to live to 
see the peace process succeed before he dies? Thank you for 
your consideration. 
  ['Arafat] Peace in the Middle East is not an expression or a 
newspaper article. There have been all these years of 
confrontations, particularly with regard to Palestine, which is 
the land of the three monotheistic religious, Judaism, 
Christianity, and Islam. Well, Palestine has long experienced 
war, throughout known history. I also ask myself the same 
question, since we are now facing this prolongation of 
negotiations and talks. 
  We keep negotiating and negotiating and have yet to achieve 
a 
basis on which to proceed with implementation of the agreement. 
Nothing can be achieved on paper alone, but rather in the 
field. Well, we do not know how long this process will take. 
Maybe tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the coming week, or the 
next month. There are no secrets. What we have agreed upon is 
on paper, with our signatures on it. We hope. We cannot say 
that it is within our power to give you the final decision. He 
must decide. He must say. My people and I are under Israeli 
occupation. They must decide whether they are going to withdraw 
or not. [applause] They have to decide whether they want to 
implement what has been agreed upon or not. I hope, from the 
bottom of my heart, that this will come to pass and I know that 
Mr. Peres has a very broad vision, but I also know that there 
are extremists, I know they exist, and I am very sincere about 
it all. Well, they must understand what this peace means. 
  Peace is a very precious goal for all of us, for our 
children 
and their children, and for our new generation and for their new 
generation. Peace is not only a Palestinian need. It is an 
Israeli need, a Russian need, an American need, and an 
international need. However, it is mainly a need for the Middle 
East, which is the most important strategic area in the whole 
world. If we do not achieve peace -- but we hope to achieve it, 
because the alternative is too horrible for words -- we will 
have complete confusion in our region and new Balkanization. 
This is not a joke. It is bloodshed, it could lead to further 
bloodshed. Therefore, from here, I call on Prime Minister Rabin 
and Mr. Peres, who have the upper hand, to look at the (?plight 
of those who have less power) and withdraw. [applause] 
  [Peres] To answer your question, I must admit that 50 is a 
pretty dangerous age. If you survive it, you have already 
accomplished something. However, to answer your question 
frankly, even if the Palestinians want to change something or 
the Israelis want to change the world, well, the world is 
irreversible and we cannot really change it. This is a new 
world, and we must enter it, since the new world will not follow 
us. What is the new world? The Cold War is finished, 
therefore, there is no one left around to finance cold wars. 
Likewise, communism collapsed. Many of the Middle East 
conflicts were supported by the Cold War. If there is no cold 
war, there are no longer conflicts in the Middle East. Second, I 
do not believe it is really up to us. You know, I keep 
wondering what led to the collapse of communism? After all, no 
other party has emerged in the Soviet Union to bring this all 
about. No, there was no new party or coup d'etat. It was not 
the military who overthrew communism and no invasion took place, 
either. What toppled communism, and will always topple 
dictatorships, is television, knowledge, and the dissemination 
of information, which nobody can really halt. The young men 
from Moscow, Baghdad, Jerusalem, or Bucharest are increasingly 
watching what is going on in the world. Then, they ask 
themselves: Why are people in some parts of the world happy and 
rich, while we get up every morning in poverty? 
  I believe that the change does not depend on the leaders or 
the countries. The world will become more and more democratic 
and peaceful, because there is a third reason for it all. I do 
not believe that the extremists have a future. What are they 
doing? They are killing, and killing, and killing. What then? 
They have no other alternative. The alternative does not 
belong to extremism, but to the mothers in Israel and Palestine 
who do not want their children to be exposed to the same dangers. 
  Chairman 'Arafat, you said that I am an occupier. You must 
admit that I am a pretty pleasant occupier. There are not many 
occupiers like me. However, as a so-called occupier, I am 
firmly taking my seat at the negotiating table alongside you and 
I hope we will find a political solution, without force and 
violence, between the Palestinian and ourselves. I told 
Chairman 'Arafat about the Israeli saying that the better one's 
neighbor feels, the better one feels also. Gentlemen, I would 
like to reiterate that the future is irreversible and, in this 
context, peace is irreversible, too. [applause] 
  [Chiriac] I have two questions for Mr. Peres and Mr. 
'Arafat. First, did you make any progress in the peace talks 
here in Bucharest? And second, do you think that Romania can 
still play a role in the peace process in the Middle East. 
  [Moderator] Who is asking the question? 
  [Chiriac] Dan Chiriac, from the ADEVARUL daily newspaper. 
  [Moderator] There will be a news conference for journalists 
later. 
  [Chiriac] Well, this was my question for both Chairman 
'Arafat and Mr. Shim'on Peres. 
  ['Arafat] Not to forget that we have a very important 
meeting this afternoon in which we will all participate; His 
Excellency [President Ion Iliescu] wants to help give further 
impetus to this peace process. Therefore, as I said several 
times at the start of my speech at the Forum proceedings, thank 
you, thank you Romania. [applause] 
  [Official] International investors are convinced that, if 
there is peace, the Israeli-Palestinian team and the entire 
Middle East will again become a growing market, a market for the 
future. We know that this process can be long-term. Is it 
possible to develop concrete initiatives between Israelis and 
Palestinians, such as a mixed Israeli-Palestinian bank, or a 
joint Israeli-Palestinian company for research projects and 
water exploitation, or other similar initiatives that can 
facilitate coexistence on concrete technical and financial 
planes? 
  ['Arafat] At this point, our economy is an economy under 
occupation, under Israeli occupation, and it is totally linked 
to the Israeli economy. When they withdraw, we will raise this 
question then. I do not want to go into detail now, but, 
regardless of the situation, we are still under occupation. It 
is no small thing that we have been suffering for 45 years. 
When the Israelis withdraw and we manage to establish our 
national authority, then you can come and see. If you listened 
to my speech, I referred to several future projects and 
emphasized that it is our right to have a Marshall plan for the 
region, which has gone through so many wars, as there was a 
Marshall plan for Europe. Why should we not also have a 
Marshall plan in our region? We need it. This applies to the 
peoples in this region, not only the Palestinians and Israelis, 
but to all the other Arab states in the zone. They also have a 
right to profit form a Marshall plan. I even departed from my 
written text to the session in order to emphasize that we need 
this plan. 
  [Peres] In my opinion, there should be economic and 
scientific cooperation between us and the Palestinians. We 
should take care not to replace a market economy with a national 
flag economy. I believe that there is more money in the world 
than ideas. We must develop research activity. The 
Palestinians and Israelis should jointly concern ourselves with 
this aspect. 
  [Announcer] I would like to remark on an interesting aspect 
of this question-and-answer session, namely the languages used 
by the two leaders, the Israeli and Palestinian ones: Shim'on 
Peres answers both in English in French, while 'Arafat, aside 
from Arabic, also just answered a question in English. 
  [Official] I have a question for Mr. Peres in his capacity 
as professor at Cairo University. Does he think that the 
developments in the region have conformed to projections in the 
lectures he has written, or does he now have a new slant on 
developments in the region? 
  [Peres] As professor at Cairo University, let me give you a 
very concrete example. There is cooperation between Egypt and 
Israel in the sphere of agriculture. Our Egyptian friends asked 
us for technology in the sphere of irrigations, drainage, and 
other fields. The project proved successful. As a matter of 
fact, Egypt has become a competitor for Israel in this respect. 
I doubt that the Egyptians feel that they are subjected to 
domination from Israel in this respect. We are also cooperating 
with Morocco and other countries. I believe that all of us have 
two passports: a national passport, linked to history, and a 
universal passport linked to science. Science is universal. 
Science knows no frontiers. It must be made available to 
everybody. One can achieve a lot through science. [applause] 
  [Official] I represent the German Bundestag. I have a 
question for both Chairman 'Arafat and Minister Peres. You have 
just referred to the future. However, before I take up that 
point, I would like to thank the Romanian people for having 
created favorable conditions -- at a pretty difficult time for 
themselves -- for the peace process. The experience we have 
gained here in Europe, at the end of World War II, makes me ask 
you a realistic question about the time after the conclusion of 
the peace process. Do you not believe that too much attention is 
being paid to the conflict rather than to the assistance 
required after the end of the conflict? Are you not worried 
about the fact that the world, including Europe, will lose 
interest in the region? As you know, the attention here is 
focused on the European Union and on the processes currently 
taking place in Europe. What is being done to ensure that, 
after the end of the conflict, you will get assistance from the 
European Union? What are your expectations from us? 
  ['Arafat] My viewpoint is the opposite of what you said 
regarding the Middle East-Europe relationship. While U.S. 
President Clinton characterized [words indistinct] from Greece, 
up to the Scandinavian countries and Portugal. Regarding the 
European participation in this aid program -- meaning the 
European portion, worth millions of dollars -- we note that the 
European share is the largest. By that, I mean it has the 
largest percentage. Therefore, nobody can say that Europe is 
not interested in the Middle East. Europe has an interest in the 
region and in the aftermath of peace in the area. We are not 
living somewhere in Hawaii, but in the Middle East. We have 
shared history, land, and economy with Europe. We have also 
shared wars, science, and culture. Everybody knows that the 
Mediterranean Sea has been viewed as a lake between us and you 
in Europe. Thanks to my bilateral contacts, I noticed that all 
European countries of the European Union feel the need to help 
us. They are particularly interested in the evolution of 
negotiations between us and Israel and in future development 
plans in the region. I said that in my speech to the conference 
and I even made references to the private sector. We would like 
the European private sector to support us and we want to 
mutually support and encourage each other. Therefore, I suggest 
you revise your viewpoint and your sources of information. 
Thank you. 
  [Peres] Well, let me say something as an associate member of 
the Common Market -- as you know, Israel is an associate member 
and Palestine is also indirectly associated to the Common 
Market. In the future, Palestinians will probably also want to 
become members of the European Union. However, I want to tell 
you something. Europe has become so productive and efficient 
that all the Europeans can produce now is unemployment; the more 
productive Europe becomes, the more unemployed can be found in 
Europe. Therefore, we ask the Europeans: Why should you spend 
so much money on unemployment? Why not export these unemployed 
to help build societies, that is, send them to some social 
markets? The cost is the same. Why reduce the size of your 
companies, the number of jobs, and thereby create so many 
problems? For instance, in the Middle East -- I am not 
referring to geographic markets only, but to social ones, too -- 
you should try to help people in the Middle East increase their 
living standard by setting up and building nuclear plants, 
roads, and so forth. You can better recover your money that 
way. This is what the Ford company did. 
  Lenin introduced discipline in this respect. I know that the 
governments have budgets. We have a state president here who 
can confirm that to you. Therefore, governments have budgets, 
but they do not release the money, because all the money is used 
at the national level. On the other hand, the companies have 
money but no ideas and companies will never invest money in a 
region marked by danger and question marks about it. What we 
would like to suggest to the Europeans is that their governments 
give guarantees to their own companies, so that the latter can 
invest their money in new areas. Europe must choose between 
freezing their own economies and expanding their ideas. I 
believe that there are great possibilities now and I believe 
that we agree with the Palestinians in this respect -- that 
there should be a change in this sphere: Instead of selling 
weapons to us, the Europeans should give us money to build our 
homes; the Americans can build bridges, airports, and other 
projects in the region. I believe this is the real proposal we 
want to make. [applause] 
  [Announcer] This is the end of the question-and-answer 
session.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Velayati, in meetings today with 
Croatian, Bosnian, and Albanian officials on the sidelines of 
the world forum foundation [Crans Montana Forum] in Bucharest, 
discussed the status of Muslims in the Balkan peninsula and the 
latest developments in Gorazde. Here is our correspondent's 
report: 
  [Correspondent] Foreign Minister Velayati, who is in Romania 
to take part in the world forum foundation session, held 
separate meetings today with the Croatian parliamentary speaker 
and the foreign ministers of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania at 
the embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI] in Bucharest, 
and discussed the situation facing Muslims in the Balkans and 
the latest developments in Gorazde. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubljankic 
described the latest situation in Gorazde and referred to the 
Serbs' destructive acts of destroying 800 mosques and Islamic 
monuments. He also stressed the effective role of the IRI in 
eliminating the problems facing Muslims in his country. 
Velayati pointed out the sensitivity and sympathy of the people 
of Iran and described the special attention of our country's 
president to the situation in Bosnia as the basis for a new 
round of extensive diplomatic moves by the IRI in international 
forums. 
  Velayati referred to his talks with the UN secretary 
general, 
the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] secretary general, and 
a number of foreign ministers of Western and Islamic countries, 
and said: The future session of the ICO foreign ministers 
contact group, which will take place at the United Nations at 
Iran's proposal, is a new move to speed up UN Security Council 
decisions in support of the people of Bosnia. 
  Velayati said that he is ready to visit Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in 
the near future. 
  In a meeting with Croatian Parliament Speaker Stjepan Mesic, 
Mesic expressed satisfaction at the trend of talks with Muslims 
and the agreement reached and further explained a proposed 
confederation in the agreement with Bosnia. Velayati expressed 
the hope that recent agreements would last and be respected, and 
called for further expansion of the two countries' ties. 
  During the third meeting today, Albanian Foreign Minister 
Alfred Serreqi briefed Velayati on the inhumane and harassing 
actions taken by Serbia against the Muslim people of Kosovo. 
Velayati expressed sympathy, and said: The IRI will endeavor 
at international forums to promote the removal of the problems 
facing the people of Kosovo, and will continue to support them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Raluca Dana Cotruta in Bucharest on 22 April -- recorded, in 
English with superimposed translation into Romanian; translated 
from the Romanian] 
  [Text] [Cotruta] Mr. Minister, you have made lots of 
political statements these last few days. Now that the end of 
your visit is drawing closer, we can also discuss other more 
humane issues of interest to all of us. Could you just define 
tolerance? What is tolerance, in your opinion? 
  [Peres] I defined it in my speech to the forum when I said 
that, although democracy means the right to be equal, tolerance 
means the equal right to be different. Tolerance is a 
relationship with a different person, opinion, and religion. 
You do not necessarily have to agree with them, but you should 
always observe them. That is the meaning of tolerance. 
  [Cotruta] What do you think makes people intolerant? What 
are the roots of this kind of attitude? 
  [Peres] Fear, prejudice, jealousy. Usually, the source of 
intolerance is fear and uncertainty. People apparently have an 
element of aggressiveness in themselves. For many good years, 
aggressiveness manifested itself through wars. In a way, it is 
now being expressed to a certain extent in sports, on the soccer 
fields, where confrontations slightly resemble wars. 
Aggressiveness is also manifest in road traffic; many people 
will not allow other cars to overtake them. Intolerance is an 
accumulation of fears and uncertainties. 
  [Cotruta] Do you think that intolerance, this kind of 
disease -- since it is a disease, although you may not see it 
burst out on your skin or accompanied by high fever -- do you 
think this kind of sickness is more present in some regions of 
the world as compared to others? 
  [Peres] Yes. I think there is a direct relationship between 
poverty and intolerance. When you are becoming richer, you are 
also getting richer in tolerance. When you are turning poor, 
you are becoming more intolerant. Then, it depends very much on 
cultural development, which has many effects in its own turn. 
For example, the number of children. We all have smaller 
families because we want to invest in our children. However, if 
we are talking about the society of a backward nation, then you 
note that it relies on many children; you have a high death rate 
of children, too, with many of them not enjoying the benefits of 
education. The same applies to the issue of tolerance. The 
freer, richer, and more secure one is, the more one can afford 
to be tolerant. The reverse of the coin is intolerance. 
  Then you must realize that there are several forces that 
give 
legitimacy to intolerance -- I am basically referring to 
religions, since once something becomes holy, it ceases to be 
reasonable. Holiness is above all reason. This also applies to 
the problem of sacredness, as in the case of Khomeinism or the 
Inquisition. Then come the various strategies, the fact that 
people have had to fight wars in order to earn a living. This 
is also on the point of disappearing. The strategies are 
outdated, as well as the wars. I do not think the like of this 
will still happen in the future. But strategies and secret 
services have always been with us, the same as suspicion, 
disquietude, and intolerance. Then comes the economic and 
personal confrontation. The people want to excel each other 
and, in their endeavors to this end, they sometimes try to 
minimize or ridicule the others. The causes of all this are as 
diverse as the human beings themselves. 
  [Cotruta] I would like to return to the Middle East, not 
politically but spiritually, so to speak. What do you think is 
the meaning of the Middle East for the rest of the world and for 
the people living there? What is your viewpoint in this respect? 
  [Peres] We represent a very strange mixture -- the cradle of 
three religions and the wells of oil. You have the great 
memories and traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, 
which are represented by huge communities throughout the world. 
There are 1 billion Catholics in the world, 1 billion Muslims, 
I do not know exactly how many Protestants, and there is also a 
small Jewish people. All of them are linked to the area in one 
way or another. Maybe half of humanity is linked to the Middle 
East emotionally or religiously. On the other hand, 60 percent 
of the world's oil resources are in the Middle East. Therefore, 
if you are religious, you come to the Middle East. If you are a 
layman, you still must come to the Middle East. 
  The Middle East has filled the pages of history. The 
Middle East has experienced 30 changes of empires throughout its 
history. Some 30 different empires have passed through the 
region and left their impact on the pace and remembered history 
of mankind. I do not know whether the nature of the Middle East 
has made that religions should be so exclusivist or that the 
exclusivism of religion has made the Middle East to be so 
strained. Nevertheless, it has surely had its effect. There is 
a very interesting theory belonging to French historian 
(?Maspereau). He said that there are two kinds of countries -- 
the mountainous and the flat ones. He said that in a flat 
country, there are never prophets or revolutionaries, since they 
do not know where to hide themselves. The people there live 
together, can see each other, and take their water from the same 
springs. In mountainous countries, where you can hide well, 
there are prophets and rebels, revolts and revolutions, as well 
as ideas. So, from Mount Sinai to the mountains of Judea, the 
stories were written that gave birth to the wars, revolts, 
religions, and the prophets. 
  [Cotruta] Your words sound so serene. Nevertheless, I 
imagine that you have gone through quite a few difficult moments 
in your career as diplomat. Can you name one? 
  [Peres] I have had so many difficult moments that a single 
example would not suffice. You know, one experiences crises and 
disappointments in almost everything. Even in these 
negotiations, there were at least three moments when I thought 
we would not pull it off. Then again, we had to overcome those 
moments and resume the negotiations from the start. 
  [Cotruta] Which was the toughest moment? 
  [Peres] I think the night before we signed the accord in 
Oslo. My friends told me: You are finished. Everything is over, 
there is no chance. I talked all night with the people in 
Tunis. I have been to Sweden with the late Minister Holst, and 
we were sharing the same room. He was shouting to 'Arafat [on 
the phone]. During the night, between Sweden and Norway, many 
people thought that the peace process had failed. 
  [Cotruta] Yesterday you sounded quite optimistic and Mr. 
'Arafat, on leaving Bucharest, made a pretty optimistic 
statement. Can one talk about a moderate optimism? 
  [Peres] For me, it is a permanent optimism. Personally, I 
do not know how one can go through life with pessimism. Does it 
help any to be pessimistic? Even here, in Bucharest, when we 
met the first night, Mr. 'Arafat was not in very good form. We 
sat until 0230 in the morning trying to examine all matters and 
find solutions to them. I am glad to say that Chairman 'Arafat 
left Bucharest with an optimistic feeling about what has been 
achieved. 
  [Cotruta] You know that in his inaugural speech to the 
forum, Mr. Carteron [president of the Crans Montana Forum 
Foundation] said that this meeting in Bucharest is not a 
haphazard product -- he said that in French. Therefore, it is 
not accidental that the meeting took place in Bucharest. I 
mean, many speculations have been made in this respect. 
  [Peres] Obviously, I cannot guess what the organization's 
president meant by that. 
  [Cotruta] He said the meeting was not accidental. 
  [Peres] I know you are talking about Mr. Carteron, but I do 
not know what he was alluding to. I know that the organization 
has made this huge effort to bring me and Mr. 'Arafat together 
here. It was a difficult task. Romanian diplomacy also had a 
part in it. I think we wanted to pay our respects to Bucharest 
and the Romanian diplomacy -- this being another inducement for 
our coming here. 
  [Cotruta] Are there any other bridges being built between 
Israel and Romania? 
  [Peres] There are quite a few bridges. The connection 
between us is natural, so why should we look for new bridges? 
  [Cotruta] Well, that is what I was referring to -- namely 
the Israelis originating from Romania. 
  [Peres] Yes. 
  [Cotruta] So, they are a bridge. 
  [Peres] Yes, 10 percent of Israel's population originated 
from Romania and they nurture very warm feelings for Romania -- 
something that makes Israeli-Romanian relations so special. 
  [Cotruta] Is there anything you dislike in the present stage 
of Romanian-Israeli relations. 
  [Peres] No, I do not think so. Occasionally, there are some 
sporadic anti-Semitic outbursts, which is strange because there 
is practically no important Jewish community left in Romania. 
What remains of the large Jewish community of Romania is only 
approximately 16,000 people, the great majority of whom are old 
people. However, I do not think we have any real problems. 
  [Cotruta] Do you think this problem of anti-Semitism is real 
nowadays or is it artificially sponsored and maintained? 
  [Peres] Well, it is like a devil and an evil spirit, but it 
exists in the people's minds and memory. I was never confronted 
with it personally, but I have met many people who are afraid of 
this evil spirit. This evil spirit does not exist in reality, 
but in the composition of human psychology. As far as I am 
concerned, anti-Semitism is not a Jewish malady but a Gentile 
one. That is why we find it spread among the non-Jews. I think 
it is an ugly spot on their own societies. I do not believe 
that if a strong anti-Semitic trend existed in Romania, it would 
jeopardize the life of the Jews, because the whole thing is 
pointless. However, I believe that for a Romania that wants to 
be free, liberal, respected, and clear, it should prevent the 
emergence of these ugly phenomena, which are so much linked to 
the past and have so little to do with the future. 
  [Cotruta] Is this phenomenon more acute in other countries? 
  [Peres] Well, it has different expressions. In Germany, for 
instance, there is a certain xenophobia. Actually, the German 
potential of anti-Semitism is directed against the Turks and 
other foreign workers. It is something crude, ugly, and brutal. 
We know the Germans are trying to fight this phenomenon. There 
are certain anti-Semitic manifestations in Russia and many other 
places. But as I have said, this is not a Jewish malady. 
  [Cotruta] Let us leave the devils aside and turn back to 
what we might expect and what I believe we should do. What do 
you think would be the main danger -- or better said, what might 
jeopardize the peace, which has now become a reality? 
  [Peres] Usually it is the crazy people you should watch. 
You know, there are crazy people in three countries: Iran, 
Iraq, and Libya. They are endangering peace and their own 
nations. However, I believe that less and less people are going 
to support them, even among the crazies. What can you achieve 
by war? What is important, you cannot achieve through war, and 
whatever war can achieve is no longer important. Then comes the 
cost of war, which is prohibiting, as well as the cost of arms 
and the damage caused by the war. No one can really engage in a 
war today. I see war as a cholera, a disappearing disease. It 
no longer really functions in the modern world. It is no longer 
a real problem. There are countries that still maintain huge 
armies but have no enemies. It is so strange to see a country 
whose army should be poised to fight against an enemy, but the 
enemy that might justify the size of that army simply does not 
exist. 
  [Cotruta] I have two more questions. The first one is 
concerning what we usually call the great powers. You said that 
many weapons were sold to the Middle East, something that costs 
a lot of money. All this traffic in arms and money -- does it 
have anything to do with the great powers or with some people up 
there wanting to preserve a climate of tension? 
  [Peres] Well, when there was a conflict between the two 
superpowers, they searched for clients in the Middle East. Many 
countries in the Middle East thrived on this world conflict. 
Anyhow, I think this is a good question. Why should a country 
like Russia or the Soviet Union spend an estimated $180 billion 
to finance and support various parties in the Middle East in the 
way of arms, credits, and so forth? 
  The answer is that this confrontation between the two 
superpowers was not only a strategic and economic one but an 
ideological one, too. Each ideology -- the democratic one, on 
the one hand, and the communist ideology, on the other -- wanted 
to prove that they were able to obtain more support from as many 
people as possible. It was more an attempt by these great 
ideologies to conquer the people's hearts rather than their 
territories. 
  I once read a very interesting article about an American 
foreign policy expert who made a speech before a group of U.S. 
businessmen and explained the need for the U.S. program of aid 
for abroad. He had a very good idea. He told them: Let us 
assume that I do not work for the State Department but for the 
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Let us also assume that 
you are not U.S. businessmen but Russian ones. If you are to 
ask me how we spent the Russian assistance for foreign 
countries, I would say that we spend it in Egypt. If you asked 
me how much are we spending there, I would say $6-7 seven 
billion. In which way? Well, we are supplying arms. What did 
Egypt do with the weapons? It entered a war. Did it win the 
war? No. Is there a communist party in Egypt? No, it is in 
prison. 
  Well, then I would say that we further spent some foreign 
aid 
in Indonesia. If they asked me how much, I would say about $2 
billion. If they asked me on what, I would say on a stadium. 
If they asked me why, I would say because [former Indonesian 
President] Sukarno liked stadiums. If they asked me whether 
this has made Russia more popular in Indonesia, I would have to 
give a negative answer. Is there a communist party in 
Indonesia? No, it is in prison. Then the American dignitary 
closed his speech by saying the following: Do you know the 
difference between the United States and Russia? In Russia they 
do not ask questions. 
  [Cotruta] The last question. You travel a lot. Are you 
ever homesick? 
  [Peres] The minute I leave my home I am homesick.

<F P=106> [Statement by Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in </F>
Bucharest on 23 April -- recorded, in English with 
passage-by-passage translation into Romanian; translated from 
the Romanian] 
  [Text] [Announcer] Shim'on Peres, deputy prime minister 
and foreign minister of the State of Israel, left Bucharest this 
evening. Teodor Melescanu, minister of state and foreign 
minister of Romania, accompanied the guest to Otopeni airport. 
Before his departure, the Israeli guest granted an exclusive 
interview to our correspondents Nicu Popescu and Ion Marinescu. 
  [Begin Peres recording] In the three days of talks, one of 
the issues approached was bilateral relations between Romania 
and Israel, and the other issue was relations with the 
Palestinians. 
  As far as bilateral relations are concerned, we are on the 
right path. There is an increase in economic activities and 
cultural and scientific relations and there are technological 
exchanges between our countries. 
  We held talks with the foreign minister, the prime minister, 
and the president of your country in a very nice atmosphere. We 
have the impression that we are on the right path. Romania has 
a very important investment in Israel -- namely, the people who 
left Romania for Israel but without divorcing their feelings 
from Romania. They feel very strong about it. We will build a 
new strong bilateral relationship. As far as the Crans Montana 
Forum conference is concerned, there were 350 delegates from 
abroad, but what is more important was the presence of over 700 
correspondents in this rather impressive palace. I think it was 
an important congress. I think Bucharest was interesting. The 
issues discussed have exceeded your own nation and these issues 
are not part of the Black Sea, but of the Balkans. I met many 
interesting and acknowledgeable people. 
  Then there was the meeting with Mr. 'Arafat, where we tried 
to solve the different points in our discussions and clarify 
relations between the PLO and Israel. We tried to create the 
right atmosphere. The tradition of Romanian diplomacy that has 
been mediating in the Middle East has been felt now, too. In 
general, it was a very useful meeting. As you know, Mr. 'Arafat 
felt at home here and I believe this will accelerate the pace of 
negotiations toward a positive final result. I am grateful to 
the Romanian Government for the attention granted to me. We had 
a working lunch today with the prime minister and the foreign 
minister that was completely kosher and held in a very good 
atmosphere and I hope we will continue to work together. [end

  [Text] At the end of a meeting this morning with Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu, FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic stated to the press that the NATO ultimatum against 
the Bosnian Serbs provokes antagonism and complicates the 
situation in Bosnia because NATO is only pressuring the Serbs 
and is not taking into account the military actions of the 
Bosnian Muslims. On the other hand, Mr. Vladislav Jovanovic 
declared that the cease-fire agreement in Gorazde, which was 
reached yesterday in Belgrade, represents an appropriate way to 
find a solution to the crisis and that the Belgrade leadership 
insists on the immediate cessation of hostilities. 
  Apart from the Bosnian conflict, discussions between the two 
foreign ministers also focused on bilateral relations. The 
sides agreed that Romanian and Yugoslav experts will soon meet 
in order to finalize the text of the basic political treaty 
between the two states, our correspondent Eugen Baboi informed 
us.

<F P=106> ["Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by the Greek </F>
magazine BALKAN NEWS AND EAST EUROPEAN REPORT" in Bucharest on 
22 March 1994] 
  [Text] [Reporter] How do you view the development of 
Europe and what role will Romania play in that future 
development? 
  [Iliescu] After the events in 1989 in the Central and East 
European countries, the physiognomy of Europe radically changed. 
  Although the Cold War was over, we had to face prejudice and 
certain tendencies toward the discriminatory treatment of East 
European countries. I believe that the future Europe should 
consist of countries that develop relations of cooperation and 
not confrontation. 
  Last year Romania succeeded in removing the last barriers 
that affected its image. It became a member of the Council of 
Europe with full rights and obtained most-favored-nation status 
from the United States. This year, Romania was the first 
country to sign the Partnership for Peace with NATO. We propose 
to keep up this rapid pace of integration in Europe and develop 
good relations with the United States, the Far East, and other 
countries of the world. 
  The recent accord not only represents financial support but 
it is also a moral credit granted to our country. It speaks for 
itself about the fact that, according to experts, Romania has to 
play an important role because of its natural resources, its 
people's high level of education, the efficiency of its 
government, and its privileged geographical position, which 
permits control over air routes and waterways that connect 
Europe and the Middle East and mainly the Rhine-Main-Danube 
Canal. 
  [Reporter] In the past months, after the political changes 
stabilized in Central and East Europe, we witnessed the first 
real signs of redistribution of influence between the major 
powers. Could you please comment on this? 
  [Iliescu] Unfortunately, I cannot fully agree with you that 
all political changes in Central and Easter Europe have been 
stabilized. While this is obvious for such states as Romania, 
Bulgaria, and Hungary, in terms of the former federations, such 
as Yugoslavia and USSR, the current stabilization is still 
fragile. 
  Second, I believe that the example of shares of influence of 
the great powers belongs to an old mentality that is specific to 
the Cold War rather than to current relations. I rather see the 
near future of this part of the world in terms of distribution 
of areas of influence between big and average centers of power. 
The former socialist countries in Europe should mainly 
recuperate the technological and managerial deficiency that 
separates them from West Europe to be able to make full use of 
its resources, among which I would call human resources as the 
major one. All this should not turn former socialist countries 
in competitors for West Europe; on the contrary, we should 
become equal and solid partners in the act of building a 
stronger, more stable, and more prosperous Europe. That is why 
the last thing we need now is a conflict for hegemony, no matter 
whether we are talking about the attempt of one country to 
expand its hegemony or the need to defend itself from foreign 
hegemony. 
  I believe that the Partnership for Peace and the prospects 
for complete integration of these countries in NATO represents 
the first step toward the achievement of a greater stability in 
the area. But this has to be completed with an initiative of 
the Partnership for Development, according to similar concepts 
and organized around the same institutions. 
  [Reporter] After the downfall of totalitarian regimes in 
Europe and after the real abolition of the Warsaw Pact, what do 
you believe will be the role of NATO in the world and especially 
in Europe? 
  [Iliescu] Just like all the other East European countries, 
we are naturally concerned about our security. We regard NATO 
as a successful alliance, which has been one of the major 
pillars of security in Europe after World War II. What is 
really important is the fact that NATO's development should not 
be reduced to a simple expansion of its umbrella with a few 
hundred kilometers toward east, but NATO should turn into a 
factor of security for all countries in this region. 
  The proposal of the Partnership for Peace shirks the danger 
of establishing new and aimless discrimination among the 
countries that are candidates to become NATO members and offers 
equal chance to all these countries. That is why we joined this 
formula of cooperation and were the first country that took this 
step. However, our final goal is to become members with full 
rights of NATO. 
  We suggested the Partnership for Development, as a component 
of the Partnership for Peace in Europe and the North American 
region. The European Union can represent an adequate framework 
for the development of this concept. What is important for us 
in Europe is to overcome the stage of confrontation and 
suspicion and understand that the problems that exist both in 
East as well in West Europe can be solved through a broad 
opening of gates toward a free circulation of capital, of 
knowhow, goods, and people. In the long run, through adequate 
administration, the inevitable phenomenon of a united Europe 
will lead not to competition among European countries but to 
cooperation and greater prosperity for everybody. 
  [Reporter] In the less than three years since the Soviet 
Union ceased to exist, we have witnessed a new situation 
prevailing among former Soviet republics, which we can see in 
the military, political, and financial areas. Could you please 
comment on this? 
  [Iliescu] The situations differ in each case, according to 
the republics that we refer to, in Asia Minor, in the Caucasus, 
or the Western republics of the former USSR. However, even 
among the countries that belong to this last group, things 
differ, whether it is one of the Slavic republics, one of the 
Baltic republics, or the republic of Moldova, the only one that 
has no common borders with the Russian Federation. But, at the 
same time, all these republics have many common elements. First 
of all, the high rate of economic integration that prevailed in 
the former USSR, made these countries economically dependent on 
each other, but mainly on Russia. Therefore, I believe that in 
case of most of these countries to expect them to change 
overnight is not a realistic demand. On the other hand, 
however, it is essential for them to gradually develop their 
alternative economic ties, in order to defend their independence 
and prevent Moscow having a monopoly. 
  Second, unfortunately, all political forces in Russia 
manifest an increasingly higher degree of nostalgia for its 
former imperial role. These very conservative, imperial forces 
are the ones that try to keep strategic control over foreign 
lands, sometimes even at the cost of war. I am going to give 
you a very significant example for Europe, especially for the 
situation in the Balkans: what is the role of the 14th 
[Russian] Army in Moldova, on the banks of the Dniester River, 
at a distance of almost 1,000 kilometers from Russia and on the 
territory of a sovereign state, which is not even Russia's 
neighbor? The imperial nostalgia affects all the former 
republics of the USSR, including Russia. Instead of 
concentrating its efforts on economic and social problems, 
Russia will waste its efforts in other ways and the result can 
be none other than the continuation of the decline in the 
standard of living and in political coherence, with the possible 
restoration of an anti- democratic regime. Therefore, all of us 
are and must be interested in strengthening democratic forces 
and in ensuring the success of economic reform in the Russian 
Federation. 
  [Reporter] You will visit Greece next week. What do you 
think Greece could do for Romania's integration in Europe, 
especially now when Greece holds the presidency of the European 
Union and, furthermore, Greece is the first country that 
ratified the treaty of Romania's association to the European 
Union? 
  [Iliescu] I believe that the official visit to Greece, which 
will take place on 30 and 31 March, represents an extremely 
important moment both for our bilateral relations and for 
developments in the Balkans. 
  The excellent Romanian-Greek relations are based on 
longstanding traditions and on mutual advantage and support. We 
are grateful to Greece for the support granted to Romania to 
achieve its strategic objective of integration in the European 
Union. As you have mentioned, the Greek Parliament was the 
first to ratify the Treaty of Romania's association to the 
European Union. We wish to express thanks again for this act 
and we sincerely hope that our Greek friends will make all 
possible efforts to see to it that the respective treaty is 
ratified by all members of the European Union. Likewise, we 
appreciate the friendly support granted by Greece for the 
admittance of Romania to the Council of Europe. We are 
convinced that Greece can make a new and important contribution 
in all stages of Romania's integration in Euro-Atlantic 
structures. And last but not least, we rely on Greece's 
cooperation in promoting certain economic projects in the 
Balkans, with the assistance of European financial bodies, for 
the benefit of all countries in the region, including Romania 
certainly. 
  [Reporter] How do you view the issue of former Yugoslavia 
and the Macedonia issue? 
  [Iliescu] The emergence of new states on the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia is a reality. Most of them have been 
accepted in the United Nations and recognized by the 
international community. The promotion of normal relations with 
these states is an action that makes a contribution to the 
efforts to overcome tension and increase confidence and 
stability in our region. 
  The meetings that took place between officials in Romania 
and 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, made it possible for 
us to find solutions to current aspects of cooperation and the 
movement of our citizens. Therefore, a Romanian Trade Office 
and Romanian consular office have opened in Skopje. 
  I am convinced that problems facing Greece and The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia will be solved by both sides 
through dialogue and understanding, because of the need to have 
relations of good neighborliness and in the interest of 
cooperation, mutual confidence, security, and peace in the 
region.

<F P=106> [Statement from the Albanian Foreign Ministry; place and </F>
date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] With the aim of contributing to reducing tension 
between the two countries and in the region in general, as well 
as for creating a more favorable climate for the meeting between 
the foreign ministers of Albania and Greece scheduled to be held 
in Zurich on 3 May 1994 and whose success we are interested in, 
Albania has decided to freeze the application of its decision 
regarding the question of the diplomatic staff of the Greek 
Embassy in Tirana until this meeting. 
  In Zurich a bilateral agreement on the diplomatic staffs of 
both countries will also be discussed, as stressed in the 
meeting that President Berisha held on 14 April with German 
Ambassador Claus Vollers, representative of the troika of the 
European Union in Tirana. 
  We hope that this act, which expresses Albania's 
determination for a constructive policy, will serve as a signal 
for the Greek Government to engage in stopping hostile acts and 
following a policy of good-neighborliness toward Albania. 
  With this decision, Albania confirms once again its 
determination to follow a policy of reducing tension and 
preserving stability in the south of the Balkans.

  [Text] Takovo, Apr 23 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Army Chief of 
Staff Lt. Gen. Momcilo Perisic Saturday [23 April] said that the 
Serb people does not want war, but will not tolerate anyone from 
abroad ordering its life by military threats. Commenting the 
NATO threats to the Serbs in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Perisic ponted out: "I want to believe that 
the latest threats will not be materialized, as their 
consequences could be catastrophic and push the whole Balkan 
region back into prehistory." 
  The NATO council Friday threatened Bosnian Serbs with air 
strikes if they do not withdraw their forces by Sunday at 0001 
GMT to three kilometers away from Gorazde, around which Serb and 
Moslem forces have been fighting bitterly for nearly one month 
since the Moslem forces launched their offensive from this safe 
area on Serb positions in late March. "We will not reply to 
threats by threats, but the Serbian and Montenegrin people must 
not remain indifferent and careless and [word indistinct] their 
state to be destroyed", Perisic said in Takovo at the 
commemoration of the 179th anniversary of the second Serb 
unprising. "We are aware of the great danger looming over all 
Serb lands, but we believe that this can be overcome only by 
just peace", Perisic said, adding that "the [word indistinct] 
weighing over the Serbs' national fate has regretfully received 
illusory legitimacy, and we must all take out fate in our hands, 
determined not to leave it up to others". 
  Commenting the U.N. sanctions against the Federal Republic 
of 
Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.), Perisic said that "the children, the future 
of the nation, are living today in a ghetto set up for them by 
the world powers, which hypocritically explain that peace is 
most easily achieved through the humanitarian isolation of the 
weakest". 
  At the end of May 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed 
sanctions on the F.R.Y., accusing it of aggression on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, even though there are no Yugoslav army 
troops in that former Yugoslav republic, but its three 
constituent peoples -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- are fighting 
in a civil war. 
  "Some world powers are doing all they can to push us to 
civilization's fringes, to subject us to their ill will and 
erase the best pages of our history, thus depriving us of our 
right to the future, but they will not succeed", Perisic said. 
"This is why the unity of the Serb people everywhere is 
necessary now more than ever in order to protect the people from 
the cruelest anti-civilizational isolation", he concluded.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic said on Friday [22 April] that the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia resolutely urges a political and 
peaceful solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina and supports Russia's principled and 
objective stand on the crisis in ex-Yugoslav territory. In 
talks with a delegation of the Russian parliament's lower house 
[State Duma], Kontic said that Russia's efforts have prevented 
the escalation of the fighting in Bosnia and underscored that 
the further continuation of the international sanctions against 
Yugoslavia practically prolongs the crisis in the former 
Yugoslav territory. 
  The head of the Russian parliamentary delegation, Nikolay 
Bezbirodov, said that the aim of the visit is to see for 
themselves the situation in Yugoslavia and the developments in 
Bosnia, and thus enable the lower house of the Russian 
parliament to make objective and principled decisions. 
Bezbirodov, who is deputy chairman of the parliamentary Defence 
Committee, said that he lower house is aware that the sanctions 
should be lifted and that they do not contribute to the 
resolution of the crisis in ex-Yugoslav territory. He said that 
the lower house is opposed to the use of military power in the 
settlement of the Bosnian crisis and that all conflicts should 
be resolved through negotiations, in a peaceful way. 
  The Russian delegation also met with the Speaker of the 
Yugoslav Parliament's lower house, Radoman Bozovic, who said 
that peace in Bosnia should be established immediately along the 
separation lines and then that all international institutions 
should be engaged to take part in political talks on all open 
issues. He said that the peace process requires the objective 
and equal treatment of the Serb people, on the same footing as 
all the other warring sides. Pointing out that it is senseless 
to further maintain the sanctions against Yugoslavia, the 
Russian delegation said that a legal project on their lifting 
had been drafted in the lower house, but that the procedure had 
been halted for the present due to the deterioration of the 
situation in Gorazde.

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- The president of the 
Bosnian Serb republic, Radovan Karadzic, and the UN special 
envoy, Yasushi Akashi, and his aides reached an agreement late 
this evening, after almost 10 hours of talks, on an absolute 
cease-fire in the Gorazde area, which is to come into force at 
1000 GMT tomorrow. It was also agreed that the Serbian forces 
would withdraw heavy weapons from Gorazde to a distance from 
which, as Yasushi Akashi said this evening, it would not be 
possible to hit the town. An agreement on the completely free 
movement of humanitarian convoys and the evacuation of the 
wounded from Gorazde was also reached. It has been announced 
that the talks would resume at 0700 GMT tomorrow, with the same 
people attending.

  [Text] Belgrade, 23 Apr (TANJUG) -- The two-day talks 
between Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Yasushi Akashi, 
the UN secretary general's special envoy for the former 
Yugoslavia, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of 
Srpska, and their aides ended in Belgrade today with complete 
success. This has been confirmed by the main participants in 
the Belgrade meeting -- Milosevic, Akashi, and Karadzic. In a 
brief statement for journalists after today's second round of 
talks, the Serbian president expressed satisfaction with the 
success of the talks between UN representatives and the republic 
of Srpska. 
  "I believe that a big step has been made toward peace," 
Milosevic said and added: "In the future, the Republic of Serbia 
will continue to lend support to peaceful solutions to the 
Yugoslav crisis through negotiations because we believe that 
this path has no alternative, and it is the only one which leads 
to such a solution." Yasushi Akashi also expressed satisfaction 
with the results of the talks, stressing that "a possibility has 
been created to avoid the crisis." He expressed gratitude to 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for the initiative which 
resulted in the two-day meeting in Belgrade. Akashi said that 
he is satisfied with the readiness to cooperate on the part of 
the Bosnian Serb representatives, especially Karadzic. 
  According to Akashi, it was agreed over the past two days 
that the Serbian forces should withdraw to three kilometers from 
the center of Gorazde. "We are planning to deploy peace forces 
around that town as early as this afternoon. I am convinced 
that in that respect we will have full cooperation for the free 
movement of the peace forces on their way to Gorazde before the 
end of the day." 
  Republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic's statement 
was 
in the same vein. He said that the Serbian forces will withdraw 
to three kilometers from Gorazde and that relations with the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] have been fully normalized. If 
there is peace in Gorazde, and peace forces are deployed there, 
that is, if the area is demilitarized and the possibility of a 
Muslim offensive removed, we can hope for a total peace, the 
president of the Serb Republic said in conclusion. 
  The initiative for the two-day meeting in Belgrade was 
launched by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who based it 
on the firm conviction that the crisis can be solved through 
negotiations and not through escalation of the war. Milosevic 
suggested that the representatiaves of the United Nations and of 
the republic of Srpska should discuss three issues: the 
normalization of relations between the republic of Srpska and 
UNPROFOR, an end to the conflict around Gorazde, and an 
agreement on a cessation of hostilities throughout the territory 
of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Milosevic's proposal was accepted and a full accord was 
reached on six issues. There is no doubt that the most 
important agreement is the one on the immediate and total 
cease-fire in and around Gorazde. Under the agreement, the 
cease-fire was to come into force at noon today. The agreement 
on the normalization of relations between the republic of Srpska 
and UNPROFOR is also of great importance, as well as the 
consensus that an agreement on a cease-fire throughout the 
territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina must be reached. 
  The question now is: Whose turn is it to make a move after 
the Belgrade agreement? Everything indicates that the 
conclusion is that it is the Bosnian Muslims. The wish of only 
one side is not enough for a cease-fire, nor is it enough for a 
war. In a certain way, NATO made a move out of turn by issuing 
fresh threats and ultimatums, and only to one side -- the 
Serbian side.

  [Text] [Announcer] The talks between Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic, Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's 
special envoy, and Serbian Republic President Radovan Karadzic 
that were held in Belgrade for several hours ended around noon 
today. These talks, which were held at the initiative of Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic, began yesterday afternoon. 
Following the talks, President Milosevic made a brief statement: 
  [Begin recording] [Milosevic] I am very glad that the talks 
between representatives of the United Nations and the Serbian 
Republic were successful. I think that a major step toward 
peace has been made. In the future as well, Serbia will 
continue to support a peaceful solution of the Yugoslav crisis 
through negotiations, because we think that there is no 
alternative and that this is the only way to achieve such a 
solution. Thank you very much. 
  [Correspondent Jelena Radovanov] Yasushi Akashi also 
addressed the correspondents. 
  [Akashi, in English fading into Serbo-Croatian report] I 
think that through cooperation among all participants in these 
long talks, we managed to avoid an even bigger crisis, said UN 
Yasushi Akashi. I am very satisfied with the results. I am 
grateful to President Milosevic for his initiative to hold such 
a meeting. I am also very pleased by the cooperativeness that 
representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, beginning with Radovan 
Karadzic, have shown, Yasushi Akashi said, and added that it was 
agreed that the Serbs would withdraw 3 km away from Gorazde by 
midnight and for heavy weaponry to be withdrawn by Tuesday [26 
April] at midnight. 
  It is our intention, Yasushi Akashi went on to say, that the 
first United Nations Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] units be 
deployed this afternoon. I have received assurances that full 
cooperation will be ensured regarding the peace forces' free 
passage to Gorazde as soon as possible, but before the end of 
the day. Yasushi Akashi added that other protected zones were 
also discussed. However, being confronted with the crisis 
around Gorazde, we have done all that was in our power to solve 
it. The result should be satisfactory to all interested sides, 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi concluded after the talks with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Republic of Srpska 
president Radovan Karadzic held this morning. 
  [Radovanov] Here is what republic of Srpska president 
Radovan Karadzic told the correspondents: 
  [Karadzic] Today's round was in fact held only to establish 
more precisely the things that we achieved yesterday. I am 
pleased that we and Akashi are on the road to success again. I 
hope that we are going to continue along that road until we 
completely conclude a cessation of hostilities. In this 
respect, Akashi is very spirited and very capable, and I think 
we are going to achieve good....[pauses] We set certain 
stipulations today regarding this 3-km zone in Gorazde. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Can you tell us some things 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Karadzic] I beg your pardon? 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Will relations with UNPROFOR be 
(?resumed)? 
  [Karadzic] Yes, relations with UNPROFOR have been normalized 
as we need them if we want to establish peace, especially since 
both sides have realized that it is impossible to do anything 
with interrupted relations. 
  [Correspondent] Could you tell us something about the 
modalities of yesterday's agreement? 
  [Karadzic] Yesterday's agreement envisages something that we 
discussed on several occasions within the past 10 days, and that 
is how to establish a criterion for the 3-km zone. In the 
center of Gorazde, since there are both Serbs and Muslims there, 
UNPROFOR will be responsible for taking care of the Serbs. It 
will take care of the Muslims as well, and according to the 
Security Council resolution, they must not provoke or shoot at 
the Serbian side. 
  If peace and the United Nations will be there -- if this is 
a 
model that is not identical to the Sarajevo one but similar to 
it -- we may hope for a complete peace in the Gorazde zone. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] that model be applied to 
other protected zones. What do you think? 
  [Karadzic] If the zones are demilitarized -- that is, if any 
possibility of provocations and offensives from protected zones 
is prevented -- then we are then ready to accept this. Had 
Gorazde been demilitarized, there would have been no Muslim 
offensive and there would have been no Serbian counteroffensive. 
Why did we not attack Srebrenica? Because, from Srebrenica, we 
are exposed to provocations alone and not an offensive. If the 
Muslims launched an offensive from Srebrenica, then naturally a 
Serbian offensive would result. We have to ensure that it is 
established who is to be blamed for the war -- that is, who 
started the offensives. Counteroffensives are a legitimate 
reply to offensives. 
  [Radovanov] Yesterday's first round of marathon talks, which 
lasted almost 10 hours, ended with a complete agreement of the 
representatives of the United Nations and the republic of Srpska 
on the most important points that were proposed by Slobodan 
Milosevic, the host of the meeting. What is involved is above 
all an agreement on the momentary and complete cease-fire in and 
around Gorazde, which comes into force at noon today. One 
UNPROFOR battalion will be deployed in the region 3 km away from 
the center of Gorazde on both banks of the Drina River. It has 
also been agreed that heavy weaponry be withdrawn from that area 
or be placed under UNPROFOR's control. A very important segment 
of yesterday's agreement is the complete normalization of 
relations between UNPROFOR and the republic of Srpska. [end

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- After over nine hours 
of uninterrupted talks between Serb President Slobodan 
Milosevic; Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy; and Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of 
Srpska, with aides, a complete agreement was reached on three 
key points that had been proposed by the host, Slobodan 
Milosevic. 
  Milosevic made the following statement for journalists: 
  "A complete agreement was reached on the total normalization 
of relations between the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the 
republic of Srpska as a prerequisite for normal cooperation in 
the interest of the peace process. This means that both sides 
are expected to fulfill the obligations they have taken upon 
themselves." 
  According to the the Serbian president, the second point 
took 
longest to discuss. It concerned an agreement on the solution 
to the crisis hotbed in Gorazde. "We discussed a possibility 
for reaching a general agreement on the cessation of hostilities 
in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory," said Milosevic, and 
added: "Full agreement was reached on this and support was given 
to the proposal that Mr. Akashi put forward to the Serb Republic 
representatives." 
  "It was all about three major issues, and agreement was 
reached on all of them. This is a very big step in the 
direction of peace, and I hope it will be very successful," the 
Serbian president said. 
  The UN secretary general's envoy, Yasushi Akashi, expressed 
satisfaction with today's talks and described them as positive, 
recalling Slobodan Milosevic's statement on full accord 
regarding three key issues. Yasushi Akashi put a particular 
stress on the importance of the agreement on Gorazde. "We 
agreed on the principles of an immediate and complete 
cease-fire, and Mr. Karadzic agreed with it. The cease-fire 
will come into effect tomorrow at 1000 gmt." 
  "We will try to deploy UN protection forces in Gorazde as 
soon as possible, and soon thereafter we will try to withdraw 
heavy artillery to a distance from which the town will not be 
threatened." Akashi went on to say that an agreement had been 
reached on the full freedom of movement for UN protection 
forces, the evacuation of the wounded, and the free work of 
humanitarian organizations. "I would like to express 
satisfaction with the agreement on the complete normalization of 
relations between UNPROFOR and the Serb side in Bosnia. Today 
we exchanged opinions on the future of the peace process when 
this crisis is over, as well as about efforts that will lead 
towards a global cease-fire, aiming at reaching an overall 
political solution later," Akashi said. He told journalists the 
talks would resume tomorrow morning. 
  Radovan Karadzic, president of the republic of Srpska, 
reminded the journalists of the beginning of the mission of UN 
secretary general's special envoy, drawing attention to "very 
successful meetings with him and very significant achievements 
in the Sarajevo zone." 
  "Unfortunate events around Gorazde, especially the bombing 
of 
Serb positions, have to a certain extent slowed down the 
previously positive process," said Karadzic and added, "Since 
1000 GMT today we have regained our mutual trust and cooperation 
with the UNPROFOR, which is promising." 
  "In our opinion the results of today's meeting are very 
similar to those we had achieved on 6 February regarding the 
Sarajevo crisis. We hope the series of our successful meetings 
and achievements will continue. We positively responded to the 
initiative on the general cessation of hostilities," said 
Karadzic. "If we draw a lesson from the Gorazde crisis, as we 
have done from the Sarajevo crisis, and if Muslim forces do not 
continue with their offensive from the direction of Tuzla or 
some other areas, we can expect all sides in the conflict and 
the international community to work on what was agreed here 
today -- the general cessation of hostilities in the entire 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory," said Radovan Karadzic in 
conclusion.

  [Text] Belgrade, 22 Apr (Tanjug) -- We are broadcasting the 
integral text of the agreement reached this evening in Belgrade 
between the delegations of the republic of Srpska and the UN, 
headed by Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and Yasushi 
Akashi, special envoy to the UN secretary general. The text of 
the agreement in English was forwarded to TANJUG from the office 
of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic: 
  "In the spirit of UN Security Council Resolution 913 of 21 
April 1994, the UN secretary general's special envoy for the 
former Yugoslavia and civilian and military authorities of the 
Bosnian Serbs agreed on the following: 
  1. Immediate and total cease-fire in the territory of 
Gorazde and around it. 
  2. As the first step, the urgent deployment of one UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] battalion in a 3-km radius around the 
center of Gorazde and on both banks of the river Drina; that 
battalion will monitor and supervise from close quarters whether 
both sides are observing the cease-fire and will report on it. 
Heavy artillery will be immediately handed over to UNPROFOR or 
will be withdrawn to a distance from which it will not threaten 
the Gorazde safety zone, and in a way that will not interfere 
with a procedure, which will be agreed upon later in line with 
paragraph three of Resolution 913 [as received]. 
  3. Guarantees for safe conditions for an urgent medical 
evacuation from Gorazde. 
  4. Complete freedom of movement for all UNPROFOR personnel 
and humanitarian organizations. 
  5. Urgent opening of talks to discuss -- with good 
intentions -- all military issues to diffuse tensions, separate 
forces, create safe and peaceful conditions, and meet the 
humanitarian needs of the civilian population. 
  6. The intention is that the implementation of the above 
measures should contribute to reinforcing efforts directed 
towards reaching an overall political solution all sides would 
approve."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>
  [Text] In the wake of yesterday's agreement reached 
between the authorities of the republic of Srpska and the 
prominent UN representatives for Bosnia-Herzegovina, who had 
ordered on 10 April the bombing of Serbian positions near 
Gorazde, the following question poses itself: Would this be 
sufficient to stop the already rushing war machinery that was 
started by U.S. President Clinton and the NATO Council with a 
new ultimatum and threats directed only at one side in this 
civil war -- the Serbian side. The answer could be positive, 
provided the Muslim side also guarantees that it will comply 
with the unconditional cease-fire and sit at the negotiating 
table. As we already know, this not only depends on them but 
also on those who have pushed them into a war against their 
neighbors in the first place. 
  The Muslim leaders at Bascarsija [center of Sarajevo] could 
finally benefit from the wisdom of their religious brother in 
Cairo, President Sadat, who, after four wars with its neighbor 
Israel, signed a peace agreement at the end of the 1970's, thus 
refusing to fight any more for the Arab cause to the last 
Egyptian. 
  It is well known that roads and interests of not only one 
foreign power are crossing themselves on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia that was based on AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council 
of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] as well as 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The interests of Germany, Austria, the 
Vatican, and Turkey are mostly well known from history. It is 
less known why the United States is investing so much passion in 
accusing the Serbs wherever they may be and supporting the 
Bosnian Muslims whatever they may be doing. This may to some 
extent be learned by examining the new U.S. interests in these 
regions, which are stronger than the interests of a small ally 
in the two world wars. 
  The U.S. strategic concept, whose implementation has been 
elaborated in detail by military experts, includes a general 
scale of U.S. national interests. They are officially 
established by the President and their implementation depends on 
public opinion, support by Congress, and priorities that are 
established by executive authorities. U.S. national interests 
are organized into four categories according to the degree of 
importance. Vital life interests come first, and they refer to 
achieving basic national security aims. In order to defend 
those, the United States is prepared to risk even waging a 
nuclear war. Second place is occupied by great interests that 
require from the state readiness to use armed forces for their 
protection, but under the condition that the conflict does not 
grow into a nuclear war. Ranked as third are important 
interests. They are a little less important than vital and 
great interests but are important enough for offering logistic 
assistance and limited support from the air and sea. Ground 
forces would be used only in an advisory role. It is not 
difficult to see that the U.S. engagement in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is in accordance with these important aims. 
Occupying fourth place is a single word: interest. With a view 
to protecting that, the United States would take certain 
measures -- but for war -- including help to allied and other 
friendly countries, with a possibility of engaging armed forces 
as well, in case of need. 
  It is interesting to note the further division of U.S. 
national interests into direct and indirect ones. Therefore, 
for instance, if West Europe is of vital interest for the United 
States, then the oil fields in the Persian Gulf and naval routes 
from them to Europe are indirectly of vital interest for the 
United States as well. Following the analogy, one can understand 
Washington's relationship toward the Bosnian Muslims, 
considering the U.S. interests to improve relations with 
oil-rich Islamic countries and to contract profitable businesses 
with them. 
  When mentioning the United States, the question somehow 
spontaneously poses itself of where Russia is and what its 
interests are. It is difficult to answer that question now, but 
it is nevertheless known that it was in the Balkans that this 
country was always confirming itself as a great power. Time 
will show whether it is renouncing this status in exchange for 
the benefit of cooperativeness and partnership with the United 
States.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slavko Perovic, president of the Liberal </F>
Alliance of Montenegro, by Marko Vukovic; place and date not 
given: "Anschluss of Montenegro to Herzegovina"] 
  [Text] Momir Bulatovic, president of the republic, 
furnished the topic for the interview of the president of the 
Liberal Alliance [LSCG] when he hinted at a union of Montenegro 
with Herzegovina. The increasingly frequent demands to ban the 
LSCG and SDP [Social Democratic Party] [as published] made by 
certain members of assemblies of northern Montenegrin opstinas 
were of equal interest. 
  [Vukovic] What would union with Herzegovina mean for 
Montenegro in the sense of its status as a state and to 
Montenegrins from the nationality standpoint? 
  [Perovic] It is not a question of any union with 
Herzegovina. 
It is a question of annexation or, if you like, Anschluss, of 
Montenegro to Herzegovina, so that Montenegro would forever, 
according to the conception of the Serbian expansionists, be 
part and parcel of the future maxi, midi, or mini Serbia. So, 
Montenegro must at any price be included in Serbia. Because of 
its coast from the geostrategic standpoint, because of its 
history, which, using the formula of the Montenegrins as the 
purest Serbs, as a people of Serbian origin, and so on, rounds 
out, according to the Serbs, the overwhelming truth not only of 
the five centuries of enslavement, but also, as far as the 
church is concerned, of collaboration with the Turks. When 
things are taken to their ultimate consequences, we learn that 
Montenegro is the backbone, but also the Achilles heel, of the 
Serbian expansionist project. Nikolaj Velimirovic put it this 
way: "Serbism without Montenegro is like a body without bones." 
So, following a de facto annexation, the Montenegrins would very 
quickly be presented a demand to become Serbs, since, as 
President Bulatovic threatened with the authority of his 
authoritarian state, the Montenegrins are of Serb origin, so 
that it is truly illogical, when they are of Serb origin, for 
them not to be Serbs today, but Montenegrins, a Comintern 
nationality invented somewhere else. In any case, when it 
becomes part of Herzegovina, a major change occurs in the ethnic 
structure to the advantage of Serbs, who will then vote for 
regionalization of the future unitary Serbian state, in which 
nothing would be left of Montenegro but the folklore. So, this 
is a betrayal of the national interests of Montenegro.... 
  [Vukovic] One gets the impression that the development of 
events in Bosnia, I am referring above all to the U.S. 
initiative to create a Muslim-Croat federation, which would then 
enter into a confederation with the Republic of Croatia, could 
favor the suggested integration. 
  [Perovic] It is my impression that the Americans and 
Russians 
have taken over Bosnian territory. The Russian side, make no 
mistake about it, is cooperating with the Americans. It is 
merely helping Milosevic and Karadzic to celebrate every defeat 
they experience, in keeping with Serbian tradition. The entire 
world saw Karadzic's celebration after withdrawal under the NATO 
threat. And it is clear on this occasion that if Yeltsin had not 
made the request, Karadzic and Mladic would have given NATO a 
kick in the rear. It is my belief that Bosnia will be buttoned 
up, that the confederation will turn out to have been only a 
lure to join the negotiations. I am convinced that Bulatovic 
"fired off" Herzegovina only in order to throw out a new bone 
for this unhappy people to gnaw on, a trick to make it forget 
the fact that it is imprisoned and that this was done to it by 
the Montenegrin-Herzegovinian-Serbian separatists, who have made 
of it their own reservation on which, so they hope, they will be 
the chiefs for a long time yet.... 
  [Vukovic] Many refer to Mr. Bulatovic's statement as an open 
claim to territory of neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina, which 
has been internationally recognized. How do you assess the 
effect of that act on the attitude of the international 
community towards Montenegro? 
  [Perovic] The idea of union with Herzegovina has the 
additional goal of destroying any thought of any Montenegrin 
position in foreign policy. Bulatovic's move subjects Montenegro 
to a defeat and mockery in the international arena and will 
contribute to its being globally satanized once again. This is 
all being done intentionally in order to destroy Montenegro. The 
result is the same as achieved at one time by Prevlaka, then 
Dubrovnik, then Zhirinovsky.... This question should be put to 
Montenegro's foreign minister, since the ministry still has not 
spoken out, which might be interpreted as support for the views 
of Bulatovic and Djukanovic; otherwise, the moral thing to do is 
resign. 
  [Vukovic] Do you believe the idea of creating the Republic 
of 
Montenegro and Herzegovina, as they say it would be called, was 
conceived in the head of President Bulatovic? 
  [Perovic] Bulatovic and Vucurovic are excellent friends, and 
they are both entirely devoted to Slobodan. It is clear than an 
idea like this could not have been conceived in the heads of 
those two, since they are not here to create, but to execute. 
The idea is Belgrade's, the execution is Podgorica's, just as 
January 1989 established. If things take that course, the idea 
is strategic in the sense that Montenegro is killed off for good 
within the framework of some alliance of Serbian states, 
countries, cantons, or whatever they might be. 
  [Vukovic] How would the LSCG react if a referendum were 
called for unification of Montenegro with Herzegovina? 
  [Perovic] That referendum, if it should come about, will be 
carried out under the same conditions as the recent referendum 
on annexation of Montenegro to Serbia. We boycotted that 
referendum, we would boycott this one as well. 
  [Vukovic] What impact would that event have on interethnic 
relations in the republic? 
  [Perovic] It would heat them to the glowing point. There 
would be no place in this state for Montenegrins, Muslims, 
Albanians, and the few Croats who have remained in Montenegro. 
At the same time, I think that the Montenegrins would be in the 
worst position, since the other groupings would be protected by 
the international community, but it will not protect us, since, 
as Bulatovic says, we are of Serb origin, that is, Serbs. In 
that scenario even the Serbs in the People's Party will be 
undesirable, since the entire project was conceived as an act of 
destroying Montenegro's statehood, so that the question of the 
sea would be solved for the Serbian side once and for all. The 
existence of a state bothers them, since that is the means by 
which the sea is kept out of their complete control, regardless 
of whether it is a Serbian or Montenegrin state. And that is the 
only reason why Seselj and his office were set up in Montenegro 
and that is why even Kilibarda is a traitor from their 
standpoint. 
  [Vukovic] Now that we have touched upon the topic of 
interethnic relations, which it seems have been additionally 
strained by the arrests of the leaders of the SDA [Democratic 
Action Party], we should note that there have been more frequent 
demands to ban the LSCG and the SDA! 
  [Perovic] We are precise in our views, and they expose the 
Serbian expansionist project, which ultimately, or even above 
all, is disastrous for the Serbian people itself. We get in the 
way, since we are a party of the authentic liberal democratic 
option, that is, of the civil option; we further our objectives 
exclusively by democratic means, which even the world at large 
has recognized through my foreign political contacts, and has 
supported us in this. That is why we are an embarrassing 
opponent, that is why they need to ban us, not only because of 
our objective, an independent Montenegro, but because of the 
truth that we convey and communicate unashamedly. All the 
groupings in Montenegro have been armed by the government -- 
either directly or under its tranquil eye. Those who were naive 
took the weapons, not realizing that weapons could not solve 
anything, since this is not 1784, but 1994. Those weapons have 
turned into a trap for those who accepted them, and the 
government will take advantage of this regardless of the 
religious, ethnic or other allegiance of those who possess them, 
since political accounts are settled with arrests like the 
arrest of the SDA, using the form of protecting the public 
order. Someone decided the Muslims need to be intimidated once 
again, perhaps pushed once again in the direction of Bulatovic, 
who mentioned them in such mellifluous terms at the recent 
congress of the DPS [Democratic Party of Socialists]. Perhaps an 
election is being prepared. Who knows what they are up to. I 
have information that something is being prepared for us and for 
me in particular. One would say that it is our turn. But, 
whatever happens, we are ready for him! 
  [Vukovic] Along with the "spontaneous" demands to ban the 
LSCG, an attempt is being made to cast your party in the image 
of a terrorist organization. To that end the Montenegrin 
ministry of internal affairs has been showing a surprising 
propensity toward graphomania. 
  [Perovic] The Montenegrin public is aware of all the 
government's efforts to satanize the LSCG. This has had a 
definite impact with a certain number of people. But we have 
managed to achieve the opposite result with an immense number of 
people. We were not taken in by the provocations, by the plants, 
by the offers of posts in the government, by the threats, nor 
will we be. We are aware that we are being infiltrated by 
"spies," by agents provocateurs, that at some point an agent 
provocateur will be activated to portray us in the light they 
want. We know that, we see them, it is all right. That is their 
technology for holding onto power, but nothing will stop us, 
nothing....
