  [Text] (STA) Podgorica -- The accusation leveled by the 
Belgrade Center for Antiwar Activities against the Montenegrin 
state leadership for war crimes committed against civilians, 
specifically refugees, no doubt seriously endangers the security 
and stability of that state. The accusation is plausible, based 
on documents signed by Nikola Pejakovic, Montenegrin minister of 
interior affairs. The documents state that scores of Muslim 
refugees arrested by the Montenegrin police last May were handed 
over to the Serbian police, after which they vanished without a 
trace.

<F P=106> [Article by Seki Radoncic: "Into the Minister's Ear"] </F>
  [Text] The fear citizens of Montenegro have of having their 
phones tapped is a legacy of the communist times, but also a 
consequence of this government's loose use of the word "traitor" 
for those who do not share its political opinions. Finally, an 
important reason for suspicion arises from the fact that only 
the Montenegrin police in all of Europe are not subject to the 
oversight of a multiparty parliament. 
  It is the public's general belief that eavesdropping is done 
on a large scale, says Slobodan Franovic, justice secretary of 
the executive board of the LSCG [Liberal Alliance of 
Montenegro]. "It is not our view that certain agencies that 
exist in all states should not take advantage of certain methods 
which represent some departure from certain principles of human 
rights, such as the principles of secrecy of the mail or 
inviolability of other means of communication between 
individuals. However, this must conform to the standards that 
prevail in the world." 
  The Liberal Alliance has announced "that it will take the 
initiative for evaluation of the constitutionality of the Law on 
Internal Affairs, that is, of Article 23, under which the 
minister of police can order the SDB [state security service] to 
take steps that depart from the inviolability of the mail and 
allow eavesdropping." 
  The Constitution of Montenegro, Franovic says, provides that 
this can be done only on the basis of a court order. However, 
the present Law on Internal Affairs allows this on the basis of 
a decision of the minister of internal affairs. So, we want the 
court to evaluate this and issue a decision, that is, to 
establish civilian control over the work of the police. We will 
soon file a petition with the Constitutional Court as to whether 
one provision of the Law on Internal Affairs conforms to the 
provision of the constitution. Specifically, concerning the 
procedure whereby the constitution allows departure from the 
principle of inviolability of the mail and other communications. 
"I personally believe," Franovic says, "since this is more than 
obvious, that the Constitutional Court will find that this 
provision of the Law on Internal Affairs does not conform to the 
constitution." 
<H5>  Eavesdropping on Telephone Conversations </H5>
  The PTT does not resist when the police monitor telephone 
conversations. In all the post offices in Montenegro, that is, 
there are separate rooms through which subscriber cables pass, 
where eavesdropping devices and telephone recording devices have 
been installed; post office employees are not allowed to enter 
except in special cases. 
  Aware of this kind of collaboration between the police and 
the post office, the former Democratic Party [DS] filed a 
criminal charge back in 1990 against several persons because of 
warranted suspicion they committed the crime of unauthorized 
eavesdropping and recording. 
  The basic public prosecutor's office responded to the 
complaint of the Democratic Party in mid-1991 by confirming that 
"in 26 PTT offices in Montenegro there are in fact rooms with 
what are called `cable taps' in which is possible to monitor and 
record other people's telephone conversations." However, it also 
informed the plaintiff that it found no legal basis for 
undertaking criminal prosecution of the "suspects." 
  It is of interest that the basic public prosecutor's office 
said at the time "that the powers of the republic secretary (now 
minister) of police under Article 24 of the Law on Internal 
Affairs are too vague...." 
  The prosecutor's office also observed the following: The 
summary definition of this authority, as represented in the law, 
affords an opportunity for arbitrariness and willfulness on the 
part of the agency of the state and an erroneous assessment of 
the existence of grounds for invoking the authority. In the 
judgment of the basic public prosecutor's office, this is 
incompatible with basic civil rights.... 
  The basic public prosecutor's office promised at that time 
that it would initiate amendment of the legislation in effect in 
the Montenegrin Assembly. However, that never went beyond an 
empty promise. 
<H5>  Bugging Facilities </H5>
  In the meantime the police have made technical advances, and 
now conversations in Kolasin, Cetinje, and Danilovgrad can be 
monitored from Podgorica, conversations in Kotor and Tivat from 
Herceg-Novi, and conversations in Zabljak from Pljevlja. 
  In addition to eavesdropping on telephone conversations, the 
police frequently eavesdrop on conversations in facilities they 
have bugged. The bugging of facilities (offices, apartments, 
houses...) is done by installing highly sensitive microphones in 
the walls (especially under wallpaper), light fixtures, pieces 
of furniture, or anywhere the police imagination can think of. 
The bugging of a facility may be temporary or permanent, again 
depending on the police assessment. This method has one 
technical deficiency. That is, the place where the conversations 
are taped and recorded must not be very far from the place that 
is bugged. For example, if a person "subject to operational 
scrutiny" goes to a hotel, then through collaboration between 
the police and the desk clerk, he is sent to a room that is 
permanently bugged. Usually between eight and 10 rooms are 
bugged in the larger hotels. One of the hotel rooms is always 
"at the service" of the police, and that is the location of the 
"operative" who listens in and tapes conversations of the person 
or persons in whom the police are interested. 
  Policemen, depending on the need, also know how to install a 
hidden camera. They may use three methods at the same time: 
monitoring the telephone conversations, bugging the rooms, and 
tailing. The bugging of a room is defeated most easily by 
turning on the radio or TV, and turning on a water faucet has 
also proved an effective means of defense. 
  In any case, all the observations of the police, reports, 
taped conversations, and so on are coded separately and put in 
the same file. The first and last name of the "suspect" are 
never used as the code. So, the person, the facility, and the 
measure (eavesdropping or tailing), the action, and the file 
itself are given separate codes. 
  The Montenegrin SDB also monitors and records telephone 
conversations on behalf of the KOS [counterintelligence 
service]. Although by law the KOS, our sources say, is required 
to file a request, order and decision of the Montenegrin MUP 
[Ministry of Internal Affairs] for such "services," 
eavesdropping is done on no more basis than a verbal agreement 
between the heads of these two agencies. 
  The equipment which the Montenegrin MUP has for monitoring 
telephone conversations is nevertheless not quite as good as 
what the Serbian MUP has. That is, the Serbian SDB has the 
"5001" system, which is the most up-to-date and was purchased 
from the French, Germans, and English. This system allows 50 
telephones to be monitored from a single point. The system also 
allows computer monitoring of a particular subscriber in that it 
prints out data on all the numbers called. This system can also 
block a large number of telephone lines at the same time, 
normally if the "security people" judge that certain people 
should be prevented from contacting one another by telephone. A 
journalist of POLITIKA has expressed the opinion that "whoever 
has this equipment in his hands has control of the country." 
<H5>  Who Is Monitored? </H5>
  The Montenegrin police regularly follow all the major fairs 
of police equipment in the world. MONITOR has learned that Bosko 
Bojovic, who heads the Montenegrin SDB, attended the world's 
fair of police equipment, technology, and weapons two months ago 
in Paris. He was accompanied by a well-known Podgorica 
businessman, which could suggest that soon even "our" MUP will 
be technically upgraded. As is natural, the price of this police 
equipment will be paid for by the citizens of Montenegro, and 
many will thus be financing eavesdropping on their own 
conversations. 
  For someone to be monitored, there must be warranted 
suspicion of his extremist activity, an activity aimed at 
bringing down the order established by the Constitution. 
Although they cannot be put in that group, Nikola Samardzic, 
former foreign minister, and then Blagoje Lucic, current federal 
minister, as well as Branko Abramovic, former agriculture 
minister in the Montenegrin Government, have been monitored, our 
sources say. 
  If it is true that current ministers have been unlawfully 
monitored, then this greatly strengthens the suspicion that 
certain opposition leaders are monitored in Montenegro. For that 
matter, it has already been leaked to the public that Slavko 
Perovic, leader of the LSCG, has been bugged and that this 
operation was allegedly done by the police under the code 
"Godfather." It is no secret at all that the eavesdropping on 
certain opposition politicians is spoken about openly in the 
other opposition parties. But what is the eavesdropping on 
opposition leaders compared to the bugging of Dobrica Cosic, 
whom the Serbian SDB "bugged," according to the press, while he 
was president of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]? 
  For the present there is no hard evidence that the police 
are 
monitoring the telephone conversations of party leaders in 
Montenegro. Provided, of course, the arrested leaders of the SDA 
[Democratic Action Party] are excluded. However, MUP personnel 
who work in the "ear department," we have learned, have their 
hands full of work and every morning put envelopes containing 
recorded conversations on the desk of Bosko Bojevic. He then 
informs Nikola Pejakovic, minister of internal affairs, about 
the content of the conversations and other knowledge generated 
by the operations. 
  The minister of police, our sources say, reports all the 
more 
sensitive and major operations of the MUP (which include the 
monitoring of important persons) to Momir Bulatovic, president 
of Montenegro, Mile Djukanovic, prime minister, and of course 
Zoran Zizic, the inevitable deputy prime minister responsible 
for monitoring the operation of the police. Since Montenegro is 
the only state in Europe that does not have a parliamentary body 
to oversee the work of the police, it is a closed circle. 
  The police were supposedly depoliticized back in 1989. We 
have had a chance to see what this looks like in practice by 
watching the TV screen when the camera showed the 
"depoliticized" chief of the Montenegrin SDB, Bosko Bojevic, 
attending a closed party congress of the incumbent party. 
Strange that he should not have attended the open congresses of 
the People's Party or the Liberals. Or perhaps he knew in 
advance what they would be saying and adopting there, and he did 
not want to waste his time?

<F P=106> [Article by Olja Obradovic: "Violence With a Government </F>
Stamp"] 
  [Text] Since the Superior Court in Bijelo Polje quashed the 
decision of the investigating judge temporarily suspending all 
the rights of defense counsel, on 1 March the four of them were 
finally able to talk to people of "Muslim faith" suspected of 
the grave crimes of threatening the territorial integrity of the 
FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and unauthorized possession 
of firearms. The conversation in the Pretrial Custody Prison in 
Bijelo Polje, mainly into events that occurred after the arrest, 
lasted from 1300 to 1700 hours. Gajo Joksimovic, investigating 
judge of the Bijelo Polje Superior Court, and Luka Bulatovic, 
warden of the Pretrial Custody Prison, attended the conversation 
between the defense lawyers -- Branko Vukotic and Vladan 
Djuranovic from Podgorica and Velje Muric and Adil Nasufovic 
from Bijelo Polje -- and their 13 clients (four hired other 
lawyers and another four are still at large). 
  All the accused -- Esad Omerovic, Harun Hadzic, Rizah 
Burnazovic, Isad Skenderovic, Umer Hadzic, Rifat Veskovic, 
Hakija Muratovic, Erdzan Fetahovic, Rasim Sahman, Avdo Ciguljin, 
Sefket Brkovic, Sead Gec and Sabahet Spahic -- confirmed that 
from the moment they were arrested until they were brought 
before the investigating judge they were subjected to almost 
unimaginable mental and physical torture. Every one mentioned 
the hood and blindfold and spoke of terrible beatings with 
"fists, kicks, sticks and all kinds of things on the head, soles 
of the feet, and the entire body." 
<H5>  Police Creations </H5>
  Still, the reason why the conversation confined to events 
after the arrest took up four valuable hours of the time of the 
defense counsel will best be explained by excerpts from the 
testimony of a few of them concerning particular police 
inventions. 
  Harun Hadzic was forced to do 100 jumping jacks and 
kneebends. He did not get water; he had to drink from the toilet 
to avoid dehydration. He was beaten until the last moment, even 
now in the corridor as he was being brought before the 
investigating judge. He was not allowed to sleep for three days. 
During interrogation he was exposed to a strong floodlight and 
high temperature thanks to a device he described as an "asbestos 
cap." Exposed to electric shocks, that is, to a device with 
which they touched him behind the ear, causing a strong pain and 
twitching of the legs. The electric shocks and beating lasted at 
least 48 hours. He suspects that he was taken to Foca, since the 
people who drove him there threatened to turn him over to 
Turtle. He described the building where he was interrogated as a 
"labyrinth of many rooms, booths, and bars." It seemed to him 
that the room in which he was tortured was lined with red 
velvet. They threatened to kill him the whole time. 
  Esad Omerovic, a mental patient who was discharged from the 
army in the care of a guardian, was kicked and beaten and hit 
with sticks over his entire body and head. The defense counsel 
had the impression that he neither knew where he was nor why. 
  After his arrest Rizah Burzanovic, hooded and blindfolded, 
was driven in an unknown direction "an hour and a half or two 
hours from Pljevlja." They beat and kicked him over his entire 
body and hit him with sticks. They did not allow him to sleep 
for three days. They threatened to kill him. The investigating 
judge interrogated him at night. 
<H5>  The Middle Ages </H5>
  Umer Hadzic is certain that he was in Foca, which he 
recognized from the window of the room in which he was tortured. 
Along the way his escorts stopped the vehicle to stage an 
attempted escape in order to kill him. They fired shots in the 
air around him and beat him as he attempted to stay near the 
vehicle. They told him to prepare to be shot. When they reached 
Foca, he received numerous blows as he ran the gauntlet. The man 
they referred to as "Vojvoda" [commander] told them not to beat 
him since he was a friend of Lazo Boricic, former head of state 
security. Another man, who he thinks from his speech was a 
Bosnian, threatened to kill him and avenge his brother whom the 
Muslims had "roasted alive." He was "treated" with electric 
shocks over his entire body, especially the genitals. He spent 
at least two days tied to a radiator in a position that did not 
allow him to sit or stand. They threatened they would kill him, 
and also said his children would pay if he did not confess. He 
says that he would recognize some of the people who tortured him. 
  They kicked and beat Erdzan Fetahovic and hit him with 
sticks. They told him that they had also picked up his wife 
("right now they are lining up for her in the other room"). 
  They asked Avdo Ciguljin whether he could count to 10. When 
he said he could, they asked whether he knew how many blows he 
had received. When he said he did not know, they retorted that 
he should count from the beginning. He counted 100 blows on the 
soles of his feet and 50 to his head. They forced a stick into 
him, first into his anus and then into his mouth. 
  Sefket Brkovic's words "If once again I had to go through 
all 
I have gone through, I would find a way to end my life" are 
perhaps the best testimony to the sadism of the torturers 
representing such an important state agency that it is entrusted 
with care for the security of citizens as well as the 
"inviolability of the physical and mental integrity of the 
individual," even though he has been detained on suspicion of 
the most serious crimes. If perhaps the top leadership of the 
Montenegrin government is not privy to the secrets of police 
treatment of imprisoned Muslims, as this issue of MONITOR comes 
off the press, the defense counsel will be trying to inform it 
firsthand. 
<H5>  Under the Constitution and Law </H5>
  The superior court in Bijelo Polje, and we have to hope for 
an honest trial, will decide whether these people took it upon 
themselves "to divide Montenegro and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia." At the same time the president of all the citizens 
of Montenegro must fulfill his promise made in his speech to his 
party's congress that "the law-governed, democratic, and civil 
state" will treat them "strictly under the constitution and law 
and without discrimination." Just that, nothing more. 
  Nevertheless, even the way in which the investigation has 
been conducted does not instill confidence in the specific 
institutions of the "law-governed, civil, and democratic state." 
A majority of those detained told the defense lawyers that the 
attitude towards them during pretrial detention was correct, 
given the circumstances, but also that out of fear of new 
mistreatment they had repeated the testimony extorted from them 
by the police when they were examined by the investigating judge. 
  The presence of prison personnel when the accused are 
interrogated is unthinkable and contrary to the Law on Criminal 
Procedure. The decision to suspend all rights of defense 
counsel, issued 1 February, was supposedly rescinded no later 
than 4 February. However, it was delivered to the defense 
counsel only on 21 February, so that for 17 days the defense was 
prevented from doing its job. While the defense lawyers were 
allowed to examine the papers in the case for the first time 
only on 22 February, some of the government media were given 
information from police and investigation files much earlier. 
Medical examinations were conducted only 12 days after the 
suspects were detained, when visible traces of the abuse might 
have already disappeared. The defense lawyers were informed 
tardily of certain actions in the investigation even after the 
suspension was lifted. In view of the presence of the 
investigating judge, the visits of the defense lawyers to the 
accused were limited by his time. It was not even possible to 
photocopy the file, since the machine in the court was broken, 
and they were not allowed to take the file out even in the 
company of a court employee. 
  MONITOR nevertheless has learned one piece of good news from 
confidential sources: The superior court in Bijelo Polje has 
rejected the motion of the superior public prosecutor to turn 
certain investigatory operations in these cases over to the 
police, although the cases have already been turned over to the 
court.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "From President Rugova's Press </F>
Conference" -- issued by the Democratic League of Kosova] 
  [Text] "The past week was characterized by harsh Serbian 
terror, so that it is very difficult to give exact figures of 
the victims subjected to this repression, which has been taking 
place for several years in Kosova," president of the republic of 
Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said speaking to reporter today in 
Prishtina [words indistinct] places throughout Kosova, he said. 
Imer Bala, a member of the Kosova Parliament, [words 
indistinct] because arms were requested from him, President 
Rugova added. 
  Dr. Rugova told the reporters that military movements have 
been reported along the border with Albania in Vermnica village 
and elsewhere. He also said that additional military units had 
been deployed in Dragash, a town bordering on Albania. 
President Rugova expressed his sympathy on the killing by the 
Serbian border guards of two Albanian citizens last week. "They 
were unarmed. It means that the border between Kosova and 
Albania continues to be the last `Berlin Wall,' a very dangerous 
wall in Europe," he said. 
  The persecution of the Albanian political activists 
continues 
unabated, said Dr. Rugova and mentioned the beginning of an 
another framed political process against 14 Albanians, which 
like the previous ones is aimed at discrediting the peaceful 
movement of the Kosova Albanians. 
  Continuing, President Rugova called on the international 
community to take into consideration the very grave situation in 
Kosova which may escalate. He condemned the ill-treatment of Ms 
Adelheid Felicke-Tiemann, a journalist with the "Deutsche 
Welle." She was ill-treated by the police while in Kosova. 
  Commenting on the latest developments in Gorazde, President 
Rugova said it was a tragedy and the international institutions 
should act more decisively to halt it. "If violence and 
aggression are legalized in Bosnia, many problems will emerge in 
the Balkans and Europe." 
  President Rugova hailed President Clinton's plan on wider 
intervention in Bosnia, and expressed hope that the 
international community would do everything to prevent the 
tragedy and [passage indistinct]. 
  If a summit on the highest level, USA-EU [words indistinct] 
definitely included in the talks and solution, as Kosova was 
part of former Yugoslav federation, a federal unit equal to 
other federal units," President Rugova remarked. 
  Ending his observations, President Rugova reiterated his

  [Text] At a news conference given in Prishtina today, 
Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, said that 
the Kosovar-Albanian border, where the concentration of the 
Serbian Army forces continues, is becoming more and more 
dangerous for the Albanians and expressed his regret over the 
murder of the two unarmed Albanian nationals. For more, Ramadan 
Mucolli from Prishtina: 
  [Mucolli] Speaking about the international community's 
stance toward the Kosova issue, President Rugova said that in 
face of the situation prevailing in Gorazde, Kosova was 
mentioned as a possible target of the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia, which requires a solution. He mentioned the 
viewpoints of the U.S. Secretary of State Christopher on the 
danger of the explosion of war in Kosova and Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM] if the efforts 
for the realization of the project on Greater Serbia still 
continue. 
  President Rugova hailed the commitment of President Clinton 
for a broad intervention in Bosnia in order to defend security 
areas. On this occasion, he drew the attention that if violence 
and repression are legalized, there will be problems in the 
Balkans and the whole of Europe and that the principles of the 
international institutions and the United Nations not to reward 
violence and aggression, but the efforts for peace, agreement, 
and understanding will be devolved. 
  President Rugova said that if a top international summit is 
held with the United States, the European Union, and Russia on 
the solution of problems in former Yugoslavia, we will 
persistently ask that Kosova unfailingly be part of this 
solution, because it was a federal unit of former Yugoslavia 
with equal status to other units and, being a nerve center of 
the crisis, it will be a continuous danger if not solved on the 
basis of the political will of the people and in the Balkan 
context. 
  President Rugova reiterated his demand that Kosova be placed 
under the protection of the international community and 
expressed his hope that the peaceful policy of Albanians will be 
rewarded.

  [Text] [Announcer] With the repressive apparatus 
installed in Kosova and after the commotion about the alleged 
arrest of members of the defense ministry of the republic of 
Kosova, the Belgrade regime is now attempting to find soldiers 
for its army. Based on this pretext, the Serbian police have 
intensified their punitive actions in many Kosova dwelling 
places. Mehmet Haziri has more details: 
  [Haziri] Albanian youths have particularly become targets of 
the Serbian police in Kosova. They are being pursued on two 
pretexts -- to be recruited into the service of the so-called 
Yugoslav Army and for allegedly having trained in various 
military centers in Albania. The Kosova Information Center 
reports that after protesting the alleged arrest of members of 
the Defense Ministry of the republic of Kosova, Belgrade has 
recently been attempting to invent the soldiers of this 
ministry. Thus, the Serbian Prosecutor's Office and Peje 
District Court decided to pre-imprison [paraburgim] youths 
Bedrush Halilaj and Florin Golaj from Lipovec in Gjakove on the 
pretext that upon instructions from representatives of the 
Kosova government in Tirana, they have become militarily 
efficient in Labinot in Elbasan, with the aim of starting an 
armed action in Kosova at the proper moment. 
  Another month of imprisonment has been defined for those 
youths, whom the Serbian police arrested in early April. During 
April, the Serbs in the Kosova prosecutor's offices and courts 
called for pre-imprisonment for many Albanian youths on the 
pretext that they allegedly carried out military training in 
Albania. In the wake of pursuing Albanian youths, Serbian 
recruiters issued draft notices to 125 youths in the Malisheve 
commune this week. On the other hand, repressive actions by the 
police has spread to other strata of the Albanian population. 
On the pretext of searching for weapons or other invented 
schemes, police expeditions during the last two days have raided 
dozens of families in the communes of Mitrovice, Viti, Kamenice, 
Kline, Peje, and Lipjan. 
  In Okllap in Lipjan, the Serbian police confiscated all of 
the pedagogical inspection documents of the education counsels 
in Ferizaj.

  [Text] The Serbian army and police continue to raid 
Albanian families throughout Kosova. Meanwhile, it is reported 
that an Albanian national died from the consequences of torture 
in a command post of the Serbian police. Let us follow a 
telephone report by Mehmet Haziri: 
  [Haziri] Recently, the cases in which the Serbian Army has 
been launching new adventures by helping the police with the 
daily terrorization of the Albanians have become more frequent. 
The Information Commission of the Kosova Democratic Alliance 
[LDK] in Han i Elezit reports that the Serbian soldiers 
stationed in this locality, in collaboration with the police, 
raided six Albanian families in Dine village. It is also 
reported that the soldiers stationed in the barracks in Han i 
Elezit have been maltreating the Albanian citizens of the nearby 
villages for days on end. 
  The LDK confirms that raids and maltreatments of Albanians 
were reported in Mitrovice and Gjilan communes. The bus station 
in Mitrovice has long become a place where the Albanians are 
tortured for no reason. Thus, in the evening of 20 April, the 
police caused serious body wounds to two youths who were found 
in this location. Under the pretext of searching for arms, 
several families in the villages of Zhegel, Lladove, and 
Llashtice in Gjilan were raided and some persons were 
maltreated, among whom was the 83-year-old man Shuaip Ajeti. 
Mehmet Hajrullahu died in Zhegel village in Gjilan last night 
and there are no doubts that he is a victim of police torture. 
  The LDK Information Commission in Gjilan has reported that 
two weeks ago, the deceased was gravely tortured by the police 
on the pretext of handing over weapons.

of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) were early on Monday [25 
April] deployed between the warring local Serb and Muslim troops 
in Gorazde, Muslim enclave in southeast Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
U.N. spokesman said. According to REUTERS, the British, Russian 
and Egyptian soldiers joined the 200 U.N. troops which had 
arrived in Gorazde on Saturday. The aim of the U.N. 
peacekeepers in Gorazde is to form a buffer between the 
belligerent sides, to secure the safety of the humanitarian 
agencies and monitor the withdrawal of the Serb heavy artillery 
to 20 km away from the centre of the town, as called by a NATO 
ultimatum which expires at midnight Tuesday.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Moslem 
authorities in Gorazde have killed, tortured and in different 
ways maltreated several hundreds of Bosnian Serbs, thus abusing 
this U.N.-designated "safe area". About 12,000 Serbs lived in 
this town before the outbreak of the civil war. Moslems did not 
even spare the dead, because they demolished the Serb graveyard. 
Moreover, they pulled down St. George's church built in the 
13th century. The truth about Moslem crimes against Serbs 
started coming out only after the Bosnian Serb army had reached 
the outskirts of the town, having first crushed in a 
counter-attack the Moslem offensive, mounted right from Gorazde, 
the Belgrade dailies VECERNJE NOVOSTI and EKSPRES POLITIKA write 
on Monday. 
  After the failure of the Moslem offensive waged in very 
sight 
of U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) members, the Moslem 
authorities committed horrible atrocities against Serbs, and 
then showed the massacred bodies of the dead to foreign 
reporters claiming that they were victims of "Serb shells and 
snipers." There is "a special job" in some parts of Gorazde 
called "pushing the massacred bodies of dead Serbs" into the 
river Drina, the Belgrade dailies write. 
  In the section of the town under control of notorious Moslem 
fundamentalist Ferid Buljubasic, there is still some 400 Serbs. 
In that section of the town, from which Moslems open mortar and 
sniper fire violating a truce, there are prisoner camps for 
Serbs. In the camp in the Vinarici settlement and 
"printing-works" and "cement works" in Vitkovici near Gorazde, 
hundreds of Serbs (men and women) have been tortured and killed, 
the dailies write. 
  Moslems killed seven Serb soldiers captured in early August 
1992, having tortured them first in the most brutal way. They 
were kept in the Trnovrh prisoner camp overhanging the town. 
One of the captured Serb soldiers, Rade Kacar, cut the agony of 
being tortured and humiliated by hanging himself while the 
bodies of the other six soldiers were thrown into the river 
Drina which runs through Gorazde. In the Serb village of 
Crkvice near Gorazde Moslems killed the entire population and 
completely burned down the village. 
  Western media zealously reported about the U.S. relief 
operation "Provide Promise", but was silent about NATO aircraft 
supplying 15,000 Moslems troops in Gorazde with up-to-date 
weapons over the past months, although Gorazde is a 
U.N.-designated "safe area" and as such should have been 
demilitarized as far back as last spring, the Belgrade dailies 
say. 
  The Bosnian Serb army has come into possession of the 
information that NATO aircraft have been dropping weapons and 
ammunition to Moslems in Gorazde every night in recent months, 
the dailies say.

  [Text] Cajnice, Apr 24 (TANJUG) -- No shots were fired from 
Serb positions around Gorazde since Sunday morning, even though 
the Bosnian Serb command in the region has reported that the 
Moslem side is obstinately trying to provoke return fire and 
obtain an intervention of NATO war planes. The forces of the 
Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) on Sunday continued implementing 
the agreement on Gorazde signed by R.S. president Radovan 
Karadzic and UNPROFOR chief Yasushi Akashi on Friday in 
Belgrade, Bosnian Serb military sources said. 
  The command of the Herzegovina Corps of the Bosnian Serb 
army 
has stated that artillery units have already withdrawn and that 
when the U.N. forces are deployed along the demarcation lines 
between Moslem and Serb forces, the infantry would also withdraw 
to three km away from Gorazde, in line with the Akashi-Karadzic 
agreement. Striving to fully contribute to the implementation 
of the Belgrade agreement on Gorazde, the Bosnian Serbs have 
agreed to the sending of another UNPROFOR unit to Gorazde and a 
wide scale humanitarian mission in that area, the TANJUG 
correspondent has learned from Bosnian Serb army souces. 
  An additional UNPROFOR batallion was to leave Sarajevo for 
Gorazde at 1400 local time and the beginning of the evacuation 
by air of the sick, the wounded and accompanying family members 
when necessary was planned simultaneously. The UNPROFOR 
helicopters which will shuttle from Sarajevo to Gorazde will 
land every time in the Serb territory at Sokolac for Serb 
control of the abidance by the agreement on evacuation, the 
sources said. 
  On Sunday morning just as during the previous night, Moslem 
forces in Gorazde itself intentionaly caused explosions trying 
to imitate a Serb artillery attack in a bid to bring about NATO 
air strikes. Sniper fire was also opened several times Sunday 
on Serb positions, but without effect. However, as the first 
U.N. convoy was entering Gorazde Saturday evening at Kopaci, 
three km away from the town, the Moslems opened sniper fire on 
Serb positions wounding one Serb combattant, under the very eyes 
of French General Andre Soubirou. The general, who was watching 
all this without reacting, just shrugged disinterestedly. The 
NATO planes are frequently flying over the Gorazde front line on 
Sunday in groups of ten, but at allowed altitude and without 
attacking. 
  The Herzegovina Corps command pointed out that there is 
reason to suspect that Moslem infantry would try to take 
advantage of the withdrawal of the Serb forces to take the empty 
space before the U.N. peacekeepers arrive. The Serb forces' 
command has stated that in the past few days, the Moslems in 
Gorazde massacred nearly 200 Serbs remaining in the town. A few 
Serbs who managed to escape from the town at the last minute two 
days ago reported on mass killing of Serbs in the town but could 
not provide precise figures. 
  Many Serb refugees from Gorazde who watched Moslem 
television 
showing massacred bodies and claiming they were Moslems killed 
by Serb artillery in Gorazde actually recognized Serb civilians 
among the killed. Bosnian Serb Captain Boro Ivanovic said there 
were nearly one thousand Serb civilians in Gorazde until a year 
ago. After many murders committed by Moslems, only about 300 
Serbs now remain in the town, he said.

  [Excerpt] Zagreb, April 24 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
appear to have complied with a NATO ultimatum to withdraw three 
kilometers from the center of Gorazde or face air strikes, the 
head of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia said Sunday [24 
April]. In an interview with AFP here, French General Bertrand 
de Lapresle said the Serbs were observing a ceasefire and "have 
withdrawn beyond the three-kilometer line, as far as we can 
tell." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cajnice, 24 Apr (TANJUG) -- The return of Serbs 
expelled from their homes by the Muslims began this afternoon at 
the same time as the deployment of UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] troops along the demarcation line between the warring 
sides on the Gorazde front. Several hundred Serbian civilians 
from Donja Potkozara, Gornja Potkozara, Zupcici, Lug, Visevica, 
and other villages have returned to their homes after almost two 
years spent as refugees. They decided to return after UN 
representatives offered them guarantees that they would be 
secure. On their return the Serbian civilians found utter 
devastation in their villages because the Muslims had razed and 
burned to the ground all houses and other buildings. However, 
they hope that they will receive aid in rebuilding their razed 
homes and that UNPROFOR representatives will be a true guarantee 
that the Muslims will not massacre them in their villages again.

<F P=106> [Report by unidentified reporter from Gorazde--recorded] </F>
  [Excerpts] We are in twelfth hour since the expiration of 
the NATO ultimatum deadline for the withdrawal of the chetniks 
outside the three-km exclusion zone around Gorazde. That NATO 
can easily forget its ultimatum issued to the Serbs is best 
confirmed by chetnik snipers who killed two women this morning: 
One was killed in the suburb of [name indistinct], and another 
one was killed on the bridge over the Drina River in the central 
part of the town. According to details available to us at the 
moment, they have also wounded 15 people. [passage omitted] 
  The latest reports from the region of Kopaci say that an 
armored personnel carrier arrived in the suburb of (?Kokino 
Selo) bringing in fascists who are systematically setting fire 
to houses in the suburb and laying antipersonnel mines. Strong 
explosions are reverberating in the region of Pobjeda 
enterprise: plants belonging to this industrial complex are 
being destroyed. When this report was filed we heard from 
Pobjeda enterprise that chetnik shells completely devastated the 
only (?auxiliary) water supply system with nonpotable water, 
though it has been used as drinking water for the past two 
years. Now the population can use only several freshwater 
sources in the central part of the town, but they are under 
constant sniper fire coming from the other bank of the Drina 
River. [passage omitted]

  [Text] This morning, following the expiry of the NATO 
ultimatum, our correspondent filed this report at about 0000 GMT. 
  Twelve minutes past midnight, two UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] armored carriers carrying Ukrainian soldiers entered 
Gorazde. They were welcomed by antiaircraft weapons fired from 
chetnik positions at the approach to the town. In the town 
center, they came across sniper fire from the hills on the right 
bank of the Drina. The rest of the convoy started entering 
Gorazde at 0145 hours. French General Soubirou, the commander 
of the Sarajevo sector [word indistinct] also arrived aboard 
this convoy. 
  No changes have been sighted at the chetnik positions. The 
snipers are still firing at the main communications and 
crossroads. At 0100 hours sharp, a large-caliber shell landed in 
the town center, followed by several explosions on the outskirts 
of the town. According to initial reports, some people were 
wounded. At 0200 hours, the chetniks on the right bank of the 
Drina were still only a few hundred meters from the hospital.

sometime before 2200 hours. The activities of the aggressor 
have significantly diminished compared to this afternoon and the 
early hours of this evening, but tank and howitzer shells are 
from time to time landing on the town. Firing from infantry 
weapons has also diminished in intensity compared to what it was 
an hour or so ago. However, there are no indications that the 
aggressor is withdrawing, something that is demanded by the NATO 
ultimatum. But there is evidence that attacks on the Rogatica 
and Pale areas of the battlefield are intensifying. Fresh and 
stormy events are probably in store in this area.

<F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Becic for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and </F>
Television] 
  [Text] After a very short break between 1800 and 1900, 
explosions can be heard again in Gorazde. Several apartment 
blocks have been hit by tank shells. Buildings in the immediate 
vicinity of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] were also hit. 
Several shells completely destroyed three apartments. Again, 
there are killed and injured. From 0800 up to this moment, 
according to incomplete statistics, 21 people have been killed 
in Gorazde and 53 wounded. 
  At about 2100 chetnik forces began using anti-aircraft guns 
and infantry weapons to fire on housing in the town center and 
buildings around the hospital. The consequences of these 
activities are not yet known, while at this moment, at about 
2117, howitzer shells are landing on the town. Chetniks today 
launched fierce attacks from the direction of Pale. Four tanks, 
several armored vehicles, and strong infantry forces took part 
in these attacks. Actions from the direction of Rogatica and 
along the demarcation line northwest of the town were 
intensifying. There is no precise information on the events in 
this area.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 23 (TANJUG) -- The column of 
UNPROFOR combat vehicles arrived late Saturday night [23 April] 
in Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, agencies 
reported, U.N. spokesman Maj. Guy Vinet said. UNPROFOR members 
will be deployed in the area three kilometers from the center of 
Gorazde on both banks of the River Drina, which flows through 
the town, declared a safe area a year ago by the U.N. this was 
in keeping with the agreement reached Friday in Belgrade by 
Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) President Radovan Karadzic and 
UNPROFOR head of mission Yasushi Akashi, through the mediation 
of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. The Serbian forces 
around Gorazde are to withdraw to three kilometers from the town 
by Sunday at 00:01 GMT. Otherwise, as NATO council decided 
Friday, they would be exposed to NATO air strikes.

  [Text] [Reporter] The situation today is similar to that of 
recent days. All day the whole town of Gorazde was under heavy 
shelling, which has not stopped this evening. Here is what 
hospital director Alija Dogovic told us about the situation in 
the Gorazde war hospital: 
  [Begin recording] [Dogovic] In the past hour, since it 
became 
dark [passage indistinct] the hours of hell, the wounded in a 
horrifying condition [passage indistinct] without bandages -- 
have been arriving. Many are in a very critical condition. 
[passage indistinct] We have no more people to give blood. They 
cannot come here. Those who are giving blood and those who are 
receiving it are bleeding. [end recording] 
  [Reporter] Foreign journalists were today particularly 
interested in whether the situation in Gorazde had changed after 
NATO's ultimatum to the aggressor's side. Esad Ohranovic, the 
president of the executive committee of the Gorazde district, 
answered the question. 
  [Begin recording] [Ohranovic] The intensity of shelling is 
not the same as during the day, but an occasional shell lands 
even as I am speaking. The Serbs are firing from anti-aircraft 
weapons, but not with the same intensity as before. The 
shelling did not stop after 1900. We could say that the 
intensive shelling stopped around 2000 or 2015. However, they 
have continued shelling and firing from anti-aircraft weapons, 
but with reduced intensity. [end recording] 
  [Reporter] Asked how many causalties there were as a result 
of the chetnik attacks on Gorazde today, Esad Ohranovic said: 
  [Begin recording] [Ohranovic] There are fewer casualties 
than 
yesterday, but I have to tell you that between 0800 and 2000 59 
people were killed and 143 slightly or seriously wounded. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- U.N. chief for former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi has warned the Bosnian Serbs that a 
NATO ultimatum to withdraw their heavy weapons near Gorazde and 
other U.N.-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina would 
not at all be interpreted in a flexible way. REUTERS quoted 
Akashi as giving this warning at a press conference in Zagreb 
late on Sunday. The ultimatum, demanding that the Bosnian Serbs 
pull out their heavy weapons 20 km from the centre of Gorazde, 
Tuzla, Srebrenica, Bihac and Zepa, U.N.-designated "safe areas", 
is due to expire on Wednesday at 3 A.M. (0100 GMT). 
  Akashi said he hoped that the Bosnian Serb military and 
political leadership would consistently observe the relevant 
terms and stressed that the Bosnian Serbs could expect no 
flexibility in complying with the terms set by the ultimatum. 
Drawing attention to the fact that, late on Saturday ahead of 
the expiry of the NATO's first ultimatum on the withdrawal of 
Bosnian Serb forces to 3 km from Gorazde, NATO asked for a 
permission to bomb Serb artillery positions near that Moslem 
enclave in the east of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which Akashi refused 
to issue, REUTERS quoted a Western diplomats as saying that it 
was quite obvious that strong pressure had been put on Akashi 
and adding that many wanted air strikes. 
  The United Nations issued a statement early on Sunday 
specifying that U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and 
not Akashi, would have the final word in deciding whether air 
strikes should be launched or not. NATO circles maintain that 
this change has most probably resulted from the pressure by NATO 
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, who spoke sharply on the 
phone with Akashi late on Saturday, but, nevertheless, failed to 
persuade the Japanese diplomat to change his stand. 
  Diplomatic sources say that Akashi caused indignation in 
NATO 
when he refused to approve air strikes on Saturday, explaining 
that the Bosnian Serbs were withdrawing in line with the terms, 
although they were not completely observing the set deadline.

  [Text] Brussels, April 22 (TANJUG) -- The North Atlantic 
Council late on Friday night [22 April] extended its ultimatum 
to Bosnian Serbs to cmver the other U.N.-designated `safe 
havens' in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A statement released from the 
session said that Bosnian Serb armament would be targeted if 
they attacked the `safe havens' of Gorazde, Bihac, Srebrenica, 
Tuzla and Zepa from heavy weapons or in other ways. The towns 
were designated `safe havens' in spring of 1993.

Haris Silajdzic in unspecified location by Radio Sarajevo studio 
announcer in Sarajevo on 22 April -- live] 
  [Text] [Studio announcer] Esteemed listeneres, we have 
just been informed that we have Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic on the line. Good evening. 
  [Silajdzic] Good evening. 
  [Studio announcer] Mr. Silajdzic, at the beginning of the 
newscast we announced that we had received news that the NATO 
(?ambassadors) had reached a decision on a new ultimatum to the 
Serbian aggressor. We also said that we could not confirm this 
information. Can you confirm it? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes. The ultimatum to the Serbian forces calls 
for their withdrawal by midnight tomorrow [23 April] to a 
distance of three kilometers from the center of Gorazde. If 
they fail to comply, every target within a 20 km radius will be 
bombed. That is the ultimatum. 
  [Studio announcer] Could you comment on what will happen? 
Will the aggressor comply with the ultimatum? 
  [Silajdzic] That remains to be seen. If they do not comply, 
(?punishment) will follow. 
  [Studio announcer] Has this decision come too late? 
  [Silajdzic] Whether it is too late or not -- these are 
academic questions. It is too late for the dead, but it is not 
too late for the living. It is not too late for those who are 
defending themselves. Therefore, we hail this decision, and we 
hope it will be implemented. Thank you. 
  [Studio announcer] Thank you.

  [Text] Jagodina, 24 Apr (TANJUG) -- Biljana Plavsic, vice 
president of the republic of Srpska, said today that by 
withdrawing its forces from around Gorazde the republic of 
Srpska showed the world that it is in favor of the peaceful 
resolution of the crisis, even though its army did not carry out 
any aggression there but was on the defensive. In a Jagodina 
Radio program called "Weekend" she noted that "some people 
regret not having seen bombardment last night, which forebodes 
fresh provocations" and added that for this reason a summit 
between Russia, America, the European Union, and the United 
Nations should be held as soon as possible, in order to clarify 
the issues completely and restore a permanent peace.

  [Text] Banja Luka, April 24 (TANJUG) -- The command of the 
7th Corps of the Moslem force ordered its units which are in 
close contact with forces of the Serb Republic army to open fire 
on all NATO planes which fly over the line of separation, TANJUG 
learned from well informed Bosnian Serb military sources. The 
sources said that the 7th Corps of the Moslem force, in charge 
of central Bosnia-Herzegovina, had issued this order so that the 
blame for the possible downing of NATO planes, with a strong 
media campaign, could be pinned on the Bosnian Serb army and 
their ground positions punished. This would not be the first 
time that Moslem forces down NATO aircraft. In June last year, 
Moslems downed an Italian transport plane, the sources said, 
adding that world media had given little coverage to the 
incident although it had been proved, so that the Moslem 
leadership still relied on this support.

trapped a UN convoy Friday [22 April] when it began retreating 
to Sarajevo after failing to reach the besieged Moslem enclave 
of Gorazde, UNPROFOR spokesman Richard Pernod told AFP. The 
convoy, made up of some 100 French, British and Ukrainian 
peacekeepers from the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR], was on its 
way to relieve Gorazde when it received orders to head back to 
Sarajevo but Serb forces stepped in and have stopped its 
retreat, he said.

  [Text] Zvornik, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb 
authorities will do their best to help find a solution 
acceptable to all, enabling a U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) convoy to proceed to Gorazde, Bosnian Serb army 
sources told TANJUG on Friday [22 April]. The Gorazde-bound 
convoy of 49 combat vehicles, with 141 U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) members from Great Britain and Ukraine and 41 
Norwegian medical workers, on its way from Sarajevo was stopped 
in Rogatica on Thursday by a group 350 Serb women and children. 
The spontaneously gathered group demanded that UNPROFOR 
evacuated all Serbs held captive in the [word indistinct] 
Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. They also demanded the 
return of the bodies of killed Serbs. 
  The Bosnian Serb republic (S.R.) authorities are investing 
every effort towards resolving the situation, Bosnian Serb army 
sources said. The Serbs have agreed that two U.N. platoons be 
deployed in the Gorazde area under Tuesday's S.R.-UNPROFOR 
accord pursuant to which the Serbs proclaimed a unilateral 
ceasefire in the area on Wednesday. In the meantime, UNPROFOR 
Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina British General Sir Michael 
Rose was reported to have ordered the convoy to return to 
Sarajevo. 
  News agencies reported that UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo 
Rob Annink said that Gen. Rose at 1.30 p.m. (1130 GMT) on Friday 
ordered the convoy to return. He added that the order was 
issued for tactical and political reasons. Clashes around 
Gorazde escalated in late March when the Moslems from Gorazde, a 
U.N.-designated `safe area' which should have been demilitarized 
last spring, launched an offensive against Serb positions. The 
offensive has been crushed by a strong Serb counterattack.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The Bosnian Serb army 
headquarters has denied a statement by a U.N. Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) spokesman in Sarajevo to the effect that Bosnian Serb 
forces had blocked a second convoy of peacekeepers for the 
eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde immediately after it 
had left Sarajevo on Sunday [25 April]. The French AFP news 
agency quoted the statement on Sunday. 
  A protest note, which the Bosnian Serb army H.Q. has sent to 
UNPROFOR commands in Zagreb and Kiseljak, says that UNPROFOR on 
Sunday asked a permission for its convoy to pass through the 
Bosnian Serb territory three times and the permissions were 
invariably given them. The note quotes a statement by the 
deputy chief of UNPROFOR command for Bosnia-Herzegovina to the 
effect that the problem with the convoy was that it had not 
started from Sarajevo, because some countries, which had given 
their troops, did not agree to their leaving for Gorazde. 
  This was primarily France, the note states and adds that the 
convoy was at the airport since early morning until the 
afternoon, when its structure was finally changed. This can be 
confirmed by Captain Drole, an officer in the headquarters of 
Colonel Sonic, UNPROFOR chief of staff for Section Sarajevo, 
says the statement. 
  The Bosnian Serb army H.Q. statement says that UNPROFOR 
convoy, which should have left Sarajevo at 10 A.M. (0800 GMT), 
should have consisted of 221 troops from the British, French and 
Ukrainian contingents. However, the convoy, which entered the 
Bosnian Serb territory at 5.05 P.M., consisted of British (117 
members), Egyptian (51), Russian (20), Ukrainian (48), French 
(5) and Nordic (3 members). The note explains that added to the 
newly-formed convoy were some "new members," who had not been 
discussed earlier in the day. They were military observers and 
members of the UNPROFOR civilian affairs, UNPROFOR civilian 
police and UNICEF. 
  We have allowed that too, and the newly-formed convoy 
entered 
the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic at 5.05 P.M. and set 
out for Gorazde, says the protest note.

  [Excerpt] Joint attacks launched by Karadzic's fascists and 
Abdic's phalanges of traitors [Muslim forces of self-proclaimed 
autonomous province of western Bosnia founded by Fikret Abdic] 
were intensified today. Chetniks repeated their artillery 
attacks on the central part of the Bosanska Krupa area this 
afternoon [words indistinct]. 
  Since last night members of rebel-traitor units [Muslims 
loyal to Abdic] have been launching artillery attacks on the 
Liskovac, Todorovo, and Varoska Rijeka areas. On several 
occasions they were backed by chetniks from the so-called Serb 
Krajina in shelling the areas mentioned. The focus of today's 
attacks was the Medik medical equipment factory in Skokovi. 
Several attempts at an infantry breakthrough were made during 
the day and this afternoon a sabotage group from Trzac [town 
held by forces loyal to Abdic] was destroyed. Many people were 
wounded today and one person was killed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Doboj, April 23 (TANJUG) -- Moslem forces mounted 
strong attacks on Serbs in the broader area of Doboj in northern 
Bosnia, while inter-Moslem fighting continued in western Bosnia. 
As reported by military sources of Serbs in Bosnia, the Moslem 
forces were most active on the front near Teslic, southwest of 
Doboj, where, coupled with strong artillery support, they 
executed two strong attacks which were repelled. The town of 
Teslic, too, itself came under mortar fire. 
  There was fighting also northeast of Doboj, where the Moslem 
forces used all weapons at their disposal in the attacks on Serb 
positions. The Serb side was forced to respond, after which the 
attacks ceased. 
  Inter-Moslem fighting in western Bosnia, as reported by the 
Moslem-controlled Sarajevo Radio, continued along all the 
separation lines in the Cazin and Velika Kladusa municipalities. 
There was heavy fighting with the use of artillery and infantry 
since the early morning hours between the forces loyal to Moslem 
radical leader Alija Izetbegovic and the formations of the 
autonomous province of western Bosnia, which was last year 
formed the followers of peaceful solution to the crisis in 
Bosnia.

  [Text] Petrovac, 23 Apr (TANJUG) -- Throughout the day and 
at various time intervals, particularly this afternoon, NATO 
planes have been violating the air space over Petrovac, Drvar, 
Kljuc, the Serb municipality of Bihac, Krupa on the Una River, 
and other municipalities in the western part of the republic of 
Srpska. Supersonic aircraft carried out low-altitude and 
illegal flights, demonstrating their force and particularly 
making their presence felt over the Bihac front where they were

  [Excerpt] There was no peace in the Travnik municipality 
today. The Serb-chetnik aggressors are firing shells of the 
largest caliber at civilian targets in the town and its suburbs. 
The aggressors also shelled defense lines in the Turbe area and 
launched combined infantry and artillery attacks on the Vlasic 
plateau. Five civilians were killed and a number wounded by 
howitzer and tank fire from enemy strongholds. As we file this 
report at 1850 the combined artillery and infantry attacks are 
still going on at 1850. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 22 April carries in its 
regular 41-minute newscast three reports on fighting in the 
republic. 
  Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "after 
attempting two unsuccessful infantry and tank breakthroughs in 
the areas of Vranovaca and Boderiste, the enemy intensified the 
shelling of the Brcko defense line in the afternoon. Civilian 
objectives were also targeted. During an hours-long, relentless 
shelling of the defense lines on the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca 
route, chetniks from the direction of Cadjavac and Tadici used 
tanks, recoilless guns, all caliber mortars to fire several 
hundred shells. The chetnik artillery and tank attack did not 
affect the stability of our positions. The same can be said for 
sniper activity directed at Djukici, Vranovaca, and Boderiste." 
  The studio announcer introduces a report by an unidentified 
correspondent on the situation in Breza and says that "on three 
occasions today, the aggressor's artillery fired at Breza." The 
correspondent says that "the first time occurred at around 1240 
when the aggressor used howitzers from the region of Nabozici. 
Several shells were launched at the outskirts of Breza. It is 
redundant to mention that the positions from which the chetnik 
artillery is firing are located well inside the Sarajevo 
exclusion zone, that is, within the 20 km radius. Some time 
later, several shells again landed on the outskirts of Breza, 
after which a deceptive calm settled in. However, at around 
1605, the chetniks again used artillery to shell the residential 
area of Breza with seven 122-mm howitzer shells. The general 
alarm signal was again sounded on the territory of our commune 
and is still in effect at the time of filing this report at 
1758." 
  Sead Custovic reports from the 1st Corps Information Service 
and says that "two months have gone by since the cease-fire was 
agreed upon in Sarajevo, yet during all this time the chetniks 
have not even tried to observe it. The chetniks began the day 
by throwing hand grenades in the district of (?Aerodrom). This 
was followed by machine gun barrages from Velika Kula and 
Baletici directed at the defense lines [words indistinct]. This 
affects primarily Lemze, which was targeted by Tromblon shells 
from the Rajlovac barracks and a portable rocket launcher from 
Zecja Glava and [name indistinct]. The citizens must exercise 
caution because the criminals may at any moment turn to shelling 
the city. This is implied by the movements of their manpower 
and hardware sighted today, and the dogged work of engineering 
units on the reinforcement lines."

  [Excerpt] Zvornik-Bratunac, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- This morning 
Muslims launched artillery and infantry attacks on Serbian 
territory and defense lines of the Bosnian Serb republic army, 
whose final aim is to capture the Serbian part of Sarajevo. The 
attacks have not stopped this evening, TANJUG's correspondent 
has learned from Serbian military circles. 
  It is specified that, after several days of preparations and 
constant attacks, Moslem units launched attacks from the area of 
Olovo, Cemerka and Mountain Zvezda [all north of Sarajevo], and 
from the Breza and Visoko areas [northwest of Sarajevo]. They 
are using all available weapons. 
  The main targets of the Moslem offensive activity are 
Serbian 
villages and defense positions of the republic of Srpska army in 
the area of Ilijas [northwest of Sarajevo, toward Visoko], 
Srednje and in the Nisici plateau [both north of Sarajevo]. The 
attacks were accompanied by strong artillery support and mortar 
fire. 
  Republic of Srpska army units are responding to all attacks 
and successfully thwarting Moslem attempts at an infantry 
breakthrough of Serbian defense lines. Circles in the republic 
of Srpska army point out that the Moslems' intention is to cut 
the Ilijas-Srednje-Nisici communication link and take control of 
the Nisici plateau. They would then direct their actions toward 
Sarajevo, aiming at severing Serbian territory and occupying the 
Serbian part of Sarajevo. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, April 23 (TANJUG) -- Delegations of 
Bosnian Croats and Moslems failed Saturday [23 April] to reach 
agreement in Sarajevo on naming the future president of the 
Moslem-Croatian Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As reported 
by the Croatian radio, the deadline for reaching the agreement 
was extended until next week. The delegations headed by Bosnian 
Croatian leader Kresimir Tubak and Prime Minister of the Moslem 
Government in Sarajevo Haris Silajdzic set forth, as claimed by 
the same source, their pros and cons of the candidate for 
president, giving legal and political reasons. 
  Invoking the Washington Accord on forming Moslem-Croatian 
Federation in Bosnia, signed earlier this year under strong U.S. 
pressure, the Croatian side sought to see a Croat as head of the 
first president of the Moslem-Croatian Federation. The same 
source set out that the Croats were prepared also for a 
compromise: This post they would yield to the Moslems, but on 
condition Silajdzic be named instead of the proposed Moslem 
leader Alija Izetbegovic, whom the Croats have no wish to see 
under any circumstances heading the joint federation.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 22 (AFP) -- The final UN military 
observer held by Bosnian Serb forces was freed Friday afternoon 
[22 April], said UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force] 
spokesman Major Eric Chaperon. The observer, who was named as 
Dutch Major Van Baal, was freed along with his Serb interpreter, 
the United Nations Protection Force spokesman said. Van Baal 
informed his Sarajevo headquarters of the men's release, the 
circumstances of which were not detailed. 
  The two men went missing April 11, the day after the first 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strike on Serb forces 
besieging the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. 
Fifty-eight unarmed UN military observers were placed under 
house arrest by Serb forces in areas under their control in 
reprisal for that air strike and a second strike a day later.

investigative officials have secured the arrested eleven members 
of the French non-governmental humanitarian organizations

Command, recalling that illegal arms and ammunition transport 
was violating the U.N. Security Council ban on arms deliveries 
to the former Yugoslavia, on Thursday disclaimed that the French 
nationals were held hostage.

  [Text] British Prime Minister John Major has sent a letter 
to Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which, among other things, he refers to 
the current aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  I am horrified by the brutality of the Bosnian Serb 
offensive 
on Gorazde. The basic task now must be a cease-fire not only in 
Gorazde, but throughout Bosnia. To this end Great Britain is 
actively taking part in the discussions in NATO and in all 
organizations in which a solution to this is being sought. A 
cease-fire by itself is not sufficient. A cease-fire must be 
followed by an agreement on a final solution that will require 
important territorial concessions by the Bosnian Serbs. The 
tragic events of the past few days stress the urgent need for 
the renewal of the peace process, the letter from Britain's 
Prime Minister John Major to President Izetbegovic says.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the presidency 
of our country, today sent a letter to John Major, the prime 
minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland. In the letter, President Izetbegovic thanked Prime 
Minister Major for his letter of 21 April. I am pleased that 
the Minister of State Douglas Hogg will visit Sarajevo during 
the first week of May. We will welcome him and wish him success 
in his mission. As you suggested, during the visit we can agree 
on the date and the program of my and my prime minister's visit 
to London. I also wish to thank you for your message regarding 
the tragedy of Gorazde and for your government's active role in 
passing the latest UN and NATO resolutions. These resolutions 
have considerably alleviated the situation for the tens of 
thousands of Gorazde citizens but unfortunately peace and safety 
from Serb attacks are still far away. 
  I am glad to hear that your government shares the view that 
a 
peaceful solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina implies the withdrawal 
of Karadzic's Serbs from the considerable part of the occupied 
territories. In our view, these are the areas with the majority 
Muslim and Croatian population before the aggression, President 
Izetbegovic says in conclusion of his letter to British Prime 
Minister John Major.

delegation of the Russian State Duma, led by Nikolay Bezbirodov, 
deputy chairman of the Commiteee for Defense and Security, 
arrived in Pale today and began talks with Vladimir Lukic, prime 
minister of the republic of Srpska. The two sides are 
discussing the present political and security situation in the 
wake of last night's NATO ultimatum to Serbs in the republic of 
Srpska and the agreement which Slobodan Milosevic, president of 
the Republic of Serbia, and Radovan Karadzic, president of the 
republic of Srpska, reached with Yasushi Akashi, the UN 
secretary general's special envoy, in Belgrade last night. The 
Russian parliamentarians arrived in Pale with specific proposals 
involving various aspects of economic and cultural cooperation 
between the Russian Federation and the republic of Srpska.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Major Zdenek Zezula, chief of the </F>
Civil Defense Authority, by Ladislav Lenk; place and date not 
given: "Life Is a Series of Somersaults"] 
  [Text] Under the previous regime, civil defense was 
an unbelievably complex and thoroughly organized institution 
that, on the basis of its composition and principles of 
functioning, was more reminiscent of a kind of territorial 
defense army or home guard--which was not exactly in harmony 
with the Geneva protocols. But, with the birth of the Czech 
state, even civil defense is getting a totally new look. We 
spoke of this with General Major Zdenek Zezula, engineer, who 
was put in charge of the Czech Republic Civil Defense Authority 
midway through last year. 
  [Lenk] Government Resolution No. 126 decided to radically 
change the civil defense system. Can you comment on the changes? 
  [Zezula] Government Resolution No. 126 was adopted in March 
of last year and, in the months that followed, some portions of 
the resolution were fulfilled. However, that cannot be said of 
the task that called for working out a new concept of civil 
defense by 30 June. The concept was such that the minister 
characterized it as casting the existing status in concrete for 
an additional two to three years. That is why, when I took on 
the job on 1 July, I first had to answer the question where 
civil defense would belong at all. Was it to be part of the 
Ministry of Defense or the Ministry of Interior, or would it be 
a totally independent ministry? Following intensive 
negotiations, the view finally arrived at indicated that it 
would perhaps not be suitable for civil defense to currently 
leave the Ministry of Defense. But it would have to be created 
as a completely autonomous system so that, in the future, on the 
basis of political decisions, it could be transferred elsewhere 
at any time. That is what we based our subsequent work on when 
we proposed to the minister that certain steps be taken and when 
he accepted these proposals. One of the first and fundamental 
steps was the requirement that the military aspect of civil 
defense, which cast doubt upon the position of civil defense in 
the eyes of foreign countries--that is to say, the fact that 
military rescue regiments were subordinated to the General 
Staff--had to be changed very rapidly. 
  [Lenk] It is precisely this that was probably in conflict 
with the Geneva protocols.... 
  [Zezula] You are right. It was a legacy of the previous 
developments and the mission of civil defense at the time. It 
was therefore decided that the transition would be accomplished 
as of 31 December 1993. And this was successfully done. To take 
over regiments is one thing, but to do it in such a manner that 
the regiments would not recognize the fact that someone else was 
in command, particularly from the standpoint of their material, 
financial, and other support, was a matter that, at that time, 
literally kept me awake every night. Suffice it to say that we 
had to actually create an entire logistics system at the same 
time that, in the final analysis, must be capable of taking care 
of not only the regiments, but also the entire nonmilitary 
portion of the civil defense system. 
  [Lenk] How did the mission of the regiments change on the 
basis of their altered subordination? 
  [Zezula] Basically, the mission did not change. The 
regiments 
are perceived as central forces and resources of civil defense 
that should be used if local regional nonmilitary portions of 
the civil defense system prove unable to liquidate the 
consequences of disasters, catastrophes, and other extraordinary 
events in times of peace. 
  [Lenk] I am coming to the nonmilitary civil defense 
components. What kind of fundamental changes will they undergo? 
  [Zezula] I would say that it involved, speaking 
symbolically, 
yet another somersault. And it was much worse. Initial work on 
the project began sometime last year, in the spring, when the 
civil defense leadership promised the heads of okres offices 
that okres civil defense staffs would be done away with. I 
learned of it while mapping out the situation sometime in 
mid-August, and I was horrified to find out what was being done 
in that regard and what the views were as to how the system 
should function at all in the future. Moreover, there was a 
decision that the steps would have to be accomplished by 31 
December. But we managed it. In August, the appropriate 
materials were dispatched to the government, and then in 
September the materials were forwarded to the Defense Council of 
the state. The council recommended that the material be 
finalized, and, in November, Government Resolution No. 660 made 
the change possible. It was a fairly stressful situation because 
we had to eliminate the okres civil defense staff order of 
battle as early as September so that we could let people go 
within the time limits stipulated by law. 
  [Lenk] In place of the civil defense staffs, there are 
sections for the protection of the population at okres offices 
and municipal offices. What will they be doing? 
  [Zezula] Essentially the same as the okres civil defense 
staffs were doing. 
  [Lenk] You have in mind the building of shelters, the 
creation of stockpiles, training... 
  [Zezula] Yes, perhaps even that. But the whole problem lies 
elsewhere. What is involved here is the fact that, although the 
chief of an okres office has the responsibility for civil 
defense, he had no one in his office to solve such problems. The 
civil defense staffs stood outside, and relationships were 
highly complex. So it was said that, if the chief of the okres 
office is responsible, let him have someone subordinate to him 
who can work on these matters. 
  [Lenk] But, in this case, there can be no military 
personnel. 
  [Zezula] No, the sections for the protection of the 
population will actually not have a single soldier. 
  [Lenk] And what will the relationship be between your office 
and those sections? 
  [Zezula] We shall direct them methodologically. That is 
because their mission will in fact be identical with that of the 
civil defense staff, which functioned here until now. There is 
an entire scale of functions--communication, warning, protecting 
the population, training, maintenance, etc. 
  [Lenk] So you would like to say that those "popular" alerts 
at factories and offices and in schools, where, as the saying 
goes, there were monthly idiotic actions involving gas masks, 
will continue? 
  [Zezula] You know, perhaps you will not believe what I am 
about to say to you, but I have received material from the 
United Nations having to do with requirements for the civil 
defense of the population, and, if we were to conduct ourselves 
in accordance with this material, we should have to expressly 
intensify our activities. 
  [Lenk] What kind of threat is there anyway? Military, 
civilian, some other kind? 
  [Zezula] Of course, also military threats. But civil defense 
today, as can be seen from the supplemental protocols 
accompanying the Geneva Agreements, is something altogether 
different. Briefly stated, what is involved is that civil 
defense be capable of making maximum use of its resources to 
benefit the population in times of peace--that is to say, in the 
case of disasters, catastrophes, etc. So that you should 
understand what I am saying, this is precisely the kind of 
activity that was perceived by the former civil defense system 
as an odd job. And there is absolutely no reason why our 
resources should not be utilized in peacetime. 
  [Lenk] What then is ahead for civil defense this year? 
  [Zezula] First of all, we are working on the Civil Defense 
Law, the principles of which should be presented to the 
government sometime in the fall of this year. At the same time, 
work is going on regarding the concept of civil defense; at the 
present time, interministerial estimating procedures are under 
way. The concept is to be presented to the government for 
discussion in the first quarter of this year. 
  [Lenk] Will the Civil Defense Authority be scheduled for 
transfer out of the Ministry of Defense, after all? 
  [Zezula] For the next two to three years, the situation is 
unequivocally given, which was also stated by the chairman of 
the Defense and Security Committee in parliament: The system of 
civil defense must be created within the framework of the 
Ministry of Defense but as an autonomous system. That is, thus, 
our principal task. We are even initiating the reorganization of 
regiments into rescue formations; that is what they will now be 
called. We are moving the regiment from Varnsdorf to Rakovnik 
because it is supposed to be involved in protecting the 
population of western and northwestern Bohemia and cannot get 
there at all from Varnsdorf in the winter. We are also resolving 
the problem of identifying the military portions of civil 
defense so that it would be clear that this is not an army--we 
will have different uniforms with our own emblem on them. So 
much for the military component of the civil defense system. The 
nonmilitary component is faced with a complicated task--the 
activity involving the separation of the civil defense functions 
from okres offices must be started, which means that, for 
example, we shall have to train all those people who entered the 
system at the okres level.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Army Tested Small Pox"] </F>
  [Text] Prague -- Although only a month ago army officials 
kept quiet about the small pox virus ever having been studied in 
Czechoslovakia, the army admitted yesterday that military 
scholars worked with this dangerous virus in the 1960's and 
1970's. Moreover, according to the former employees of the 
Military Health Institute, the small pox virus has never been 
destroyed. 
  There was no small pox virus in the viral strain bank that 
the army liquidated last February, while, according to 
information available, it was not destroyed in the 1980's 
either. So far, none of the army or civilian officials we asked 
has explained what has actually happened to the small pox virus. 
  The director of the Central Military Health Institute, 
Vladimir Radovnicky, believes that the virus was destroyed 
between 1976 and 1978. "The small pox virus strain (variola 
maior) was here once, because there is a diagnostic serum. It 
was a problem of the 1970's. The strain was probably destroyed. 
Nevertheless, I cannot give a definite answer of when and how 
it was destroyed. I can only confirm that the small pox virus 
was not in the strain bank that was destroyed earlier this year. 
It would be hard for me to trace what happened in the 1960's and 
1970's," he said. He then emphasized that there is no viral 
strain, even less the small pox one, in his institute now. 
  A former employee of the same institute, who wishes to 
remain 
anonymous, and who used to work with the small pox viruses, 
asserted that, after the small pox research was concluded in the 
1970's, the strain was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a 
special container. 
  In 1979, when thanks to the world-wide systematic 
inoculation, small pox was completely suppressed, the General 
Commission for Elimination of Small Pox recommended that all 
remaining stock of small pox virus be either destroyed or 
transferred to reference laboratories in the United States and 
the USSR. "We have not respected the research recommendation by 
the world commission out of laziness, rather than out of bad 
intentions," the former staffer of the research laboratory 
admitted.

  [Excerpt] Negotiations between the delegations of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government 
have begun in Sarajevo. They are to discuss the implementation 
of the constitution of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Washington 
agreement. Ankica Bosavljak reports: 
  [Begin Bosavljak recording] A working meeting beteen the 
Croat and Bosnian Muslim sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina began in 
Sarajevo this morning. The meeting is intended to prepare 
deputies for the upcoming session of the Assembly of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiating teams are headed by Kresimir 
Zubak, president of the presidential council of the Croat 
republic of Herceg-Bosna, and Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic. The final result of today's talks should solve the 
dilemma about the election of the future president and vice 
president of the federation and the prime minister-designate of 
the federal government. Even if no names are made public, it 
will be known which nation will provide which officials. 
  In a break at 1400, Kresimir Zubak told us that during the 
first part of the meeting they discussed humanitarian and 
economic issues, and that though the talks were successful, the 
more difficult, political part of the agreement was to follow. 
Kasim Trnka, minister of justice in the Bosnian Government, was 
also optimistic in his evaluation of today's talks. He 
expressed hope that a successful agreement will be reached.

  [Text] Knin, 22 Apr (TANJUG) -- The new government of 
national unity of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK]--with 
Borislav Mikelic as prime minister--held its first working 
session today. The government reviewed the implementation of the 
Zagreb agreement and preparations for the continuation of the 
negotiating process with Croatia and the UN. 
  As Mikelic told journalists after the session, at tomorrow's 
talks on the implementation of the cease-fire agreement with 
Croatia -- to be held in Turanj near Karlovac -- the Serb side 
will raise the issue of certain corrections to the buffer zones; 
that is, the line of separation. 
  We must raise this issue because we have been tasked by the 
parliament, and we are also forced by complaints from the field. 
We will reexamine the maps and see what people have not 
accepted in the implementation of the agreement, Mikelic 
stressed. 
  The government also adopted stances on the forthcoming talks 
with the UN special envoy, Yasushi Akashi. As it was said 
today, the government will set firm conditions, the fulfillment 
of which will be a precondition for the resumption of talks with 
Croatia. 
  First of all, Krajina will demand at least a partial 
annulment of provision 12 of UN Security Council Resolution 820 
to make possible talks and negotiations on equal basis, Mikelic 
said. 
  The Krajina delegation for talks with Akashi will comprise 
RSK president Milan Martic, prime minister Mikelic, and foreign 
minister Milan Babic. 
  The delegation will also raise the issue of the 
reconstruction of Vukovar, for which, according to Mikelic, 
funds have been secured but have been given to Croatia. We will 
demand, he said, that the funds be used and that reconstruction 
begin. 
  The RSK government also has one condition for talks on 
economic relations with Croatia -- the payment of pensions. 
  "Croatia must honor this to open talks on economic 
relations. 
The reopening of traffic links is at the moment out of the 
question," Mikelic said categorically. 
  According to figures Mikelic presented yesterday while 
explaining his government's program, around 40,000 pensioners 
who worked in Croatia are demanding to be paid pensions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stipe Mesic, former Yugoslav president and </F>
current president of the Croat Lower House, and Josip Manolic, 
president of the Croat Upper House, by Erich Rathfelder; place 
and date not given: "`Tudjman Must Resign'"] 
  [Text] [Rathfelder] Mr. Manolic, Mr. Mesic, you were 
founding members of the present Croatian government party, the 
Croatian Democratic Community (HDZ), and now you want to form a 
new party. Why? 
  [Manolic] We can no longer work in a party that approves of 
the policy conducted by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. We 
have been following this president's deficiencies with great 
concern for a year now. What was crucial to our decision is the 
disagreement over policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is once 
again making sad headlines, but we have also been concerned 
about the development of democracy in our country. 
  [Rathfelder] What mistakes has Tudjman made in Bosnia? 
  [Manolic] We were both in favor of a single 
Bosnia-Herzegovina within its acknowledged borders. The three 
nations were to have equal rights there. But even before the 
war started, Tudjman agreed with Serb President Milosevic to 
split up Bosnia-Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia. Neither 
Milosevic nor Tudjman had, however, expected the Muslims to 
resist this plan so vigorously. When the plans for division 
failed, the Croatian president, in agreement with the lobby of 
Croatian Western Herzegovina, decided more than a year ago to 
start a war against the Muslims. This was a destructive act for 
Croatian politics. 
  [Mesic] The war in Bosnia is a truly absurd situation that 
is unprecedented in history. Croatia fought its only ally, the 
Bosnian Muslims, although we are still inferior to our main 
adversary. Thank goodness the Washington Agreement, which we 
warmly welcome, has changed the parameters of policy. What 
particularly pleases me is that reconciliation is going 
comparatively smoothly. This shows that the hatred between the 
two nations was artificially created. There should never have 
been a war between the two. 
  [Rathfelder] How can you explain Tudjman's sudden change of 
opinion? 
  [Mesic] We do not know whether Tudjman has changed his 
personal view. The fact is that after the Washington Agreement 
all those who were in power before in Herceg-Bosna are still 
there; this means all those who wanted to divide Bosnia, who 
promoted the war, and who are only interested in establishing 
the state of Herceg-Bosna in spite of the agreed federation. 
  [Manolic] This touches on the second reason we want to 
disassociate ourselves from Tudjman. We want Croatia to become 
a constitutional state where human rights and democratic freedom 
are observed. Undemocratic practices have also been noticeable 
in the government party HDZ. We wanted to democratize it. 
  [Rathfelder] Does forming a new party mean that you have 
given up hope that the HDZ can be reformed? 
  [Manolic] Not only that. A new party will strengthen the 
democratic opposition in Croatia. A strong opposition could 
make various institutions more democratic. This is the first 
step. The second step would be to prevent the president from 
conducting his dishonest policy. 
  [Rathfelder] Will you manage to pull enough HDZ 
parliamentarians over to your side to make their absolute 
majority in parliament totter? 
  [Manolic] There have, of course, been intense discussions. 
This is why Tudjman is getting nervous; they are trying to 
pressure us. All government party deputies have been urged to 
declare their loyalty to Tudjman. Our telephones are being 
monitored, and police measures are reminiscent of those taken 
against dissidents during the communist era. 
  When we formed the HDZ, we wanted to break the one-party 
rule 
of the old regime. In this respect, there were no differences 
between myself and Tudjman. Like Tudjman, I was a communist; we 
wanted to continue the tradition of the Croatian Spring of 1971 
and create a democratic Croatia. But Tudjman has kept the old 
leadership principles, he makes all decisions autocratically. 
  [Rathfelder] Tudjman still has plenty of support. And he is 
backed by the powerful clan of the Herzegovinians. 
  [Mesic] These politicians from western Herzegovina are not 
powerful. The majority of Croatians and the entire church have 
spoken out against the policy of dividing Bosnia. Certain 
people are responsible for establishing concentration camps. 
There was hope of finding a reason to accuse the Bosnian Army 
of driving Croats out by withdrawing Croat forces from several 
areas in central Bosnia. They have destroyed a large part of 
Mostar. And this dishonest policy was supported by Zagreb. 
  [Rathfelder] This is a harsh attack on Tudjman! Does this 
mean he has to resign? 
  [Mesic] He must, indeed, draw the conclusions. 
  [Rathfelder] Why did you not act a year ago? You might 
have been able to prevent the catastrophe then. 
  [Manolic] If we had been more firm at that time, we would 
have been eliminated. Croatian paramilitary forces were 
established in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Their crimes were supported 
by Defense Minister Gojko Susak. And these people would not 
even have survived for a month, if Tudjman had not supported 
this course. 
  [Rathfelder] Is the public in Croatia aware of the Croatian 
crimes? 
  [Mesic] I do not think so. There is a media blockade; 
Croatian television has played the worst role in this war. But 
the war criminals will be persecuted. They must be convicted by 
the courts. We know who killed Muslims in Stupni Do, Ahmici, 
and Prozor. Some murderers have changed their names, others are 
living here in Zagreb, in the Intercontinental Hotel, protected 
by Minister Susak (Bosnian-Croat leader Mate Boban, E.R.). 
  [Rathfelder] Is all this digging Tudjman's political grave? 
  [Mesic] This policy was exclusively his choice. But you 
cannot ignore international responsibility in this context. The 
international community has had its share in the war in Bosnia. 
Feeding the victims before they are killed is simply not enough. 
Lord Owen promoted a division of Bosnia rather than safeguarding 
the unity of the state. Serbia was encouraged to continue its 
aggression, and Croatia was tempted with the prospect of gaining 
27 percent of the Bosnian territory. But the resistance of the 
Bosnian Muslims has confused the international scene.

  [Text] The Presidium of the Croatian Democratic Community 
[HDZ] today addressed a message to the members of the HDZ and 
the Croatian public. We will broadcast the message in its 
entirety. 
  At a critical historic moment in the struggle to defend 
Croatian state sovereignty, when we have achieved the greatest 
results and obtained recognition from the whole of the 
international community for our consistent, peace-loving, and 
democratic policy, but while we are still facing serious 
challenges and uncertainties on the path of establishing full 
sovereignty over Croatian areas under the protection of the 
peace forces -- but in fact under Serb occupation -- and the no 
less grave problem of establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina; 
in such internationally complex circumstances, we are facing an 
attempt to cause a rift in the HDZ. The HDZ Presidium is, 
therefore, addressing the HDZ members and public with the 
following message: 
  The initiative launched by Josip Manolic and Stipe Mesic to 
form a new political party called the Croatian Independent 
Democrats [HND] marks the final stage of their departure from 
the HDZ's program and policy. The process of their departure 
from the HDZ's central policy has been under way for more than a 
year, and it gained momentum after the second general convention 
of the HDZ, held on 15 October 1993. 
  Manolic and Mesic protested their deep dissatisfaction with 
decisions adopted with an overwhelming majority at the 
convention. Their objections referred to the new program 
envisaging the completion of the transformation of the HDZ from 
a Pan-Croatian democratic movement [opcehrvatski demokratski 
pokret] into a Pan-Croatian and all-people's party [opcehrvatska 
and opcenarodna stranka] which bases its democratic policy on 
the principles of Christian civilization. They expressed 
particular disapproval over the new party leaders and the HDZ 
presidium that was elected in a secret ballot at the convention. 
  Over the past few months Manolic and Mesic were increasingly 
open in expressing their views that were contradictory to those 
of the HDZ leadership, the president of the republic, and the 
prime minister in all important issues concerning internal and 
foreign policy. 
  Through their separate political activity and the initiative 
to launch a new party, Manolic and Mesic continued and deepened 
the work of those from the opposition and from abroad -- the 
letter of the six and the Initiative Circle -- who called for a 
change in the constitutional order, the resignation of the 
president of the republic, and early elections. 
  Considering the circumstances in the internal and 
international spheres, there can be no doubt as to the 
intentions and consequences of such activity. The attempt to 
cause a parliamentary and constitutional crisis, and especially 
the discrediting of the state policy of the president of the 
republic did not and cannot aim at anything other than the 
destabilization of the internal order and the weakening of the 
international position of democratic Croatia, and consequently 
the weakening of Croatia's negotiating positions in resolving 
the problem of the occupied Croatian areas, ending the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the realization of the Croat-Bosnian 
Muslim Federation and confederation, as well as in reaching 
economic and financial agreements with other countries. 
  Naturally, respecting the constitutional and democratic 
rights of every citizen, the HDZ Presidium recognizes Manolic's 
and Mesic's right to hold differing views and form a separate 
party. However, the HDZ Presidium has not only the right, but 
also the obligation toward HDZ members and the Croatian public 
to present its view on their stances and activity, because this 
is not only an attempt to create a rift in the HDZ as a majority 
party, but also an attempt to change the policy of the state. 
  The Croatian people have achieved their sovereignty and the 
Croatian state has secured its place in today's world under the 
leadership of the HDZ owing to the correctness of its policy and 
the stability of its democratic order. By pursuing such a 
policy, Croatia has gained trust and made friends and allies in 
the modern world. On the other hand, the world, the important 
international players, need a stable Croatia as a reliable 
factor in the creation of a new international order in this part 
of Europe. 
  In whose interest is then the destabilization of Croatia? 
  Only people who are politically blind and yearn for power 
or those who cannot reconcile themselves to an independent and 
sovereign Croatian state. Precisely because it is obvious to 
every rational human being the attempt by Manolic and Mesic to 
bring about a division and a constitutional crisis is doomed to 
failure. 
  Of the 16 deputies that they claim to be in the Initiative 
Committee of their party, several have already denied any 
connection with them. The HDZ has retained the majority in both 
Croatian Assembly chambers, while messages of support for the 
HDZ Presidency and reports of a growing membership are being 
received, precisely because of the departure of Manolic and the 
like. 
  Attempts to cause a division and to weaken the HDZ are 
already turning into a process of strengthening and 
consolidation of the HDZ as the focal party on the Croatian 
political scene. The HDZ will resume its tried and tested 
policy at both the domestic and international levels without 
taking any right or left turns away from its program principles 
and goals. 
  The HDZ will remain a pioneer in the construction of a 
democratic Croatia in the period of economic and cultural 
renaissance, in the construction of a legal system. The HDZ 
will encourage private entrepreneurship and resolutely struggle 
to overcome all remains of the old communist regime, all 
bureaucratic, criminal, and immoral phenomena. 
  The HDZ Presidency is calling on all its members and 
deputies 
in the Croatian Assembly, in county and municipal assemblies, to 
justify the trust placed in them by the people who elected them. 
  A question now arises of personal responsibility, before 
public and party bodies, for the conscientious execution of the 
duties entrusted, for regular participation in the Assembly 
Chambers, and the responsible implementation of party policy. 
  All civil servants are requested to fulfill their 
obligations, including the one on keeping state secrets. They 
also bear collective responsibility for their own specific 
areas, especially with regard to economizing at all levels. 
  Personal changes that will take place in the leaderships of 
the Assembly Chambers -- given the democratic right of a 
majority party -- will not cause any changes in Croatian policy 
either at domestic or international levels. On the contrary, 
they will insure its more consistent implementation. 
  Similar and even greater turmoil than that in the HDZ is 
also 
present in the opposition parties. They are the expression of 
democratic shifts in the balance of political alliances and will 
serve to strengthen the democratic system in Croatia. 
  All our experience so far gives us solid reasons to conclude 
that the HDZ, with its well-proven leadership, will come out of 
this situation even stronger and more united, at the head of the 
struggle for the preservation, consolidation, and construction 
of a sovereign and independent Croatian state, the state of full 
democratic liberties, progress, happiness, and prosperity for 
all its citizens -- the HDZ Presidency states at the end of its 
message. 
  [Signed] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of 
Croatia, HDZ General Secretary Jure Radic, Deputy Presidents 
Nikica Valentic, Mate Granic, Franjo Greguric, Gojko Susak, 
Marjan Sunjic, and members Ivan Milas, Djuro Brodarac, General 
Djuro Decak, Antun Vrdoljak, Ivic Pasalic, Hrvoje Hitrec, and

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- Bashkim Kopliku, 
deputy prime minister of Albania, who is attending these days 
the Crans Montana Forum conference in Bucharest, assessed as 
remarkable the impact this conference is expected to have on the 
general cooperation process in Europe and especially on detente 
and development in the Balkans. 
  During a meeting he had Thursday, 21 April, at Victoria 
Palace with Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Mr. 
Kopliku made a point of saying that after 45 years of isolation 
Albania's most important foreign policy objective is the opening 
to all European states, and primarily to the Balkan states. 
  Both sides shared the opinion that the Romanian-Albanian 
relations, by their traditionally friendly nature, are an 
example of cordiality between peoples in this so very troubled 
region of Europe. The multiple problems generated by the 
Balkans' ethnic patchwork configuration do not exclude the 
possibility of their becoming the bridge between states, as is 
the case of the Albanian minority in Romania, was one of the 
positive ideas of the meeting. 
  The dialogue enabled the two sides to exchange opinions on 
the stage reached by the reform process in their countries.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 21 April "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, April 21 (BTA) -- The press gives 
prominence to the request for overflying Bulgaria which the 
command of the UN peacekeepers in Zagreb addressed to the 
Bulgarian Government but withdrew later. The UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] command asked permission for the passage of 
an Ukrainian aircraft carrying Finnish blue helmets in 
connection with the rotation of UNPROFOR units along the air 
route Skopje-Helsinki-Skopje. 
  According to unofficial information published in the private 
daily STANDART NEWS, the question was not about Finnish 
peacekeepers, but about the replacement of the Swedish 
contingent recently transferred from Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to Gorazde. 
  The private paper KONTINENT reports that the request for 
using Bulgaria's airspace was received at the Bulgarian Foreign 
Ministry's Consular Department on April 15, the day when the 
National Assembly allowed a single passage of a UN convoy to 
from Romania to Macedonia. The letter from Zagreb is said to 
have requested a permanent permission for using the route, 
KONTINENT says. 
  According to TRUD, the daily of one of the major trade union 
amalgamations in Bulgaria, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov was told 
about the letter as late as on Tuesday [19 April]; it took the 
Foreign and the Defence Ministries three days to formulate their 
positions. The prime minister is said to have authorized the 
Minister of Justice Petur Kornazhev to notify the Presidium of 
the National Assembly (comprising the Chairman, the three deputy 
chairmen, the chairman of the parliamentary Legislative 
Committee and the floor leaders of the parliamentary groups) 
about the overflight request. 
  DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the Union of Democratic Forces 
(SDS), accuses Prime Minister Prof. Berov of being five days 
late in notifying parliament about the letter. 
  DUMA, the daily of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), 
cites 
the declaration which the BSP leadership and its parliamentary 
group circulated yesterday [20 April] on the same issue. The 
declaration insists that the Consultative Council for National 
Security be urgently convened and reproaches President Zhelev 
for being "inactive when vital issues of the national security 
are concerned". 
  The private daily OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK quotes SDS MP's whose 
names are not specified as saying that "Bulgaria is a member of 
the UN, therefore it have got to meet certain specific 
commitments; refusing to do so would be taken to mean that this 
country supports the aggressor". 
  "The ever more persistent attempts to use the territory of 
Bulgaria and its airspace reveal a simple tendency towards this 
country's close involvement with the actions of the world 
organization in the explosive regions of its western 
neighbours", the KONTINENT editor-in-chief writes. He wonders 
if it has ever come to the mind of any statesman or politician 
to ask what happened with Bulgaria's request for a transport 
corridor across Serbia to ship its tomatoes and fruit, which is 
quite different from the request for transporting armoured 
personnel carriers. "The settlement of this problem also depends 
on the United Nations. All we have heard from them so far is 
mumble and requests," he notes. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brussels, April 22 (AFP) -- Here follows the text 
of the statement issued here Friday by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organisation threatening air strikes against Bosnian Serbs 
attacking the Bosnian town of Gorazde. 
  The council: 
  1. Reaffirmed the readiness of the alliance, as stated in 
the January NATO summit, to support the UN in its efforts to 
protect Gorazde as authorised under UN Security Council 
Resolutions 824, 836 and 844, noting also Security Council 
Resolution 913. 
  2. Reaffirmed its support for a negotiated settlement of the 
conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and called for the 
intensification of the efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement; 
and in this context welcomed the coordination and close 
consultation between the United States, the Russian Federation, 
the United Nations and the European Union, with the aim of 
bringing together current diplomatic initiatives. 
  3. Reiterated its determination to carry out its previous 
decisions in support of UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) as it 
carries out its overall mandate. 
  4. Demanded strict respect for the safety of UNPROFOR and 
other UN and relief agency personnel throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and for the right of free access of all these 
personnel to UN-designated safe areas, and reaffirmed NATO's 
readiness to provide close air support in the event Bosnian Serb 
forces attack UNPROFOR or other UN and relief agency personnel 
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina or forcibly interfere with the 
conduct of their mandate. 
  5. Responding to the request contained in the UN Secretary 
General's letter of 18th April; 
  6. Agreed that Bosnian Serb actions in and around the city 
of Gorazde meet the conditions in relation to civilian centres 
identified by NATO on 2nd August 1993 as grounds for air strikes. 
  7. Agreed that unless: 
  a. Bosnian Serb attacks against the safe area of Gorazde (UN 
Security Council Resolution 824, Paragraph 3) immediately cease; 
  b. Bosnian Serb forces pull back three kilometres from the 
centre (to be specifically identified forthwith by NATO military 
authorities in consultation with UNPROFOR) of the city by 0001 
GMT on 24th April 1994; and 
  c. From 0001 GMT on 24th April 1994 United Nations forces, 
humanitarian relief convoys and medical assistance teams are 
free to enter Gorazde unimpeded, and medical evacuations are 
permitted, CINCSOUTH (Commander-in-Chief of Allied Forces in 
Southern Europe) is authorised to conduct air strikes against 
Bosnian Serb heavy weapons and other military targets within a 
20 km radius of the centre of Gorazde (but inside the territory 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina) in accordance with the procedural 
arrangements worked out between NATO and UNPROFOR following the 
council's decisions of 2nd and 9th August 1993. 
  8. Called on the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina not to 
undertake offensive military action from within the safe area of

  [Text] Belgrade, April 24 (TANJUG) -- The scenario for 
postponing the peace process and fanning the flames of war, so 
generously used in the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina so far, was once again followed in the case 
of Gorazde, Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
Radoje Kontic said on Sunday. Every time peace was close at 
hand or whenever talks between the warring sides became 
deadlocked through a fault of the Moslems or Croats, Serbs would 
be provoked into military action or a massacre of civilians 
would be staged, with the inevitable effect of postponing the 
peace process and fanning the war, Kontic said in a statement to 
Radio Kragujevac. 
  From Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which should have been demilitarized in spring last year as a 
U.N. protected area, Moslems launched an offensive against Serb 
positions in late March. When the Moslems were threatened with 
military defeat, NATO bombed Serb positions around the town on 
April 10 and 11 allegedly to protect the local U.N. observers. 
Since this did not affect the situation on the front, NATO set 
another ultimatum to Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday, this 
time that they withdraw to 3km from Gorazde by 00:01 GMT Sunday 
or be bombed (again). 
  The bombing did not take place because Serbs from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, under an agreement with head of the U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, 
started to withdraw, and around 200 peace-keepers have arrived 
in Gorazde and have begun their deployment in the buffer zone 
between Serb and Moslem forces. Assessing that the plan of the 
European Union (E.U.) on Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of three 
ethnic republics had offered a real perspective for resolving 
the crisis quickly, Kontic said that Serbs had practically met 
all the Moslem demands, so that it had seemed that the solution 
was on the horizon. "And then the U.S. enforced the 
Moslem-Croat federation and the confederation with Croatia, 
without any participation of the Serbs, and at their expense in 
fact, because new concessions by the Serb side had been counted 
on," the Yugoslav prime minister said. In order to get Serbs to 
make these concessions, it was necessary to intimidate them with 
air strikes, or blacken them once again in the eyes of the world 
community and justify the siding against them, Kontic said. 
  Commenting on the U.S. demands for the destruction of 
bridges 
and other forms of communication between the Serb Republic in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, 
Kontic assessed that such demands which come from extremist 
circles and individuals should not disturb Yugoslav citizens and 
cause their concern. "Even if this did take place, it would be 
an act of aggression on an independent and sovereign country and 
the answer would be unequivocal and clear. Yugoslavia has such 
a force that can be placed in the defence of the country at a 
moment's notice," the Yugoslav prime minister said. "The 
situation is monitored continually and measures are taken to 
protect our borders. That is why certain funds are earmarked 
for equipping the army with modern weapons and strengthening the 
country's defence even at this moment when the economic 
situation is very difficult," Kontic told Radio Kragujevac.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Bucharest, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Nikola Sainovic, the 
vice-prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, on 
Friday told the Crans Montana international forum in Bucharest 
that the policy of pressures, ultimatums and punishing of 
Yugoslavia has been proved ineffective, inhuman and 
counter-productive. Such a policy only postpones a just 
solution to the lengthy crisis and widens the economic, social 
and cultural gap between the Balkans and the other parts of 
Europe thus providing a favourable terrain for longterm 
destabilization, Sainovic told today's session on the topic 
"Prospects for peace in the Balkans." 
  Sainovic, who heads the Yugoslav delegation in Bucharest, 
said that the holding of the conference on the Yugoslav crisis 
depends on the fulfillment of three conditions: the equal 
treatment of all sides in the conflict, the abandoning of a 
policy of pressures and ultimatums, and the lifting of the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia. Sainovic recalled that the 
international sanctions against Yugoslavia, the first against a 
European country, represent the collective punishment of the 
entire population of a country and threaten some 60 [?million] 
refugees, of which 300,000 are children, and who found sanctuary 
in Yugoslavia. An enture nation has been denied the elementary 
and civilization rights: the right to health, education, 
culture, the freedom of movement and travel, and even the right 
to life, Sainovic said. 
  The imposition of the sanctions against Yugoslavia only, 
represents the implementation of a policy of double standards 
which has no basis in democratic principles and can only be 
explained by the interests and revanschism of certain powers and 
states who have always had certain historic aspirations towards 
the Balkans, Sainovic said. The Balkans have dramatically been 
pushed into the spotlight of world public opinion and have 
become the stage for new divisions reflected in the 
disintegration of the former yugoslavia and the civil war in its 
territory, he said. Internal antagonisms and the in-advance 
prepared secessionist forces saw their chance in the changes in 
the balance of power in Europe and carried out the violent 
secession from an internationally recognized state and the 
founder of all major institutions of the international order, 
Sainovic said. The existing constitutional order has been 
disrupted, the universal principles of the Helsinki CSCE process 
violated and the rights of peoples who voted for the continuity 
of a joint state ignored, the Yugoslav vice-prime minister said. 
  At this year's meeting of the Crans Montana forum, attended 
by some 1,000 prominent world figures, the Yugoslav delegation 
also includes Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic and 
Serbian Minister Without Protfolio Dragan Tomic.

  [Excerpts] Cajnice, 25 Apr (TANJUG) -- The cease-fire on 
the Gorazde front is today being violated only by Muslim snipers 
firing from the town center in a vain attempt to provoke the 
Serbian army, it has been announced in the command of the 
Herzegovina Corps [of the Bosnian Serb forces]. The command 
says that, in line with the Karadzic-Akashi agreement, the 
Serbian forces are today continuing to withdraw to 3 km from the 
center of Gorazde, while heavy weapons have been withdrawn to 
the agreed distance of 20 km. [passage omitted] Serbian 
military sources say that scattered Muslim forces are 
withdrawing from the center of Gorazde and regrouping in 
Orahovica, northwest of the town, probably planning to link up 
with their forces on Mount Igman near Sarajevo.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musevic] </F>
  [Text] After 28 days and nights of the worst hell, the 
citizens of Gorazde that have survived seem to have entered 
better and quieter times. This is suggested by events since 
early this morning. The chetnik snipers, anti-aircraft weapons, 
and tanks have fallen silent. Under pressure from the 
international community and with the arrival of the first 
contingent of blue helmets, the murderers from the hills do not 
seem to live here any more. 
  The first estimates suggest that the chetniks -- despite the 
considerable delay considering the NATO deadline -- have started 
to withdraw from the points from where they have been sowing 
death in Gorazde. The chetniks are scorching the earth as they 
pull back. The members of the Ukrainian battalion that arrived 
in Gorazde on Saturday evening have started to impose a buffer 
zone in the region. The result is obvious: There is no more 
blood in the streets of Gorazde, there is no more death, 
screams, and pain. 
  After more than a month a UNHCR convoy with food and 
medicine 
managed to enter Gorazde late last night. Another humanitarian 
convoy has been announced for today for the starved and bleeding 
Gorazde. Still, the main concern of the people is today's 
resumption of the evacuation of the badly wounded from the 
Gorazde hospital.

<H8>  Policy Statement of theGovernment of the Slovak </H8>
Republic 
<H8>  Introduction </H8>
  The coalition government, sworn in on 16 March 1994 in 
accordance with the Constitution, is presenting to the National 
Council its policy statement in order to seek the confidence of 
the supreme legislative body of the Slovak Republic. The 
government came into being on the basis of a decision made by 
this parliament, and its six-month term of office must be seen 
within the context of domestic political developments since 1992. 
  The government assumed responsibility for the country's fate 
under exceedingly difficult conditions of the development of our 
young state, which is undergoing an extensive political, 
economic, and spiritual transformation. 
  One of the basic aims of the preceding government was to 
wind 
up the emancipation process and gain for Slovakia the status of 
an entity under international law. It became apparent that, in 
view of the outcome of the 1992 elections in the Slovak Republic 
and the Czech Republic, the fulfillment of this aim was possible 
only through the partition of the CSFR and the founding of two 
independent states. Today it is evident that the Government of 
the Slovak Republic was not sufficiently prepared for this step, 
which manifested itself in improvisation in tackling many 
serious problems of society in the process of the founding of 
the independent state. The gradual rise of authoritarian 
management led to the escalation of social tension and to 
disintegrative tendencies not only within the government and 
within the ruling parliamentary majority, but also in many 
spheres of social life, which increasingly rendered it 
impossible for other political entities to effectively 
participate in political decisions. 
  The Slovak Republic's efforts at integration into democratic 
European structures were harmed by inappropriate statements 
about the foreign policy orientation of the republic as well as 
about some issues regarding national minorities and ethnic 
groups. 
  A dangerous phenomenon, which had been introduced into 
political life by the ruling power, was the confrontational 
manner of political communication and its low standard. The 
solution of personal conflicts among politicians and individual 
parties through the mass media discouraged a considerable 
segment of the population from participating in political life, 
particularly those citizens who are interested more in specific 
results than in political squabbling, demagogy, or populism. 
  By slowing down the transformation process, lack of concept 
in its economic policy, particularly lack of dovetailing of its 
instruments, by delaying solutions, but also by an unrealistic 
assessment of the starting macroeconomic position of the Slovak 
Republic's independence and by insufficient preparations for the 
independent existence of the Slovak economy, by politicizing 
economic problems, deferring the transformation of the social 
sphere, failing to deal with the complicated situation in the 
company sphere, giving insufficient support to the development 
of the entrepreneurial sphere, and failing to ensure political 
and economic stability inevitable for the entry of foreign 
investors, the government greatly contributed to the unfavorable 
development of the Slovak economy in the years 1992-93. GDP and 
industrial production dropped. The growth rate of consumer 
prices more than doubled in 1993, compared with 1992, 
unemployment and regional differences in unemployment levels 
rose, and the indebtedness of the government sector drastically 
increased. The social cost of transformation inordinately 
increased in 1992-93 and the social situation of the population 
further deteriorated. The ruling power was not competent enough 
to halt and reverse the unfavorable development, for which it 
bears its share of responsibility. 
  Those were the main reasons for the passage of a vote of no- 
confidence in the ex-prime minister by the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic and the subsequent departure of the whole 
government. In this context, attention needs to be drawn to the 
fact that the refusal by members of the preceding government and 
state secretaries to remain in office until the appointment of a 
new government was unusual and in contravention of practices 
that are customary in democratic states. 
  By its subsequent decision to shorten the electoral term, 
parliament at the same time defined the present government's 
term of office. 
  During its term of office, this government wants to restore 
confidence in the highest constitutional bodies and lay 
foundations for a permanent democratic execution of state power 
based on tolerance, consensus, and a businesslike exchange of 
opinions. 
  The government must, and wants, to govern on the basis of a 
broad political consensus among forces that assess many problems 
differently from their party positions. Our ability to display 
this consensus in today's immensely difficult situation, 
particularly economic situation, and to apply this consensus in 
practice will be to the benefit of the broadest spectrum of our 
citizens. Only by achieving this consensus and by such a 
crystallization of views can we gradually start working on 
Slovakia's development strategy, a call for which was made by 
President Michal Kovac in his report on the state of the 
republic. 
  We will continue all the positive steps taken by the 
previous government. We regard our most important tasks to be 
stabilizing the political, economic, social, and security 
situation in Slovakia, preparing the elections and important 
conceptual documents and legislative norms, and warding off 
collapse in health care, education, culture, and the judiciary. 
We will continue putting the finishing touches to the shaping 
of a state based on the rule of law and will complete the 
drafting of basic documents pertaining to the security and 
defense policies of the Slovak Republic. With regard to foreign 
relations, we want to effectively defend the foreign political 
interests of our state and tackle existing problems in a 
professional way. 
  Although the government's program has been worked out for a 
period of six months, it is based on longer-term development 
targets. On this basis, the government also wants to initiate 
new dynamizing elements [dynamizujuce prvky], regardless of the 
fact that their effects will make themselves felt only after the 
present government's mandate expires. 
  The government undertakes to speed up economic 
transformation, which is a prerequisite of an efficient economy, 
and to raise the standard of living on this basis. 
  We will devote maximum efforts to bringing about 
macroeconomic stability, which we consider to be an important 
condition of further development. We want to achieve this by 
means of a prudent budget policy and by coordinating our policy 
with the monetary policy of the Slovak National Bank. 
  On questions of principle of economic policy, the government 
will proceed so as to win trust at home and abroad. It will 
focus, in particular, on creating a favorable entrepreneurial 
environment for domestic and foreign entities, a transparent and 
energetic privatization, and on combining foreign economic 
policy with stabilizing measures in the crucial sectors of the 
economy. 
  The government's intention in the social sphere is to speed 
up its transformation and to abandon state paternalism in favor 
of citizens' responsibility while retaining the principle of 
social solidarity and state guarantees where essential. 
  Within the framework of an active employment policy, we will 
concentrate on solving the problems of the most severely 
affected regions and micro-regions. 
  We want to pursue our activities in such a way as to halt 
the 
process of anarchy in social life and the moral decline of 
society. 
  This government is a coalition government, composed of 
political entities from various parts of the political spectrum. 
The coming together of such heterogeneous entities in one 
government does not occur often in history. It is at times when 
the foundations of society's functioning and of democracy are 
threatened that diverse political entities raise common interest 
above their particular interests. We are of the opinion that 
Slovakia finds itself in such a situation at present. 
  The political entities participating in this government are 
convinced that their main task is to help solve the present 
critical period in Slovakia's development, calm the emotions 
that are running high, and contribute to the holding of 
democratic elections. They will do everything they can to 
maintain the established consensus. 
<H8>  Risks of the Starting Position of the Economy </H8>
  In 1993, the first year of the existence of the independent 
Slovak Republic, the development of the economy deteriorated 
once again, particularly in the first half of the year. This 
was caused by the previous government's lack of concept in 
preparing the independent existence of the Slovak economy, gross 
shortcomings in its economic policy, and the slowing down of the 
transformation process and privatization, in particular. 
  This found expression in another decline of real GDP by 4.1 
percent, in a decline of industrial production by 13.5 percent, 
and in a drop of construction output by almost one-fourth. 
  The conditions of internal and external balance 
substantially 
deteriorated compared with 1992. The deficit of the state 
budget, which increased to 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] (6.8 
percent of GDP), not only contributed to further price growth 
but, by siphoning off credit resources, also had an extremely 
adverse influence on the development of the entrepreneurial 
sphere. The increase in the budget deficit was accounted for, 
apart from the decline in GDP, also by shortcomings in preparing 
the introduction of the new system of taxation and insurance. 
  In spite of the Sk's devaluation, exports declined sharply 
(11.5 percent compared with 1992), while imports grew at a 
relatively rapid pace (15.4 percent), which resulted in a Sk26.7 
billion deficit in the foreign trade balance. 
  At the same time, the clearing account registering trade 
with 
the Czech Republic showed a deficit of Sk5.8 billion, which, 
while representing an extraordinary boost to budget revenues in 
1993, aggravated, on the other hand, the starting position for 
budget management in 1994. 
  The starting position of the state budget for 1994 is also 
made worse by the unresolved liabilities of public sector 
branches -- health care, transportation, education, and others 
-- which were not included in the 1993 state budget deficit. 
These represent an additional burden of more than Sk6 billion 
for the 1994 budget. 
  As a result of deficit financing, which assumed unrestrained 
dimensions toward the end of 1993, the net debt indebtedness of 
the government sector rose to Sk60.0 billion. This substantially 
increased the debt servicing burden for the state budget in 1994 
and the subsequent years. 
  The price level went up 23.2 percent in 1993, more than 
double the 1992 price growth. 
  The unfavorable development of the Slovak economy in the 
years 1992 and 1993 also found expression in growing 
unemployment and in the social situation of the population. By 
the end of 1993, the rate of unemployment increased to 14.4 
percent. 
  The preceding government did not take resolute steps to 
stabilize the conditions for the development of the 
entrepreneurial sphere and in support of its development. This 
was reflected in another increase in the number of companies 
operating at a loss, the proportion of which reached 57.5 
percent by the end of 1993, with their aggregate loss amounting 
to Sk42.5 billion. This further aggravated companies' inability 
to pay their bills and acted as a brake on monetary flows. 
  Our predecessors are accountable for the, by international 
standards, low inflow of foreign investments, primarily because 
they failed to ensure essential political and economic stability 
and because the government's low credibility deterred foreign 
investors. This is reflected in the fact that the overall volume 
of foreign investments reached only Sk10.8 billion by the end of 
1993, which was Sk4.2 billion more than at the end of 1992, but, 
when Czech investors' capital is subtracted, the increase 
represented only Sk3 billion. The inflow of foreign capital had 
a declining tendency in the course of 1993. 
  As transpires from the aforesaid, we are taking over the 
economy in a situation when negative trends -- particularly the 
drop in GDP, the decline of production in industry, 
construction, and agriculture, the growth of unemployment, the 
growth of social costs, and the like -- culminate. We are 
convinced that this situation can be changed. However, this 
requires a change of economic policy. We are putting forward 
the aims and instruments of a new policy, realizing that during 
this government's term of office the results of this policy can 
be reflected in the economy only partially. 
<H8>  Basic Economic Intentions and Targets </H8>
  In contrast to the preceding government's program, our 
program proceeds from the longer-term aims of the Slovak 
economy's development. On this basis, during our term of 
office, we want to lay the foundations for new dynamizing 
elements, regardless of the fact that their effects will make 
themselves felt only later. At the same time, we will try to 
achieve that the transformation process does not slow down and 
that the attainment of the targets of economic policy for 1994 
is not jeopardized. 
  The government's unequivocal intention is to speed up the 
embarked-upon process of transforming the economy and ownership 
relations, in particular. We will set the process of 
privatization in motion again, with respect to which we will 
return to the tried-and-tested method of coupon privatization, 
which had in the past won citizens' trust. We regard successful 
transformation as the prerequisite for the development of a 
modern and efficient economy that will enable the Slovak 
Republic to join the league of economically advanced countries 
and to raise the living standards of the population. We pledge 
to retain the social tolerability of transformation. We will 
conduct social dialogue to achieve generally acceptable 
solutions in the interest of maintaining social peace. We will 
devote particular attention to the socially weakest strata of 
the population. 
  The government wants to implement the basic aims of economic 
policy arising from the Memorandum on Economic Policy for 1994. 
In view of our starting position, great risks are associated 
with the attainment of those targets. We will prepare measures 
to alleviate those risks. Apart from short-term fiscal measures 
that will contribute to the attainment of 1994 macroeconomic 
targets, we place emphasis, above all, on measures that will 
help break through the unfavorable tendencies in the development 
of the Slovak economy and lay foundations for the renewal of 
economic growth. 
  The government realizes that at the root of the development 
of society lie the initiative and responsibility of every 
individual and every economic and noneconomic organization. The 
government's task is to act as the catalyst of this initiative. 

<H8>    Points of Departure of Macroeconomic Policy </H8>
  The government considers macroeconomic stability to be one 
of 
the basic features determining the development of the Slovak 
Republic's economy. The attainment of this stability is 
conditional on the implementation of prudent budget, tax, wage, 
price, subsidies, and customs policies. To achieve the common 
macroeconomic targets regarding internal and external balance, 
the government considers it essential to coordinate its 
macroeconomic policy with the monetary policy of the Slovak 
National Bank, while respecting its independence. This means 
drawing as close as possible in 1994 to zero-growth of GDP, 
maintaining price growth in the range of 10 to 13 percent, 
keeping unemployment under the 17 percent limit, and meeting the 
commitment [not further specified, referring possibly to the 
commitment to keep budget deficit under 4 percent of GDP as 
recommended by the IMF] in budget management. We envisage a 
growth of net foreign exchange reserves, with a view to 
maintaining the internal convertibility of the [Slovak] currency 
and a surplus in the balance of payments. The government will 
seek to obtain a standby credit from the IMF in order to 
maintain macroeconomic stability. 
  In budget policy, the government will focus on closing the 
unfavorable budget management for 1993 and the preceding years. 
It will have to resolve the high deficit of the state budget for 
1993 bequeathed to it by the previous government. 
  To prevent the situation of 1993 from recurring, the 
government will focus in 1994 on securing revenues for the state 
budget. It will implement measures to mobilize budget resources 
and, in strictly defined cases, reduce budget expenditures and 
will strive, in general, to bring about order in finances. It 
will adopt measures to prevent tax evasion, reduce outstanding 
tax arrears, unblock claims abroad, and address the issue of 
debts stemming from the pre-1993 period. 
  During its term of office, the government will prepare the 
draft state budget for 1995. 
  We have inherited an unintelligible and inefficient system 
of 
taxation, customs, and insurance and will prepare specific 
proposals to improve this system. 
  While implementing wage policy, we will attend to it, in 
enterprises with dominant participation by the state, that wages 
serve as a sufficient incentive for individual initiative. At 
the same time we will see to it that the disproportion between 
the growth of wages and the development of labor productivity 
does not increase. 
  We will establish conditions for a more extensive 
utilization 
of the financing of development targets from foreign resources. 
At the same time we want to make transparent the existing 
system of obtaining foreign credits and assessing their 
effectiveness. We will therefore tighten the criteria governing 
the assumption of liabilities vis-a-vis foreign partners. We 
consider it essential that every credit taken abroad should 
establish prerequisites for its repayment and strengthen the 
economic position of the Slovak Republic. 
<H8>  Macroeconomic Policy </H8>
  The government will adjust macroeconomic policy with a view 
to attaining its macroeconomic targets. Without bringing about a 
fundamental turnabout in the company sphere, we will not only 
fail to achieve the set macroeconomic targets, but the 
unfavorable tendencies will continue to intensify. The 
government's attention will center on speeding up the 
commercialization [komercionalizacia] and transformation of 
state enterprises in terms of ownership in order to finally 
resolve the institutional vacuum, in which companies have found 
themselves in the last four years and to shorten the intolerably 
long pre-privatization agony of companies. With respect to 
commercialized state enterprises, the government will make use 
of the motivating function of managerial contracts and will 
limit its interference to rigid financial control. 
  By its economic policy the government will establish 
prerequisites for eliminating the causes of the intolerable 
growth of company indebtedness and will take specific steps in 
the legislative sphere, and to secure the course of court 
proceedings in commercial matters and bankruptcy proceedings, 
which will help speed up the financial restructuring of 
companies. It will speed up negotiations on obtaining a loan 
for restructuring the company and banking sphere (EFSAL). 
<H8>  Creation of Favorable EntrepreneurialEnvironment and </H8>
Support for theDevelopment of the Private Sector 
  The basic prerequisite and impulse for the desirable 
development of enterprise is the stability of the 
entrepreneurial environment and its ability to provide 
motivation. The government wants to establish a favorable 
entrepreneurial environment by means of macroeconomic measures, 
particularly fiscal and economic instruments, but mainly by 
means of measures in tax, customs, and social policy and by 
improving the legislative framework. 
  We will also orient our efforts toward improving the 
competitive environment and finalizing the system, and 
intensifying the activity, of institutions charged with 
promoting the development of businesses, such as the National 
Agency for the Support and Development of Small and Medium-Sized 
Businesses, consultancy centers, Slovenska Zarucna Banka [Slovak 
Guarantee Bank], and the like. In this process we will 
cooperate with entrepreneurs' associations and with the Slovak 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 
  We regard a strong private sector, operating on the basis of 
market principles and private ownership, as the source of Slovak 
economic prosperity. Therefore, we want to expeditiously 
eliminate obstacles and restrictions to the development of the 
private sector in the legislative and administrative spheres and 
help tackle the financial prerequisites for the further 
development of private entrepreneurial activities. 
  We will support private activities even in those sectors of 
public services that have until now been the exclusive domain of 
the state. 
  Foreign investment, which should help eliminate the acute 
shortage of capital, will represent one of the dynamizing 
elements of the economy. We want to create a stable and 
favorable entrepreneurial environment that will also be 
attractive to foreign investors and take specific steps to 
facilitate their becoming involved in the economy of the Slovak 
Republic. We will establish conditions to substantially improve 
and increase the flow of information to foreign investors and 
will give support to those, whose entry will accelerate the 
development of the economy. 
<H8>  Privatization </H8>
  One of the most serious causes of the intensification of 
negative tendencies in the development of the economy was the 
slowing down, and virtual halting, of privatization. Lack of 
concept compounded by lack of transparency and exceptionally 
hasty privatization in the closing days of the previous 
government's term of office have brought about loss of 
confidence in privatization among citizens. We consider it our 
priority to restore the confidence of citizens and foreign 
investors alike in the process of privatization in Slovakia. In 
this spirit we are taking measures to speed up the privatization 
process in such a way that, by the time the second wave of 
coupon privatization is concluded, more than one-half of all 
property in state ownership should be into private hands. At 
the same time we will establish conditions for effective control 
of privatization by the public. 
  The government will secure the equality of privatization 
methods and the equality of participants in privatization. It 
will consistently attend to making privatization transparent and 
will prevent political deformations of this process. In 
contrast to the preceding government, which considered coupon 
privatization a residual method and was deferring its 
preparation, this government will approach it as an equal method 
and, within the framework of its mandate, will also secure the 
commencement of the second wave of coupon privatization. 
Enterprises from all branches of the economy, including 
attractive investment opportunities, will be included in coupon 
privatization. Parts of property that were not privatized in 
the first wave will also be offered for sale by means of coupons. 
  We will speed up the realization of already prepared and 
undisputed privatization projects by means of standard methods. 
We will offer certain enterprises, or their parts, to domestic 
and foreign interested parties who will demonstrate their 
credibility and will submit the most interesting projects, 
interesting not only in financial terms, but also from the 
viewpoint of entrepreneurial plans. 
  In the near future, we will prepare a proposal in which we 
will specify our ideas about the extent, timetable, and methods 
of privatization in individual sectors of the economy. We want 
to cooperate with the National Property Fund on new foundations. 
We will strive to speed up the sale of shares in the National 
Property Fund's portfolio. We will work toward the National 
Property Fund exercising its ownership functions only passively 
in those companies in which there are important private 
shareholders. 
<H8>  Regional Policy </H8>
  Within the framework of the transformation process, we will 
also give consideration to regional aspects. On the basis of 
monitoring the situation in individual regions, we will support 
the program of their structural adaptation. The government 
regards as its long- term priorities, in particular, the 
creation of conditions for a balanced economic and social 
development of regions, a rational use of resources, 
environmental protection and ecological stability of the 
landscape, and a harmonious arrangement of economic and social 
functions on a given territory. It will also pay heed to the 
problem of migration from the countryside and the lagging behind 
of rural areas, to cross-border and international cooperation 
among region, and to the establishment of free-trade zones, 
business zones, science and technology parks, and the like. 

<H8>    Sectoral Policy </H8>
  The government will adopt economic stabilization measures 
that will convince not only our citizens, but also foreign 
countries of its readiness and ability to carry on the 
transformation of the economy and to gradually finalize the 
conditions for the Slovak economy's transition to a modern 
market economy integrated into European and global economic 
structures. 
<H8>  Industry, Construction, Trade, and Tourism </H8>
  The government's priority in industry will be, above all, 
raising the ability of Slovak products to compete. We consider 
support for the restructuring and revitalization of industrial 
companies to be the foundation of sectoral policy. We will 
speed up the privatization of arms companies, which was kept 
being delayed thus far, while at the same time securing the 
state's adequate participation so as to be able to preserve the 
strategic interests of defense and security. 
  In the sphere of energy, the government will draw up a 
proposal for the organization, restructuring, and gradual 
privatization of enterprises that are now in state ownership, 
providing for well-considered participation by foreign capital. 
Based on foreign experience, the government will proceed 
particularly circumspectly in the process of transforming and 
privatizing the energy sector in order to preserve the state's 
energy sufficiency. It will prepare regulatory measures to 
prevent unwarranted price increases in this sector. Our main 
target in the construction industry, apart from giving support 
to small entrepreneurs, will be to establish conditions for the 
utilization of our large-scale capacities to build transport 
infrastructure and complete unfinished apartments and energy 
projects. We will take the necessary steps to make possible the 
export of construction capacities. We will speed up 
negotiations on the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power 
plant. In the sphere of domestic trade, we will ensure the 
adoption of the Principles of State Consumer Policy, with a view 
to protecting the health, safety, and economic interests of 
consumers. 
  The preceding government did not make use of the dynamizing 
potentials of tourism for the development of the Slovak economy. 
In contrast to the preceding government, we will focus on the 
development of tourism with a view of increasing its share in 
the generation of new jobs, revitalizing individual regions, and 
increasing foreign exchange earnings. 
  We will speed up the privatization of companies engaged in 
tourism, will prepare the institutional framework for tourism 
promotion and a law on tourism, will intensify the promotion of 
Slovakia, and the like. 
<H8>  Transport, Communications, and Public Works </H8>
  In the sector of transport and communications, we will 
replace by pragmatic solutions the previous practice of 
unsuitable interventions and statements, which brought about 
stagnation in those areas and met with unfavorable response 
abroad. We will support the restructuring of the Railroads of 
the Slovak Republic and of enterprises of the Slovak Automobile 
Transportation as well as modernization projects in transport 
and communications, particularly the Telecommunications I and 
Telecommunications II projects for the renewal of the 
telecommunications network, for which the state will provide 
important guarantees. We will place emphasis on the efficient 
utilization of foreign credits. We will establish conditions 
for the development of combined transportation and will support 
the creation, and speed up the enforcement, of a competitive 
environment on the domestic and international haulage markets. 
In implementing state transport policy by means of foreign 
activities, we will closely cooperate with neighboring states in 
order to acquire funds for linking our transport network with 
the main European transport routes. 
  The government will draw up and submit to parliament for 
discussion, still during its term of office, a draft amendment 
to the Law on Railroads, a Bill on the Health Insurance of 
Railroad Employees and the Railroad Employees' Health Insurance 
Company, a Bill on Road Transportation, as well as a Bill on 
Telecommunications. 
  It will follow up on all legislative and preparatory work 
and 
all studies and blueprints aimed at the development of 
infrastructure in transportation, postal services and 
communications, and the institution of public works and will 
secure a more distinct progress of all those projects. 
  The need to take care of the citizens' housing situation was 
not fully appreciated in the preceding period. We will draw up, 
and will begin to implement, our own concept of housing policy, 
including the completion of unfinished apartments and 
infrastructure and amenities. We will initiate and speed up the 
launching of privatization of the housing stock and will 
initiate an increase of investments in the housing economy. We 
will clarify the legal framework regarding expropriation for 
projects in the public interest. 

<H8>    Agriculture </H8>
  In agriculture, the government will orient its activities 
toward meeting the basic strategic targets adopted by the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic. We consider 
agriculture to be one of our priorities. 
  Establishing the prerequisites for stabilizing agriculture, 
halting a further production decline, securing continuity of 
agricultural production, and ensuring conditions for its 
qualitative growth remain the primary tasks. We want to clarify 
the arrangement of property relations and claims in agricultural 
cooperatives, speed up the transformation of proprietary 
relations regarding land, particularly the privatization of 
state farms, and establish conditions for agricultural 
enterprises' faster adaptation to the new conditions. 
  In giving a final shape to the economic environment and a 
functioning market for agricultural products and food, the 
government will use economic and legislative instruments as well 
as organizational and institutional measures that conform with 
market principles. 
  Following up on the transformation of proprietary relations, 
we are planning a new organizational arrangement of the forest 
economy. The implementation of the program of remedial measures 
in forests damaged by pollutants will continue by drawing on 
domestic as well as foreign financial resources. 
  One of the most important tasks in water management is to 
ensure the supply of larger territorial entities with 
unobjectionable drinking water. The basic priority is the 
protection and economical use of water resources in conformity 
with the most demanding ecological criteria. The construction 
of the Malinec and Turcek water reservoirs will continue and 
support will be given to the construction of the Zilina 
hydroelectric power project. Special attention will be devoted 
to the quest for an agreement with Hungary on the operation of 
the Gabcikovo hydroelectric power project. 
<H8>  Development of the Financial Sector </H8>
  The government is interested in the formation of a 
competitive commercial banking sector. In the endeavor to 
contribute to this process, we will support measures designed to 
continue the privatization of banks, improve the banks' 
portfolio, and reinforce the banks' capital stock, including 
reinforcement from outside capital resources. One of the aims 
of this support is to significantly raise the level of Slovak 
banks' international acceptance and to integrate them into the 
international banking system as fully fledged members. 
  We will also devote attention to the expansion of insurance 
services mitigating entrepreneurial risks, particularly to 
insuring export credits. We will also give consideration to a 
system of insuring citizens' bank deposits and to the formation 
of credit cooperatives. 
  The government will finalize the establishment of conditions 
for a more intensive development of the capital market, which 
operates as an important means of allocating capital resources 
in the economy. In the process of developing the capital 
market, it will attend to ensuring its transparency, improving 
the legislative framework regulating its operation, and defining 
the status and extent of control functions, including the 
finalizing of a state supervisory body. 
<H8>  Foreign Economic Policy </H8>
  Some areas of foreign economic policy remained unresolved in 
the preceding period. Essential measures designed to protect 
the market in the transitional period, as well as exceptionally 
needed export- promoting measures, kept being delayed, which 
caused a further intensification of external disequilibrium and 
economic decline. 
  We will therefore strive, above all, to give finishing 
touches to export-promoting policy and to implement it 
across-the-board in order support the export potentials of 
Slovak companies. In justified cases we will also secure an 
adequate protection of the internal market. 
  We will project the conclusions of the bilateral and 
multilateral talks of the Uruguay Round of GATT into instruments 
of economic and trade policy. The preparation and 
implementation of international bilateral and multilateral 
agreements essential for the expansion of space for trade will 
be an integral part of trade policy. We will support the 
adoption and implementation of an agreement on shortening the 
transitional period and eliminating tariff and non- tariff 
obstacles to trade within the framework of the Central European 
Free Trade Agreement, while taking into consideration the 
specific situation in agriculture. We will support the 
development of mutual economic relations with the Czech Republic 
and other neighboring states. 

<H8>    Ecology and Economic Policy </H8>
  The successful transformation of our society is conditional 
also on respect for requirements for the protection and 
enhancement of a healthy environment. The government will 
therefore significantly reinforce the linkage between economy 
and ecology. 
  The principle of separating the protection of natural 
resources from their exploitation has not been conceptually 
resolved thus far, which generates a number of problems in 
practice. 
  The allocation of resources from the State Environmental 
Fund 
of the Slovak Republic has thus far respected, more or less, the 
importance of requirements and priorities at district level, 
while the importance of national priorities has not always been 
respected. This situation jeopardizes the possibility of funding 
from the resources of the State Environmental Fund nationwide 
priority projects and of positively evaluating other requests in 
the second round. 
  A great deal has been expected of the establishment of the 
Slovak Environmental Agency, but its activity needs to be 
consolidated. With the aim of preventing further environmental 
damage, we will strive for the speedy passage of a law on the 
assessment of the impact of operations on the environment and 
for the comprehensive completion of the legal system related to 
the environment, in a way that will make it compatible with the 
legal system in the European Union. 
  The Government of the Slovak Republic will define with 
greater precision and make more transparent individual 
government departments' powers regarding the use and protection 
of natural resources, particularly forests, water, and soil, 
while also paying heed to the rights of owners. 
  With a view to a rational utilization and protection of 
natural resources that are in state ownership, we will reassess 
the present system of fees for their exploitation. The 
government will harmonize the use of resources appropriated from 
the state budget in special-purpose state funds with the aim of 
a more efficient financing of environmental projects. At the 
same time, it will establish conditions for the transformation 
of the State Environmental Fund into a revolving fund [obratovy 
fond], in conformity with the principles of the market economy. 
<H8>  Social Sphere </H8>
  In the interest of continuity in the transformation of the 
social sphere, the government will continue ensuring the tasks 
of social policy. The government's intention is to abandon 
state paternalism in favor of citizens' responsibility. It 
wants to reinforce the citizen's personal participation in 
solving his social situation while retaining the principle of 
social solidarity and state guarantees where essential. The 
steps taken thus far came too late and were not always in 
harmony with the systemic and conceptual intentions laid down in 
1990, despite the preceding government's declared identification 
with those intentions. Insufficient attention was also devoted 
to the dovetailing of economic and social transformation, which 
led to an undesirable development in the social situation of the 
population. 
  The rate of unemployment reached almost 14.8 percent in 
February 1994, which represents almost 380,000 unemployed 
registered with labor offices. In February 1994, the rate of 
unemployment exceeded 20 percent in 14 districts, with the 
district of Rimavska Sobota reporting a rate of unemployment of 
26.7 percent. That the growth of long-term unemployment (the 
average period of registration of job applicants with labor 
offices) represented 229 days at the end of 1993), as well as 
the fact that, by the end of 1993, the category of young people 
under 25 represented almost one-third of all unemployed, must be 
regarded as a particularly negative phenomenon. 
  Apart from the growth of unemployment, the deterioration of 
the social situation and the living conditions of the population 
in 1993 was also caused by another increase in the cost of 
living, which went up 22.8 percent compared with the preceding 
year, and by a 2.6 percent decline of real earnings. 
Single-parent families, families with several children, and 
pensioners are the worst off. The proportion of households with 
children whose income in 1993 was lower than 1.5 times the 
subsistence minimum reached 61.9 percent, with 15.2 percent of 
households with children finding themselves below the 
subsistence level. The unfavorable social situation of citizens 
was tackled by means of the provision of welfare payments. A 
total of 239,000 recipients of these payments were registered in 
1993, more than 140,000 of whom were long-term unemployed. 
Welfare payments were collected by 8.6 percent of households 
with dependent children. 
  Taking the above facts into consideration, dovetailing the 
processes of economic and social transformation, abandoning 
state paternalism, and embracing citizens' responsibility will 
remain the basic approach in the social sphere, the target 
solution being a socially equitable acceptance of the citizen's 
personal participation, social solidarity, and state guarantees. 
  From the viewpoint of the situation in the sphere of 
employment, the government will reassess, on the basis of a 
thorough analysis of the labor market, the instruments of active 
employment policy, while respecting the demand that financial 
resources be spent rationally and effectively and while 
respecting the situation on regional labor markets. It will 
place particular emphasis on active employment policy, on 
reassessing the provision of material benefits also from the 
viewpoint of the gradual transfer of this care to the insurance 
system, as well as on expanding the possibilities for our 
citizens to assert themselves in the work process, and 
protecting the labor market, by means of bilateral contracts 
with other states. 
  Within the framework of the transformation of labor 
relations 
onto a new qualitative level corresponding to the conditions of 
a socially conform market economy, the government will continue 
working on the preparation of a new Labor Code and a new system 
of accident insurance and will tackle the status of civil 
servants. 
  The transformation of the existing systems of pension 
schemes, health insurance, state social payments, and welfare 
payments into systems of social insurance, state social support, 
and social assistance remains the government's basic conceptual 
intention in the sphere of social security. 
  From the viewpoint of topical tasks in the sphere of social 
security, we consider it necessary: 
  -- to tackle the issue of child allowances as the key form 
of 
state transfer payments for families with children, 
  -- to analyze the functionality of the National Insurance 
Company, 
  -- to create legislative foundations for a system of 
supplementary pension insurance, 
  -- to continue to gradually create conditions for humanizing 
the care of physically and mentally severely disabled persons 
and elderly citizens, with particular emphasis on the actual 
guarantee of their rights, 
  -- and to gradually establish conditions for the activity of 
nonstate entities in the social sphere. 
  In the sphere of social security, the government will 
respect 
all claims of citizens that are guaranteed by law. In 
accordance with this commitment, it will index [valorizovat] 
pensions and the subsistence minimum, as well as transfer 
payments whose level is calculated on the basis of the 
subsistence minimum, when the conditions set by law are met. We 
support dialogue with social partners on all matters pertaining 
to employment, labor relations, and social security with the aim 
of maintaining social peace. 
<H8>  Health Care </H8>
  The present unfavorable situation in health care results 
from 
the disrupted continuity of the 1992 health care reform and from 
the introduction of some incorrect systemic steps, compounded by 
a drastic cut in financial resources. 
  As of 31 December 1993, health care establishments reported 
unpaid bills of Sk1.8 billion, of which bills for medical drugs 
account for Sk1.2 billion. The remainder is made up of bills 
for energy, fuel, and food supplies and reconstruction and 
modernization projects. 
  Health care has found itself in a critical financial 
situation, as a consequence of which one can also speak about a 
high level of hidden indebtedness (which is estimated at Sk50 
billion). 
  In 1992, 17.1 billion Czechoslovak korunas were spent on the 
operation of health care facilities, in 1993 Sk16.2 billion, 
and, disregarding inflation and the introduction of systemic 
measures, the use of only Sk15.7 billion was projected for 1994. 
  The government's main aim in the sphere of health care will 
be to deal with the financial crisis taht directly threatens the 
provision of health care and slows down the transformation 
process. The following measures are inevitable to ward off an 
imminent collapse: 
  -- to quantify and specify the justified demands of health 
care on the state budget for 1993 and determine the method of 
settling the liabilities of health care facilities, 
  -- to find ways of alleviating the budget deficit in health 
care for 1994, 
  -- to carry out changes in the existing system of payments 
for health services. 
  Concurrently with the aforesaid inevitable measures, 
conditions will be established for systemic changes in key 
health care areas. 
  In the sphere of financing health care and health insurance, 
the government will strive to establish conditions to 
financially secure the provision of basic health care, support 
the development of the Health Insurance Fund, and secure its 
independent operation. 
  The system of assessing the value of health services 
introduced as of 1 October 1993 will have to be replaced by a 
new solution that will be more effective, simpler, less 
demanding administratively, and less costly. The new system 
will have to be prepared in a differentiated way, separately for 
individual types of health care providers. 
  In the near future, we will put forward draft laws on health 
care and on the protection of people's health. 
  Following up on the passage of the law on the protection of 
people's health, we will ensure in organizational terms the 
transformation of the institutes of public health and 
epidemiology into state health institutes. The government will 
update the National Health Support Program. 
  We will continue to privatize health care facilities, using 
publicly controllable criteria. In the course of April we will 
ensure the drafting and publication of conditions for the 
privatization of pharmacies and health spas. Changes in 
ownership must not jeopardize the therapeutic functions of 
natural springs and spas. A majority participation by the state 
in the privatization of key spa facilities is foreseen. By the 
end of June 1994, we will prepare documents for the 
privatization of primary health care establishments. 
  The government will work out an analysis of the present 
state 
and structure of health care establishments. In implementing 
structural changes, it will cooperate with the appropriate 
regional bodies of state administration involved in health care. 
  In connection with the implementation of essential changes 
to 
the existing system of payments for health services, the 
government will establish conditions for a solution to the wage 
conditions of health care employees. The government will ensure 
the drafting of a concept for the further education of medical 
staff. 
<H8>  School System, Education, and Science </H8>
  High educational and cultural standards of the population 
represent the basic source of a state's wealth. Advanced 
countries pursue the strategy of growth of investments into the 
sphere of education and science. In defiance of this worldwide 
trend, both the conceptual and the everyday issues regarding the 
development of education, science, and research have been 
neglected in our country of late. 
  The budget of the department of education and science has 
been cut by Sk2.795 billion over the last two years. The 
already low budget for 1994 is further reduced by a debt of 
Sk298 million stemming from the year 1993. The situation is so 
grave that, if education retained all its functions at the level 
of 1993, the budget resources allocated for education and 
science would be exhausted in the 9th month of 1994, even if the 
price level remained constant. The situation is compounded by 
the fact that no legal norms have been drawn up and introduced 
into practice that would make it possible to introduce 
progressive forms of management into schools and educational 
establishments. 
  As a result of the grim situation in the sphere of education 
and science, which is documented, for example, by the breakup of 
kindergartens, school catering, and school accommodation, the 
government will pay particular heed to ensuring a calm 
completion of the 1993/94 school year and preparation of the new 
1994/95 school year. 
  For this reason we consider writing off the 1993 debts of 
schools and educational establishments, adequately amending the 
state budget for education and science for 1994, and reassessing 
the existing structure of revenues and expenditures in the 
department of education to be unavoidable. We will explore 
additional sources of revenue at home and abroad. Our intention 
is to concurrently rationalize and make transparent the spending 
of financial resources in this sphere. With this in mind, we 
will work out principles to be used in drafting a law on 
financing schools. 
  The government regards as one of the decisive tasks the 
formulation of the republic's strategic interests in the sphere 
of education and training and the commencement of work on 
drafting the National Program of Education and Training. 
  We consider good primary schools to represent the foundation 
of the good work of the entire educational system. In addition 
to essential improvements in the contents and forms of primary 
education, we will work toward its gradual humanization and 
influence also out of classroom. A contribution to this should 
be made also by the drafting of the principles of a law on 
protecting and supporting youth, which should guarantee the 
physical and mental development of young people. 
  In the sphere of secondary schools, we will continue 
restructuring the network of schools and the system of fields of 
study and vocational training, with special regard for the 
changing conditions of the labor market. We will also devote 
attention to addressing the complex issue of specialized 
secondary schools. We will take the necessary steps to ensure 
an even development of education in areas inhabited by people 
with diverse mother tongues. We will guarantee the fulfillment 
of the right to the free choice of the language of instruction. 
We will guarantee to students of all nationalities conditions 
to master literary Slovak. 
  The government will ensure the drafting of the Concept of 
Developing University Education in the Slovak Republic Until the 
Year 2010 and the transformation of the existing system into a 
system that will flexibly react to the needs of the labor market 
and will be compatible with the system of education in the 
countries of the European Union. Based on experience from the 
implementation of the law on higher educational establishments, 
the government will establish prerequisite for the drafting of a 
new law or for amending the existing law. 
  While implementing school policy, we will give 
comprehensive support to further improvements in qualification. 
In view of the complicated economic situation of higher 
educational establishments, we will support their acquisition of 
funds from nonstate resources as well. 
  We want to consistently support the development of science 
and technology in the directions designated as priorities as an 
important prerequisite of economic, social, and cultural growth 
under the conditions of an unfolding market economy. We will 
submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic for 
adoption a law on state support for science and technology. We 
will propose the establishment of the Slovak Republic State Fund 
for Science and Technology as well as an independent Slovak 
Republic Grant Agency for Science and Technology, which should 
help preserve and develop the intellectual base of the state and 
prevent academics and researchers from leaving universities and 
research institutes. The government will also ensure a regular 
and consistent process of mutual recognition [akreditacia] of 
universities and the research and development base. 
  Based on a realistic assessment of the present situation in, 
and standard of, physical education and sports, we want to 
establish the necessary institutional, legislative, and economic 
conditions for the development of physical education and sports, 
with emphasis on financing them from central sources through the 
medium of the State Physical Education Fund. By giving support 
to top-performance sports, we will contribute to the successful 
representation of the Slovak Republic in sports. 
  For the needs of public administration and division of 
powers 
between state administration and self-administrative bodies, the 
government will draft an optimal variant of management and 
administration of primary and secondary schools, providing for 
the gradual transfer of some of the powers of central bodies of 
state administration to local state administration and 
self-administrative bodies. We will seek to gradually transfer 
powers in the sphere of the economic management of preschool 
facilities to the administration of towns and communities, while 
retaining state guarantees for the contents of pre-school 
education and supporting the consolidation of preschool 
education as the basic element of the educational system. 
  In the effort to stabilize researchers and pedagogical 
staff, 
we want to create scope for the drafting of a proposal for the 
systemization [systemizacia] of university jobs and address the 
issue of university teachers' and researchers' salaries. With 
the aim of rationalizing and making more transparent the 
spending of financial resources in the sphere of education, we 
will work out principles to be used in drafting a law on 
financing education. We want to devote attention to the 
development of international cooperation in the sphere of 
education, science, and technology, with emphasis on the more 
distinct involvement of universities, the Slovak Academy of 
Sciences, and departmental research and development institutes 
in international cooperation programs. 
<H8>  Culture </H8>
  The government will draft a basic long-term strategy concept 
for developing culture under the conditions of the 
transformation of the economic and social system. It will also 
prepare a basic model of the organizational arrangement and 
financing of culture, a model that will ensure functional ties 
in the emerging market environment. 
  The government's basic aim is to establish legislative 
prerequisites for the transition from the central financing of 
culture toward providing incentives, and introducing 
preferences, for investments in this sphere. At the same time, 
it is necessary to retain the possibility of supporting 
directly, by means of the state-run PRO SLOVAKIA [as published] 
fund, those areas of culture in which the market instruments do 
not assert themselves. We will support the drafting of an 
analysis of the functioning of this fund, with emphasis on the 
attainment of the expected targets and its position [sentence as 
published]. 
  We will continue our efforts to finalize the legislative, 
political, and social scope for the functioning of media at the 
level of the European standard. The law on the mass media, now 
in preparation, and the law on economic support for the 
periodical press will lay the groundwork for this. 
  We want to continue supporting the activity of churches and 
develop cooperation with them on the basis of partnership. The 
present good relations will have to be put on a legislative 
footing corresponding to the standard customary in the advanced 
democratic states of Western Europe. 
  The difficult financial situation in culture is also a 
result 
of indebtedness and of the failure to commence the privatization 
of cultural facilities. This is true, in particular, of the 
Slovak Film Production company, which loses Sk40 million 
annually. The required settlement of debts is often being 
ensured through the sale of property. In this regard, it is 
necessary to speedily privatize the film studios of Slovak Film 
Production. 
  We consider it essential to finally resolve the problems of 
privatization in the sphere of culture, particularly of entities 
involved in the publication of books and in cinematography. 
  Complicated problems arise from the failure to approve the 
license for the second channel of Slovak Television. This issue 
will have to be resolved as soon as possible. 
  We want to make visible progress in dealing with short-term 
problems. This concerns financial and legislative provisions 
for the opening of the Kosice State Theater and the theater in 
Zvolen. It is also necessary to secure nonbudget funds to 
finance the completion of the National Theater. 
  An important task is to distribute financial resources for 
individual spheres of culture according to "cultural" and not 
political criteria. 
  Debts accumulated over the past few years complicate and 
limit the care of monuments, cultural values, and galleries. In 
contrast to past practices, an accommodating attitude and 
dialogue are necessary in financing local culture, some branches 
of culture, particularly graphic arts, music, and books, as well 
as the development of ethnic minorities' cultures. 
  One of the immediate tasks in the sphere of culture will be 
to make transparent the flow of finances into the development of 
ethnic minorities' cultures. In conjunction with this, it will 
be necessary to prepare legislative procedures for financing the 
culture of national minorities and ethnic groups while providing 
for direct control by representatives of minorities and ethnic 
groups. The government sets itself the task to improve, in 
cooperation with the Slovak Heritage Foundation, the moral and 
financial care of Slovaks living in areas where Slovak culture 
and the cultures of ethnic minorities exert influence on one 
another. 
  We will support talks with all artists' associations and 
seek 
common aims with them in the interest of developing Slovak 
culture. The implementation of this intention is also associated 
with limiting and, ultimately, eliminating the preferential 
treatment of certain groups at the expense of others. 
  We want to approach in a novel way the arrangement of 
relations with the Czech Republic regarding the exchange of 
objects and values of cultural heritage. 
  We set ourselves the task of working out a concept for the 
presentation of Slovak culture abroad. This concept must lay 
down guarantees ruling out the duality and degradation [dualita 
a degradacia] of the presentation of individual cultures of the 
Slovak Republic abroad. 
<H8>  Ethnic Policy </H8>
  The government considers it an important task to secure the 
rights of ethnic minorities, and to establish conditions for 
their fully fledged development, in the spirit of the 
Constitution of the Slovak Republic as well as ratified and 
transformed international agreements pertaining to the rights of 
citizens belonging to ethnic minorities. 
  We would like to achieve social consensus that will 
guarantee 
the stability and peaceful coexistence of all citizens of the 
Slovak Republic, regardless of nationality and the color of 
their skin. A prerequisite for this necessary consensus is the 
mutuality of rights and duties, combined with the civic 
principle. The government is prepared to provide all necessary 
guarantees of rights to persons belonging to ethnic minorities. 
  Instead of confrontation, we will introduce the mechanism of 
permanent dialogue as a method that promotes cooperation and 
seeks consensus in generating and exercising rights of citizens 
belonging to ethnic minorities. 
  We will resolve the issue of designation of the names of 
towns and communities. Following up on the valid legislation 
regarding citizenship and names and surnames, we will prepare a 
draft law on [birth and marriage] registers as well as a 
proposal for its execution by means of generally binding legal 
regulations. 
<H8>  State, Democracy, Law, and Public Order </H8>
  The government will continue building a state based on the 
rule of law and a modern legal system. It will support all 
positive processes leading to the formation of a democratic 
environment and the rule of law, particularly in the sphere of 
enhancing guarantees of citizens' rights and freedoms, 
reinforcing the independence and improving the efficiency of the 
judiciary, and strengthening compliance with the Constitution 
and legal guarantees by means of control by the courts. On the 
other hand, it expects all citizens of the Slovak Republic to 
fulfill their constitutional civic duties, which is an important 
prerequisite of eliminating instances of ultra-nationalism, 
irredentism, and separatism. 
  We consider it important that all necessary conditions be 
established for reinforcing the key elements and links of the 
constitutional form of government, that is, parliamentary 
republic, with emphasis on the government's constitutional and 
political accountability to parliament. Our task is to 
continue decentralizing the state by devolving the appropriate 
powers to community and regional self-administrative bodies and 
reinforcing the self-regulation of the civic society's life. 
The economic reform is also a reform of the state and must 
reduce the state's interference in the economy and the state's 
"redistribution" functions. 
  The government's intention in this sphere is to concurrently 
support the idea of constitutionalism [konstitucionalizmus], 
that is, the stability of the Constitution and its supremacy 
over the parliament, government, president, the Constitutional 
Court, the judiciary at large, and the civic society. 
  In building a state based on the rule of law, we will 
explore the possibilities of introducing the institution of the 
ombudsman and improving the system of protecting the legal 
status of citizens. 
  The government will seek to eliminate shortcomings in state 
administration, reflected in the passivity of state agencies, 
procrastination, and decisions running counter to the 
Constitution and laws. It will establish the prerequisites for 
transparency in the operation of state and self-administrative 
bodies. It will give comprehensive support to all institutions 
guaranteeing the protection of the Constitution, the democratic 
system, and the integrity and sovereignty of the state, and all 
instruments preventing the concentration of power, particularly 
state and economic power, in the hands of a single body or even 
in the hands of an individual. 
  We will take steps to transform government administration. 
Our aim is to improve the government's efficiency, reduce 
administrative costs, make transparent the activity of state 
agencies, establish prerequisites for professionalism and ethics 
in the work of the government administration, and change the 
style of the government's work. 
  We will support all efforts aimed at improving the quality 
of 
the activity of courts and at effectively enforcing their 
independent operation and status as well as their professional 
ethics. 
  The government will continue to implement the concept of 
stabilizing the judiciary of the Slovak Republic that was 
approved by the National Council of the Slovak Republic. By 
means of legislative proposals and organizational and financial 
measures, it will establish conditions for improving the quality 
and effective exertion of independent judicial power as an 
essential and equal branch of power in a democratic state based 
on the rule of law. 
  Amending and recodifying [rekodifikacia] laws pertaining to 
the judiciary will represent an organic part of purposeful steps 
leading toward the completion of the democratic legal system. 
  The government will submit the draft principles of laws on 
judges, the state administration of courts, and court executors, 
as well as a draft law that changes and amends the law on courts 
and judges. The government regards as particularly important 
the preparation of the draft principles of recodifying the Penal 
Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
  We want to continue creating conditions for establishing the 
office of the Slovak Republic's legal representative for 
proceedings before the European Commission for Human Rights and 
the European Court for Human Rights in Strasbourg. 
  The government will seek to further raise the functionality 
of local state administration and self-administrative bodies, 
strengthen their powers, and de-politicize local state 
administration. It will reassess the time frame for the 
implementation of the reform of public administration and the 
reform of the Slovak Republic's territorial and administrative 
division. 
  In implementing reform in public administration, we will 
devote special attention to the rational structure of local 
state administration bodies, to the devolution of powers from 
state administration to local self-administrative bodies, to the 
formation of self-administration in higher-level territorial 
entities, and to the problem of financial flows in this area. 
The sequence of pragmatic solutions will be determined so as to 
guarantee their continuity and so that it results in the 
proposal for a new territorial and administrative division of 
the Slovak Republic. 
  In implementing legal policy, the government will proceed 
from the long-term program of the Slovak Republic in combating 
crime, including effective prevention. It will complete the 
institutional framework for crime prevention within individual 
government departments. It will give support to all 
constitutional measures aimed at speeding up and facilitating 
preparatory procedures. 
  With the aim of limiting various forms of social pathology 
and crime, in particular, the government will prepare a draft 
law on combating the most serious, especially organized, forms 
of criminal activity and the legalization of income stemming 
from such activity. It will also complete, and soon submit [to 
parliament], proposals for extensive amendments to the Penal 
Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, which will, at the same 
time, mark the first phase of changes to the criminal law codes. 
  The government will raise the effectiveness of the struggle 
against organized crime, including international organized 
crime, by means of close cooperation with foreign police forces 
and cooperation at the level of other bodies involved in the 
suppression of crime. 
  With regard to the prison system, the government will 
establish further norms to govern the serving of prison terms 
and will see to the creation of prerequisites for the employment 
of convicts. 
  The government will establish the prerequisites for a 
comprehensive system of protecting the state border against 
illegal migration. 
  Our immediate aim is not only to make public life more 
democratic, but also to strengthen public order and social 
responsibility for public affairs at the level of the community 
and the whole state. 
  In conjunction with the preparation of elections to the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic and community 
self-administrative bodies, the government will prepare and 
introduce the appropriate organizational, technical, and 
material measures, in harmony with the Constitution and laws. 

<H8>    Aims and Tasks in Legislation </H8>
  An important intention of the government is to strive for a 
functional and internally harmonious legal system, so that there 
are no discrepancies among individual legal norms, their 
compatibility with the European law is increased, and their life 
span extended. The government's aim in this area is to 
contribute to the stabilization of developments in the republic 
and to gradually establish a democratic, cooperative, and 
peaceful environment for building our state. In addition, the 
government will ensure the better orientation of citizens in the 
rapidly changing legal system of the republic. It will 
coordinate the entire process of the massive transformation of 
legislation to a far greater degree than has been the case thus 
far. 
  The passage of the amendment to the law on the organization 
of ministries and other central bodies of state administration, 
which the government pushed through in the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic immediately after its appointment, put an 
end to the provisional situation that arose in the wake of the 
transfer of the former federation's powers to the Slovak 
Republic. The passage of this law wound up the building of the 
institutions of the young state and established prerequisites 
for its operation as a law- governed state. 
  In the period running up to the September elections, the 
government will place emphasis, in the legislative sphere, on 
the establishment of basic legislative rules for the stable 
functioning of the state. 
  The key long-term task in the legislative sphere is to 
ensure 
the compatibility of our legal system with laws of the European 
Union. The implementation of this task is urgent also because, 
thus far, the Slovak Republic did not devote the appropriate 
attention to the fulfillment of this commitment, which arises 
from the association agreement concluded between the CSFR and 
the European Community. 
  It will be necessary to reexamine the compatibility of our 
legal regulations with the appropriate Council of Europe 
agreements to which the Slovak Republic is a contracting party, 
and to adopt measures necessary to meet the adopted commitments. 
It will also be appropriate to analyze those Council of Europe 
conventions to which the Slovak Republic is not a contracting 
party from the viewpoint of our possible accession to them. 
  With this in mind, the government is determined to prepare 
its legislative proposals so that the legal system of the Slovak 
Republic is brought closer to European law, in spirit as well as 
in contents. The government will establish conditions to raise 
the standard, and importance, of comparative legal studies. 
  The basic intentions in the legislative sphere proceed from 
the government's general intention to stabilize developments in 
the Slovak Republic and to establish conditions for the peaceful 
building of the state. 
  To make this possible, systemic prerequisites must be 
established for purity of public life. We are firmly determined 
to prepare and enforce in the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic a law on preventing conflicts of interest in the 
performance of duties, which would pertain to constitutional and 
higher-level state administration officials. This law will put 
an end to the practice of higher-level state officials 
collecting several salaries from the state and will render it 
impossible for state officials to exploit their post for illicit 
profits from entrepreneurial activity. We will prepare a law 
that will lay down the obligation to prove the origin of 
financial resources used in privatization. Only such systemic 
legislative provisions for the purity of public life can restore 
citizens' trust in their representatives in state bodies and in 
state institutions in general. The peaceful building of our 
republic would be impossible without this basic trust. 
  The government considers it important to improve conditions 
for the entrepreneurial sphere and for the operation of 
non-profit organizations. With this in mind, it will prepare a 
law on state support for small and medium-sized business, as 
well as a draft law on foundations and civic associations. 
  The rise in crime and, in particular, the emergence of new 
forms of crime, compel us to proceed energetically in this 
sphere. In the legislative sphere, this means expeditiously 
preparing and submitting a law on combating organized crime as 
well as amendments to the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. In the principles of a new Penal Code and a new Code 
of Criminal Procedure, the government will formulate its 
fundamental plans for the future. 
  In its legislative activity, the government is prepared to 
meet also those international commitments that were assumed by 
the former government. 
  We attach extraordinary importance to the consolidation and 
stabilization of state administration. We want to submit to the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic a law on civil service 
that will make it possible to improve the execution of the state 
administration and to separate qualified staff from political 
functions. 
  The government's legislative activity will also extend to 
the 
preparation of new parliamentary rules of procedure and, 
possibly, to the improvement of legislative conditions for the 
parliamentary and communal elections in 1994. 

<H8>    The Security and the Defense of the State </H8>
  The government will complete principal documents regarding 
the concepts for Slovak Republic's security and defense policy 
-- which are: the Basic Objectives and the Principles for the 
Slovak Republic's National Security, the Slovak Republic's 
Defense Doctrine, the Strategic Concept for the Defense of the 
Slovak Republic, and the Concept for the Building of the Army of 
the Slovak Republic -- and will present them to the applicable 
bodies for approval. Within the framework of the Partnership 
For Peace plan, the government will present to the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic a Presentation Document, in which 
our cooperation with NATO will be outlined. In the interests of 
laying down the foundations for the legal basis of the defense 
of our democratic state, the government will draft a bill on the 
Slovak Republic's defense, on the Slovak Republic Army, on 
compulsory military service, and on the working conditions of 
the soldiers of the Slovak Republic Army. 
  The government wants to consistently continue the 
transformation of the army. In this framework, the government 
will demand that the Defense Ministry should precisely define 
its own jurisdiction in the military, political, and executive 
spheres, and create conditions for introducing systemic 
management and increasing the powers of the lover organizational 
structures. It is necessary to gradually introduce the system 
of defensive planning, programming, and budgeting. By 
introducing these qualitative changes, the government wants to 
free the huge human potential in the army, be able to utilize 
material and financial resources more rationally and 
efficiently, and create systemic prerequisites for a democratic 
control of the army. 
  The Defense Ministry will draft a concept for social policy, 
in which it will pay increased attention to the solution of the 
problems linked to the living conditions of the individual 
groups of soldiers, improvement of the overall atmosphere in the 
army, and improvement in relations between its members. In the 
Ministry of Defense sector, education toward patriotism will 
improve, and a concept for religious services within the army 
will be drafted. 
  The Slovak Republic Government has decided to build the army 
within the framework of the adopted international obligations so 
that this army might become a modern army, sufficiently armed 
and trained for the defense of our country. 
<H8>  Foreign Policy </H8>
  The objectives and priorities of the Slovak Republic's 
foreign policy were correctly set out after the establishment of 
the independent state. In the past period, the decisive 
political forces adopted them. In this way, the basic 
prerequisites have been established for political consensus 
needed in the country, which is in the process of establishing 
itself in international relations. This consensus was 
significantly confirmed in practice when the government of wide 
coalition was established. This is a good signal to foreign 
countries. 
  A full integration of Slovakia in European political, 
economic, and security structures is a priority of strategic 
importance. We realize the significance of our future 
membership in the European Union. We want to create our path to 
our membership by developing all-encompassing relations with the 
European Union and its individual members. The internal 
prerequisite for the success of our efforts is a further 
stabilization of our democratic institutions, a speedy 
continuation of economic transformation, and respect for the 
principles of our legal system. We are going to cooperate in 
harmonizing the Slovak Republic's legal system with the European 
laws. Our pushing the individual countries of the European 
Union toward the smooth completion of the ratification process 
outlined in the European Association Treaty will be our most 
topical task in the upcoming period. 
  The government confirms the interest of the Slovak Republic 
in obtaining full membership in NATO and the Western European 
Union. This objective is not based on any imminent threat, but 
on the logic of our orientation and our scale of values. The 
government will use the opportunity given to us in the 
Partnership For Peace plan. In relation to the Western European 
Union, the government will take diplomatic steps to 
qualitatively improve our status, with the aim of achieving 
as-close-as-possible cooperation with all the Western European 
Union's structures. 
  The Slovak Republic will build on its successful activity in 
the United Nations and its specialized agencies. By being 
active in the UN peacekeeping forces, we are also accepting the 
responsibility for keeping peace on the global scale. We are 
also going to use our presence in the CSCE process, where we 
will build on our experience from work in the Troika. 
  The Slovak Republic's membership in the Council of Europe 
has 
a key role in the development of democratic institutions and the 
protection of human rights. We are going to create legislative 
prerequisites for meeting the recommendations of the Council of 
Europe's Parliamentary Assembly in connection with the Slovak 
Republic's joining the Council of Europe. We want our experts 
to be more active in the process of drafting new documents and 
legal norms in the Council of Europe, mainly those documents 
that deal with the protection of the rights of ethnic 
minorities. The government will prepare an analysis of the 
conditions for the Slovak Republic's joining the European 
charter of Regional and Minority Languages, and the European 
Charter of Local Self-Administration. 
  The government is aware of the fact that every successful 
step of the state in the sphere of multilateral diplomacy is 
also dependent on the large scale of harmonious bilateral 
relations, particularly with our closest neighbors. The 
government is interested in forming relations with the 
neighboring countries in the spirit of modern European 
cooperation. Slovakia will act as a reliable and cooperating 
partner. We are expecting a similar attitude from our 
neighbors. We are convinced that this type of cooperation will 
bring a double benefit. It will mobilize the hidden potential 
of bilateral relations and create favorable conditions for 
trustworthy integration of the Central European countries in the 
process of Europe's unification. In this sense, we are also 
understanding of the European Union's initiative -- the Pact of 
Stability -- which can help create political conditions for the 
integration of the Central European countries in the European 
Union, while respecting the interests of the participating 
countries and retaining wide stability in our region. We are 
aware of the fact that a satisfactory solution of the problems 
linked to the people belonging to ethnic minorities is part of 
European stability. We will pay extra attention, in particular, 
to cooperation with our neighbors that are undergoing the 
transformation process, namely the Czech Republic, Poland, and 
Hungary. After the most recent decision on the conditions for 
Austria's joining the European Union, the existing importance of 
our relations with Austria will grow even more. We are very 
interested in cooperating with Ukraine and in a successful 
completion of the transformation process in this important 
European country. 
  The government will make efforts to develop advantageous 
relations and a high level of political dialogue with other 
European countries. We are interested in broadening and 
intensifying cooperation with the United States and Canada with 
the aim of strengthening the transatlantic dimension of the 
Slovak Republic's foreign policy. The Slovak Republic is also 
interested in maintaining good relations and general cooperation 
with the Russian Federation. In the economic sphere, the 
government will create proper conditions for developing 
cooperation, particularly with the G-7 countries and the OECD, 
while it will pay increased attention to the dynamically 
developing Pacific region. Searching for cooperation in other 
parts of the world will become a permanent task for our 
diplomacy. 
  A greater level of involvement of the tools of Slovak 
diplomacy and closer coordination with economic sectors in the 
sphere of pushing for the Slovak Republic's interests must 
become a significant feature of our efforts in the period to 
come. It is possible to push for Slovak interests abroad only 
if our foreign service is fully professional and the leading 
positions at our diplomatic missions abroad filled. 
  To provide objective information to the foreign countries on 
the developments in the country and to intensify communication 
with our partners is a permanent task for the government. The 
government confirms the necessity to develop the closest 
contacts with our people living abroad. 
  The government will consistently secure the coordination of 
foreign policy activities and is prepared to coordinate closely 
with the National Council of the Slovak Republic and the 
president of the Slovak Republic in order to fully utilize 
constitutional bodies of the state in the interests of 
strengthening the international position of the Slovak Republic. 
We have to realize that the smaller the country is, the more 
professional its foreign policy must be for it to assume a firm 
position in the network of international relations. 
  The government is convinced that, when pushing for our 
foreign policy interests, we do not have to create an atmosphere 
of fear and create the image of an enemy. In foreign policy we 
want to solve problems in a businesslike manner, professionally, 
with a feeling of responsibility for the destiny of our country. 
<H8>  Conclusion </H8>
  The government is presenting its policy statement while 
being 
aware of the fact that it has a mandate for only six months. 
From its contents it is clear that the government will not 
conduct policy aimed at creating effects for the election 
campaign. The government is not going to postpone important 
decisions. On the contrary, it will create conditions for 
making the inevitable changes more dynamic, the objective of 
which is political stability, economic prosperity, and a free 
and fruitful civic society. 
  The government coalition initiated early elections. It did 
not do so because of self-interests, or in fearing 
responsibility. The government is convinced that, in this short 
period, it can show the Slovak citizens that there is an 
alternative to the way of governing the country, an alternative 
that avoids confrontational and strong-arm gestures in politics, 
and an alternative that can improve the respect for our country 
abroad. We believe in the increasing power of civic democratic 
society and are convinced that when parliamentary elections are 
held, we will be able to look the electorate in the eye and 
accept its decision. Before this happens, we want to call on 
all the people to join our work for the benefit of the Slovak 
Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by correspondent Eva </F>
Hulkova; place and date not given; from the "Conversations at 
Lany" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hulkova] [passage omitted] I would like to 
touch on a very painful topic concerning the current very dismal 
situation that Czech radio finds itself in. A few days ago, the 
Radio and Television Broadcasting Council decided to take the 
medium wave frequency away from Czech Radio and allocate it to a 
private operator. I would like to know how you feel about this 
business. 
  [Havel] [passage omitted] The result of taking the medium 
wave frequency away would be a constraint on the broadcasting 
potential of Czech radio. What occurs to me against the 
background of some other matters, such as the deputies' 
sponsored proposal to privatize Czech Television Second Channel, 
is whether this issue is not a rather dangerous or exaggerated 
passion for privatization, the consequences of which could turn 
not only against the public, but eventually even against the 
political power itself. After all, if we have only private 
radios broadcasting all the time pop-music and advertisements, 
and if we have television broadcasting American horror films and 
so on and so forth, one day it could happen that important 
political information does not at all reach the public. [passage 
omitted] 
  Naturally, this is linked to the fact that the legislation 
covering the non-profit making sphere in our country has not 
been completed yet. As you know, I often recollect this topic. 
One of the many types of non-profit making organizations are 
public institutions. While we have the law on television and 
radio, these laws are bit intangible and I am not sure about 
their quality. This applies mainly to the decisionmaking 
mechanisms operating through the [Radio and Television 
Broadcasting] Council. The Council's decision is thus primarily 
a reminder of the importance of regulating this sphere, of 
thinking out well and without bias what position should be given 
to the public institutions and of comprehending that they are 
absolutely irreplaceable. I regard the trend leading to 
imposing an excessive constraint on their potential for the 
benefit of commercial media as very dangerous. It is a trend 
which could turn against all of us. 
  [Hulkova] [passage omitted] Now we know what the president's 
view is. This view is unequivocally in line with the view held 
by the prime minister, parliament speaker, all the 
representatives of all political parties, and by the broad 
public. All of them unanimously agree that the Council's 
measure is not very good. What occurs to me in this context is 
-- where is the law, where is the justice? Pardon me for using 
such grand words. 
  [Havel] It appears that the Council, which as far as I know 
cannot be dismissed, has been given disproportionate powers. It 
seems to me that the Council set up by the parliament should not 
be the last, the highest, and only decisionmaking body. 
Undoubtedly, it has a million reasons to justify its decision. 
But all the same, it seems to me, that just as everywhere else, 
in this case there should also be a chance to appeal and to 
evaluate its decision on a higher level. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] This week was very dismal for the population of 
Gorazde. As the world is admitting its powerlessness, I would 
like to ask whose turn is it now to solve this? 
  [Havel] As you well know, for a long time I have been 
feeling 
the world community's bewilderment and helplessness and I have 
found it difficult to come to terms with. I consider the fact 
that the world community is pulling itself up only now, when the 
things went as far as they did, to be sad, tragic and almost 
shameful. The Karadzic army is more or less ridiculing the 
whole world, doing whatever it wants. 
  It is only now that there is any really serious debate about 
decisive steps to stop this. My view is that the evil has to be 
fought, the sooner the better, if possible at the very 
beginning. The stakes in this issue are very high; above all, 
those thousands of innocent people who are suffering and are 
being murdered, including patients at medical points that are 
being attacked and shelled. However, there is much more at 
stake here -- this is something explosive, something that might 
represent a political threat to the whole of Europe if nothing 
is done about it. 
  I do believe, that at least at this late stage the world 
community will after all take a course of action decisive enough 
to open the door for really serious talks, not just pseudo-talks 
when one side deals with the other with the knowledge that they 
are liars and that they will deceive them the next day anyway. 
This is just a negotiating game. It is clear that it is always 
better to negotiate than to bomb somebody. However, 
unfortunately, sometimes there is a situation when there is no 
other way to force somebody to engage in serious talks than to 
use a tough threat against him. 
  [Hulkova] Mr. President, do you think that the Americans who 
are still traumatized by the Vietnam experience will be prepared 
to wage a real war, prepared for sacrifices for this issue, if 
necessary? 
  [Havel] This is America's traditional and big problem, it 
has 
been America's problem before Vietnam and after Vietnam. 
[passage omitted] 
  Everybody understands that the American public is very 
reserved regarding U.S. involvement in the world. However, at 
the same time it is clear that this big state has some sort of 
an indirect responsibility for the fate of freedom, democracy, 
human rights, and basic moral decency of human coexistence on 
this globe. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Edmond Laci: "`Omonia,' the Shadow of Suspicion"] </F>
  [Text] Tirana -- There are suspicions that many of 
Omonia's activists in the south of Albania have been involved in 
anticonstitutional activities. On Wednesday [20 April] 
afternoon, a Public Order Ministry statement confirmed reports 
that, following several surprise raids in different districts of 
Albania, "a large amount of anticonstitutional literature has 
been found, proving Greek expansionist aims toward Albania and 
Albanian territory," as well as "brazen Greek attempts to 
Hellenize the area of southern Albania." These confiscated 
documents include publications such as "Greece's Northern 
Epirus," by Sebastianos, the metropolitan of Dropull; many maps 
showing more than four-fifths of the present territory of 
Albania as "Northern Epirus," and other secret material. Also 
on Wednesday, Omonia's main leaders, while not unambiguously 
speaking out about the reasons behind the detention of many of 
their leading activists, demanded in a letter to President 
Berisha "the immediate release of all the detainees," who 
belong, they claim, to the Greek ethnic minority in Albania. 
  The lightning strikes organized by the Public Order 
Ministry, 
according to its statement, were carried out following reports 
of the unlicensed possession of weapons and of criminal 
anticonstitutional activities. The 11 detainees confirmed by 
the Public Order Ministry include many persons from other 
districts of the Omonia branch in Gjirokaster, and other 
activists of the association. On Tuesday alone, five more 
people, whom preliminary investigations accuse of 
anticonstitutional activity, were detained in Delvine. These 
are Kosta Miculi, Pirro Kondi, Panajot Mato, Pandeli Gazeli, and 
Kostaq Cavo. An unlicensed firearm was found on one of them. 
  Thoma Sharra, deputy general chairman of Omonia, told GAZETA 
SHQIPTARE that "As far as we know, four people have been 
detained in Sarande alone, including one woman activist. The 
detainees include Vangjel Papakristo, chairman of the Omonia 
branch in Sarande." 
  [words indistinct] three more Omonia activists in 
Gjirokaster 
have been detained, while two people remained in detention in 
Korce on Wednesday. The first was Ermioni Andrea, chairwoman of 
Omonia in Korce, and the second the chairman of the 
Albania-Greek Friendship Association. According to Sharra, the 
deputy chairman of the Omonia branch in Tirana was detained for 
18 hours. Omonia Chairman Sotiraq Qiriazati wrote in his letter 
to President Berisha that, "in recent days, the ShlK [National 
Intelligence Service] and the police have been subjecting us to 
a wave of psychological repression, with detentions, raids on 
homes, and searches of Omonia offices." The day before the 
delivery of this letter, which attempts to connect the recent 
detentions to the criminal incident in the barracks at Peshkepi, 
the Public Order Ministry's spokesman had explained that "all 
Albanian citizens, regardless of their ethnicity, are obliged to 
obey the law of the Albanian state."

<F P=106> ["Cs.I."-signed interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of </F>
the Independent Smallholders Party; place and date not given: 
"The Victor Always Finds Friends"] 
  [Text] The renewal of the nation needs a leadership ready 
for sacrifices, a leadership accepted by the population -- 
Jozsef Torgyan said in the series of interviews we are 
publishing with the heads of political parties that presented an 
election list. The chairman of the Independent Smallholders 
Party [FKGP] is sure that his party will be one of the winners 
in the elections. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Four years ago, the still united FKGP 
received 11.7 percent of the votes. Listening to your speeches, 
it seems that you are almost certain that the party will far 
exceed this figure this time. 
  [Torgyan] You must know that you are talking to the possible 
winner of the elections. Despite the situation of immense 
discrimination against us and despite the fact that we are under 
constant fire and that, near the pseudo-opposition that signed a 
pact, we were the only real opposition party in Hungary, we not 
only revived our party but also won over considerable masses of 
people, and this clearly proves that the FKGP is one of the 
potential winners of the elections. I think the Hungarian 
people are sober and careful enough to be able to understand why 
there is a deliberate silence about Jozsef Torgyan and the FKGP. 
The government achieves exactly the opposite effect: It is 
possible that, with this attitude, [Prime Minister] Peter Boross 
helps us win a tremendous victory and, in case we win, I will 
publicly thank him for this in a very polite manner. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does your party's division hinder the 
achievement of such results? 
  [Torgyan] Some 99.9 percent of our members support us. We 
have never made it a secret that the gates are open and we 
welcome any group of any name, no matter what they call 
themselves: democratic smallholders, conservative smallholders, 
national-oriented, or not national; we welcome the members, but 
God save us from the betraying leaders! A party whose chairman 
is only busy with cursing Jozsef Torgyan! I do not think that 
this would be an adequate program in the elections. It is clear 
that the current government created and maintains the United 
Smallhodlers' Party, and it is no accident that, behind their 
backs, people call them the party of ministerial armchairs. 
This party will end up on history's garbage dump after 8 May, 
and no one will have to deal with these issues ever again. We 
have ceased to deal with these issues for quite a while. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Your personality will surely bring many 
votes for the FGKP in a certain circle, but is there a real 
program behind the declared promises, a program that can be 
implemented? 
  [Torgyan] We are the only party that clearly stipulated in 
its program that in case of an election victory, we will carry 
out radical changes in all walks of life. It is worth pointing 
out, and we do not keep it a secret either, that in case we 
become part of the government, we will discard the 
Budapest-centered political activity and will replace it with a 
village-centered policy. We will create a top agricultural 
ministry to revive the Hungarian agriculture, and we will 
subordinate all the other sectors to this, including the foreign 
affairs. Basically, it is possible to restore the agricultural 
sector in two years. This is a full program that differs from 
every other party's program. We would also apply totally 
different solutions in legal matters, constitutional issues, the 
state apparatus, privatization, unemployment, and the national 
debt. National renewal requires a selfless leadership ready for 
sacrifices, and one accepted by the population. We stress that 
if someone gets a public function, he should not try to fill his 
own pockets; instead, he should fill the pockets of the voters 
he represents. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The FKGP has never named the desirable 
coalition partners. It is also true that, with the exception of 
the Hungarian Justice and Life Party and the Market Party, all 
the parliamentary parties distance themselves from the FKGP led 
by Jozsef Torgyan. 
  [Torgyan] I am not willing to cooperate with certain types 
of leaders. People who have ignored and disregarded 
constitutional methods so far, would be ready to do the same 
anytime. Although people did not pay enough attention, I always 
said that a party is one thing, and its leadership is another 
thing. I am not sure that the parliamentary parties which you 
are taking into account now will have the same leadership after 
the elections. On the other hand, I start from the premise that 
a victor always finds friends. The question is whether the 
victor can calmly select. We want and will be able to select. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If things turn out that way, under what 
conditions would you accept the position of prime minister? 
  [Torgyan] I am a professional person who is absolutely aware 
that it is impossible to keep waiting for new parliamentary 
cycles to have a talented leader at long last. Nor can one wait 
until an untalented leader becomes somebody. On the other hand, 
one should examine the possibility of creating a social 
cooperation in which the whole population supports the prime 
minister, because it is impossible to get out of the current 
catastrophic situation in any other way. If the conditions for 
this cannot be created, one must not accept the position.

<F P=106> [Interview with Green Party Chairman Zoltan Medveczki by </F>
Zoltan J. Gal; place and date not given: "A Small Mammal Among 
Dinosaurs"] 
  [Text] Before voting for a party, some 250,000-300,000 
people in Hungary are first curious to know what party did what 
for environmental protection. The achievement of the Hungarian 
Green Party [MZP] is perhaps the biggest surprise of the 
election campaign so far: They succeeded in presenting a 
national list after gathering the nomination slips. The stormy 
phase in the history of the MZP began in the spring of 1993 when 
many people left the party. The views of the party's current 
leaders -- like the view on the so-called neo-Zionism -- have 
been repeatedly labeled as fascist. The national list of the 
700-member MZP is led by Zoltan Medveczki. We interviewed the 
31-year-old forest ranger and party chairman. 
  [Gal] Many people find your success surprising.... 
  [Medveczki] This is not a success for us; this is below our 
expectations. 
  [Gal] What did you expect? 
  [Medveczki] We thought that the elections would enable us to 
finally prove that green politics is neither rightist nor 
leftist. 
  [Gal] Why? Where do you stand? 
  [Medveczki] In front. We could be called small mammals 
among the huge socialist and democratic dinosaurs. 
  [Gal] Your achievement is nevertheless surprising, all the 
more so because, as far as we know, you looked for candidates 
through advertisements. 
  [Medveczki] This is a professional way of selecting 
candidates. Nixon also answered a newspaper advertisement, and 
later he became President. 
  [Gal] All over the world, the green parties regard 
environmental protection as a major goal. What would you do for 
this? 
  [Medveczki] The MZP is also engaged in politics for the 
benefit of environmental protection, human protection, and 
health protection. Environmental protection should be treated 
as a symptom, and not as a cause. This means that we Hungarians 
should also use green technologies instead of the obsolete 
technologies. Most cars in Brazil are running with alcohol made 
from sugar cane. Sugar beet could be grown along the highways in 
Hungary, and then the cars would also be running with alcohol 
here. And we would only laugh at the Arabs if they increased 
the oil prices in the meantime. 
  [Gal] If I understand it correctly, surplus sugar cane is 
used for fuel production in Brazil. In Hungary, however, all 
that produce that would give way to the planting of "fuel sugar 
beet" would be missing. Am I mistaken? 
  [Medveczki] Nothing would be missing. We are growing wheat 
in vain along the highways. In addition, this way, we also eat 
the lead together with the bread, and then we are surprised to 
learn that Hungary has the biggest number of cancer cases. 
  [Gal] You often declared that you support the construction 
of the power station at Nagymaros. You must be quite alone with 
this opinion. 
  [Medveczki] We start from the premise that a lot of money 
has been invested in the construction of the dam. We are also 
aware of the advantages of such a dam. 
  [Gal] But there is no water in the Danube. 
  [Medveczki] This is precisely the point! The Danube is 
carrying less and less water and, therefore, dams are essential. 
Such dams should be constructed in as many places as possible, 
because these dams modify the unfavorable climatic effects and 
increase the level of ground water. Besides, the secretary of 
the MZP was the first person who refused to listen to anyone 
here and went to Slovakia to get information there. 
  [Gal] We quote from your party's leaflets: "Hungarians 
should eat Hungarian fruit, including apples from Szabolcs, 
peaches from Kecskemet, watermelons from Csany." They should? 
  [Medveczki] The consumption of national plants is the basis 
of our national independence. It is a proved fact that everyone 
should eat the products of the ecosystem in which he lives, 
because he can only digest this type of food. 
  [Gal] Another slogan: "Among the political organizations in 
Hungary, it is only the Green Party that is deliberately 
fighting against the following monstrosities: prostitution, 
homosexuality, an immoral way of life.... microwave ovens, 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and McDonald's." How does a 
political party fight against prostitution, homosexuality, and 
an immoral way of life? 
  [Medveczki] We would inform the people that there would be 
no need for prostitution with an adequate sexual culture. 
Prostitution and homosexuality are the hotbed of AIDS. 
However, these monstrosities are constantly advertised in 
Hungary. No children will be born from a relationship between 
two homosexuals, and we would not like to see the Hungarian 
nation disappear from the Carpathian Basin. 
  [Gal] I think this violates human rights and also the 
Constitution of the Hungarian Republic. 
  [Medveczki] If the homosexuals start thinking, they will 
realize that we are also fighting for them by strengthening the 
role of the family with our positive advertisements. We Green 
men like women, and the Green women like men. 
  [Gal] The MZP also set up a police group and a defense 
commando unit. What for? 
  [Medveczki] We will defend not only others, but also 
ourselves against those who attack us. 
  [Gal] A commando unit attacks, it does not defend. 
  [Medveczki] The condition of acceptance in this unit is a 
basic knowledge of aikido. This combat sport uses the attack 
energy for defense. If you want to hit me, I will not kick your 
head off, I will only defend myself. Besides, this commando 
unit has various tasks. We will have to face tremendous 
catastrophes in the near future, and this might urge people to 
blow up the nuclear power stations. The life defense commando 
unit would find these people and neutralize them. 
  [Gal] You also declared war on the so-called neo-Zionism. 
What is that? 
  [Medveczki] More correctly, it is pseudo-Zionism. We would 
like the Arab-Israeli conflict to end. Both Jews and Arabs 
should be informed that they are not the ones who confront each 
other in this conflict; those who are inciting this war are the 
ones that confront each other. 
  [Gal] People find several similarities between the symbol of 
the MZP and the Nazi symbol. 
  [Medveczki] I would suggest those who judge our party on the 
basis of such outside appearances to try to use this on the 
United States or the FTC [a Budapest soccer club], because these 
two organizations also have the same eagle in their symbol. It 
is strange that the orange used by the Federation of Young 
Democrats in their advertisements does not bother anyone, 
although the orange is a non-Hungarian fruit.

  [Text] Would your party be willing to lay down the 
unchangeability of current borders in basic treaties with the 
neighboring countries? If not, then with which country would 
you refuse to do this? 
  Gyorgy Fabri, Agrarian Federation: "Good-neighborly 
relations with the states of the east European region and the 
establishment of a viable system of relations is a distinctly 
important goal of our foreign policy concept. With this in 
mind, we are willing to lay down the recognition of the current 
borders and their unchangeability in basic treaties with all 
neighboring countries." 
  Karoly Herenyi, Hungarian Democratic Forum: "The term 
`unchangeability' actually means a ban on all changes. The 
international agreements in force do not suggest and do not even 
allow any such categoric bans. Together with the other 
democratic parliamentary parties, we also claim that, in 
agreement with the international norms, the given populations, 
the given countries, and the international community, border 
changes are theoretically possible. It is a different matter 
that, rather than at border changes, Hungary's political 
endeavors are directed at achieving that all national minorities 
be able to live within such an institutional and political 
framework that makes it possible for them to survive within the 
current borders. The establishment of such circumstances also 
guarantees the security of the states, and the inviolability and 
stability of borders. We would like to have these included in 
the treaties with our neighbors." 
  Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]: 
"According to the SZDSZ, Hungary will not need to initiate any 
kind of border changes in the future, either. We support the 
inclusion of this in basic treaties with all our neighbors, 
however, the signing of a basic treaty is a political gesture 
that also has to settle other important areas of bilateral 
relations, including the situation of the national minorities, 
and the expansion of economic and cultural links." 
  Lorant Benedek, Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP]: "As 
various international agreements -- including the Paris peace 
treaty and the Helsinki agreement -- lay down the 
unchangeability of the current borders when the interested 
parties cannot both agree, the MIEP considers further such 
agreements completely unnecessary. In fact, more treaties like 
these would only serve the purpose that the neighboring 
countries that advocate this will be able to support their 
obviously false propaganda claim according to which the 
Hungarians are intending to aggressively conquer territories, 
and this is why these countries need to coerce Hungary to sign 
such treaties." 
  Laszlo Urban, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]: ``In 
the Fidesz's view, the basic treaties are suitable for settling 
the situation of national minorities living beyond the borders. 
Therefore, it supports the signing of these treaties, especially 
with those neighboring countries where Hungarian minorities are 
living. However, negotiations on the Romanian and Slovak 
treaties have been suspended. Both these neighbors insist that 
Hungary again declare in the treaty that it does not want any 
border changes (neither in violent nor in peaceful ways). On 
the other hand, Hungary wishes to receive institutional 
guarantees in the basic treaties on settling the situation of 
national minorities. 
  ``Hungary does not want to change the borders through either 
violent of peaceful ways. The Fidesz cannot see any obstacles 
to including these in the basic treaties. At the same time, it 
considers it important for the basic treaty to also contain a 
section on national minorities. The views of the Hungarian 
minority have to be taken into consideration when drawing up 
this section. 
  ``The Fidesz urges the signing of basic treaties with the 
neighboring countries as a culmination of good-neighborly 
relations. However, it is important to establish a system of 
diverse bilateral agreements because, without these, the basic 
treaty would be a formal act without any content.'' 
  Gyula Thurmer, Workers Party: "The Workers Party wishes to 
base our relations with the neighboring countries on three 
pillars. We are offering a treaty in which we first declare that 
we do not want to change the borders. Second, we mutually 
ensure the rights of national minorities in accordance with the 
European norms and the possibilities of the affected countries. 
Third, we put down in writing that we cooperate in all areas." 
  Gyorgy Janosi, Hungarian Socialist Party: "It is expedient 
to sign the basic treaty with Slovakia and Romania as soon as 
possible. In the documents, the current borders have to be 
confirmed, and the guaranteeing of national minority rights in 
accordance with the European norms has to be stipulated. After 
the the South Slav crisis is settled, we will immediately have 
to begin placing our relations with Yugoslavia and Serbia on new 
foundations. Using the opportunities that will arise from 
signing the basic treaties, we further have to expand our 
relations with Croatia, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Also bearing 
Hungary's security policy interests in mind, there is no 
alternative to historical reconciliation." 
  Marica Korondy, Mrs. Balla, Independent Smallholders Party 
[FKGP]: "According to the FKGP's foreign policy program, the 
Hungarian Republic has to observe the Helsinki Final Act that 
was also signed by the Hungarian Government. Hungary is not 
intending to change the borders, and it sees Central and Eastern 
Europe's stability and security in recognizing the region's 
national minorities as political entities. It is unnecessary to 
surrender our future rights in the basic treaties with the 
neighboring countries. At the wish of the Hungarians in the 
neighboring countries who were forced into a minority situation 
as a result of the Paris peace system, a system of viable 
autonomies has to be established, and this way, the transparency 
of borders can be achieved when the border issues will no longer 
need to be raised." 
  Zoltan Kiraly, Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP]: 
"If the MSZDP gets into a position to make decisions, then it 
would be willing to lay down the unchangeability of the current 
borders in basic treaties with neighboring countries."

<F P=106> ["rueb." report: "Romania Warns Against `Disastrous Logic </F>
of Violence'"] 
  [Text] Bucharest, 24 April -- Foreign Minister Melescanu 
has commented reservedly on NATO's threats against the Bosnian 
Serbs that are connected with the ultimatum. It is still too 
early to assess this step, he said in an interview with this 
newspaper. He sees the possibility that an acceleration of the 
peace process might follow from the threat. However, it is also 
conceivable that a disastrous logic of violence will be started. 
It might become very difficult to break it again, he said. 
  Melescanu took the view that, after the agreement between 
the 
Muslims and Croats on the formation of a joint state in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the attempt has to be made now to again 
involve the Bosnian Serbs in the negotiations. A comprehensive 
peace plan that starts from the German-French peace initiative 
is necessary. In return for concessions of the Bosnian Serbs in 
the peace negotiations, this plan, which was proposed by 
[German] Foreign Minister Kinkel and [French] Foreign Minister 
Juppe and later adopted by the European Union (EU), provides for 
the gradual loosening of the sanctions against Serbia and 
Montenegro. In addition to the European Union, the United 
States, Russia, and the United Nations have to be involved in 
the talks of the warring parties, Melescanu said. 
  Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies of the 
Romanian 
Parliament and chairman of the biggest partner in the government 
coalition, the Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR), 
expressed the view that, with NATO's latest threats, the peace 
process has reached a decisive point. Nastase, who is expected 
for a five-day visit to Germany this Monday [25 April], told 
this newspaper that the shelling of Muslim enclaves by the 
Serbian besiegers has to be stopped immediately. At the same 
time, however, he also warned against a possible escalation of 
violence. All political means have to be used to accelerate the 
peace process again. Here a gradual loosening of the sanctions 
against Serbia and Montenegro is also to be considered. So many 
attempts have been made to achieve peace in the former 
Yugoslavia. "We should also try to loosen the sanctions," 
Nastase said. 
  According to Nastase, Romania has suffered an economic 
damage 
of more than 11 billion German marks [DM] as a consequence of 
the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. In order to 
compensate the neighboring countries of "Yugoslavia" -- Serbia 
and Montenegro -- at least for part of the damage, Nastase 
proposed the establishment of a UN fund. Romania, which has 
traditionally good relations with all successor states of the 
former Yugoslavia, is offering its services as a further 
mediator in the Balkan war, if this is desired. Bucharest is 
also conceivable as a possible place for new peace negotiations. 
  "Yugoslav" Prime Minister Jovanovic said in Bucharest that 
NATO's threats are an "unfortunate development" and a further 
proof of the continuous application of different standards in 
the Balkan war by the West. The "negative developments" in 
Gorazde were caused by a Muslim offensive, to which the Bosnian 
Serbs had only reacted with a counteroffensive. The "Muslim 
offensive," however, was not noticed in the West, but it reacted 
with punitive actions to the Serbian counteroffensive. 
Jovanovic expressed the fear that the "important results" of 
the meeting of Akashi, UN envoy for the former Yugoslavia, with 
Serbian President Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic in 
Belgrade last Saturday, might be thwarted by NATO's "pressure 
from the outside." Morizet, French diplomat in Bucharest, felt 
called upon to warn that one must not counter "the terror on the 
ground with (NATO) terror from the air" in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu by Goran </F>
Gotev; place and date not given: "Romania Is a Country of 
Equilibrium, Dialogue, and Stability"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Gotev] The announcement that 
Romania is the second Eastern European country, following 
Poland, to halt the decline in production and show signs of a 
rise in its GNP caused a sensation in Bulgaria. How do you 
explain these results and what effect will they have on your 
relations with other countries? 
  [Melescanu] Our country's leadership has been concerned with 
halting the economic decline since 1990, but due to the existing 
internal and external conditions, this goal was only achieved in 
1993. It happened because of the continuous efforts to 
restructure and technologically reequip our industrial 
enterprises, to privatize whole sectors of our national economy, 
such as trade, tourism, and construction, and to return the land 
to the peasants. At the same time, we completed a restructuring 
of the banking system, decentralized foreign trade, and 
supported free enterprise in the small industry and services 
sectors. This year we plan to carry out a major privatization 
of industry. 
  These results can increase the confidence of business 
circles 
in the developed states in the opportunities for cooperation 
with Romania, which for us will lead to an increase in foreign 
investments and support from the international financial 
organizations. 
  [Gotev] How do you view the prospects for the development of 
Bulgarian-Romanian relations, which includes taking joint 
foreign policy initiatives in the Balkans and the Black Sea zone? 
  [Melescanu] Romania ascribes particular importance to 
comprehensively developing its relations with Bulgaria. No 
disputed or unresolved problems remain between our countries. 
Since 1990, Romanian-Bulgarian cooperation has been progressing 
positively in all fields. Despite the fact that we have no 
top-level official contacts for one year, I am sure that the 
relations of cooperation and good-neighborliness between Romania 
and Bulgaria will continue to advance further in the interest of 
both countries, so as to provide a model of stability in the 
Balkans. At the same time, I think that Romania and Bulgaria 
should actively cooperate in formulating a coordinated foreign 
policy line for cooperation in the Balkans and the Black Sea 
zone. Our country will use every occasion to hold consultations 
with Bulgaria with a view to adopting decisions to the benefit 
of stability, trust, and prosperity in our region. 
  [Gotev] Where do Romania's preferences lie: toward the 
European alternative, or toward affiliation to the Balkan 
Orthodox region? 
  [Melescanu] The point of European and Euro-Atlantic 
integration is precisely to develop a united, stable, 
democratic, and prosperous Europe. As far as the Central and 
Eastern European countries are concerned, this is the only way 
to confirm and consolidate their national, political, economic, 
and security interests. It is evident that regional and sub 
regional cooperation has a very important part to play within 
the all-European architectural framework. Projects such as the 
Central European initiative, Black Sea economic cooperation, and 
Balkan cooperation when the tragic Bosnian conflict ends are a 
necessary complement to the our state's efforts toward European 
integration. The tracing of new lines of demarcation in Europe, 
whether based on ethnic, religious, economic, or security 
criteria, may become a risk factor for our continent's 
stability. Romania has constantly and firmly spoken out for 
averting such artificial barriers, which can only become 
substitutes for the ideological barriers with which we are so 
familiar. 
  [Gotev] What priorities does Romanian diplomacy have for 
1994? 
  [Melescanu] Our priorities may be defined as lying in three 
complementary directions. First, we want to continue the 
process of integration with the political, economic, and 
security structures of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic alliance. 
Ratifying and bringing into effect the association treaty with 
the EU, concluding a treaty with NATO within the Partnership for 
Peace Initiative, establishing long-term relations with the 
Western European Union, and switching over to a "permanent route 
forward" within the Council of Europe -- these are only some of 
the goals we have set ourselves for the near future. 
  Second, we want to impart fresh dynamism to our relations 
with neighboring states and other countries in the region. The 
conclusion of basic political treaties with states like Hungary, 
the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine can 
assist the ascending development of Romania's relations with 
these states, and at the same time create a favorable political 
climate. 
  Third, in our foreign policy efforts we want to expand and 
diversify our relations with states or groups of states in other 
geographical zones with which Romania maintains permanent and 
fruitful relations.

<F P=106> [Article by Iulian Nitu: "A Disquieting `Premiere'-- </F>
Foreign Troops Have Crossed Romania in Great Secrecy; Who Has 
Approved It and on What Grounds?"] 
  [Text] We have learned that a train with military 
equipment has crossed Romania recently. It is true that this 
act took place with the authorization of the United Nations. 
Even if the equipment, though we do not know what it contained, 
had this statute, the event acquires an extraordinary importance 
through its political and strategic significance. Nevertheless, 
there has been complete silence over this event. Apart from the 
thieves who discovered and robbed it, and the heads of the 
leadership, nobody knew about this train, although this issue is 
of utmost concern to the public. 
  Why this fact was concealed, but mainly who authorized the 
crossing of the respective train, is not known. Article 117(5) 
of Romania's Constitution stipulates that "foreign troops cannot 
enter Romania or cross its territory except under conditions 
stipulated by the law." What law establishes the entry or 
crossing of foreign troops we could not discover. Neither could 
we discover to whom the law grants this responsibility. 
  No matter who it is and who has such an authority, we 
believe 
that this event is too important to be kept concealed from the 
public. We do not say that we have anything against the 
authorization for the transit of troops or UN military 
transports, however, the fact itself is disquieting. The same 
bodies that today had the right to decide in secret about UN 
troops crossing Romania's territory certainly tomorrow will have 
the right to approve with the same secrecy, far from the eyes of 
the public, the "entry" or the crossing of other "equipment" or 
troops, or even their stay in Romania. No matter to whom the 
law gives this right, we believe that Romania's Parliament 
should have a certain responsibility or connection with such 
important actions. We believe this because, if the Parliament 
discusses and decides on such an issue, normally the public is 
also informed of it.

  [Text] The Press Bureau of the Romanian Army has faxed us 
a communique in which the Army comments on certain information 
that appeared in the press regarding allegations that trains 
with military signs carrying Russian tanks and troops have 
transited Romania. The Press Office of the Armed Forces 
mentions that the information issued by the A.M. Press, quoting 
National Railway Company information, does not correspond to 
reality. Romania was not asked and consequently did not agree 
to the transit of military trains belonging to the Russian 
Federation across its territory, the Press Bureau of the Army

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Milosevic: "A Bitter Lesson"] </F>
  [Text] We should hope that the bells of Croatian diplomacy 
are ringing in alarm. The United Nations, the West, and NATO, 
which Croatia so wholeheartedly relied upon as allies to help it 
solve its greatest problem -- the reintegration of the occupied 
areas -- have shown their true face. Morally corrupt, 
cold-hearted, cynical, and incapable of preventing the tragedy 
of Gorazde, these Croatian allies have crossed the Rubicon of 
dignity and morals. Instead of responding to the latest Serb 
tricks, lies, and crimes with strong military pressure, these 
rich, powerful, and influential societies are openly discussing 
lifting the sanctions imposed on Belgrade. 
  Those who believed that the West could not fall any lower 
after Vukovar, Sarajevo, or Bijeljina have seen that there is no 
end to the abyss. Croatia should find it indicative that 
lifting the sanctions is discussed by UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali as well as the Belgrade supporters in Moscow, and 
that even the U.S. Administration has been making completely 
confusing announcements regarding the issue. 
  The fact that the Americans are prepared to consider lifting 
the sanctions if the Serbs withdraw from Gorazde and at least 
reduce the attacks in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina clearly 
shows that the West and the international community consider 
Croatia the least of their concerns. Not taking even the UN 
resolutions into consideration, Butrus-Ghali has shown that the 
peaceful reintegration of the occupied Croatian territories is 
not on the list of his political priorities. This is why 
Croatia can do nothing else but respond to this (un)expected 
development of events by taking the diplomatic steps that will 
prevent the jaded world power-wielders from leaving it alone 
with the problem, the solution for which they impose, but do 
nothing to implement. 
  The lesson is bitter, but it is a good one, and we should 
hope that it has arrived on time.

  [Text] Republic of Croatia President Franjo Tudjman has 
sent a letter to Prime Minister Nikica Valentic; Luka Bebic, 
president of the Committee for Internal Policy and National 
Security; Supreme Court President Milan Vukovic; and State 
Prosecutor Krunoslav Olujic. The letter is based on Article 94, 
Paragraph 2, of the Croatian Constitution, which defines the 
president's obligation to secure adherence to the Constitution 
and the regular functioning of the state authorities. 
  The letter demands that they investigate and establish the 
real state of facts, within their powers, regarding the claims 
by Stipe Mesic published in FERAL TRIBUNE on 25 March, in which 
he says: A number of murders have been committed, whose 
perpetrators have still not been arrested, although their 
identity is known. It is known who killed Reihl-Kir [head of 
Osijek police, killed in summer 1991], Saban Krivokuca, and the 
Zec family. 
  The letter demands that the government and the relevant 
parliamentary committees, within their defined powers, examine 
the situation regarding protection of human rights and the 
implementation of the principles of a law-governed state, in 
particular all incidents which violate the legal order and all 
forms of crime. 
  I am proceeding from the belief that the Croatian state 
authorities, despite the war, paid particular attention to the 
protection of human rights and implementation of all basic 
principles of a law-governed state, to the importance of the 
rule of law and the need for all state authority bodies strictly 
to adhere to law and the constitution and to effectively take 
measures to curb all forms of crime. I have emphasized this on 
many occasions, for instance in my address to the parliament on 
23 March 1993, the letter says.

<F P=106> [Letter by Josip Manolic, chairman of the Croatian </F>
Assembly's Chamber of Counties: "Answer to President Tudjman"] 
  [Excerpts] Mr. President, I am very grateful to you that 
you had your speech, delivered in front of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Community] Group in the Croatian parliament on 7 
April 1994, published in VJESNIK on 10 April 1994, because by 
doing so you have given me the opportunity to provide an answer 
in the same place and in the same scope to your interpretation 
of the political events and to your accusations against me. I 
knew that you were coming to the Croatian parliament that day 
since the "president's flag" was raised above the Croatian flag. 
I asked myself what legal stipulation was the basis for raising 
it. I learned later that it was a party meeting, which reminded 
me of the famous statement: "L'etat c'est moi!" I would also 
like to thank you for releasing me of the obligation to be 
silent about delicate issues. [passage omitted] 
  There is no continuity in the policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Washington agreement is the most 
radical breach with the policy you made. This policy has never 
pursued the idea of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina as the 
elementary and only strategic interest of Croatia. You have 
signed the Washington agreement under the pressure of several 
factors: 1) In the present Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Croatian 
nationality has been driven to the verge of ruin; the Croats 
were ready to defend themselves by all means from the disastrous 
results of your suicidal policy, which they expressed by 
founding the Croatian National Council of Bosnia- Herzegovina, 
2) Opposition parties, including all right-wing to extreme 
left-wing parties, exerted pressure on you; the criticism within 
the HDZ became especially loud (I was the loudest), 3) A total 
military defeat, which has increasingly involved Croatian troops 
in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina resulted in international 
isolation and threats of sanctions, which consequently led to 
the collapse of the economy and caused social discontent in all 
layers of the society; apart from the that, the costs of the war 
were so high that all funds are now empty and taxes were raised 
to an unendurable level, 4) The will and influence of 
international powers. 
  Obsessed by the myth of enlarging Croatia, you have refused 
to accept the reality in Bosnia-Herzegovina, trying to divide it 
between Serbia and Croatia from the very beginning. You fell 
for Milosevic's trick in Karadjordjevo and insisted on it until 
harsh reality forced you to sign the Washington agreement. 
Innumerable of your statements prove that you have never even 
thought about a coexistence of Croats and Muslims, nor do you 
want this today, which can be seen from your insistence on 
Izetbegovic being guilty for the conflict between the Croats and 
Muslims. Do not forget that I was present at the meeting in 
which Izetbegovic proposed the appointment of Mate Boban as 
defense minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina. You refused it. You 
are praising the contribution to the Cutilliero plan. The 
attempt to implement this plan according to your policy --the 
ethnic cleansing of Muslims from Livno and Mostar to Travnik, 
Jablanica and Konjic -- caused strong fighting between Croats 
and Muslims. You should look again at the Smiljko Sagolj 
reports and Vice Vukojevic's uniform (and his boast that so many 
Muslims were killed in Prozor that they did not fit into two 
trucks etc). 
<H5>  Plunging Into Catastrophe </H5>
  It is true that "we had to have a political and governmental 
organization in Herceg-Bosna, the function of which is to 
protect the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the strategic 
interests of the Croatian state...," but the question is of who 
Croatian interests are threatened by. The only possible answer 
is that this is Serbian aggression, so that the question has to 
be asked into what and why this "political and governmental 
organization" developed and in whose interests that was. 
Instead of waging a war against the Serbian aggressor, a war 
was waged against the allies; instead of protecting the Croatian 
people, their displacement was caused. Instead of having 
villages and towns, we now have a country that is burnt down, 
approximately 10,000 dead people etc.. Whose policy was it and 
why did he make it? Was the warning voice of the Catholic 
Church not enough to prevent Croatian politics from plunging 
into the catastrophe in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is well-known 
with what arrogance your politics responded to it. 
  The fact that, by the signature on the Washington agreement, 
the collapse of the Croatian political strategy -- the war 
option -- was admitted does not free the creators of this policy 
from explaining to the Croatian people how the tragedy came 
about. 
  The thesis about the continuity of "the Croatian policy 
toward Bosnia-Herzegovina," with signing of the Washington 
agreement, allegedly led to "the overlapping of Croatian 
interests with the interests of the Western world.... We were 
not forced, ther was no turnabout, it is the continuation of our 
policy. The world has accepted us because of the consistence of 
our policy," is a transparent mask to cover up the actors of a 
policy that is tragic for the Croatian people, both in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Republic of Croatia, to avoid 
political responsibility and having to provide answers to the 
following questions asked by the Croatian people: 
  Why did it come to a war against the Muslims? What are the 
aims of that war? 
  Who made the political decision to start the war against the 
Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina? No legitimate body has made such 
a decision; it was not even made within the HDZ. Who has 
committed war crimes that have made the differences between the 
Croats and Chetnik criminals disappear? 
  Who gave the order for the ethnic cleansing of Muslims and 
who founded concentration camps? The answer that others also 
had them is a bad pretext. The Croats do not deserve to be 
blemished and stigmatized as aggressors. 
  Who is responsible for the exodus of Croats from Bosnia- 
Herzegovina? 
  Who financed the war against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
Who has the records about it and who will be "presented with 
the bill for it"? 
  Who is responsible for thousands of dead and wounded, for 
destroyed villages and towns, for the destruction of the 
cultural heritage in Mostar and other places etc...? 
  Who organized smuggling gangs in Herzeg-Bosna and who are 
they supported by in Croatian institutions (tobacco, oil, drugs, 
weapons, and so forth)? 
<H5>  The End of the War Option </H5>
  Since you, Mr. President, covered up the responsibility for 
all these things with your thesis about the "continuity" of the 
Croatian policy, you have practically taken over the obligation 
to give answers to the above-mentioned questions. You have to 
give answers to these questions primarily to the Croatian 
parliament as the highest sovereign body in Croatia. 
  Let us go back to the question of the present policy toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is, as you claim, "in continuity." Is 
it expected perhaps that the people who created and carried out 
the tragic strategic concept -- the war option -- that collapsed 
and was buried by the Washington agreements, will carry out 
these agreements sincerely and honestly and be able to cooperate 
with Croatian political bodies in Bosnia-Herzegovina? How could 
Muslims trust them and vice versa? During the first 10 days 
after the Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
was adopted, may of the actions of these people were directed 
toward a blockade of the Washington agreements. The state of 
Herzeg-Bosna and its "presidential council" did not cease to 
exist, for example. The practical enforcement of the agreement 
(detention camps, communications, the legitimacy of Croatian 
representatives in the parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
treatment of "non-HDZ" political representatives etc.) is also 
being inhibited. Will the people of this political profile 
carry out the Washington agreements? The United States 
certainly does not expect these people to protect them from 
Islamic fundamentalism and an Islamic state in Europe! What 
will happen with Albania, Kosovo, and Turkey in such a case. 
(Not to mention Romania, Bulgaria, and Greece, which "cannot 
await" to enter the sphere of Moscow Orthodox interests!) The 
Washington agreements could have been implemented without any 
victims and destruction two years ago. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  Democracy and Risk </H5>
  Antifascism is the basis of our present state, as you keep 
on 
pointing out, at least for international consumption. This is a 
historical issue and we thought that the unity of the Croatian 
people in the war against the Serbian aggression made this issue 
uninteresting. Unfortunately, you were the main actor in 
"Vice's" movie [not further specified] where you tried to 
disqualify Mr. Cesar, the leader of the Croatian Christian 
Democratic Party, because he was an obstacle to the membership 
of the HDZ in the European Christian Democratic Union. This is, 
at the same time, the answer to you regarding who is 
blackmailing whom and for what reason. We should enable the 
younger Croatian generations to live a life without burdens from 
the past; let us not allow history to make a new division among 
Croats. 
  It is better not to mention the paternalistic overtone you 
use when speaking about me -- "he should go to the 
Constitutional Court and... be calmed there." Tudjman has 
forgotten that an elected member of the parliament, the chairman 
of the Chamber of Counties and a member of the HDZ Presidency 
and its Main Committee cannot be "calmed" by a decree and the 
wish of an individual, because he is politically and morally 
responsible to the people and the party membership. I am not 
one of those advisers, civil servants, or business adventurers 
who enjoy greater or smaller privileges (such as apartments, 
company stocks, business premises, membership in administrative 
bodies etc.). They can be "calmed" by such privileges, or if 
they are consistent, they fall into anonymity. There cannot be 
any "calming" in political issues of the highest priority for 
the Croatian future. There is no such individual, whatever his 
position might be, even if he is the president of the Republic 
and the ruling party leader, who could decide on his own about 
such important matters. 
  In his political career, Josip Manolic has not violated a 
single postulate of democracy, including the democratic 
Constitution and laws. He has behaved and acted consistently 
with all democratic postulates. When his attempt to start a 
democratic discussion in the HDZ about elementary questions 
regarding the future of the Croatian state and its people was 
undermined, he -- quite legitimately -- addressed the Croatian 
people and informed them of controversial matters within the 
HDZ, which are of vital importance to all Croatian citizens. An 
honest and responsible politician has to speak in front of the 
people. I do not think that you have expected me -- since you 
know me well -- to be silent about the dangers of the policy you 
have been pursuing just to save my position as chairman of the 
Chamber of Counties and a member of parliament. I am not made 
for such "honest outcomes." Democracy is a risk for 
politicians. Their opinions and attitudes may be contested and 
criticized. If the president looks for conspiracy or motifs for 
his "overturn" behind an expression of a normal democratic 
attitude (mine), this is from fear of responsibility for the 
things done. 
  Mr. President, you have been counterfeiting history. I 
quote: "....during 1992 when we were formally recognized, but 
did not have real friends." 
  Croatian politics had the most and the best -- the "real" -- 
friends during its struggle for independence and international 
recognition. You should just think of statements issued during 
the struggle for Croatia's international recognition. Think of 
the support of Mr. Kohl, the German chancellor, Mr. Genscher, 
his deputy, the support of the Vatican and the pope, Mr. 
Cossiga, the Italian president, his visit to Croatia. You 
should not forget very the intense communication and help 
offered by friendly Austria. All of them told you, asked you, 
and advised you not to go into a conflict with Muslims. You 
have lost real friends because of your agreement on a division 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Milosevic, you fell for Milosevic's 
trick. 
  I quote again: "Representatives of one international power 
told me during a visit: `Mr. President, you probably know that 
you have to make a new defense and safety system. We are ready 
to help you, but without Josip Manolic, please.'" 
  Mr. President, I would like to point to two things in 
connection with this citation. The first is a blunder that a 
head of state must not make unless he wants to humiliate himself 
and the state he represents. Can you imagine a head of state 
who is visited by a foreign intelligence service spy and asked 
to dismiss the head of the intelligence service of his sovereign 
country. By this act of yours, you have made "a banana 
republic" of Croatia and a figurehead of yourself, which is a 
subversion of national interests. 
  The second thing I want to remind your of is my reaction to 
the respective information you gave me. This was a game with 
foreign intelligence interests -- their services were looking 
for "their space," in other words for persons surrounding you. 
The whole thing was not about me, but about you. On that 
occasion I told you that I had accepted a decision about a 
political function, but that I could not accept the 
Constitutional Court because that function would exclude me from 
political life. Your explanation was: "The problem is Croatia, 
our increasing isolation from the international scene, 
especially in the field of economy, but also in other fields," 
and so forth. It was my pleasure to ask you ironically on the 
first anniversary of our conversation about my dismissal whether 
the Croatian position and your personal position had improved. 
No comment. Sanctions had already been prepared at that time, 
they had only not been made public. I wanted to remind you that 
it was not I who was a problem, but you. Your politics became 
an impediment to the recognition of Croatia in the world. 
<H5>  "In Croatia's Interest" </H5>
  All this was "in Croatia's interest." Your set phrase is: 
"The problem is Croatia." You have covered up all personnel 
changes in the government and in the ruling party by this 
phrase. Even the latest act, by which the autonomy of 
parliament was violated -- the president of the parliament was 
sent on vacation during a session of the parliament, and you 
manipulated the election of the State Courts Council through the 
VONS (Defense and National Safety Council); your adviser Pasalic 
said in a VONS session: "We need courts that will carry out 
official politics." Should the autonomy of the Supreme Court, 
of the Chamber of Attorneys-at-Law, of the parliament and 
government be abolished because of such courts?! Where is this 
leading? To dictatorship and tyranny. 
  It is necessary to quote one more of your allegations: 
"...because the proposal for his dismissal obviously came 
because of his contacts with services from the previous regime 
and his communist views. It is well-known that he has most 
contacts with people from `old services.'" 
  All my functions in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and in 
the parliament were public. I can say with full responsibility 
that I have always acted according to the Constitution and laws. 
I always helped people who needed help. I am not registered as 
a spy with any of the foreign intelligence services. This 
enabled me to be sovereign in my job. As far as my contacts 
with people from "the old service" are concerned, it is correct 
that I have contacts with them, but we have achieved the 
following things with this old service: 
  1. We took power after the multiparty election in 1990 
without any single victim owing to visible or invisible people. 
  2. During the Serbian aggression these people took some of 
the burden, made a selection among their own people, and 
supported us in all our actions -- the first military attacks 
were blocked by people from the old police, who were admittedly 
at that time already strengthened by young policemen. Many of 
them were real heroes in the war, as for example, Mr. Starcevic, 
head of the service for the Protection of the Constitutional 
Order, and Zeljko Tomljenovic, deputy minister of internal 
affairs. The prize they got, like several hundred others, was 
retirement. This was revenge against people who did everything 
for us, but were punished only because they came from the old 
system. Revenge was not a part of the HDZ program in the 
election campaign. Whose policy is this? The pretext for it is 
the same phrase: "It is in Croatia's interest." 
  Mr. President, I do not want to discuss "communist views" 
and 
our past with you. We went through this rough school of 
communism together. I fought against these attitudes for 
decades and finally disassociated myself in 1970. I was 
excluded from the League of Communists in 1971 together with 
other Croatian dissidents. 
  My work in the HDZ has been characterized by democratic 
relations. Your treatment of people, however, was full of 
despotism and intolerance toward other opinions. These 
characteristics of yours make you close to communistic behavior. 
This is reflected in the party in general, which you have 
brought to collapse. 
<H5>  According to the Statutes </H5>
  Mr. President, I agree with your assessment that we do not 
agree on anything any longer, especially not in politics. 
  As far as my dismissal from the function of the president of 
the Chamber of Counties is concerned, I have performed it 
strictly according to the Statutes and the democratic procedure 
(and it is known that the procedure is the essence of 
democracy), which has to be respected in first of all in 
parliament. This lecture on democracy is necessary if we want 
to cherish the democratic culture in future. 
  I did not work on the above mentioned statutes, they are a 
work of your law adviser, who compiled it according to your 
instructions -- so the Statutes serve the ruling party. It has 
now come into the hands of opposition, and that is where the 
problem developed. According to the statutes, only the president 
of the Chamber of Counties can convene a session, and this at a 
moment he politically assesses as opportune. 
  In closing, I would like to mention that Croatia is not 
destabilized by politicians who ask questions about vital 
matters regarding the foreign and domestic safety of Croatia; it 
is destabilized by your policy, which has led us to the brink of 
disaster. 
  After all, why are you, Mr. President, upset by these 
issues, 
why are you using words such as "destabilization," "dead and 
wounded," "honorable outcome," "East and West," "Muslim 
element," "rift," "constitutional crisis," "overturn of the 
president" if -- as you say -- "he will take less than 1 percent 
of HDZ members with him"? Why so many words about this 1 
percent, why put the whole party and media machinery into 
motion, why so much fuss about it?

<F P=106> [Article by Boris Komadina: "Who Is Eavesdropping on Whom?"] </F>
  [Text] After the scandal that happened at a reception 
at the Germany Embassy in Zagreb, in which Seks and Budisa 
participated, our public's attention has been drawn again to the 
work of the Croatian secret police. 
  When Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Seks set out for the 
evening reception that was arranged by Horst Weisel on 24 March 
in the German Embassy, he probably expected a relaxed 
atmosphere, choice wines, a well-spread table, and comfortable 
small talk with the diplomatic and other political elite. He 
certainly did not expect an awkward scandal. That is precisely 
what happened, however. The next day, on 25 March, Drazen 
Budisa, president of the Croatian Social Liberal Party [HSLS] 
and a deputy in the Chamber of Deputies, wrote an open letter to 
Prime Minister Valentic, which was carried by all the daily 
newspapers in the country. The letter states that after dinner, 
during a conversation in which Slovene Ambassador Matija 
Malesic, Deputy Finance Minister Bozo Prka, Milan Djukic, SNS 
[Serbian National Party] president, and Presidential Adviser 
Nenad Porges participated, Seks stated that he knew what Budisa 
had said at a recent HSLS meeting in Virovitica. In response to 
Budisa's inquiry about how he knew that, Seks answered that he 
had recordings that the police had delivered to him. 
  "I ask you, esteemed Mr. Valentic, to give me and our public 
an answer as to whether the police are recording HSLS meetings 
with your instructions and approval, and if not, I request that 
you urgently inquire who is doing it and on whose instructions," 
Budisa's letter said. It also expressed the hope that the 
government's policy did not include police monitoring of 
opposition parties. 
  Four days later, on 29 March, Vladimir Seks answered 
Budisa's 
open letter with an article entitled "Drazen Budisa's False 
Misinterpretations." Categorically denying Budisa's statements, 
at the same time Seks also explained Budisa's motives: "It is 
quite unlikely that I would make such a statement to Mr. Budisa, 
and his request that the conversation be translated for the 
German ambassador obviously indicates Budisa's intention of once 
again indicting, accusing, and denouncing the Croatian state, 
while portraying himself as a politician who, as a democrat, 
ought to be president of the republic in accordance with alleged 
foreign `tastes.'" 
<H5>  Valentic's Quick Response </H5>
  Who said what to whom and how it was interpreted is not that 
important, because only Seks and Budisa know the real truth 
about the course of the conversation. Far more serious is the 
mention of the alleged secret recording being done by the 
police. It is therefore not surprising that there was a quick 
response from Prime Minister Valentic, who said in connection 
with Budisa's accusations, "The Service for Protection of the 
Constitutional Order of the Republic of Croatia is not 
operationally interested in meetings of political parties, or in 
communications among them. Consequently, any sort of recording 
of the meetings of the HSLS or any other party is out of the 
question. I therefore reject any possibility of that the police 
acted in Virovitica in the way stated by Mr. Drazen Budisa. At 
the same time, I strongly protest the reference to the police in 
this context, whoever made it, because those allegations are 
unfounded and untrue." 
  Zdravko Zidovec, the interior minister's chief of staff, 
said 
about this: "The claim that the police recorded an HSLS meeting 
in Virovitica is ridiculous. I categorically reject that 
possibility." 
  Regardless of the content of the conversation between Seks 
and Budisa at the German Embassy, attention really has been 
drawn to the work of the secret services. "The state sees all, 
the state hears all," is the well-known slogan of the 
totalitarian regimes with which the communist authorities 
frightened us for 45 years. It is therefore not surprising that 
the Croatian public is sensitive to references to secret 
recording, monitoring, or the wiretapping of telephones. The 
fact is that the Croatian state inherited many of the former 
regime's institutions, and thus also a large police apparatus. A 
thorough restructuring of the intelligence services was 
therefore one of the first steps that Croatia took. The Service 
for Protection of the Constitutional Order [SZUP], which is the 
best-known "secret police," was created, and intelligence 
services are also possessed by the Defense Ministry (the SIS 
[Security-Information Service]) and the Foreign Ministry 
(Section 8), along with the youngest Croatian Information 
Service [HIS]. The legal framework regulating their powers and 
operation, as well as control over those services, was supposed 
to be modeled after that of other democratic countries. Their 
work is based on the constitution and special laws, for example, 
the Law on Internal Affairs (the SZUP). 
<H5>  Internal Regulations </H5>
  It is thus said of the SZUP that it is "one of the police 
services within the Republic of Croatia's Interior Ministry," 
and that "in accordance with the constitution and the law, it 
handles matters related to protecting the order established by 
the constitution, within the framework of which it collects 
information and intelligence, and undertakes other necessary 
measures to detect and prevent activities aimed at undermining 
or destroying the order established by the constitution and 
threatening the country's security." It therefore focuses its 
activity on those criminal acts that are, in principle, prepared 
in secret and in an organized manner, such as terrorism, 
espionage, and so forth. 
  Some occurrences in the past two years, however, drew the 
public's attention precisely to the work of those services. This 
has to do primarily with wiretapping certain individuals. The 
first such accusation was uttered by the controversial Nikola 
Viskovic, a deputy in the last Assembly. The second case, which 
was exploited even more by the media, is, of course, the "case 
of Manolic's special telephone," through which he could obtain a 
direct connection with any continent, and which someone 
regularly blocked two days out of the week. Both cases once 
again revived the question of where the limit to the secret 
services' work actually was. In the end, wiretapping is not any 
kind of bogeyman if it is conducted strictly in accordance with 
the law, and if all possibilities for abuse are eliminated. 
  The powers of the SZUP, however, are not based exclusively 
on 
the constitution and the law. As we have unofficially learned, 
there are also internal regulations, which are classified at 
such a level that even SZUP employees cannot read them until 
they pass all the tests, take the oath, and receive official 
identification. It seems that through the unnecessary 
mystification of their work, those services are actually doing 
themselves a disservice. It is precisely for that reason that we 
will list some of the devices used by similar services in the 
world. 
<H5>  Eavesdropping Devices </H5>
  A laser system for eavesdropping on inaccessible premises 
consists of a transmitter that sends a focused beam to the glass 
of a window, while the receiver catches the modulated beam in 
the form of the vibrations resulting from speech and turns it 
into an audio signal, filters it, and amplifies it. There is 
also a probe for surveillance and eavesdropping: Through at 
least an 8-mm opening, a probe is inserted, at the end of which 
is a sensitive microphone and a lens with a 90-degree field of 
vision; an ordinary camera, video camera, or tape recorder can 
be installed on the other end of the probe. These two devices 
are among the most modern ones in the world, and are said to be 
highly sophisticated instruments. 
  A simple instrument for eavesdropping on telephone 
conversations consists of a tape recorder and a device for 
recording the operation of the telephone dial. That kind of tape 
recorder is activated whenever the telephone rings or when the 
phone is picked up. The numbers dialed from the telephone that 
is being tapped are also recorded on a separate tape. The 
biggest producers of this and other eavesdropping equipment are 
Japan, Great Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United 
States. Today the TRM series from 0040 to 0045 are among the 
best-known and most highly valued eavesdropping devices. The TRM 
0040 is a microcassette recorder with a size of 119 x 55 x 17 mm 
and a weight of 160 grams. Thanks to this, it can be camouflaged 
very well in a pack of cigarettes, for example. It can record a 
conversation at a distance of up to 10 meters. It also has a 
remote control attachment, a tape counter, and a memory button. 
It is equipped with an additional device for voice activation, 
so that only so-called active speech is recorded. These are only 
a few of the eavesdropping devices that can be bought in West 
European countries in any well-equipped store selling technical 
goods. 
  Information is power. The one who has it and who can get it 
before others has more power, and more authority. Playing with 
that power is dangerous, and that is why control mechanisms 
exist. Any indication of possible abuse of that power is useful 
and welcome. 
<H5>  [Box, p 26] </H5>
<H5>  Vladimir Seks, Croatian deputy prime minister: "Budisa Is </H5>
Making a Provocation" 
  [Seks] You can associate this story of Budisa's with the one 
that the Croats destroyed a mosque in Livno. Budisa knew very 
well that everything bad that was done in the areas that are 
under the control of the Croats in Bosnia would be attributed by 
world political factors to the Croatian government. I understand 
political rivalry, competition, and scoring political points, 
but this shows his great impatience and goes beyond all bounds 
of fair play. Budisa's use of such misinterpretations in front 
of another country's ambassador is irrational and unclear. One 
can conclude precisely from that that this is a deliberate 
political provocation through which Budisa tried to discredit 
the government, the Interior Ministry, and me personally in 
front of the German ambassador. It really is ridiculous that I 
would make such a statement. Budisa and I have been friends for 
many years, but obviously his desire for a political 
breakthrough knows no bounds. 
  [Komadina] At one time you were also the state attorney. Did 
you ever encounter cases in which the police secretly 
eavesdropped on or recorded any party's meetings? 
  [Seks] Never. 
<H5>  [Box, p 27] </H5>
<H5>  Drazen Budisa, HSLS President: "Seks's Inventions" </H5>
  [Budisa] It really is quite improbable, as Mr. Seks said in 
his statement, that he said what he did. Unfortunately, a lot of 
things in Croatia that are quite improbable are real and true, 
and so is Mr. Seks's statement. 
  In the conversation that we had the next day, after that 
dinner, Seks did not deny his words, but only stated that he was 
joking, and it seems that that is how the other participants in 
the conversation also perceived it. I do not have any 
appreciation for HDZ [Croatian Democratic Community] wit, 
however. Consequently, the truth is precisely what I wrote to 
Prime Minister Valentic. On the contrary, it is not true that 
there was any discussion that evening about my representing 
myself as the future president of the Croatian state. Those are 
really Mr. Seks's absurdities and inventions. Now I am only 
considering what the people who participated in the conversation 
that evening are thinking about Mr. Seks. 
  [Komadina] Had you already had similar information about 
your 
meetings being recorded? 
  [Budisa] No. We did not even refer to that. I do not know 
about any recording, and that is precisely why Seks's statement 
was shocking--especially because he told me about it, if it is 
being done.

<F P=106> [Article by Damir Herceg: "The Wolves From Rijeka's West </F>
Point"] 
  [Text] Rijeka -- When the honor fell to Rijeka to get the 
9th Guard Brigade, many people asked themselves: How would they 
fill the ranks of that professional unit? It is after all 
well-known that people in Primorje have never been overly fond 
of the military uniform and weapons, but when it is a question 
of defense of the homeland, soldiers are a pride and an example. 
This has best been shown during the last three years of war on 
battlefields all over Croatia, from Kostajnica to Vukovar, but 
especially in the Lika theater. Finally, the young men from the 
Rijeka region have been the most numerous among the volunteers 
in the HOS [Croatian Defense Force], according to certain 
figures. 
  People in Rijeka are proud of their 9th Guard Brigade, of 
their Wolves, and now there are more and more from Primorje who 
want to join the ranks of the Wolves, that is, who want to 
become professional soldiers. It should be mentioned that life 
in the Rijeka region is not so bad that people would have to 
look to the uniform for financial security. In Rijeka, after 
all, in spite of all the troubles in the economy, it is still 
easier to find a job on water or land than in a majority of 
cities in Croatia. It is not just the money, then, that men from 
Rijeka are seeking in the ranks of the professional soldiers. 
  The training for selection of enrollees for all the guards 
brigades of the Croatian Army [HV] is conducted in the garrison 
on Trsat, which many call the Rijeka West Point, partly because 
of its fine location and partly because of the way in which the 
training is conducted. 
  Captain Stevo Prazic, a superb theoretician and pedagogue 
and 
still more superb fighter, is commander of training of 
candidates for selection on Trsat at the moment, so that his 
training is useful even to those who are war veterans. Another 
veteran of the Homeland War without whom the training for 
candidate selection is unthinkable is Lt. Svjetlana Doricic, 
psychologist, who is training officers and other men. At the 
beginning of the war many officers felt that they and the men 
had no need for a psychologist, least of all a woman, but only 
cannon. Today Svjetlana Doricic is probably the most respected 
person in the garrison on Trsat, and not only because of her 
looks, since the story is that many apply for training just to 
have a chance to talk to her. To round out the dominance of 
women in the training of candidates for selection there is also 
Dr. Mirjana Dosen. The basic precondition for someone to be able 
to begin training at all is to pass the medical examination and 
psychological testing. 
  The selection and training of candidates follow the NATO 
formula, and after 30 days of training the two sides can see 
whether a contract is to be signed or not. If either the 
Croatian Army or the candidate is dissatisfied, the person who 
has gone through the training receives payment for that month 
and returns to civilian life, and, if he is employed, to his 
enterprise. 
  They say on Trsat that the important thing is not the 
specialized training and rating one intends to pursue, but 
rather the basic thing is to have your domovnica 
[certificate of origin] and to be between the ages of 18 and 35. 
Good communication has been established with employment security 
bureaus for the region of Rijeka and Istria, where conversations 
are organized with young men who are unemployed. They are 
informed about the advantages of serving in the HV, and after 
these conversations many find it much easier to decide to go to 
Trsat. 
  We visited one company of candidates during training. We 
found them on the exercise ground, and from what we saw, the 
uninformed might think that some Croatian modern version of the 
Normandy landing was being filmed. First Lt. Alen Valjan, a 
Rambo with the face of a child, is the commander of these lads; 
there are three groups of candidates in training: young 
soldiers, veterans of the Homeland War, and civilians, and it is 
up to him to get that "orchestra" in tune. The candidates have a 
reinforced diet, but after 30 days no one any longer has a belly 
hanging over his belt. It would seem that the older and 
"heavier" men are somewhat more concerned about getting in shape. 
  It is evident that the boys are happy with their equipment 
and the way the training is being conducted, since the uniforms, 
berets, weapons, and equipment they are wearing and carrying now 
are for the present those which they have had occasion to see 
only in U.S. war films. Some of them have even pasted the name 
of their girlfriend on their gun, so now we do not know whether 
they like the rifle better because of their girl or the other 
way about. 
  This year has been proclaimed the Year of the Wolf, since 
that species is threatened with extinction; to judge from what 
we saw on Trsat, the Rijeka 9th Guards Brigade will get most of 
the young Wolves.

<F P=106> [Article by Marko Franjic: "How Much Do the Herzegovinians </F>
Smoke?"] 
  [Text] The key question is not the individuals 
involved in smuggling; more important is the state budget's 
revenue from taxes on tobacco and the control over their 
payment, because if there are holes in the regulations and 
control over the payment of taxes, there will always be 
smugglers. 
  There are 450 metric tons of cigarettes smoked in the 
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, but three Croatian factories 
officially export a total of 2,500 tons of cigarettes there. 
Where the 2,000 tons of cigarettes went, and whether taxes were 
paid on them, because it is assumed that 60 million German marks 
[DM] in taxes have not been collected, was a deputy's question 
from Vice Vukojevic on the first day of last week's Assembly 
session. Prime Minister Nikola Valentic himself gave him an 
interesting answer. The answer was approximately that some of 
the cigarettes were exported to Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it was 
most likely that a large amount of that tobacco ended up on the 
Croatian market and thus evaded taxes. 
  After that, just a few days after the Assembly session, 
everything continued to proceed in the established order and 
rhythm, as if it had not upset anyone too much. Since the 
question involved fairly specific statements, it seemed that 
Vice Vukojevic had more facts, and so we asked him to expand on 
his question and explain what was going on, and whether he 
perhaps knew anything more about the whole case. 
  During the Assembly's recess, however, Vukojevic only 
responded briefly to our query by saying that we should ask the 
Finance Ministry who was given permits to export tobacco and 
tobacco products, since the key and the answer lay in that, 
while he himself, until he received that information, did not 
want to comment on anything else. So far no one has spoken up, 
although all three Croatian tobacco factories were clearly 
identified in the deputy's question: the Zagreb, Rovinj, and 
Zadar factories. They were called upon to answer where they had 
marketed the 2,000 tons of tobacco, and whether no more or less 
than about DM60 million in taxes had been paid for those 
cigarettes. Also named was the Finance Ministry, which has 
jurisdiction over issuing export permits. It is also concerned 
with supplying the state budget, and it ought to know how much 
cigarette tax has been collected. It is interesting that at the 
last session of the Assembly, one of the agenda items was the 
state budget, and the Ministry's strongest staff, with the prime 
minister's assistance, had a great deal of work to do in 
defending the proposed figures before the deputies. 
<H5>  Germany One Hundred, Croatia Three </H5>
  Furthermore, the IMF announced that Croatia would have to 
prepared a state budget for the next three years if it wanted to 
conclude arrangements with that institution. Naturally, in that 
situation the key question is where to get the money, not only 
as a fictitious amount on the paper of the state budget, but 
rather as real collected revenue, which means that the ministry 
absolutely has to take into account the collection of taxes. The 
tax administration, which operates as part of the Finance 
Ministry, has just prepared a proposal for excise duties, a new 
system for taxing products that are of interest for taxation in 
every country, which also include cigarettes, because most of 
the tax revenue is collected precisely by taxing tobacco, 
alcohol, and oil. Every year Germany collected DM100 billion 
from those three products, while Croatia, according to some 
assumptions, should earn at least DM3 billion. When we add to 
this the claims expressed several times--also unofficially 
admitted by the tax administration--that the state lost DM200 
million on imported and licensed cigarettes and the smuggling of 
those cigarettes last year because of the inappropriate tax 
system, it is clear that this is not a problem that just 
appeared yesterday, nor does it concern negligible revenues. 
  Furthermore, the state introduced stamps for cigarettes a 
long time ago, and precisely thereby declared war on smugglers, 
and by a special decree it tried to regulate exports of certain 
products, including cigarettes, precisely because of smuggling, 
which threatened the state budget's revenues. That decree 
prescribed that deposits would be paid on exported goods, and 
when it was proven that the exports had taken place, the Finance 
Ministry would return the deposited money to the exporter. 
Consequently, even before the introduction of the stamps (on 19 
November 1992), it was known that cigarettes were a commodity of 
interest for smuggling and that the state treasury was being 
left empty because of that "interest." 
  Recently in the Varazdin area, the police there seized large 
amounts of smuggled cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. As the 
policemen explained, the goods, although intended for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the documentation, came from 
Slovenia. Specifically, a large amount of cigarettes was first 
purchased at the Rovinj Tobacco Factory, and then, according to 
the documentation, it was supposed to be exported to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was taken to Slovenia, however, and after 
that it was smuggled to the Varazdin area, where it was offered 
at lower prices. So far there have been a lot of interested 
customers there, who probably knew where the cheaper cigarettes 
came from and how. 
<H5>  Tobacco Smuggling Lobby </H5>
  After that seizure of the smuggled goods, the Varazdin 
police 
administration says that one can now speak of organized groups 
and a well-developed network for the purchase and smuggling of 
cigarettes, but also other goods. The system is already known, 
and, one might say, the usual one until recently. First of all a 
factory in Bosnia-Herzegovina is found that will fictitiously 
buy the cigarettes, which afterwards, of course, end up on the 
Croatian market at lower prices, because the high taxes, which 
are 60 percent for domestic cigarettes, are not paid. Judging by 
the suspensions of policemen and customs officers, one can 
assume who else is in the smuggling network in addition to 
Croatian factories and the ones in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Specific 
names are not being mentioned yet, however, and it is not known 
whether the network is controlled by one center of power or 
whether there are several organized groups. One could hear 
stories in the corridors--and one of them was publicized 
precisely in DANAS--that one Zagreb private businessman tried to 
go into the business as an independent, but after having paid 
$420,000 for a truckload of Marlboros, he was left without the 
cigarettes or the money, since the deal was not "agreed upon" 
with the smuggling lobby that allegedly controls that profitable 
business. 
  After a year and a half the result of all this, aside from 
the individual successful and ostentatiously presented police 
operations to prevent smuggling known as "Stibra" [Tax] and the 
firm promises that the economy will be put in order, is 
Vukojevic's deputy's question, bringing up the same problems 
again, which may imply that they have not been solved. Deputy 
Prime Minister Vladimir Seks, who is responsible for monitoring 
the implementation of the "Stibra" operations, says that both 
the regular police and the financial police have already been 
monitoring and checking what is happening in the profitable 
cigarette business for some time now. The confiscations of 
smuggled cigarettes, and even the suspensions of policemen and 
customs officers, resulted from that. Vladimir Seks, however, 
did not want to prejudge anyone's guilt, and thought that it 
would not be proper to talk about the involvement of people from 
the tobacco factories in cigarette smuggling and even about the 
names obtained during the investigation, since the investigation 
has not yet been completed. 
<H5>  A Time of Big Scandals </H5>
  So far it is known for certain that the goods were not 
exported, that they did not end up where they were supposed to 
according to the customs declaration, and instead were sold on 
the black market, probably in Croatia. It is also suspected that 
customs declarations were falsified. Since this is all still the 
subject of investigation, however, not even Assistant Finance 
Minister Bozo Prka could comment much more on it, as he politely 
explained. Nevertheless, it appears that this time, what has 
been uncovered and what is being investigated will not be hushed 
up. Our impression is that the state authorities are now working 
seriously on this, but the question is whether it will be 
brought to a finish or whether the public will be offered some 
"little fish" as scapegoats. After all, the key question is not 
the individuals who are engaged in this; what is more important 
is the state budget revenues from tobacco taxes and control over 
their payment, because if there are holes in the regulations and 
control over the payment of taxes, there will always be people 
interested in smuggling. 
  According to the proposed model for tobacco taxes, or excise 
taxes, they will be 6,000 and 8,000 dinars, depending on the 
location of the sale, for foreign cigarettes, and 2,400 and 
3,000 dinars for domestic cigarettes, with customs duties also 
paid for imports of foreign cigarettes. The difference in taxes 
for foreign and domestic cigarettes was the big reason for the 
smuggling of those cigarettes, but Croatia's joining GATT 
[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], which is in 
preparation, will be based precisely on the requirements to make 
taxes on domestic and foreign goods equivalent, with tariffs 
being the instrument to protect domestic production. The 
question is whether the proposed model for taxing cigarettes 
will pass, while experience with smuggling seems to have taught 
the Croatian government nothing. 
  When the present events are summed up after an interval of 
time, this will certainly be remembered as a time of big 
scandals for which no one has been held accountable, because not 
one official has resigned or left because of mistakes and 
omissions. In some cases there has not even been an attempt to 
determine who could have been responsible for a certain mistake, 
but without that, things will not be put in order.

and minister of trade, by an unidentified STANDART NEWS 
correspondent; place and date not given: "It Is Abnormal for an 
Acting Prime Minister To Be in Charge of the Cabinet for Over 
Two Months"] 
  [Text] [STANDART NEWS] Mr. Karabashev, who is acting as 
prime minister at the moment? 
  [Karabashev] Mr. Matinchev continues to carry out this duty, 
because the prime minister's order of 8 March remains in effect. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Are there any differences between you and 
Mr. 
Matinchev on the issue of when the cabinet should resign? 
  [Karabashev] Matinchev and I have not even discussed this 
question. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Have you suggested that any ministers should 
go? 
  [Karabashev] No. In any case, this would be incorrect and 
the question is hardly likely to be discussed in the prime 
minister's absence. 
  [STANDART NEWS] In fact, people say that you called for the 
special cabinet meeting last Sunday, when Professor Berov was 
present. 
  [Karabashev] At that meeting we discussed the position to be 
adopted by the delegation at the negotiations with the Paris 
Club. 
  [STANDART NEWS] What is your personal view on the issue of 
the cabinet's resignation? 
  [Karabashev] First, from what I know, I cannot say as yet 
how 
long the prime minister will remain absent. I have said 
previously that it is abnormal for the Council of Ministers to 
be without a prime minister for a very long period. However, the 
question of who will act as prime minister -- Matinchev or 
myself -- is not the main issue. 
  [STANDART NEWS] What do you mean by a "very long period"? 
  [Karabashev] I mentioned earlier that a normal period is 
about a month or a month and a half... 
  [STANDART NEWS] ...What about now? 
  [Karabashev] At this moment I have no detailed information 
on 
what is actually happening regarding the prime minister's 
illness. 
  [STANDART NEWS] How long can you go on without a prime 
minister? 
  [Karabashev] Oh, I will tell you that later, when I can no 
longer hold out. 
  [STANDART NEWS] In my view, this depends on whether the 
Council of Ministers does anything or not. It will never be 
idle. In the final analysis, it also depends on how parliament 
reacts. At the moment there is no indication that the majority 
of deputies will withdraw their support from the government for 
this reason. When such an indication appears, the cabinet will 
have to think again. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Does this mean that you will all go when 
parliament tells you? 
  [Karabashev] By and large, yes. The deputies elected us and 
they can topple the cabinet. 
  [STANDART NEWS] Does not Zhan Videnov's statement that the 
cabinet changes will include the deputy prime minister 
constitute such an indication? 
  [Karabashev] This does not concern me particularly. It is a 
signal sent by a deputy, but it is one thing to make some 
signal, in the manner specified under the Constitution for the 
entire government, but it is quite another thing to make some 
sign regarding individual deputy prime ministers. In the second 
case, these signals are not very proper, because the prime 
minister is the only person who can propose personnel changes. 
The former ploy is an attempt to apply some kind of pressure. 
  [STANDART NEWS] What if the ASP [Alternative Social Liberal 
Party] recalls you? 
  [Karabashev] I am not the ASP's representative in the 
cabinet, because the government was formed according to a 
different formula. In fact the ASP has no connection with this 
cabinet and at present is supporting it in some way. At the 
moment no decision has been made to ask the ASP members to leave 
the cabinet. If this call is made, Mr. Bikov and I can reach 
our own decisions on whether to respond or not. I may possibly 
submit my resignation even without such a call -- but this is a 
purely theoretical consideration. 
  I do not regard it as normal for the prime minister not to 
lead his team for a period longer than two months.

<F P=106> [Staff report: "Jovanovic Came Uninvited To Spread </F>
Propaganda"] 
  [Text] Guarded more than Michael Jackson by Bulgarian and 
Serbian services, FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic 
dropped in uninvited in Sofia on Saturday evening [16 April]. 
He came without any previous announcement and without an 
agenda; however, all measures were taken to avoid unscheduled 
media contact. At 1930 on Saturday, the Serbian Embassy informed 
the editorial boards of newspapers that there would be a news 
conference, knowing perfectly well that there would be no one 
there at that time. On 17 April, a carefully filtered and 
abbreviated piece of information about the talks with the 
Bulgarian foreign minister was faxed. 
  As could be expected, after the fraternal embraces with the 
socialist government in Athens, Jovanovic demanded that the 
Bulgarian Government insist on a lifting of the sanctions 
against the FRY -- in other words, demanding that the Bulgarian 
Government oppose the United Nations. This is something that 
the great friends of the Belgrade regime, the former Bulgarian 
Communists, tried to do last week. 
  It was to the credit of Minister Daskalov that he clearly 
said to the uninvited guest that regardless of the material 
difficulties related to observing the embargo, Bulgaria will 
adhere to the UN resolutions, guided by the premise that they 
are a peaceful, political means. The issue of lifting the 
sanctions directly depends on finding a lasting and peaceful 
solution to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  When the Bulgarian side posed the issue of violating the 
rights of the Bulgarian minority, the Belgrade minister said, as 
usual, that there are no such violations. Jovanovic did not have 
any information about Lyuben Stoichkov, a Bulgarian from 
Bosilegrad who was sentenced by the Serbian authorities for 
talking to Bulgarian diplomats. 
  Asked why Belgrade is preventing foreign correspondents, 
including Eli Yurukova, Radio Free Europe, and DEMOKRATSIYA, 
from doing their job, Jovanovic said that the correspondents 
present the regime's policy as "satanical." As a true 
Communist, he described the reporting of the truth about the 
military activities in Bosnia as an "abuse of journalistic 
ethics." 
  Everything else the Belgrade diplomat said in Sofia followed 
propoganda rules. He even utilized the decision of the 
Bulgarian Parliament to allow the passage of the UN equipment 
convoy through our country in order to voice the slogan that the 
Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] was not threatened from the north, and that the 
presence of UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Forces] 
observers there was a result of "false claims and 
manipulations." A long time must pass before good-neighborly 
relations are established between Belgrade and Skopje, Jovanovic 
said. 
  After he decided that his propaganda mission was 
accomplished, the minister departed yesterday. This time he was 
guarded like Madonna.

<F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Dzhordzheva: "FRY Envoy Describes </F>
Embargo as Genocide"] 
  [Text] According to FRY Ambassador Dr. Rados Smilkovic, the 
Bulgarians in Yugoslavia do not want to be isolated in a ghetto. 
He said this during a visit to Burgas, in answer to a question 
from a KONTINENT journalist about violations of the human rights 
of the Bulgarian minority in the FRY. Dr. Smilkovic declared 
that the Bulgarian minority even enjoys certain privileges as a 
Slavonic minority. He added that the Bulgarians there were 
enduring the same difficulties as the Serbs and that the facts 
reported in the press were false. He was surprised that even 
when describing the Los Angeles earthquake, Bulgarian 
journalists find it necessary to throw in a few profanities 
about the Serbs. According to Smilkovic, now, when Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] has been 
removed as a motive for conflict, the press is looking for a new 
apple of discord. This was unjustified, because the FRY 
leadership hopes that the border that separates us will become 
one that links us together. 
  Dr. Smilkovic said that only the FRY and its neighbors were 
suffering from the embargo, and he described the blockade as 
genocide. Despite everything, the ambassador does not blame 
Bulgaria for observing the embargo, and he pointed out that 
incidents such as the "Khan Kubrat" case should not be used as a 
pretext for worsening relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National </F>
Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], by 
Neli Koleva in Sofia on 15 April: "Only International 
Organizations Can Stop the Yugoslav Conflict From Spreading"] 
  [Text] [Koleva] In the course of today's debates on the 
permission that parliament was asked to grant for the transit of 
UN property through our territory, you mentioned the danger of 
military expansion that Bulgaria faces, against which only 
membership in the United Nations and NATO could provide any 
guarantee. Does such a danger really exist, and from where will 
it come, in your view? 
  [Dimitrov] Everyone is well aware that since the conflict 
began in Yugoslavia, risks exist for Kosovo, for Macedonia, and 
hence for Bulgaria as well. This is why my lips are tired of 
repeating that intervention by international organizations and 
effective groups that can really achieve something, namely NATO, 
is necessary. I have been repeating this since 1991 and have 
been saying it almost daily since the conflict broke out in 
Bosnia. In the final event, thank God, it turned out that the 
policy followed by the SDS government was a sensible one. We 
recognized the [former Yugoslav] republics, following which 
others recognized them as well, thus demonstrating that this is 
the way to prevent the conflict. We have been attacked for 
recognizing Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM], but, in the end, everyone recognized this republic 
because they realized that this is the only sensible way to 
guarantee tranquillity. Our government wanted blue helmets and 
observers to be sent to the FYROM, and the FYROM got them 
because this is the way to guarantee that there will be no 
expansion of the conflict. 
  Naturally, these actions are being carried out because 
everyone realizes that it cannot be excluded that an 
unpredictable communist regime like Milosevic's may do anything. 
If it does something that leads to an expansion of the 
conflict, there is a very big risk of that our Bulgarian home 
will be set on fire. Bearing in mind these dangers, which are 
not immediate at the moment, we should do everything within our 
powers to ward off this possibility. I am glad that the NATO 
forces are in [the former] Yugoslavia. They are a guarantee 
that any such expansion will be checked. 
  [Koleva] Can we regard the stance adopted by the SDS 
parliamentary group today as a kind of vote in favor of the 
policy that your government followed? 
  [Dimitrov] Today's vote does indeed show that the SDS fully 
supports the positions that the SDS government defended with 
much effort and at no little risk. 
  [Koleva] How do you explain the position of the Socialists 
in the parliamentary debate when they voted en bloc against the 
UN request? 
  [Dimitrov] I think they are acting as agents of an 
imperialist expansionist policy advocated by certain circles in 
Russia that hope that the heightening of tension in the Balkans 
and the intensification of Serbian expansion might bring in 
Russia to act as an arbiter in this region.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is the Benefit of Loyally Observing the </F>
Embargo?"] 
  [Text] It would be a good idea for the Bulgarian 
politicians to explain to the people why they are so religiously 
observing the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] embargo and 
without giving it too much thought refuse to join even the four 
European states that will ask the United Nations to lift the 
sanctions. 
  We are playing a bad trick with our indecisiveness. 
  First, our neighbors the Serbs will always remember that we 
were against them to the very end. Greece, Romania, Hungary, 
and Ukraine will insist on lifting the embargo and will not be 
thrilled by the fact that we did not support them. 
  Second, would the United Nations believe our cries regarding 
the billions of dollars we are losing from the embargo? It is 
logical for a state whose economy is being destroyed by the 
sanctions to fight by all means for lifting them. 
  It appears that we can simultaneously be on bad terms with 
our neighbors and not be compensated for our losses. 
  So, what is the benefit of our twisted internationalism?

  [Editorial Report] After several weeks, the issue of who 
will fill the vacant parliamentary seat of The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) in Kisela Voda district south of 
Skopje has been resolved, according to the 5 April issue of the 
Skopje daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA. Zore Temelkovski, the candidate of 
three of the four parties in the governing coalition--the Social 
Democratic Alliance of Macedonia (SDSM), the Liberal Party (LP), 
and the Socialist Party (SP) -- won 2,431 votes in the 3 April 
runoff election. The other two candidates were Zoran Sindiliev 
of the Democratic Party (DP), who received 1,641 votes, and 
Branislav Sinadinovski of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity 
(VMRO-DPMNE), who received 1,467 votes. Turnout for the election 
was light: Of 13,172 registered voters, only 5,822 (44.2 
percent) cast ballots. According to NOVA MAKEDONIJA, both the DP 
and the VMRO-DPMNE have charged that the election was unfair, 
citing among other irregularities a "sudden change" in electoral 
boundaries. The number of registered voters in the district was 
said to have changed from 13,035 in the first round to 13,172 in 
the runoff. 
  After a campaign punctuated with "desecrations" of party 
posters and fist-fights among the youthful fans of the rival 
parties (NOVA MAKEDONIJA, 16 March) the first round was held on 
20 March. NOVA MAKEDONIJA of 22 March reported that the winner 
was Temelkovski, with 1,802 votes (about 30 percent). The 
runner-up, Sindiliev, received 1,473 (about 25 percent), and the 
third-place candidate, Sinadinovski, garnered 1,154 (about 19 
percent). Another 20 percent was split among eight candidates, 
with the nationalistic parties winning 483 votes. 
  According to the same NOVA MAKEDONIJA report, the DP and the 
VMRO-DPMNE charged that the election results were unfair because 
people had been allowed to vote without showing their personal 
identification papers as the election law stipulated. Although 
the Supreme Court rejected their appeals, the electoral 
commission decided that voters would be obliged to produce their 
identity cards in the second round of voting on 3 April (VECER 
31 March). 
  The governing coalition's victory brings its total seats in 
the 120-member parliament to 74, including those held by the 
Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), an ethnic Albanian party. 
The distribution of seats is as follows: 
  VMRO-DPMNE -- 32, 
  VMRO-Democratic Party -- 1, 
  SDSM -- 28, 
  SDSM-LP-SP -- 1, 
  PDP -- 22, 
  PDP-People's Democratic Party -- 1, 
  LP -- 18, 
  LP-SP -- 1, 
  SP -- 4, 
  Party of Yugoslavs -- 2, 
  Party for the Full Emancipation of Romanies -- 1, 
  DP -- 4. 
  There are five independents. The foregoing numbers are drawn 
from a NOVA MAKEDONIJA series on political parties published 
between 22 January and 8 February, as well as press articles 
from 1993 and earlier. 
  According to the FYROM Constitution, the quorum for Assembly 
proceedings is a majority of the total membership (61); 
decisions are made by a simple majority of those present, which 
must, however, amount to at least one-third of the total 
membership (40); certain laws, such as those involving changes 
to the country's borders, declaring war, and amending the 
Constitution, require a two-thirds majority (80).

  [Editorial Report] The low turnout in a recent 
parliamentary by-election in The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia (FYROM) prompted a team of journalists from the Skopje 
daily VECER to conduct a survey on the public's attitude toward 
voting in the general elections scheduled for November. The 
results of the poll were published in the 31 March issue of 
VECER on pages 4 and 5. The journalists interviewed 200 people, 
half of them Skopje residents and the remainder residents of 10 
other towns in Macedonia, asking two questions: 
  -- Will you vote in the November elections (with the 
predetermined responses: yes, no, and do not know); 
  -- Why (with a few answers mentioned but no overall results 
given). The interviews were conducted partly by telephone and 
partly face-to-face. VECER claims that it followed "appropriate 
methods" to assure that the respondents were chosen 
"accidentally" and remained anonymous. The responses to the 
first question are broken down by ethnic group: Macedonian, 
Albanian, and other (Turks, Serbs, Romanies, and so forth), and 
by gender. VECER provided no further information on methodology, 
nor was the margin of error supplied. 
<H5>  Anticipating Turnout </H5>
  According to VECER, voter turnout in Macedonia's first 
multiparty elections in 1990 was about 84 percent. Noting that 
voter turnout can change dramatically and that it is thus too 
early to predict voter turnout in November, VECER recalls that 
in the first round of the by-election, which was held on 20 
March, 46 percent of those eligible voted, but that in a 
subsequent survey 54 percent indicated they would vote in a 3 
April runoff round. VECER promised to sample the mood of the 
electorate periodically. 
  With respect to the November elections, VECER found that 73 
percent of those surveyed planned to vote, with only 13.5 
percent saying they would not vote and an equal percentage 
uncertain. People between 35 and 45 years of age were the most 
inclined to vote, as were those with a secondary or higher 
education, 77 percent of whom intended to vote--compared to only 
36 percent of those with a primary school education. Gender was 
also salient: 81 percent of the men surveyed intended to vote, 
compared to 59 percent of the women. The breakdown by ethnic 
groups is shown in the table below: 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|                  |Will Vote         |Will Not Vote     |Undecided         |

<F P=106> [Article by Zoran Petrov: "Are the Detectives `Suffocating' </F>
the Interior Ministry?"] 
  [Text] The fate of the Security College is still 
uncertain. Although it has existed for 17 years, the Security 
College, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 
represents a limit on the admission of college-educated people 
into the police, except for detectives, who are narrowly focused 
personnel without "horizontal" mobility to other parts of the 
state administration. People at the Security College are asking 
whether hastily trained lawyers or economists can fight 
crime. 
  The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia--FYROM] Assembly's meeting three days ago, when the 
"Proposal to Adopt a Law on Establishing a Training Center for 
Personnel in the Field of Security" came on the agenda, revived 
once again the dispute that has existed for almost a year 
between the Interior Ministry and representatives of the present 
Security College. The basic dilemma, which is also extremely 
debatable for a considerable number of parliamentarians (at 
least according to their statements at the meeting) is whether 
the Security College, which has existed since 1977, should be 
abolished, since the most fundamental innovation in the 
government's proposal is the elimination of this college and the 
establishment of a Center, whose basic task would be to create 
personnel for the uniformed portion of the police (the present 
police secondary school). The Assembly epilogue of the draft 
offered is well-known: By a majority of votes, the deputies 
decided that the law would be handled in two phases, with the 
government charged with preparing a bill. 
<H5>  Invasion of the Police by Unemployed Lawyers </H5>
  The Assembly debate revived the dispute begun somewhat less 
than a year ago, with the notification by Minister Ljubomir 
Frckovski, sent to the Security College, which suspended the 
enrollment of students for the upcoming (1993) academic year. 
Several months later, on 18 June, Agis Sajnoski, then dean of 
the college, convened a news conference at which he called the 
Interior Minister's decision to suspend the enrollment of 
students an arbitrary action, behind which lay the interests of 
a group of professors at the Law College, well deployed in the 
government, the University's rector, and the ministers of 
internal affairs and education, whose intentions were to wipe 
out the education of detectives in order to create room for the 
employment of lawyers in the Interior Ministry, which has 
recently been done intensively. Interior Minister Ljubomir 
Frckovski responded that the reactions by the group of 
professors from the Security College were an attempt to attract 
public attention by staging "street fights," although in doing 
so they did not have the support of a single competent 
institution. "On the whole, one can understand their reaction," 
Frckovski said then, "which is due to fear for their own jobs 
and the high salaries that professors have." 
  In the meantime, the Macedonian Government completed the 
procedure for preparing a new draft on the transformation of the 
present Center (without the college), which was reviewed this 
fall by four Assembly commissions, and three days ago at the 
Macedonian parliament's meeting. What are the differences 
between the two opposing sides, and what are the arguments "for" 
and "against" eliminating the Security College, since it is more 
than clear that this is actually the most fundamental change in 
the government draft that was offered? 
  The explanation of the Proposal to Adopt a Law on 
Establishing a Training Center for Personnel in the Field of 
Security, for example, says that for almost 15 years the 
Interior Ministry, in its personnel policy, focused on the 
admission of "detective" personnel from the Security College, 
which exists within the framework of the Center. This kind of 
personnel orientation, the explanation then says, represents a 
limitation, and restricts the admission of college-educated 
people with other professional backgrounds, since these are 
narrowly specialized personnel, without "horizontal" mobility 
into other parts of the state administration. It then says that 
experiences with the quality and adjustment of personnel to work 
in the Ministry are in favor of employees with ordinary highly 
professional training--lawyers, economists, computer scientists, 
sociologists, chemists, and so forth. What still remain 
extremely controversial are the way in which this college was 
even founded--imposed on the Republic of Macedonia for the needs 
of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] 
internal affairs authorities--the method and selection of 
personnel for the needs of a completely different system, which 
could by no means be described as democratic. At the same time, 
the explanation of the Proposal to Adopt a Law says, several 
meetings were held with representatives of the Ministry of 
Education, the Ministry of Science, the Cyril and Methodius 
University, and the Center, at which there were discussions of 
these issues, and in which agreement was reached in principle on 
the transformation project, with which only the Security 
College's representatives did not agree. 
<H5>  Conflict of Conceptual Differences </H5>
  In contrast to the position of the government and the 
Interior Ministry, the current dean of the Security College, Dr. 
Ivanco Stojanov, has a completely different view of things. "Our 
college is a member of the Cyril and Methodius University," 
Stojanov said, "and it cannot be abolished without a decision by 
the University Council. Accordingly, the position stated in the 
explanation of the draft, that meetings were held at the 
University and that some sort of agreement on abolishing the 
college was reached, does not correspond to the truth. On the 
contrary," as Stojanov emphasized, "criminology is a special 
science, and differs from the legal, economic, and other 
sciences, and consequently a criminal scientist is in a 
different profession. The fact is that crime itself is a complex 
phenomenon, and only a suitably trained individual can cope with 
it, who will be able to cope with the primary 
function--preventing, detecting, clarifying, and proving crime. 
Can that be done by a hastily trained person, and can he be 
equipped by a course several months long to perform these 
things?" Stojanov asked. 
  "I maintain that during the last three years the Interior 
Ministry has hired about 1,000 graduate criminal scientists, but 
three or four times more lawyers," the dean of the Security 
College emphasized. According to him, this has radically 
violated the criterion of professionalism or competence, since 
it is impossible for people with different professional 
qualifications to conduct the police's basic activity. "And as 
for the claim that personnel from this college have proven to be 
of poor quality and unable to adapt," Stojanov stated 
categorically, "let someone tell me where the present chiefs of 
the Interior Ministry's regional units came from, the direct of 
the Center for Training Security Personnel, and several managers 
in the police services and sectors. If they are poor-quality 
personnel, then why are they assigned to management positions?" 
our interlocutor asked. The main argument for the special status 
of the Security College, according to its dean, is its very 
curriculum, which consists of 24 subjects, which are not studied 
at any other college in the University. Among others, they are: 
detective tactics, social pathology, criminal psychology, 
special physical education, the basics of security science, 
detective techniques, detective methodology, police tactics, 
forensic medicine, transportation criminal science, the 
criminology of unconstitutional acts, the methodology for 
investigating crime, victimology, the statistics of crime, 
ecological criminal science, criminological information science, 
economic criminal science, and so forth. 
  From what has been stated above, it can be seen clearly that 
there are substantive conceptual differences over the (lack of) 
justification for the continued survival of the Security 
College. On one hand, the Interior Ministry's position is that 
in the spirit of the new times and the role of the police, 
narrowly focused and "horizontally" immobile personnel are not 
needed, but rather more narrowly specialized individuals from 
several scientific areas and disciplines. The college's 
position, on the contrary, is that the basic activity of a 
detective cannot be conducted by lawyers, economists, or 
chemists, since they are trained for other fields. In other 
words, a specific problem like crime inevitably requires expert 
personnel who would be able to oppose it successfully. Whatever 
the case, the Republic of Macedonia's Assembly will have the 
last word. The latest news associated with this issue is the 
announcement by the Interior Minister that the enrollment of 
students at the Security College has been frozen for this year 
as well.

<F P=106> [Article by G. Karevski: "The Desire for Luxury Led Them </F>
Into Crime"] 
  [Text] Well-informed people in the city claim that 
the jailed policemen were known for their easy and attractive 
life, and that they intended to invest their rapidly acquired 
profits in private business. Among those jailed is one policeman 
from Serbia, who coordinated things from the other side of the 
border. Were people from Customs also involved in the 
smuggling? 
  Bitola, 10 Feb--The discovery and arrest of a group of 
smugglers of luxury automobiles a few days ago in Bitola, and 
the scandal that was caused immediately afterward by the still 
not officially confirmed but also still undenied reports that 
several policemen from the Bitola UVR [Internal Affairs 
Administration] (at least one of them with the rank of police 
inspector) were also active members of that group, will probably 
be a distinction by which the first part of February will be 
remembered in this city for quite a long time to come. And if 
(in the interests of the investigation) the embargo continues on 
any official statements and information for the public, it will 
only intensify the latter's curiosity and imagination: It is 
precisely that ordinary public that is analyzing by itself in 
detail the entire case, seeking an answer to the question of how 
and to what extent crime has taken root among people in uniform. 
  The Bitola public, especially people who say that they are 
thoroughly informed about the entire case, is already skeptical 
about the question of whether it really will be completely 
cleared up, since allegedly this has to do with a network of 
organized criminals much broader than the chain that was 
"broken" in Bitola, and because after the breaking of the 
"Bitola connection" those who "operated" in several other 
Macedonian cities are allegedly still in hiding. Furthermore, 
"those in the know" claim that a broader circle of policemen 
knew about the activity of the "Bitola connection," that they 
kept it quiet for the sake of their friends and colleages, but 
that in the end they nevertheless informed their superiors in 
the UVR, avoiding the risk that their passive attitude might 
involve them as accomplices. In any case, trying to be more 
precise, the Bitola public is now insisting on the "assertion" 
that there are four (already former) police officers from the 
local UVR in jail, and that among the jailed foreign citizens 
there is likewise one policeman (from the Republic of Serbia), 
who coordinated things from the other side of the border, and 
came to Macedonia in order to see the results of his involvement. 
  It is now being said of the jailed Bitola policemen that 
they 
are fairly young, that they were well known in the city for 
being in love with an expensive, easy, and attractive life, and 
reasons are being sought here for their going over to the other 
side of the law. "Working" then on intensive smuggling, 
exclusively of luxury automobiles (those involved were mostly of 
the Mercedes, BMW, Golf, and Ford makes, and only one 
Renault-5), they apparently succeeded in acquiring considerable 
amounts of foreign exchange. Allegedly, as much as 180,000 
German marks [DM] was found on one of the people arrested and 
was confiscated from him, and they also had a certain number of 
unsold cars "in stock." "Those in the know" say that the former 
policemen intended to invest their quickly acquired profits in 
opening private enterprises, and that the world of private 
business was their main vision, and thus, even without the 
police action, the Bitola smuggling chain would have collapsed 
on its own. That the ex-policemen really did intend to resign 
not only from smuggling but also from the police profession, 
according to the "information" of the Bitola public, is also 
confirmed by the (allegedly) regularly performed procedures for 
the registration of private enterprises. The problem arose, 
however, when the people simply forget to stop when faced with 
the magical rustling of green banknotes. 
  In any case, spurred by the statements that the 
investigation 
is constantly encountering new elements, the Bitola public is 
now also talking about new arrests and jailings. Solely on the 
basis of the "logical assumption" that the entry of the smuggled 
automobiles into Macedonia would have been impossible without 
the involvement of people from Customs as well, they are 
manipulating the "facts" that several people are "losing" their 
careers there as well, and the list of accomplices among 
ordinary citizens who allegedly also had vital functions in the 
criminal chain through their own occupations is expanding 
greatly. 
  In any case, however, the investigation is under way.

  [Text] Although the law on identity cards is not 
being passed, the Interior Ministry is announcing the 
introduction of new identity cards in the spring; the 
introduction of the new cards will be done on the basis of the 
old regulations, with a change in the form for the identity 
cards; a filter for uncovering individuals without Macedonian 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] 
citizenship. 
  While the adoption of the law on identity cards by the 
Macedonian Assembly is waiting for "better times," the Interior 
Ministry is preparing a "counterstrike"--it will start to issue 
the new identity cards as early as April, and possibly the 
beginning of June. Regardless of whether the new law is passed 
or not, legal form will be ensured by applying the old law, but 
with changes in the regulations. To put it more simply, the form 
of the identity card will be changed, which the ministry has the 
right to do, just as in the case of the change in passports. 
<H5>  Black Number </H5>
  The Interior Ministry decided on this step because the 
present situation with the use and issuance of identity cards, 
in which real chaos prevailed (red, blue, and plastic-coated 
ones are in use), is becoming increasingly untenable. 
Standardization of the main civil document has also become 
necessary in order to clear up definitively the question of who 
is and who is not a citizen of the Republic of Macedonia. 
According to Blagoja Toskovski, a chief at the Interior 
Ministry, the current process of determining the status of 
Macedonian citizenship is definitive enough to give an answer as 
to how many citizens Macedonia has. 
  The information simply shows that many residents, knowing 
that they did not meet the conditions for obtaining citizenship, 
did not even request it, but are continuing to reside in 
Macedonia, using the old identity cards, obtained in various 
ways. That is the so-called "black number," whose magnitude is 
unknown, and which can only be determined by issuing new 
identity cards, which, however, can only be obtained on the 
basis of having received citizenship. This step is an attempt at 
finally clearing up the dilemma of who is a citizen of 
Macedonia, and all those who will not meet the conditions for 
obtaining a new identity card will have the status of 
foreigners; they will be easily identified, and they will have 
to regulate their stay in Macedonia in accordance with the rules 
for residence by foreigners. 
<H5>  Prediction </H5>
  "Indisputably it is necessary to adopt the law on identity 
cards. That does not mean, however, that it should be postponed 
indefinitely, because the situation `in the field' is already 
intolerable. The Interior Ministry will wait for the law to be 
passed, but if that does not happen we will start issuing the 
new forms for identity cards this spring," Blagoja Toskovski 
said. 
  As the situation regarding passage of the law on identity 
cards stands now in the Assembly, the Interior Ministry will 
probably have to start without this law. The positions of the 
deputies' groups still remain unchanged: The opposition is 
stubbornly insisting that identity cards be written only in the 
Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet, including the 
citizen's name, and the coalition itself, in addition to being 
divided, has not decided what it should definitely accept. 
  Specifically, the PDP-NDP [Party for Democratic 
Prosperity-People's Democratic Party] is insisting that the 
entire contents of the identity card, including the name of the 
owner, be written in the language and script of national 
minorities, as well as the Macedonian language and Cyrillic 
script. The Liberals, as usual, still have reservations; that, 
however, does not mean that they possibly might not join the 
SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia], which accepts 
the government's proposal that the identity card should be 
written in the Macedonian language and the Cyrillic alphabet, 
and the name of the citizen in parentheses and in the language 
and alphabet of the national minorities. There are predictions 
that since we will have elections this fall the law will not 
even be supported at all, because of fear of a possible loss of 
support among some of the voters. 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  Identity Cards as Cards </H5>
  The new identity cards will have the form of cards made from 
a stronger material without a protective foil. The first page 
will have the photograph of the bearer, together with the 
owner's first name and surname, and his birth certificate and 
registration number. "Republic of Macedonia" will be at the top, 
but without the state seal, which is also the alternative used 
in the new Macedonian passports. 
  The data on the date and place of birth will be entered on 
the second page, and the bearer's fingerprint will be impressed 
in a special place. Otherwise, it is planned that the 
replacement of identity cards will be carried out within one 
year, but the Interior Ministry thinks that the entire operation 
can be completed in a shorter time, in view of the capabilities 
of the system, which makes it possible to issue 300,000 identity 
cards in a month.

  [Text] Novi Sad, 25 Apr (TANJUG) -- If NATO abuses UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] forces it will topple the United Nations, 
which will become an instrument of NATO and the United States 
[as received], Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the assembly of 
the Srpska republic, has told Novi Sad Radio. 
  Krajisnik stresses that the Srpska republic has long been 
demonstrating that it is ready to cease fighting and make peace 
and find a peaceful solution in ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, 
everything that is being displayed in the media and ultimata 
testifies to an intention to vilify the Serbs and satisfy 
certain interests that lead to war rather than peace. 
  It is ever more evident that the intention is to achieve a 
certain goal -- set in advance -- namely, by ultimata with the 
help of NATO, the United States, and UNPROFOR, the Muslim side 
should achieve everything it has militarily failed to achieve in 
the battlefield. 
  Gorazde and the situation surrounding it, Krajisnik 
cautioned, was just a launch pad for Muslim forces and their 
intervention in the direction of Cajnice, Visegrad, and Srbinje 
(Foca). The support of NATO, the United States, and the UN for 
such an escalation can lead to one thing only -- fierce war, 
Krajisnik said. 
  He noted that the leadership of the Srpska republic had 
successfully finished their negotiations with Yasushi Akashi, 
the UN secretary general's special envoy, but these agreements 
were not being honored and that solutions are being forcefully 
imposed on the Serbs. This is something the leadership of the 
Srpska republic cannot accept, since this is something that the 
Serb people on the soil of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot accept 
either because they are fighting for their survival and will not 
succumb to any ultimatum or force.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- NATO, issuing the 
latest ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, has openly taken the side 
of the Moslems, says Aleksa Buha, Bosnian Serb republic (S.R.) 
foreign minister. 
  In an interview published by the Belgrade daily POLITIKA 
EKSPRES on Monday, Buha described NATO ultimatums as "a two-way 
support which not only protects the Moslems from the Serb 
defence, but enables them to fire unobstructed at the Serb army 
and civilians." The NATO Council has threatened to launch air 
strikes against Bosnian Serbs unless they withdraw their heavy 
weapons to 20 km from the Moslem enclaves, U.N.-declared "safe 
areas" of Gorazde, Zepa, Tuzla, Bihac and Srebrenica. 
  Buha said that talks on Friday and Saturday between S.R. 
President Radovan Karadzic and U.N. chief for the former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, with the mediation of Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic, had implied a promising course in 
resolving the "most difficult crisis in months." 
  Buha added: "We were well on the way to iron out the 
disputes 
with the U.N. Protection Force and furthermore, to reach an 
accord on Gorazde. But just as we have sighed with relief, a 
NATO ultimatum letter arrived and somewhat discredited the 
accord." 
  He said that NATO's unsynchronized involvement with 
additional ultimatums had created further confusion and 
primarily imposed a dilemma on who among a multitude of 
international organizations had the final say -- the United 
Nations, NATO or "a big power which has made both organizations 
its instruments." 
  Akashi and Karadzic, with Milosevic's mediation, have agreed 
on an immediate ceasefire around Gorazde.

  [Text] Zagreb, April 26 (AFP) -- The UN Protection Force 
said Tuesday that the Bosnian Serbs were making progress in 
withdrawing their heavy weapons from around the Moslem enclave 
of Gorazde ahead of a 0001 GMT deadline set by NATO. 
  "Generally we are satisfied with the progress that is taking 
place on the ground," said UNPROFOR spokesman Michael Williams. 
"The Bosnian Serb Army is withdrawing heavy weaponry from the 
20-kilometre exclusion zone and the general trend is positive." 
  He said that the United Nations' special representative to 
ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi had sent a letter overnight Monday 
to NATO's secretary general Manfred Woerner telling him that he 
was satisfied by the Serb progress and was hopeful that they 
would comply with the deadline. 
  Earlier in London, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
said that the Serbs had begun withdrawing their heavy weapons 
from around the battered enclave but not enough to avert the 
threat of NATO air strikes. "Today will be an important day. 
There has been some movement, but not enough," Christopher said 
after meeting with British counterpart Douglas Hurd. 
Christopher was to leave later Tuesday for Geneva and a meeting 
with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. 
  As he spoke, a four-sided working group began meeting in 
London in search of long-term solutions to the Bosnian conflict. 
Hurd said Monday there would be "no hesitation" in ordering air 
strikes if Serb troops and weapons were not withdrawn beyond a 
20 kilometre (12 mile) radius from the centre of the Moslem 
enclave by 0001 GMT Wednesday.

a distance of 3 km from the town center, as stipulated by the 
NATO ultimatum. The UN forces still have not occupied a single 
position in the region as envisaged by the NATO ultimatum. The 
chetniks are settling Kopaci and Zubcici with civilian 
populations. These villages are in the direct vicinity of 
Gorazde. At the same time the chetniks are concentrating major 
forces on the territory around the free part of the Gorazde

had been evacuated by UN helicopters from the city. The 
evacuation is still under way. [passage omitted] 
  The skimpy information says that the chetniks have started 
to 
pull back their murderous units to the distance envisaged by the 
NATO ultimatum. However, they have still not withdrawn the tank 
in (Kazagici), which is less than 2 km from the city center. 
  The Blue Helmets have started to impose a buffer zone in the 
region. The Gorazde Presidency is holding intensive talks with 
the representatives of civilian structures of the UN Protection 
Forces in Gorazde on the normalization of the situation in the 
city. The priority is the water supply for Gorazde, since 
yesterday the chetniks blew up the reservoir of industrial 
water, which the people of Gorazde have been using as drinking 
water over the last two years. Electricity is also a big 
problem, as this city has not had any for two years. The lack 
of food after a month has been alleviated by the arrival of the 
UNHCR convoy. [passage omitted]

this morning from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army East Bosnian 
Operative Group command in Gorazde, the chetniks have not 
withdrawn to a distance of 1 km from the town center as 
stipulated by the NATO ultimatum. Moreover, UN forces have not 
taken up the positions specified by the ultimatum. Groups of 
chetniks were sighted yesterday and this morning in areas that 
are only 1 km away from the town. Chetnik provocations 
overnight were registered in the area of Orahovice and 
(?Ostanica), while a tank and infantry attack at Brdarici is 
currently in progress. 
  Life in the city is extremely hard because the small area of 
the town now holds over 40,000 citizens and refugees who were 
forced to leave their homes in the surrounding villages. Lack 
of water could cause large-scale epidemics. That is why we are 
appealing to the UN Protection Force and health organizations to 
undertake urgent measures to protect the population of Gorazde 
from infectious diseases. As we were filing this report, we 
were informed that a UN High Commissioner for Refugees convoy, 
carrying food and medicine, had entered the town.

  [Excerpt] After a long time, no one has been killed in 
Gorazde today, Esad Ohranovic, president of the Executive 
Council of the Gorazde district, reported over the radio bridge 
established at 1500 with the help of ham radio operators. 
Mladen Bosnjak has the details: 
  [Begin recording] [Bosnjak] The situation in Gorazde is 
stabilizing. There has been no shelling. Snipers have been 
active from time to time and have wounded five people. The 
citizens can cross both bridges. The aggressor's forces with 
their heavy artillery are withdrawing. An enemy tank can be 
seen in the zone within the three km circle from the center of 
Gorazde in the village of (?Kazabic), along the river toward 
Visegrad. This is briefly the situation in the town as it was 
presented by Mr. Ohranovic today. However: 
  [Ohranovic] [Words indistinct] in a way the anarchy, looting 
has started. Last night we also had two murders. The police, 
that is to say, the Security Services' Center is doing 
everything it can to prevent this anarchy somehow, to restore 
order, and to create the conditions in which the people and the 
residents can return to those houses that have not burned down 
but were temporarily controlled by the chetniks. 
  [Bosnjak] Is the evacuation of the injured continuing? 
  [Ohranovic] At the time of reporting, a certain number of 
injured people are already leaving Gorazde. We can hear the 
helicopters flying over the house. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (AFP) -- An aid convoy which had 
been blocked by Serb forces arrived Tuesday in the Moslem 
enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, a spokeswoman for the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said. 
  Spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said the Danish convoy of 10 
trucks, carrying 90 tonnes of supplies, arrived in Gorazde 
Tuesday morning. 
  The convoy, which left Belgrade Monday morning, crossed into 
Bosnia Monday afternoon, but was stopped at a Serb checkpoint at 
Dobrun, some 30 kilometres (19 miles) from Gorazde, and sent 
back into Serbia, where it remained overnight. 
  On Tuesday Bosnian Serb authorities in Pale authorised the 
convoy to continue into Bosnia, Sachs said. 
  Two other aid convoys, both Russian, were on their way to 
Moslem enclaves in Bosnia, Sachs said. One was carrying 110 
tonnes of aid to Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia and the other, of 
14 trucks carrying 61 tonnes of supplies, was heading for 
Gorazde. 
  A UN convoy carrying some 250 peacekeeping troops arrived in 
Gorazde at 2:00 a.m. (0000 GMT) Monday, having taken 11 hours to 
make the 70-kilometre (40- mile) journey from Sarajevo. 
  It was blocked for two hours in the Sarajevo suburb of 
Lukavica by Serbs who objected to what they said were 
discrepancies in the convoy's papers.

  [Excerpt] Paris, April 25 (AFP) -- The French Government on 
Monday [25 April] ordered its helicopter crews involved in the 
evacuation of wounded people from Gorazde to refuse to submit to 
Bosnian Serb identity controls, the Foreign Ministry said. The 
restrictions on helicopter flights put in place by the Serbs are 
unacceptable, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Catherine Colonna, 
said here. "We have therefore asked the French helicopter crews 
making these missions to refuse," these controls, she said. 
  "The French authorities note that UN Security Council 
Resolution 913 demands an immediate and definite lifting of all 
blockages on the free circulation of UNPROFOR," (the UN 
Protection Force) in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colonna added. Flights 
by British and French UN helicopters between Gorazde and 
Sarajevo were delayed again Monday by the Serbs. 
  According to the office of the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) -- struggling to save the most seriously 
wounded people in Gorazde -- travelling times have been 
quadrupled by Serb controls. The delays were fatal for the most 
seriously wounded patients at Gorazde hospital, an aid worker 
said at Sarajevo. 
  Of the 600 due for emergency evacuation, 154 have been 
evacuated from Gorazde since Sunday. Sixty nine people were 
evacuated Monday up to the middle of the afternoon. [passage

  [Text] Cajnice, April 26 (TANJUG) -- A Muslim sniper from 
Gorazde has killed a Bosnian Serb fighter at the right bank of 
the Drina in sight of U.N. peacekeepers, the Herzegovina corps 
command said on Tuesday. 
  The Muslim sniper shot dead Herzegovina Corps member Sasa 
Burovic near the village of Kazagici, three kilometres from 
central Gorazde. He was shot late on Monday while talking to 
Ukrainian peacekeepers by a U.N. armoured vehicle. The 
Ukrainians readily came to his rescue, transporting him to a 
Visegrad hospital but Burovic died a few hours later. 
  Early on Tuesday, Muslims kept showering Herzegovina corps 
troops with fire from rifles with telescopic sights, machine 
guns and anti-aircraft guns in violation of a ceasefire, their 
bullets whizzing over the heads of U.N. peacekeepers. 
  Whenever Bosnian Serb units withdraw and U.N. peacekeepers 
deploy within three kilometres from central Gorazde, Muslims 
from Gorazde promptly move in the vacant space, in violation of 
a NATO ultimatum and an agreement between Bosnian Serb President 
Radovan Karadzic and U.N. secretary-general's special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi. 
  Bosnian Serb troops have moved to three kilometres from 
central Gorazde, in accordance with the Belgrade agreement 
between Karadzic and Akashi, General Milan Gvero, the Bosnian 
Serb army assistant commander, said on Monday. 
  U.N. peacekeepers, deployed as an interposition force 
pursuant to the agreement, are expected not to allow Muslims any 
more provocations from Gorazde, Gen. Gvero said. 
  In late March, Muslims launched an offensive against the 
Bosnian Serb territory from Gorazde, which, as a U.N.-proclaimed 
"safe area," should have been demilitarised in the spring of 
1993, but Bosnian Serb forces mounted a counter-offensive and 
pushed the Muslims back towards the centre of the town.

  [Text] Visegrad, 25 Apr (TANJUG) -- The decision by Radovan 
Karadzic, the president of the Srpska republic, and Yasushi 
Akashi, the UN secretary-general's special envoy, on the 
withdrawal of the Serb forces around Gorazde is being 
successfully implemented, Milan Gvero, deputy commander of the 
Srpska republic's army, told a TANJUG reporter today. 
  According to Gvero, the Serb soldiers have withdrawn three 
km 
from the center of Gorazde, and the decision on the evacuation 
of the wounded and civilians from Gorazde has also been 
implemented. The passage of humanitarian convoys to Gorazde is 
also continuing successfully, Gvero added. 
  He particularly stressed that he expected that UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] deployed along the separation lines would not 
allow any further provocative actions by the Muslims from 
Gorazde. 
  Gvero also said that today he had demanded from UN officials 
that all Serb prisoners be unconditionally released from Gorazde 
and that this should not be considered a prisoner exchange. 
For, according to General Gvero, the Serbs have shown goodwill 
so many times, by allowing humanitarian convoys in and by 
withdrawing their troops from Gorazde. 
  It is time that the other side shows goodwill too, Gen. 
Gvero 
stressed.

  [Text] Peace is gradually returning to the Gorazde front. 
Only sporadic sniper fire has come from the Muslim side today. 
The UN troops are taking up positions in their designated 
locations. The Karadzic-Akashi agreement is being implemented. 
Units of the army of the Srpska republic are withdrawing to the 
lines 3 km from the center of Gorazde, while the heavy artillery 
has been withdrawn to 20 km from the town. 
  The Serbian civilians who fled their houses before the 
Muslim 
army's advance two years ago are returning to burnt and 
destroyed villages on the right bank of the Drina River. 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] (?represent a guarantee) to them 
to return and continue to live safely in their destroyed houses. 
  The Muslim army has been defeated on the Gorazde front. 
Their offensive did not succeed. Of their four brigades, with 
more than 8,000 troops, three have been crushed. This was 
stated by Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic from the Herzegovina Corps 
command during today's meeting with correspondents reporting 
from this front. He stressed that in their counteroffensives, 
members of the army of the Srpska republic liberated an area of 
170 square kilometers. The units of the Herzegovina Corps, 
commanded by General Radovan Grubac, liberated 100 square 
kilometers themselves. 
  This has created the conditions for the Serbs who have fled 
the area to return to their hearths. Herzegovina has in this 
way obtained the shortest possible route to Serbia, this officer 
said. According to Colonel Lakicevic, the world has finally 
realized that its investment in Alija's army was futile. 
  In the fighting on the Gorazde front, the Herzegovina Corps 
lost 30 fighters killed and 160 were wounded. Of these 40 were 
more seriously wounded.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1700 GMT on 25 April reports on 
low-level combat activities in the following parts of the 
republic: 
  The studio announcer says that "the Bihac district has been 
exposed to attacks by the joint aggressors: the chetniks and 
the paramilitary formations of Fikret Abdic. The chetniks 
continue to shell the defense lines." The announcer adds that 
"the defense lines on the Bosanska Krupa and Grabez fronts have 
also come under attack. Fresh chetnik regrouping has been noted 
in this part, too." 
  Reporting on the situation on the Brcko front, Hamiz 
Deronjic 
says that "most active on the aggressor's side were the snipers, 
who targeted all the defense positions throughout the day. The 
enemy also intensified the attacks with small arms and 
antiaircraft machine guns along the entire front line. The 
areas of the most frequent and strongest attacks over the past 
14 days of the enemy offensive -- Vranovaca and Boderiste -- 
were not spared shelling today either. The chetniks fired 50- 
and 82-mm mortars at this part of Brcko's defenses today." 
  A report by the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports that "the chetniks disturbed the 
deceptive lull on several occasions" in Sarajevo today. It is 
reported that "they were most active from the direction of 
Vozlica Kuca near Brijesece, from where they used a death sower 
and an antiaircraft machine gun and fired rifle grenades at the 
town's defense lines. A similar thing happened from their 
positions in the so-called Sarabina Kuca, from where they 
attacked the free territories using an antiaircraft machine gun 
on several occasions."

  [Text] Doboj, April 25 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem forces on 
Monday stepped up the intensity of their attacks on Bosnian Serb 
positions and villages in the wider region of Doboj in northern 
Bosnia. 
  Moslems attacked Serb defence positions west of Doboj with 
strong small arms and mortar fire and tried to carry out an 
infantry attack, but it was repulsed, Bosnian Serb military 
sources said. 
  Moslem forces carried out a strong infantry attack northeast 
of Teslic (southwest of Doboj), planning to break through the 
Serb defence lines, but Bosnian Serb units repulsed this attack 
and forced the Moslem formations to retreat. 
  Moslems on Monday also stepped up attacks from anti-aircraft 
weapons and small arms northeast of Doboj, but the attacks 
ceased after the Serb side returned strong fire.

  [Text] Zagreb, April 25 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Government and 
secessionists freed 356 Moslem prisoners of war in the Bihac 
pocket in northern Bosnia, the International Committee of the 
Red Cross (ICRC) said here Monday [25 April]. 
  Moslem secessionist forces led by Fikret Abdic, controlling 
the north of the pocket, freed 280 prisoners, and troops loyal 
to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in the south freed 76, 
the ICRC said. The exchanges followed the signing of an 
agreement between the two sides April 23. 
  ICRC representatives held discussions with each prisoner to 
make sure they were happy crossing the front line to rejoin 
their own side. The forces have clashed intermittently since 
Abdic declared autonomy late last year for Bihac.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, April 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Vice-Premier 
Zeljko Simic said on Friday that the international community had 
set a dangerous precedent by raiding Bosnian Serb positions at 
the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde, which might have 
incalculable consequences for the future of international 
relations and the shape of the new world order. 
  Simic, who chairs the committee for monitoring the 
International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, was speaking at a 
meeting with a delegation of the Russian State Duma (lower house 
of the Russian parliament), headed by Nikolay Bezbyrodov, deputy 
chairman of the parliamentary defence commitee, said a statement 
released by the Yugoslav Information Ministry. 
  Simic briefed the Russian delegation about the Yugoslav 
Government's positions in the light of the latest developments 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and said that Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) had been cooperative and flexible from the 
very outbreak of the crisis in the region, which means that 
accusations against its foreign policy orientation are 
groundless, and most often malicious. 
  The Yugoslav Government has always aspired to an unbiased 
and 
objective view of all aspects of the crisis in former 
Yugoslavia, as the only way for reaching a just and lasting 
settlement of the two-year-old crisis, simic said and added that 
the government would never abandon the democratic principles of 
safeguarding the sovereignty of the country and the freedom of 
its people. 
  Simic placed special stress on the unsuitability of 
sanctions 
and the need for banishing them permanently from international 
relations. 
  The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia in 
May 1992 for the country's alleged military involvement in civil 
war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has tightened them 
twice since. 
  Simic stressed that Russia's role had been and continued to 
be of great importance to Yugoslavia and the future of the world. 
  Without the active, peace-making role of Russia, which 
justly 
insists on talks as the only mode of international communication 
likely to produce lasting peace and stable relations in the 
region, it is impossible to imagine a satisfactory outcome of 
the civil war and relaxation of tensions in the region. This is 
why all international factors must embrace the Russian approach, 
which is unbiased, heeds the political reality and strives for a 
comprehensive settlement of the conflict in the territory of 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina, simic said. 
  He added that lasting and immediate peace was a necessary 
precondition for all talks and political consultations, whose 
outcome must not be prejudged. 
  The Russian parliamentary delegation agreed with the 
positions expressed by the Yugoslav deputy prime minister and 
said that their visit was primarily aimed at learning at first 
hand the true state of affairs in the former Yugoslav republics. 
They explained they intended to suggest to the State Duma later 
in April some concrete measures which should help solve the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Information Ministry 
said in its statement.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 25 (TANJUG) -- The biggest 
measurable damage to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during 
the international sanctions is the drop in the national income 
from 3,000 dollars to 700-900 dollars per capita, Dr. Oskar 
Kovac told TANJUG on Monday. 
  The prominent economist is a member of a team of experts 
charged with estimating the damage to the Yugoslav economy since 
the imposition of the sanctions in May 30, 1992 which caused a 
drop in the production, a halt of export-import activities, 
rising unemployment and lower living standards. 
  "The idea on a conference on the economic revival of the 
former Yugoslavia, recently proposed by U.N. Secretary General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, has only spurred the Yugoslav experts to 
step up their efforts to estimate the scope of the damage," 
Kovac said. 
  The former Yugoslav republics have intensified their efforts 
to estimate the war damage, either independently or with the aid 
of world experts, he said. 
  Yugoslavia has suffered damages both due to the sanctions 
and 
the disintegration of the former Yugoslav Federation which 
started in 1991 with the violent secession of Slovenia and 
Croatia. 
  The experts will determine in what measure the sanctions 
affected the reduction of the social product, which recorded a 
drop from 23,399 million dollars to 9,520 million dollars in the 
1990-93 period. 
  The marked decrease began in 1991 with a 11 percent drop 
compared to 1990, and 26 percent in 1992. In 1993, this figure 
was 30.3 percent. 
  In view of the fact that in the 1986-90 period the Yugoslav 
social product recorded an average annual drop of 1.2 percent, 
it is clear that the drastic fall is the result of the 
disintegration of the former Yugoslavia and the introduction of 
the E.C. and U.N. Security Council sanctions. 
  Much of the damage will be difficult to measure, while a 
part 
will become apparent only after the sanctions are lifted when 
potential losses of commercial banks surface.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Becirovic: "Private Operators Are Ruining the </F>
Dinar"] 
  [Text] Podgorica, 5 Apr -- Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo 
Djukanovic today invited bankers to Podgorica for a discussion 
of what is happening to the money supply, saying that disturbing 
problems have been arising in recent days after the favorable 
results in the first stage of stabilizing the monetary system. 
According to Djukanovic, these problems require urgent measures. 
He mentioned scalping, of which he said that the "participant 
banks" are not the only ones. Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister 
Krunoslav Vukcevic asked the bankers to present their view of 
how the currency exchange business operates. He presented 
figures to the effect that by 4 April Montenegrin banks had 
purchased 13.2 million German marks [DM]. When the sale of 
foreign exchange is taken into account, there was a positive 
result of about DM12 million. In view of the fact that the 
result for the entire country is DM300 million, the share of 
Montenegrin banking is not really at an enviable level in that 
amount. He also pointed to the phenomenon of scalping. Petar 
Vujovic, director of the Montenegrin branch of the National 
Bank, mentioned other figures, saying that the purchases of 
foreign exchange in Montenegro amounted to about DM26 million, 
but that banks in Montenegro headquartered in Serbia are not 
turning over their entire purchases to the Montenegrin branch of 
the National Bank of Yugoslavia. 
  "When we asked the Beobanka office about the purchases of 
foreign exchange, they told us that headquarters gave out the 
figures. Later they told us that they were not prohibited from 
giving out figures, but they could not provide them," Vujovic 
said. 
  Radmila Kalezic, Jugobanka manager in Podgorica, stated 
categorically that her bank was not engaging in scalping. She 
said that the purchasing of foreign exchange had been good up 
until 10 days ago, but since that time things had changed, and 
her bank had a deficit of DM397,000 in sales and purchases of 
foreign exchange. 
  "The tellers noticed that the same people are coming to buy 
foreign exchange again and again in the course of the day. Those 
who earlier purchased it on the street have now moved to the 
banks. It seems that private operators are not promptly turning 
in their cash receipts for the day," Kalezic said, calling for 
the government to monitor strictly the cash flow of private 
firms. 
  Milorad Lakovic, director of Pljevaljska Bank, was also 
categorical about the private operators. He said that the 
dealers are working for the private operators and that the black 
market is already beginning to operate, and Cetkovic, the 
director of Jugobanka in Herceg-Novi, presented the figure that 
until a few days ago the ratio in the purchase and sale of 
foreign exchange was 4:1 to the advantage of the bank, but now 
that ratio is even. He said that the private sector is probably 
engaged in purchasing from farmers, so that the movement of the 
money is not being monitored, and certain new people are coming 
to bank windows and doing so several times a day. The bankers in 
Kotor say that a check should be run on how people with a 
monthly salary of no more than 100 dinars can come several times 
a day and present 100 dinars to buy marks. When bank personnel 
notice this and offer another currency instead of marks, these 
people call for the assistance of the financial police, and the 
officials must then pay them. 
  It is obvious that scalping and the dealers are slowly 
becoming reality once again.

<F P=106> [Article by M. Laketic: "Even Parties on Bank Balance </F>
Sheets"] 
  [Text] Pristina, 5 Apr -- In the opinion of Pristina 
bankers, the losses in Beogradska Bank, Pristinska, a 
joint-stock company, which POLITIKA has written about, occurred 
because of a lack of discipline on the part of certain 
executives who had never performed banking operations before 
coming to that institution. So, that bank, which never formed an 
oversight committee although it has been in existence since 1990 
and should have done so under the Law on Banks (Articles 41, 
46-48, SLUZBENI LIST, No. 32, 1993) and also under the bank 
charter, has been operating according to the lights of the 
general director and a few of his associates, who have changed 
frequently. 
  Instead of an oversight committee, Director Dimitrije 
Ljiljak 
formed a farm committee and a committee for science and 
technology, each of which had 15 members, constituting a 
"voluntary" advisory body. The members of these committees, 
among them Dr. Zoran Gruic; Dr. Zoran Gligorijevic; Zoran 
Vasiljevic, director of Famipa in Prizren; Bosko Kotorcevic, 
director of the welded pipe factory in Urosevac; Boban Boskovic, 
director of Plastika in Pristina; and so on, have been receiving 
a monthly appanage incomparably greater than the salaries of 
those employed in the bank. Expenditures of this kind were 
indicated in the Report on Business Operations under the items 
of "intellectual services" and "other nonproduction services." 
  Judging by that report, most of the expenditures were made, 
or costs incurred, by the bank's branch in Urosevac. Thus, that 
branch allocated for firewood alone several hundred-fold more 
money than in Pristina, while the Gnjilane, Pec, Prizren, and 
Zvecani banks had minimal expenditures of this kind. That same 
branch in Urosevac last year had several hundred-fold higher PTT 
[post, telephone, telegraph] costs than all the branches and 
main headquarters, taken together. That branch also had the 
highest appropriation to pay net personal incomes arising from 
royalties. 
  However, the personnel in that bank say that the situation 
is 
altogether different. They say that expenditures of other 
branches and the main headquarters were entered on the books of 
this branch, and those expenditures even included all kinds of 
parties, and last spring's celebration of the Serbian Radical 
Party [SRS] is mentioned as a curiosity. That is, the SRS 
celebrated its election victory in the Narcis Hotel on 
Brezovica. The bank was the general sponsor of the celebration, 
since, let us not forget, Director Dimitrije Ljiljak was a 
people's deputy in the Serbian Assembly as a member of the SRS. 
  Another oddity referred to is the example of the purchase of 
Misa Kalajdzic's doctoral dissertation "Revitalization of Sar 
Mountain." That is, before the sale of that doctoral paper 
Kalajdzic was that bank's executive director, and now he is 
director of the commercial firm Kosmet, which was established by 
that bank. The lawyer of the Pristinska Bank, we have learned, 
opposed this unique purchase of a doctoral dissertation at the 
time, arguing that this work could be obtained without payment 
in any Kosmet library. 
  The personnel of the Pristinska Bank, among them Zaga 
Pavlovic, wrote a report on all of this for all the government 
agencies, including the president of the republic. Its petition 
referred to the collaboration between Director Ljiljak and a 
certain Milorad Dobric of Belgrade, owner of the magazine SELO, 
with the entire benefit going to this private publisher. The 
deal, our informant says, was that the magazine would write as 
much as possible about Director Ljiljak and then "there would be 
no problem about money for printing." 
  The bank's executives do not for the moment want to go 
public. The only statement was from Dr. Branko Vasiljevic, 
member of the bank's managing board, who said, "It actually 
could have been worse."

    [Editorial Report] The ability of Slovakia's new government 
to sustain a viable coalition is the subject of recent 
commentaries in the Slovak and Czech press, with some observers 
expressing optimistic views and others showing considerable 
doubts. Writing in the independent Bratislava daily NARODNA 
OBRODA of 27 March, Jan Fuelle argues that the new government 
coalition's success in accomplishing its avowed 
mission--preparing an early election and laying the foundation 
for Slovakia's economic stabilization--depends, among other 
things, on its being able to establish a framework for the 
emergence of "meaningful and viable" political groupings having 
clearly defined programs. Such a framework, he suggests, would 
resemble the Western-type division of political forces into 
left-wing, center, and right-wing parties. 
  Anyone looking at the composition of the new Slovak 
Government and at the prominent politicians whose influence made 
its creation possible, says Fuelle, would be struck by the fact 
that these men represent quite disparate, even contradictory, 
political views and that few apparent personal ties or, perhaps, 
common convictions bind them together. He writes: 
  "Until recently, Jozef Moravcik was foreign affairs 
minister; 
his predecessor in that office was Milan Knazko [currently 
chairman of the Alliance of Democrats of Slovakia]. At one time, 
Ludovit Cernak [currently chairman of the National Democratic 
Party] held the post of economy minister in the same government 
and, half a year ago, he signed a coalition agreement in the 
same room in which, last Monday night, he signed another 
agreement, this time with different partners and for a different 
purpose. Roman Kovac [former deputy prime minister and a 
prominent Movement for a Democratic Slovakia member] who also 
took part in the Monday signing ceremony, witnessed, while 
participating in the previous government's decision making, the 
expulsion of Milan Knazko, only to have the same fate overtake 
him. Jan Carnogursky [chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Movement, KDH] vehemently attacked the government, which 
included Jozef Moravcik, Milan Knazko, and Ludovit Cernak, as 
well as Roman Kovac; on the KDH election posters in 1990 one 
could read the slogan, `Let's Contain Communism.' Now, the 
former communist Peter Weiss could be seen sitting side by side 
with Carnogursky as he signed a document which mandated that, 
among other things, an SDL [Party of the Democratic Left] member 
be in charge of the Defense Ministry while a KDH member be 
entrusted with the Interior Ministry." 
  But to focus on this seemingly "absurd situation," suggests 
Fuelle, would be to miss the really significant point: 
"Politicians with such disparate views have been able to reach 
agreement." This, Fuelle believes, is a clear sign that by 
having managed to arrive at a number of compromises, they have 
adopted a truly democratic approach to the solution of the 
governmental crisis. Still, he continues, "so far all they have 
agreed on have been signatures" on the coalition document. The 
difficult moves "are yet to be made." To strengthen Slovak 
democracy, they must be "capable of additional compromises." 
Their larger mission must include the task of "regrouping" the 
existing Slovak political arrangements. For unlike the 
democratic Western countries, he argues, the Slovak political 
spectrum lacks a consolidated center. Missing between "a strong 
left" and "an emerging right" is "a viable center party." Being, 
by their own admission, moderate politicians of centrist 
orientation, the leaders of the forces behind the new coalition 
government--Fuelle mentions Cernak, Knazko, and Moravcik--now 
have a chance to create such a missing political entity, a 
center party that would "claim as its members many well-known 
and experienced politicians." Fuelle thinks that this can be 
accomplished by integration--primarily the integration of groups 
that have broken off from Meciar's HZDS--and "by finding 
partners abroad," i.e., association with parallel European 
political institutions. Should this succeed, he reasons, such a 
party "could play still another role--the role of a balancing 
factor." 
  Peter Weiss, SDL leader and one of the architects of the 
anti-Meciar coalition, feels that this coalition is capable of 
offering to the Slovak voters a government that not only 
tolerates plurality of views among its members but is resolved 
to forge, out of this diversity, a "pragmatic" program aimed 
specifically at bringing the country out of its current 
political and economic impasse. In an interview appearing in the 
30 March issue of Prague's DENNI TELEGRAF, Weiss sounds a 
cautiously optimistic note concerning the coalition's future. 
"We do not consider ourselves defeated in advance," he says, 
"and are not pessimists. Quite the contrary, we see a realistic 
chance in this lineup of being able to play at least a drawn 
game with the HZDS." And when he describes the strategy that the 
coalition is adopting as its own, Weiss echoes Fuelle's point 
about close relations among coalition parties that favor 
compromise solutions and about approximating Western models. The 
coalition, he stresses, is taking "the path of normal 
cooperation among political parties patterned after those that 
exist in the West. Precisely therein lies the alternative to 
populist and excessively nationalist policies, to 
confrontational and intransigent policies, to the policy of 
searching for an enemy," which he ascribes to the Meciar regime. 
  In contrast to Fuelle and Weiss, Slovak journalist and 
political analyst Egon T. Lansky views the coalition's prospects 
with pessimism. In the Prague English-language weekly newspaper 
PROGNOSIS of 31 March, Lansky reviews the events leading to the 
mid-March negotiations formation of the Moravcik government and 
concludes that, in spite of all appearances, the opposition to 
Meciar remains internally divided. This, Lansky argues, is the 
result of instability and confusion that has plagued Slovak 
politics "since the Communists turned capitalists" in 1989. Ever 
since that time, the Slovak political scene has been 
characterized by "complete lack of both political vision and 
distinguished personalities." Consequently, attempts at 
presenting a realistic political program for the country have 
been frustrated. It is doubtful, Lansky continues, whether one 
can expect a turn to the better now. While the anti-Meciar 
forces have finally been able to form a unified front, he 
writes, "uniting against Meciar is not enough" and, what is 
worse, the old "divisions and animosities" still seem to 
persist. "The lines dividing communists and anticommunists, 
nationalists and democrats (the few there are), as well as 
ultranationalists, Catholic nationalists, and less nationalist 
nationalists, often run across rather than between political 
groups," even for the Hungarians, "whom everyone needs" but with 
whom "few want to cooperate." Considering this "irrationality of 
Slovak politics," Lansky holds out little hope for the success 
of the coalition government. He sees no real possibility of 
reaching what Fuelle calls "additional compromises" and thus for 
the emergence of a stabilizing political center. "Chances are," 
he writes, "that even new elections will not bring a decisive 
change toward a stable, more democratic, and, above all, viable 
government." Slovakia after the elections, he adds, is likely to 
have "a weak government that is incapable of tackling the 
serious social and economic problems "--or Meciar could possibly 
return to power. Faced with these alternatives, Lansky admits 
that he is "not sure" which of the two "is worse."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy </F>
Prime Minister Roman Kovac by Robert Matejovic; place and date 
not given: "Are We Going to Cut Ourselves Off From the European 
Future?"] 
  [Text] On 23 April there will be a merging congress of the 
Alliance of Democrats of the Slovak Republic and the Platform 
for Political Realism. Following the congress, a new political 
entity should be established--the Democratic Union of Slovakia. 
We are going to discuss with Slovak Prime Minister Moravcik and 
Deputy Minister Roman Kovac certain aspects that proceeded this 
process. Both men also represent the leadership of the Platform 
of Political Realism. 
  [Matejovic] Both entities are supporting liberal ideas. Why 
is the new party not going to assume a name like the Liberal 
Party or the National Liberal Party? What is the Democratic 
Union of Slovakia? 
  [Moravcik] We have been contemplating for a long time what 
name to give to the newly established political entity. We have 
based our considerations on the fact that liberalism may not 
have strong traditions in Slovakia but is needed because it 
corresponds, to a certain extent, to the centrist thinking of 
the Slovaks who do not like extreme positions. We were afraid, 
however, that, if we called the entity "Liberal Party," people 
would not understand us. We want to convince people by 
implementing our policy program and not impress them by our 
name. We believe that in Slovakia we still have to constantly 
stress the democratic nature of the institutions we establish 
and that they are in harmony with the liberal program. This is 
why we, too, had to put the adjective "democratic" in the name 
of our union. 
  [Kovac] We have founded the Democratic Union of Slovakia as 
a party of the center. We were slightly inspired by the French 
Democratic Union that developed, after several years, into a 
loose confederation of liberally oriented parties. Our original 
idea was to provide a space for an association of parties that 
would act as a union externally but internally would keep the 
structure of individual parties. We are open to fusion with 
other parties. 
  [Matejovic] To what extent can the post-November syndrome 
based on political entities, which were established as various 
movements or unions involving a wide spectrum of opinions, pose 
a threat to the prospects of Slovak liberalism? Even the name 
of your organization indicates that this is an association of 
liberal streams and not a party that is a full and clear 
crystallization of the intensifying liberal tends in Slovak 
policy.... 
  [Moravcik] I believe that the threat you indicated does not 
stem from the name of our party but from other facts. We have 
to eliminate it by presenting a clear orientation of our program 
that will be consistently implemented. The name "union" shows 
that all of the streams in the center should unite because they 
are scattered. We will try to persuade small parties to join us. 
  [Matejovic] In the subconsciousness of the people, you are 
anti-Meciarites, who lay stress on the education and awareness 
of the nation. 
  [Kovac] We have adopted the idea that educated people make 
an educated nation, which is very important, particularly for 
young people. Our concern is not to secure a large quantity of 
educated and qualified people but, rather, to properly evaluate 
their work. We are also embracing the idea that, in the 21st 
century, the most important ownership will be intellectual 
ownership, knowledge, and skills. If we do not set up this trend 
now and if the Slovak nation does not understand it now, we are 
bound to cut ourselves off from the European future. 
  [Matejovic] Hagyari's Democratic Party is exerting efforts 
to establish something similar.... 
  [Moravcik] I do not believe we are in a situation where we 
need to make it clear, as regards the Democratic Party, what the 
domain of our joint actions are. Their program is conservative, 
ours is liberal. 
  [Matejovic] Apart from the Democratic Union of Slovakia, the 
Hungarian Civic Party is also supporting liberal ideas. This 
party has already become a member of the Liberal International. 
What kind of cooperation is there between the Slovak and the 
Hungarian liberals? 
  [Moravcik] So far, we have not established contacts. I 
personally believe it is very important for the Hungarian 
political parties in Slovakia to integrate or at least cooperate 
more closely with the Slovak parties that have a similar 
program. It makes little sense to organize parties on the 
ethnic principle. 
  [Kovac] Much will depend on what position the Hungarian 
Civic Party takes on the proposed triple coalition of Hungarian 
parties. We will certainly cooperate with liberals from the 
ranks of ethnic minorities. Among them, the Sub-Carpathian 
Germans are the closest to us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Economy Minister Peter Magvasi by Alica </F>
Strbava; place and date not given: "A Ministry of Not Only 
State-Owned Enterprises"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Strbava] Let us speak about 
the problems of arms industry conversion. During his visit to 
Israel, the defense minister was informed about the conversion 
of Israeli arms factories, which was completed within five 
years. We are in the fourth year of the conversion of Slovak 
enterprises, and many of them still have enormous problems. 
What alternatives do these enterprises have? 
  [Strbava] First, we have to say that, in Slovakia, we have 
never introduced arms industry conversion; we simply stopped our 
production. I believe this to be a nonsystemic solution to a 
nonsystemic decision. For natural reasons, the role of the 
state in that sphere is still understood as paternalistic. It 
is true that, everywhere in the world, the state has its say in 
arms production. This production is not regulated by free market 
mechanisms but is subject to the laws of a controlled and 
regulated market. We have not adopted methods of developed 
economies but have succumbed to the pressure of social groups. 
Projects that were expected to compensate for the shock from 
conversion--I stress, these projects were not conversion 
projects--required a lot of capital. Because of the recession 
and imperfect entrepreneurial plans that were drafted under time 
pressure and according to antiquated ideas, many restructuring 
projects were made ad hoc, putting many enterprises in a 
situation where they lack capital. This is, in fact, the root 
of our situation today. As a result of this brutal 
intervention, teams of top experts vanished. They asserted 
themselves in small businesses, which is good, but this cannot 
compensate for our losses in large and complex factories. 
Jacok, when he wanted to sort out problems in the Chrysler 
company, hired a team of top managers, whom he had to overpay. 
  [Strbava] What will be the solution? Are you considering 
the possibility that the Slovak Republic or its arms factories 
could join the [Czech] RDP Group? 
  [Magvasi] It is a big plus that [Czech] enterprises were 
able to establish a joint group and find a common language. 
Among the Slovak enterprises, there are disintegration trends, 
and companies are fighting for the leading place instead of 
making efforts to join forces. 
  [Strbava] The management of many arms factories is against 
the entry of foreign capital. They are rather drafting projects 
for the privatization of enterprises by shareholders' companies. 
They are willing to communicate with foreigners only after the 
enterprises are privatized. Therefore they require the creation 
of favorable conditions under which they want to privatize the 
enterprises. At the same time, they extend the problems, demand 
debt write-offs, and reject dividing large production complexes 
into smaller units. Is that to our detriment? 
  [Magvasi] I do not fully agree with your statement that the 
management is against the entry of foreign capital. I rather 
believe that foreign capital is willing to enter only when the 
owner is clearly defined. For them, state ownership, 
particularly our way of understanding it, is a too vague 
ownership. That is the first thing. The second is: It is true 
what you have said that general conditions should be 
established that would make the situation clear and tell us 
which procedures we should adopt. In Martin, we partially 
succeeded in doing it. It has become evident that establishing 
four enterprises from the former Turcianske Teplice Engineering 
Works by the end of 1992--and making their situation clear--was 
one of our good steps. That is, dividing large enterprises into 
smaller ones is a way we should go. By changing the political 
system, we want to change ownership relations and install the 
plurality of ownership relations. Under such circumstances, 
privatization has a slightly different function, such as finding 
an owner who has the best entrepreneurial plans. This is why 
the privatization process must be very comprehensible and must 
be made public. We have to have clear information on it and 
must accept the fact that we will not be able to satisfy 
everyone. If one group is unsuccessful in one project, it should 
try another one. Our weakness is that we concentrate on one 
thing and, if we fail, we lament our failure. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jiri Leschtina: "Where Are the Limits of </F>
Vaclav Klaus's Euroskepticism?"] 
  [Text] Vaclav Klaus's failure to attend the Litomysl 
banquet involving seven presidents was yet another caustic 
demonstration of the prime minister's skepticism toward 
intellectual debates on the subject of European integration. 
Every manifestation of skepticism is, in principle, an example 
of a discerning point of view, as long as it does not go beyond 
a certain limit. Where is the prime minister's limit? 
  Vaclav Klaus's profound mistrust of any kind of 
supranational 
institutions, full of bureaucrats who would like to dictate a 
new international discipline, is undoubtedly well founded. No 
matter what European habits and customs are today and no matter 
what European public opinion, which has been evolving for 
centuries, is, the road toward a united, supranational Europe 
will still be a long one, if we ever reach the end of it. 
  Critical skepticism in this regard may only be to the 
benefit 
of the situation. As the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset 
pointed out: "I do not recall that any civilization has ever 
succumbed to a paroxysm of doubt." And from where else but our 
country, endowed with its rich experience of cheap 
internationalism, should the most frequent critical and caustic 
remarks against the "Brussels visionaries" come? 
  Even the most pertinent skepticism, however, must steer 
clear 
of pointless eccentricity. Klaus's Euroskepticism is evidently 
inspired by the British mistrust of becoming too bogged down by 
European structures, a mistrust whose apostle is Margaret 
Thatcher. Her coolness toward any form of international 
affiliation, however, is born of the Briton's traditional 
insular peevishness and about whom it is claimed, half in jest, 
that his often affected inclination toward little animals comes 
from what he has put aside from his contacts with other people. 
  It would be rather absurd, however, if the prime minister of 
a small country in Central Europe, where no nation can simply 
"dance only to the beat of its own drum," were to endorse a 
similar level of isolationism. 
  It is not just that, in essence, the companionable Bohemians 
and Moravians will never be such full-blooded adherents of the 
British style of "splendid isolation." The indications that 
Klaus's cool attitude toward Brussels and his comments about the 
"unfairness" of the NATO air strikes against Serb positions have 
aroused unexpected interest from Russia are far more serious. 
  Some of our government officials have explained away the 
recent unanticipated invitation to Vaclav Klaus to make a state 
visit to Russia by saying that Moscow would like to find a 
kindred spirit in the Czech prime minister as far as its 
schizophrenic attitude toward Western Europe is concerned. 
There was even a sharp exchange of views at the extraordinary 
government session, during which some members of Klaus's Cabinet 
somewhat hysterically recommended that the prime minister not go 
anywhere. In the end, Klaus himself had to rid Chernomyrdin of 
all his false illusions when he declared categorically in Moscow 
that politics will not be discussed now because "business" is on 
the agenda. 
  Nevertheless, for us to circumvent the Kremlin's dubious 
"attachment" in the future, it would be far better if the prime 
minister would limit his natural Euroskepticism, first and 
foremost, to criticism of the unrealistic ideas about the 
foreseeable unification of Europe. And, as an advocate of 
traditional bilateral diplomacy, he should declare clearly that 
none other than Kohl's (or, after the elections, Scharping's?) 
Germany is our closest partner on our incontrovertible road 
toward the European Union. 
  So far, however, the government has made no attempt to find 
a 
cure for the understandable German traumas that persist among 
our public. Out of an obvious fear of losing popularity, Vaclav 
Klaus and other coalition politicians have left the political 
field here to the opposition, which is shamelessly playing an 
anti-German card. 
  Today, however, Germany is a scrupulously democratic state 
that is an inspiration for us in many things. There is much to 
encourage us and much to learn, for example, from the way the 
Germans bore, calmly and honorably, the postwar catastrophe and 
from how they managed energetically to come to terms with its 
terrible aftermath. 
  For this reason, it would be fitting for Vaclav Klaus to 
stand up, with Mrs. Thatcher's courage and sarcasm, not only to 
the anonymous bureaucrats in Brussels, but also to the still 
burning issue of the Sudeten Germans, which the Bonn government 
would also like to sweep definitively from the table.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Kocarnik, finance minister and deputy </F>
prime minister, by Jan T. Vavra; place and date not given: 
"EBRD Must Help in High Risk Regions"] 
  [Text] The annual meeting of the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) was to outline the role of 
the bank in the future. Most states are not satisfied with its 
operation so far. The Czech Republic was represented at the 
meeting by Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik, whom we asked for an 
interview. 
  [Vavra] How did the Czech Republic and the other countries 
assess the operation of the EBRD? 
  [Kocarnik] Of course, the assessment of the operation of the 
EBRD was marked by the election of Jacques de Larosiere as new 
president. All central bank governors and other representatives 
of individual countries expressed full support for him in his 
efforts to transform the bank and introduce a cutback program 
(salaries and expenditures freeze). We expect J. de Larosiere 
to give the EBRD a new face. 
  Personally, I was very critical in assessing the operation 
of 
the bank, particularly in the sphere of small and medium-scale 
business. Last year, for instance, we agreed on certain measures 
in this sphere, which, unfortunately, have not been implemented. 
This theme remains topical. 
  [Vavra] What basic goals have been set for the future? 
  [Kocarnik] We were asked to table the main ideas regarding 
the future orientation of the bank. The main change should be 
that the EBRD will approach the solution of the problem of 
support for business much more intensively and in cooperation 
with the domestic banks. 
  [Vavra] Have you made any demands on the EBRD? 
  [Kocarnik] First, I expressed the wish that the EBRD 
participate much more in the actual industrial sphere than in 
banking. We do not need it to enter our banks. The EBRD was 
founded to take on a certain part of the risk in the 
transforming countries rather than to enter problem-free 
institutions. 
  It also came up in the discussion that the EBRD selected 
approximately 25 of our medium or larger enterprises on which it 
intends to work. I believe that these enterprises are the 
optimum ones for the first entry of a bank, and they correspond 
to our ideas.

<F P=106> [Article by Josef Michl: "United States and Israel Are in </F>
the Game for Participation in the Production of Czech Military 
Aircraft"] 
  [Text] On the occasion of a reception for Israeli members 
of parliament on 8 April, Defense Minister Baudys publicly 
announced the possibility of cooperation between the Czech 
Republic and Israel in the sphere of arms industry. At the same 
time, he said in his report for CTK that it would be premature 
to speak about a specific form of cooperation. According to 
information obtained by RUDE PRAVO from reliable sources, the 
aforementioned cooperation could concern supplies of Israeli 
avionics for the light training and combat aircraft L-159 
developed by Aero Vodochody Co. This aircraft, in addition to 
use by the Czech Army, should succeed in the U.S. and Australian 
markets and the markets of the European NATO member countries. 
In fact, this cooperation would be just a continuation of the 
cooperation with the Israeli firm Elbit that is participating by 
supplying military equipment in the production of L-59 aircraft, 
a contract on the delivery of 36 pieces of which was signed with 
Thailand. 
  Aero Vodochody Director Zdenek Chalupnik told RUDE PRAVO on 
20 April that the observation regarding the supplies for the 
L-159 by the firm Elbit is "only a small part of information." 
"Of the approximately nine offers," he continued, "we have 
short-listed three, and no further selection has been done so 
far." He admitted at the same time that Elbit is on this short 
list of firms that are capable of satisfying the demands from 
the Army of the Czech Republic and added that the other two 
firms are from the United States. Moreover, he confirmed that 
one of them is the Rockwell International Corporation. 
  According to the RUDE PRAVO findings, this corporation 
showed 
great interest in the production of the Czech military aircraft, 
as testified by its letters to Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
and Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, in which it 
appeals to the Czech representatives to seriously consider its 
initiative, with due attention to the prestige of the firm and 
the contacts to which it can provide access. It submitted a 
detailed official offer of cooperation to the management of Aero 
Vodochody last February. In it, the U.S. corporation provides 
information on the objectives and conditions of the proposed 
joint venture that would concern an exclusive partnership in the 
sale of the L-159 aircraft on the world markets, avionics 
supplies, teamwork in the modernization of the aircraft for use 
within the framework of NATO, assistance in providing credits, 
and cooperation in the development of the Czech fighter aircraft 
of the next generation. Subcontractors from Great Britain and 
Italy are taking part in the bid of the U.S. manufacturer. 
  The Aero Vodochody company conducted its own preliminary 
comparison of the two bids. The results RUDE PRAVO managed to 
obtain indicate the superiority of the Rockwell bid. The 
internal material of Aero specifically states that the markets 
to which Rockwell promises to introduce the Czech military 
aviation production will not be, as opposed to the limited 
possibilities of the Israeli company, limited by political 
concerns and risks. The material describes the worldwide 
reputation of Rockwell as excellent, and it refers in the same 
manner to the firm's technical, marketing, and information 
possibilities and results and the offered financial assistance 
by means of its own credit company and commercial banks. It 
emphasizes its possibilities in the training of technicians, 
providing top-quality avionics, software, and NATO logistics, 
and especially notes that Elbit does not have such 
possibilities. The offer of exclusive cooperation in selling 
L-159 in the world markets is noted (while the possibilities of 
the Israeli company are limited in this respect to Singapore, 
India, and Australia) and the firm's own production potential, 
while Elbit must purchase a large quantity of equipment from 
other manufacturers. 
  Consultations by RUDE PRAVO with industry and military 
experts in aviation give rise to certain doubts regarding the 
orientation toward Israeli supplies also from the vantage point 
of the future market for Czech military aircraft production, 
particularly with respect to the desirable compatibility with 
the NATO standards and the conceivable application in the armies 
of the North Atlantic Alliance member states. Because of the 
significance of the matter, Chalupnik refuses to provide 
official information regarding the scope of individual bids, but 
he considers them approximately equal. At the same time, he 
points out the necessity for speedy processing of the concept of 
restructuring the Army and setting priorities in the development 
of military production. "We are waiting," he said in a 
telephone conversation with a RUDE PRAVO correspondent, "for the 
establishment of that program (L-159 production). We are waiting 
for the decision. Of course, to the extent of some hundred 
million korunas, we are working on the preparations so that, 
when the time comes, we can start at full speed. It will have 
Western-type avionics, corresponding to NATO standards, and the 
selection process has not been concluded. Period."

  [Text] [Announcer] Poland finds itself in a lucky period, 
where there are no real threats, Jerzy Milewski, the deputy 
minister of national defense, said at a specially organized 
discussion meeting at the National Defense Ministry [MON] on 
Polish defense policy. 
  Another participant in the discussion, Andrzej Karkoszka, a 
department director in MON, pointed at the danger for Europe 
that ensues from conflicts of the so-called old type--that is, 
national, ethnic, and religious ones. In his opinion, hopes to 
prevent such conflicts should be attached with UN and CSCE 
actions. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified official] Poland cannot 
build its own security around its borders on its own. Poland 
must base this security upon a broader system: from the global 
one, through the regional--that is, the continental one--to a 
subregional one. We know that every greater conflict in Europe 
rolled across Poland or involved Poland, and vice versa. We 
hope that our security, in connection with the above, will be 
linked to that broader security. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] The small budget of the Defense Ministry was 
pointed out in the discussion. It was recalled that an average 
Pole pays 10 times less for defense than a German citizen. 
Asked if Poland can afford to modernize its Armed Forces, which 
would help give us full NATO membership, Minister Milewski 
replied: 
  [Begin Milewski recording] There are no defined requirements 
by the NATO side concerning the size of our defense budget. On 
the other hand, we know the size of the financial burden carried 
by societies in countries that are current NATO members. We 
believe that, if 3 percent of the gross national product is 
assigned for the Polish Republic's defense budget, and if we 
have some sort of an assurance that this figure will be 
maintained in the next five to 10 years, we will find that such 
an amount, albeit a minimal one, will be sufficient to meet our 
aims. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 25 Apr--The miners are intensifying their 
strike action, reducing deliveries of lignite to power stations, 
Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol reported at a news 
conference today. He noted that for three days now he has been 
inviting the protesting miners for talks with representatives of 
the government and the employers, and he is awaiting their 
response. The department is not setting any preconditions, 
Minister Pol declared. 
  The minister reported that Decision No. 30 [setting up 
holding companies] of 23 March has not been in force since its 
suspension by the department. According to him--and the trade 
union confederations are aware of this--an unconditional 
annulment of Decision No. 30 could be perceived as an indication 
that nothing will change in the sector for many years to come. 
"I do not want to give such an indication because that would 
mean that the attempt to carry our reform in this sector has 
failed," Pol said, adding that the organizational structures in 
the lignite mining sector are based on obsolete legal 
provisions, while decisions about the functioning of the 
industry are still being made by the central administration. 
  It seemed to us, the minister stressed, that, during our 
earlier talks with the trade unions and employers, we had 
reached a consensus on the general form of transformations in 
the lignite sector. "I would be willing to use the word `annul' 
if the unions expressed their readiness to get down to talks and 
their will to carry out structural transformations," he added. 
  Minister Pol denied rumors that restructuring will mean 
redundancies. "No one is going to eliminate jobs in the lignite 
mining industry because it is the source of generating the 
cheapest energy in Poland," he said. He also added that no 
other work enterprises have the two-year employment stability 
guarantee received by this sector. 
  Asked by a PAP journalist whether the minister knows the 
contents of the letter from the striking miners to Prime 
Minister Pawlak, in which the miners maintain that any further 
correspondence between them and the department is pointless, Pol 
said he learned about the letter from the media. 
  Pol reported that, although the current power generation 
factor is 20, no exports of electric power have been stopped 
because this would incur very high contractual penalties. On 
the other hand, for several hours now, we have been importing 
electric power from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary 
within the so-called natural exchange, which means that we will 
have to return this power in the future. 
  Jerzy Tabaka, director of the National Power Control Center, 
told the journalists that, under the current power-generation 
factor of 20, some work enterprises will have to reduce their 
electricity intake by powering down installations that are not 
directly involved in their production processes. "The national 
power system is operating without reserves," he added.

  [Text] Lublin, 25 Apr--Sejm Deputy Izabella Sierakowska, 
deputy chairwoman of the Social Democracy of the Polish 
Republic, said at a news conference in Lublin on 25 April that 
the present strikes organized by Solidarity are political. 
  Sierakowska said: "The government is taking steps, wants to 
negotiate, and does negotiate, and I think that a typical 
political struggle is now taking place. Any blow against the 
power sector, the linchpin of the economy, amounts to a real 
tragedy. We are already importing electricity, and a situation 
may arise whereby some power-generating sets will never work 
again, and what will happen to the people working there? 
  "The wages in the power sector are very high, and extremely 
good social benefits, to which any other professional group is 
not entitled, are envisaged for people who may be sacked from 
this sector," Sierakowska said. She added that she is concerned 
about Mr. Krzaklewski's personal involvement and the fact that 
he keeps repeating: You must talk to me separately. "As it 
happens, Solidarity is just a trade union, like any other 
union," she said.

<F P=106> [Report compiled by "knysz": "Center for Research on Public </F>
Opinion--Confidence Fluctuations"] 
  [Text] The president and the police are losing 
confidence among the people. Meanwhile, the Army, television, 
and church continue to hold strong positions. 
  Both the president and the police have lost the confidence 
of 
8 percent of those people polled over the past month. The 
survey was conducted at the end of March, which was after our 
article on corruption in the Poznan police department appeared 
and after the president dismissed Marek Markiewicz from the post 
of chairman of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting 
Council. 
  Those who were polled also have somewhat less confidence 
than 
a month ago in the two trade unions--the All-Polish Trade Unions 
Agreement and Solidarity (a fall of 3 percent, but the change is 
within the statistical margin of error). 
  The confidence ratings of the Sejm, the senate, the 
government, the Army, television, and the church have not 
changed. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  The poll was conducted on 23-29 March, utilizing a random,

  [Text] Warsaw, 24 Apr--The merger of the Democratic Union 
and the Liberal Democratic Congress was the only logical 
solution for our parties, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, chairman of the 
Freedom Union [UW], said on Sunday at the first news conference 
held by the new party. 
  Commenting on the fact that Jacek Kuron refused to be a 
candidate for the leadership of the new party, Mazowiecki 
expressed his regret. "I know that the comments on this matter 
will be unfavorable. I tried to persuade him to put his 
candidacy forward, but he did not want to do it. However, this 
fact does not change our respect for Jacek Kuron," he emphasized. 
  When asked whom the Freedom Union would support in the 
presidential elections, he said that the UW would definitely not 
support a candidate of the Democratic Left Alliance or the 
Polish Peasant Party, and that the attitude of the UW towards 
the present president was critical. He stressed that, for the 
time being, his party would not comment on the matter "in order 
not to attract any blows. However, the time will come when we 
shall make a statement." 
  It is not yet known what the logo of the new party will be. 
It has only been established that it will be blue.

  [Text] Warsaw, 24 Apr--The congress of the Freedom Union 
adopted a resolution today that says the process of rebirth of 
the state and its economy, initiated in 1989, is under threat. 
The congress obliged the party authorities to prepare a strategy 
for "the second step along the road of reforms in Poland." 
  The national congress found essential the earliest possible 
setting up of specialized secretariats to analyze the situation 
in particular spheres of social and economic life. "Their joint 
task would be to formulate the strategy of the second step along 
the road of reforms in Poland and winning its allies' and social 
partners' support for it," the resolution reads. 
  People heading these secretariats would constitute a sort of 
"shadow cabinet."

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Prime Minister on Economic Growth; </F>
PSL Chief Council Session"] 
  [Text] On 23 April the Chief Council of the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL] spoke out in favor of a treaty concluded 
between Poland and the Holy See in 1993. The council also 
expressed its conviction that the June elections to gmina [small 
administrative units] councils will be the most important 
political event that will enable the establishment of 
representative authorities for the next four years. Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak informed the meeting's participants 
that the inflation level did not exceed 5 percent in the first 
quarter of this year, which means it was the lowest level in 
seven years. During the same time frame, output rose by 10 
percent. 
  The resolution states that the concordat regulates relations 
between two subjects of international law--that is, Poland and 
the Vatican--by defining general rules for cooperation between 
church and state. Aleksander Bentkowski reminded the 
participants that, in the document, both parties recognized each 
other's internal legal provisions and obliged themselves to 
respect those provisions. The resolution regarding the document 
was adopted by an overwhelming majority of votes, and it was 
also stressed that the PSL regards it as harmful to introduce 
disputes on the concordat into political campaigns and that that 
is why the council spoke in favor of an accelerated rate of 
proceedings to ratify the concordat. 
  "The economic indicators are optimistic, and, from an 
economic standpoint, the situation is quite good," the prime 
minister said. In the opinion of the government's chief, after 
an analysis of wages and salaries in the first quarter, there 
are no reasons for concern. As Pawlak reported, wages and 
salaries in March rose by about 14 percent and 8.8 percent, 
without taking into account salaries from profit [not further 
specified]. "And we should keep in mind that, in terms of time, 
March is 12 percent longer than February," the prime minister 
stressed. 
  W. Pawlak expressed his hope that talks will be initiated 
between the government and the striking miners, and that the 
problem will be solved to the employees' advantage.

<F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "Salons and Jeans"] </F>
  [Text] "How to live with the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL], our coalition partner, and how to get rid of the snouts 
of the `liberals'"--these topics were discussed during the 23 
April session by the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic 
[SdRP]. 
  The delegates declared their loyalty to the PSL members, and 
they expect the PSL to respond in kind. 
<H5>  We Demand Loyalty </H5>
  "Waldemar Pawlak wants deputy prime ministers to execute the 
government's policies, not to cocreate them. He regards the 
Council of Ministers' Economic Committee as a forum for 
discussion, the decisions of which can be changed without 
reason," Sejm Deputy Marek Borowski, former deputy prime 
minister and finance minister, fulminated during the SdRP 
session. "One must define with precision who is responsible for 
what in this government. This is not a coalition but a case of 
PSL domination." 
  Borowski added that the "hesitant" PSL is also to blame for 
Lech Walesa's successes in his little games with the government. 
He also admonished his colleagues from the Sejm deputies club 
for creating a "joyous legislative legacy" and for lack of 
discipline during votes. This time, Borowski said, the 
disciplined PSL should be an example to follow. 
  "The SdRP, while expressing its respect for agreements that 
have been signed and loyalty and understanding vis-a-vis the 
coalition partner, expects the same from the partner," the 
convention's resolution reads. 
<H5>  Rakowski's Attack </H5>
  Journalists expected fights between the party "liberals" and 
"social democrats." They were hoping for a Kwasniewski-Rakowski 
polemic exchange, especially given Rakowski's article published 
in POLITYKA, in which he mercilessly attacked the SdRP leader 
and party policies. Rakowski wrote that "social democrats are 
wearing liberals' pants" and that they want "capitalism with a 
human face." Rakowski's suspicion is that some SdRP leaders 
would prefer to be supported by entrepreneurs than by workers. 
He expressed his indignation at "social democrats' active 
participation in the building of capitalism in Poland"--he means 
Privatization Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek--and at the "we want to 
be in NATO" demands. Rakowski accuses the leaders of having 
abandoned the "It doesn't have to be that way anymore" slogan 
after the elections, and he is critical of Kwasniewski for his 
confession that he feels closer to the Democratic Union than to 
the PSL. 
  Many other party members have similar views to those of 
Rakowski. They call themselves "Millerists" (meaning they are 
supporters of Leszek Miller), as opposed to the liberal 
"Aleksandrists." 
  While not making any references to Rakowski's article, 
Kwasniewski engaged in polemics with Rakowski and the 
"Millerists": "The SdRP must fight for economic development. It 
would be a tragedy if left-wing rule were to bring to mind 
inflation, economic chaos, and breach of ties to international 
institutions." He added that "there are no miracles": there is 
no way that promises can be fulfilled all at once--for instance, 
elimination of the popiwek [wage-controlling legislation]. 
  Kwasniewski then disappeared along with Rakowski, and, when 
he returned, he ostentatiously hugged Rakowski. 
<H5>  Social Democrats' Grievances </H5>
  Only a few activists took the floor during the exchange 
because Kwasniewski made an appeal to his colleagues not to give 
journalists a reason to launch an attack on the SdRP. 
  "We were strengthening party unity at the expense of 
program-related debates," Waldemar Czajkowski, a delegate from 
Katowice, expressed his regrets. He speculated on the 
relationship between the views of some activists--for instance, 
on the issue of privatization--and a provision in the party 
statute saying that the SdRP is a party of democratic socialism. 
By saying this, he was definitely making a reference to 
Borowski, who had spoken out some time before that on the need 
to speed up privatization. 
  Ryszard Olow from Suwalki expressed his criticism of 
Kwasniewski's apology to the Solidarity groups: "I have no idea 
why the apology. Who will apologize to us for the four years, 
I'm asking?" He also demanded changes at the local level 
because all that has happened so far has been that politicians 
from Rozbraty (the SdRP's headquarters) moved to the Sejm 
building on Wiejska Street. 
<H5>  Unity in a Multitude </H5>
  Whereas in the main meeting hall the poor elocution by some 
Sejm deputies was debated, and delegates showed each other black 
and honey yellow briefcases they were given as gifts (malicious 
journalists have calculated the party spent over 60 million 
zlotys on the gifts), a livelier debate took place unofficially 
over glasses of beer: "Rakowski is right. Some members of the 
leadership are closer to salons than to people wearing workmen's 
jeans. We must be returning to the period of the Polish 
People's Republic. We must defend the people and the 
achievements of an economy on the basis of social criteria, and 
not just on a free market," one of the delegates told us. 
  "If it were not for Kwasniewski, we would no longer be here. 
We owe our election victory to him," another delegate was 
trying to convince me. He added that the SdRP leader is an 
efficient politician, a pragmatic person who knows economic 
realities and not a populist. He also expressed his praise for 
Kwasniewski for, among other things, the party's most recent 
success--that is, the announcement of introducing activists from 
the Democratic Left Alliance into the "Belweder ministries" 
(Defense, Foreign Affairs, and Internal Affairs). 
  The entire party leadership received a vote of confidence 
from the delegates. "This does not prove anything. It has 
always been the case here that one complains kind of 
unofficially, but when it comes right down to it, everybody 
raises his hands anyway," one of the delegates was trying to 
convince me.

  [Excerpt] Warsaw, 23 Apr--Opening the convention of the 
Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland [SdRP] in Warsaw on 
Saturday, party leader Aleksander Kwasniewski outlined its most 
important tasks: the stabilization of the state, economic 
development and integration with European structures on a 
partnership basis, decentralization, and self-government reform. 
  He said: We should understand Polish democracy as a 
democracy of compromise and not of conflict, as many of the 
president's advisers put it. The SdRP can be one of the authors 
of the new constitution. We must fight for economic 
development. It is inadmissable for left-wing governments to be 
associated with inflation and to lead to economic chaos. 
  Kwasniewski acknowledged that a positive aspect of the 
government coalition's activity had been the breaking of the 
stereotype that the coalition's creation would mean a departure 
from reforms and that it would continue Poland's international 
isolation. The government has been successful, according to the 
SdRP leader's assessment, in building a market economy, where 
economic actions are not isolated from social processes. 
  In the campaign before the local self-government elections 
and the struggle for authorship of the reforms, Kwasniewski 
expects the SdRP to be attacked by both the right wing and the 
central-liberal groupings, as well as by the media, whose 
attention is focused on the weaknesses and setbacks of his 
party. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski by Ewa Rosolak and </F>
Dariusz Szymczycha; place and date not given: "Wedding and 
Marriage Are Two Separate Things"] 
  [Text] [TRYBUNA] Is the leader of the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] as satisfied as he was on 19 September? 
  [Kwasniewski] Wedding and marriage are two separate things. 
Of course, the election victory gave us great satisfaction. We 
proved that there is a demand for the left wing in Poland and 
that, despite having been condemned to political nonexistence, 
we managed to present a rational program and people who are 
worthy of support. 
  [TRYBUNA] And the challenges that you have been facing did 
not reduce your satisfaction? 
  [Kwasniewski] Everything we have been facing since the 
elections is much harder and less pleasant than the campaign or 
the elections themselves. The SLD was faced with very specific 
and complicated problems, beginning with the formation of the 
coalition, maintaining very weak reforms, dealing with a very 
neglected social area, fighting unemployment, the poverty of 
many people, and changing inefficient ways of implementing 
social policies and privatization. 
  The SLD also had to prove that the contemporary Polish left 
wing not only is no threat to democracy but that it strengthens 
democracy, and we also had to prove that the victory by the SLD 
and the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] does not 
mean a return to the old system, undemocratic ways of ruling, 
and a centralized economy. 
  [TRYBUNA] Do you not think that the SdRP failed to consume 
the election success to a sufficient degree? 
  [Kwasniewski] I would like to separate these issues. I 
think it is quite natural and a consequence of democratic 
principles for a party that has won the elections to coform a 
government, its members becoming the ministers, and the party 
holding a dominating position in the state administration. And 
I reject all accusations that this amounts to booty sharing or 
fighting for posts. 
  In Poland, we must get used to victorious parties 
implementing their mandate after the elections, and the mandate 
is a consequence of the election results--these parties simply 
build their personnel structures and look for instruments that 
will allow them to act. In that sense, I do not think there is 
anything wrong with replacements at the posts of voivodes [local 
governmental officials] or in ministries, provided, of course, 
that these replacements are not purges. 
  The SLD approached the election results with great 
responsibility and deliberation. We are the kind of party that 
imposed limits on itself. I regard it to be a virtue and not 
some evidence of weakness or a mistake. The fact that we 
managed not to fight for the post of prime minister--to which we 
had a right--despite having won the elections, the fact that we 
did not demand specific numbers of ministers and deputy 
ministers in accordance with mathematical proportions but were 
rather guided by the candidates' skills and human values, not 
their party membership--I regard all that to be a virtue, as 
well. 
  [TRYBUNA] We used to say that Solidarity elites acted 
differently when in power and in the opposition. Can we not 
apply the same saying to the SLD and the SdRP? 
  [Kwasniewski] I think the problem of acting differently in 
the opposition and while in power is generally a big problem of 
the relationship between authorities and society in Poland. That 
problem is a huge burden left by a difficult historical legacy. 
  Today, there is a problem and a challenge at the same time: 
On the one hand, the question is how to be in power so that 
citizens are aware that they and their issues are at stake and 
not some incomprehensible ideas or values? On the other hand, 
the question is how to shape in Poland the kind of statehood 
awareness under which people would identify themselves with 
their own state, would respect the legal system, would be proud 
of living here and now, and would be able to defend their 
state's dignity in contacts with the outside world? 
  [TRYBUNA] To what extent have you, the SLD and the SdRP, 
changed by being in power? To what extent have you abandoned 
the earlier program principles? 
  [Kwasniewski] Right after the elections, people were being 
told that the election promises were not being fulfilled. I can 
see two problems here: The first is that many promises or 
program principles simply cannot be fulfilled immediately. And 
the other problem is that some of the promises were kind of 
imposed on us--they were not written down by us anywhere. We 
did not say that we will find the resources for some gigantic 
social programs as early as in the 1994 budget, and that is 
because we knew that the budget was going to be burdened with an 
enormous deficit and that there is no particular room for 
maneuver, unless the maneuver is to lead to a disaster or to a 
very short-term effect in the form of inflow of money, 
inflation, and a breakdown of public finances. 
  [TRYBUNA] What happened to the SLD's and the SdRP's 
left-wing nature at the time you assumed power? 
  [Kwasniewski] We have been trying to show and implement that 
left-wing nature in a very rational and sensible manner--first 
of all by establishing budget principles. We said outright that 
there can be no further cuts in expenditures borne by senior 
citizens, by the budget sphere, by science, culture, the 
educational system, and we also said that one must look for 
additional sources of revenue. We went in the direction that 
would definitely never have been chosen by liberal right-wing 
governments--that is, we increased taxes. 
  Second, we initiated a more determined fight against the 
so-called gray zone by setting in motion customs and financial 
mechanisms that are designed to cause an increased inflow of 
money to the budget. Third, we are in favor of comprehensive 
changes in social policies. These are clear signs of our 
left-wing nature. 
  [TRYBUNA] According to the SLD voters, what you have been 
doing can be described at most as building "capitalism with a 
human face." 
  [Kwasniewski] In my view, what we have been doing is 
attempting to build a social and economic system that will be 
efficient and competitive and that will bring money to implement 
social programs--and that is in essence the entire 
socialdemocratic or left-wing concept that can be put forward 
today. I am convinced that ideological issues are of lesser 
importance today. 
  Our left-wing nature should demonstrate itself through a 
modernization of the systems of social care and assistance and 
of the entire social policy, but, on the other hand--and this 
may sound very liberal--we must take care of economic 
development. I remind all those who are critical of us, 
including those who used to occupy high posts in the past in the 
Polish People's Republic, that Poland was in a state of crisis, 
going on for many years, which was due not just to Reagan's 
sanctions but also to inefficiencies in the economic system that 
was in effect in Poland, despite various attempts of economic 
reforms, which, even though they were quite bold at times, were 
eventually torpedoed as a result of various political disputes. 
  [TRYBUNA] As chairman of the SLD and the SdRP, are you not 
afraid that your parties will suddenly lose to the left wing, 
like, for instance, the Union of Labor? 
  [Kwasniewski] One can lose to the left wing or the right 
wing. I would not regard that as a determining factor, neither 
in our thinking nor in our actions, and that is because, in my 
view, much more serious issues are at stake in Poland right now. 
What is at stake is the strengthening democratic institutions, 
the establishment of an efficient economy that will help resolve 
the unemployment problem and will result in increased budgetary 
revenues for social programs. What is also at stake is Poland's 
integration into the European arrangement, based not on asking 
for mercy or various credits but on the principle of our being a 
significant participant of that arrangement. 
  [TRYBUNA] According to critics, the SdRP is not supported by 
any kind of basis but only by an unstable electorate. They also 
say that the party is lacking a class nature [klasowosc]. Do 
you agree with this accusation? 
  [Kwasniewski] I cannot see how anyone could agree with that. 
A system of social classes as described in textbooks is fading 
away. But the SdRP--and I am convinced of that--is a party of 
employees. Modern social democracy does not offer just the 
protection of social interests to employees. That function is 
fulfilled primarily by trade unions. A political party that 
wants to represent the interests of employees must secure 
economic development and social justice in the process of 
consuming the aforementioned development. 
  [TRYBUNA] You [left-wing activists] have always wanted to 
join the Socialist International. What chances does the SdRP 
have now? 
  [Kwasniewski] I think there is an enormous opportunity in 
that regard. The stereotype perception of Poland is changing. 
There is nobody around anymore to say that, in Poland, the 
so-called postcommunist left wing has no social support. There 
is nobody to say that we are in favor of restitution of the old 
system and that we are not making efforts to adapt ourselves to 
democracy and a free market. 
  I also think that there is currently nobody in the West who 
would have doubts that there are no hopes that a social 
democracy may be born out of such forces as the Democratic Union 
[UD]. In that sense, there is clearly an increasing interest in 
our participation in the Socialist International. I experienced 
much to confirm this--for instance, during my talks in Spain, 
Norway, and Germany, and also in Budapest and Bratislava. I 
have faith that our case will finally be settled during a 
congress in the spring of next year. 
  I think the issue is of mutual interest. The International 
must have serious partners in East and Central Europe if it 
wants to avoid being pushed into the margin by the right wing. 
We also have an interest here because I think the maturity of 
many Western left-wing parties makes it possible to use their 
experiences. 
  [TRYBUNA] Two parties representing different interests and 
different types of voters form a coalition. According to many 
views, the coalition is quite chimerical. Why is that? 
  [Kwasniewski] A coalition is always a difficult creation 
because it is formed by partners with different experiences, 
expectations, and programs. That must be said outright. I know 
of no coalition in the world that would be free of conflict. 
  It is a misunderstanding, which is sometimes spread in 
society, to view the current problems of the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] and the SLD as having their sources in the old 
relations between the Polish United Workers Party and the United 
Peasant Accord. It is just a myth. We are dealing with 
different parties now, different leaderships, and a completely 
different generation of activists, who, in many cases, do not 
even remember the old days. 
  Of course, our partner's temperament and ways of action are 
quite different from ours. These are definitely issues that 
make life difficult, but they are not insurmountable. 
  One must say in all honesty that both sides are only shaping 
their place and position in this relationship on the basis of 
common sense and conviction. 
  [TRYBUNA] A view is prevalent that there is "original sin" 
lying at the basis of the current complicated relationship 
inside the coalition. What was that sin about? Was that when 
the individual members of the government were appointed? Was 
it your statement concerning UD [that the SLD is closer to UD 
than to the PSL]? Or was it that you gave up trying to win the 
post of prime minister? 
  [Kwasniewski] In my view, the SLD imposed a limit on itself. 
It made a decision on offering the prime ministerial post to the 
PSL, and we were right in doing so. We were eager for this 
government to be based on a majority, and we succeeded. I 
definitely think the attempt by our partner to act through 
accomplished facts was not too fortunate at a point when the 
government's composition was not yet settled. As far as my 
statement on UD is concerned, perhaps that was not too 
fortunate, but... 
  I think that, given the real arrangement of forces in 
parliament after the elections, only the SLD had the opportunity 
to form a coalition--with either the PSL or UD. Both coalitions 
could have been based on majorities. But it turned out very 
quickly that UD is not ready for that and is not capable of 
implementing such an idea after its election defeat.... 
  I see no reason for the SLD, for instance, to choose just 
one 
partner currently. It is quite natural in politics to cooperate 
loyally with your coalition partner, but there are valves open 
also for others. The PSL also has such open valves. 
  [TRYBUNA] Political stability is a dream of society and of 
representatives of elites. What is currently the greatest 
danger to that stability? 
  [Kwasniewski] Given the unique chance that Poland has, the 
dangers are inside ourselves, and they are also a consequence of 
the inability to find compromise solutions and of a lack of 
persistence. 
  The world has shrunk enormously. Those people count the most 
who are able to introduce the biggest amount of the interesting 
and the effective into this whole arrangement of political and 
economic relationships. I think it would be bad if we were to 
lose the chance among disputes and selfishness. Selfishness is 
what I fear the most. 
  [TRYBUNA] What is your position on the "Kwasniewski for 
president" idea, which has been appearing more and more often 
and which is confirmed by approval expressed in public opinion 
polls? 
  [Kwasniewski] I am happy because of that. But, to be 
honest, in my view, the issue of presidential elections should 
not appear in serious political debates before the end of this 
year. The SLD has not made a decision on the issue, and neither 
have I. 
  [TRYBUNA] We thank you for the conversation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Janusz Goscinski of the Warsaw </F>
University Administration Faculty by correspondent Ryszarda 
Socha; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Socha] Professor Dariusz Rosati [candidate for 
the vacant posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister] 
maintains that, during the past three months of the left-wing 
government, its policy line has been reoriented toward the goal 
of economic growth. Can we really discern such a change? 
  [Goscinski] Claims of having entered the path of economic 
growth were made even earlier that that, by Hanna Suchocka. I 
believe that talk about economic growth is an exaggeration, but 
it is fairly certain that we are no longer facing the threat of 
a recession, and there also are some signs of economic revival. 
Industrial output in February of this year was more than 10 
percent higher than in February of last year. Nevertheless, it 
was still lower than in February 1989. 
  [Socha] Even so, we can presumably take it for granted that 
recession has been overcome, can we not? 
  [Goscinski] We have had so many months of successive growth 
that it can be regarded as a definite tendency. However, in my 
opinion, for the time being this trend is based on weak 
foundations because there is an absence of significant 
investment. Present outlays on investment, in both the state and 
the private sector, do not even ensure simple reproduction. 
Consequently, the technical condition of enterprises 
deteriorates steadily and that does not bode well in the long 
run. We can expect an economic boost when outlays on investment 
begin to grow faster than production. 
  [Socha] Prof. Rosati presented the tenets of his 
socioeconomic policy in the national press. How do you view his 
concepts? Is their author the person who can provide the answer 
our economy currently needs? 
  [Goscinski] Let me tell you what I think in perfectly 
unequivocal terms: Of all the economists I know, Rosati is to 
all intents and purposes the only one who has recently presented 
a sensible proposal that will give a realistic chance for our 
economy. It is hard for me to ascertain whether his 
administrative talents would make him a good prime minister or 
minister. He has not yet had a chance to prove himself in such 
a way. In this, we are reminded of Leszek Balcerowicz before 
him: After all, Balcerowicz, who was also a practising 
academic, later demonstrated that he was also a good 
administrator. Rosati seems to resemble him in this aspect. 
This is not to say that I believe that Marek Borowski [recently 
dismissed finance minister] was a worse proposition, but I am 
still personally inclined to value Rosati more. 
  [Socha] What do you believe to be the strongest point of his 
blueprint? 
  [Goscinski] First of all, his emphasis on the need to 
invest. Second, the absence of a fiscal angle, which was, 
unhappily, demonstrated by all of the earlier deputy prime 
ministers responsible for the economy. Rosati is the fist one 
who says that there is no need to increase taxation. On the 
contrary, he says the opposite. This year nothing more can be 
done in this matter anyway. The budget is as it is. And, if 
the president fails to sign the budget, I believe the Sejm will 
find the strength to reject the president's veto by a majority 
of two-thirds of all votes. The state cannot function without a 
budget, and it is pointless to go on using interim solutions. 
However, if Rosati is able to put his plan into practice next 
year, a decrease in tax liabilities would be quite realistic. 
This would, in any case, be closely connected with tax 
concessions for investment projects. You cannot strangle the 
economy with the taxation noose and then expect people to be 
willing to invest. 
  [Socha] GAZETA WYBORCZA promotes the view, articulated in 
its columns by Janusz Jankowiak, that Rosati is opposed to 
Balcerowicz's ideas. 
  [Goscinski] I do not share this opinion. I believe that 
Rosati's program would reinforce the functioning of free market 
principles in the economy, counteract inflation, and, at the 
same time, promote economic growth. After all, Rosati would not 
start from the same point of departure as Balcerowicz: He would 
begin at a point long after the one where Balcerowicz stopped. 
  [Socha] It seems rather obvious that the new finance 
minister must take into account both the positive and the 
negative results of the decisions made by his predecessors. 
  [Goscinski] Precisely. After all, a crisis of the public 
finance system had already begun toward the end of Bielecki's 
administration and was manifested with full strength during the 
Suchocka government; after all, a budget deficit usually grows 
with the speed of an avalanche. Please compare the balance of 
the 1992, 1993, and 1994 budgets. You will see that the sum 
doubles each time, while the inflation rate is no more than 
30-odd percent. This means that the state's share in both public 
income and public expenditure keeps growing all the time. This 
is precisely the anti-Balcerowicz situation. However, it is not 
Dariusz Rosati or Marek Borowski that Mr. Balcerowicz should 
congratulate for this state of affairs: It is Suchocka and 
Osiatynski because it was they who created it. 
  [Socha] On the one hand, the average citizen keeps hearing 
about the new economic growth, so he naturally expects to see 
its effects influence the contents of his wallet, and, on the 
other, he keeps hearing about a "budgetary gap." He is made to 
pay ever higher taxes, while, at the same time, he is informed 
that there is not enough money in the kitty for hospitals, 
social welfare provisions, the upgrading of old age and 
disability pensions, the police, the Army, and virtually 
everything else. Consequently, many people ask themselves where 
their money really goes.... 
  [Goscinski] Here, as it happens, I would be inclined to 
agree with Janusz Korwin-Mikke [Union for Real Politics 
chairman]. The more the state takes from and redistributes 
among its citizens, the worse the consequences for the public. 
Public officials are really not best qualified to decide what 
our money should be spent on. Of course, we cannot count on the 
assumption that the public sector expenditure will increase in 
the coming years. On the contrary, it is inevitable that the 
public will be burdened with the requirement to pay for an 
increasing number of public services. The problem lies in the 
fact that, at the same time, we are forced to launch new schemes 
and ventures, which we cannot afford and which could perfectly 
well have been put on the back burner to await better times, 
such as the unfortunate brainchild of Suchocka's 
administration--that is, the creation of new districts. Just 
think how much money was sunk in that project. And what about 
each successive election campaign we have had? We know very 
well that trillions of zlotys [Z] were spent on them! And all 
in order to ensure that relations between individual power 
agencies were shaped in this or that way, according to the 
manipulators' intentions. The public has not benefited from any 
of that in any way. On the contrary, you could say that it is 
forced to meet the costs of the state's upkeep because the state 
does not know how to manage its resources.... 
  [Socha] The economy is nowadays regarded increasingly as a 
field for political maneuvering or even political skirmishes. 
To begin with, Deputy Prime Minister Borowski became a casualty 
of this state of affairs. Now, the president seems to have 
eliminated Rosati from the competition even before the start of 
the game.... 
  [Goscinski] It is not only the economy that is receiving 
such treatment--it is also the entire political system. A 
friend of mine from Canada asked me recently whether I saw even 
one true politician among all of the people involved in the 
discharge of power nowadays. I told him I did not--and he 
replied that he was fully in agreement with me. As he watched 
the situation from his distant position in Canada, for a short 
while after the 19 September [1993] election he pinned some 
hopes on Kwasniewski, who at that time was dubbed a likely 
"super prime minister." Unfortunately, Kwasniewski has shown 
himself to be a less than mediocre politician. After all, the 
Borowski affair began when Kwasniewski was absent on a visit to 
Davos. And immediately afterward, if I remember correctly, he 
went to Brussels, where he was as much use as a goat in a field 
of cabbage: just another deputy leading a group of delegates 
from his party's parliamentary caucus. Even as Borowski was 
offering to resign his post, he was convinced, in his political 
naivete, much as Clemenceau was in 1912, that his resignation 
would not be accepted and that he was actually holding everyone 
in check. The moves in these two political games were virtually 
identical. Kwasniewski returned from his trips abroad; he then 
assured reporters, who swarmed around him as he was leaving 
Pawlak's office, that everything was in order; then, in the 
evening, toward the end of the TV news program, Pawlak announced 
that he accepted Borowski's resignation. This was tantamount to 
a government crisis. However, at the same time, the Lillehammer 
Olympic games were starting--and, of course, Mr. Kwasniewski's 
attendance was absolutely indispensable there. So he left the 
whole mess behind and went to spend almost a week at 
Lillehammer. Surely this demonstrates complete political 
irresponsibility! Just imagine a situation where, in the face 
of the eruption of a major fire, the chief fire-fighting officer 
says: "I will attend to putting it out when I come back from my 
vacation." At that moment, Kwasniewski forever condemned 
himself in my eyes as a politician. If he had been president, 
the situation would have been just as bad as it is now with 
Walesa in that office. Neither one nor the other has the 
political imagination to visualize the consequences of his 
various political actions a week, a month, six months, or a year 
later. They just do not have what it takes to be a statesman. 
  [Socha] In view of the president's position, it would seem 
that there is not much point for the government coalition to go 
on insisting on Prof. Rosati's candidacy for the post of finance 
minister. 
  [Goscinski] Unless someone intends to provoke a deliberate 
conflict with the Belweder and use Rosati as a pretext. 
  [Socha] Even so, we should still regret if not the man, then 
his concept, which, if your prognoses were to come true, could 
bring us clear economic advantages. 
  [Goscinski] I believe that the president is actually 
interested in keeping the government as weak as possible. The 
stronger the government's social, economic, and political 
position, the more difficult it will be for Walesa to play his 
games with it. Whenever I hear anyone claim that what is at 
stake is Poland's interests or reasons of state, I cringe 
because it usually turns out that it is only someone's 
particular interests that are at stake. 
  [Socha] As I observe the number of sensible people who 
remain on the margins of political life and see that the 
supposed democratic mechanisms offer them no discernible 
support, I begin to fear more and more that we will either 
continue drifting in this way indefinitely or some compulsory 
shock therapy will have to be applied. 
  [Goscinski] THis is precisely what Lech Walesa is hoping 
for. In his eyes, such drifting--that is, indefinitely 
preventing a cohesive power apparatus from functioning 
properly--means that the only solution possible is an 
enlightened absolutism. 
  [Socha] But how many people would be inclined to see the 
embodiment of such "enlightened absolutism" in the person of 
Lech Walesa? 
  [Goscinski] I do not believe he realizes this. Politicians 
who are aware of their intellectual limitations are not 
particularly dangerous. The real danger is posed by those who 
are in love with themselves--and, which is worse, who 
reciprocate the sentiment! 
  [Socha] Professor, I keep returning stubbornly to economic 
issues. What happens to the economy when it is, as at present, 
left, so to speak, to its own devices? 
  [Goscinski] If it were left to its own devices, it would 
most probably not suffer too much damage, if I may say so. When 
that happens, the economy usually continues functioning, powered 
by the momentum of its own mechanisms. The problem is that, in 
our case, it is not left to its own devices. The other 
ministers in office keep up their activities, and each of them 
pulls in his own direction. You cannot say that there is no 
governmental intervention at all. But there is the absence of a 
conceptual center that would watch over the whole. And Prime 
Minister Pawlak does not have sufficient economic knowledge, 
which he would need to have if he were to discharge the role of 
the head of such a center, or that of a coordinator of our 
economic policy. 
  [Socha] Who, apart from Rosati, could possibly fill the 
existing vacancy to good effect? 
  [Goscinski] In my opinion, the vacancy will not be filled 
now. We will have to wait until the presidential election. 
And, if Walesa is reelected then, we will be justified in 
commiserating with one another. 
  [Socha] So it does not really matter at all who holds the 
posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister until then? 
  [Goscinski] The president is not interested in a strong 
government. He is interested in a good political arrangement 
with Pawlak because you just cannot fight everyone all the time. 
In his turn, Pawlak is not at all interested in having the 
economy run on behalf of the government by a good economist from 
the ranks of the the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], or found by 
the SLD. 
  [Socha] Is it because a good economist would make it 
difficult for him to fulfill the promises he made to his peasant 
electorate? 
  [Goscinski] Of course. There are rumors reaching us from 
Grzybowska Street--that is, the headquarters of the Polish 
Peasant Party [PSL]--that peasants are increasingly displeased 
with Pawlak. They come to the Food Industry Bank and say that 
they had been promised 8-percent-interest loans--that is, the 
cheapest possible--for the purchase of fertilizers. They had 
been promised Z1 million per hectare for this purpose, but 
apparently the loans fund has money for only one-fourth that 
amount. In any case, someone will have to pay even for that. 
  One of the worst parliamentary acts the Sejm has approved 
is the one on compensatory supplements for the agricultural 
sector. It was manifestly put together in a hurry. But the 
president refuses to use his right of veto to reject that act 
because, by doing so, he would let the prime minister know that 
he does not approve of such a policy toward agriculture. This 
kind of interplay really has nothing to do with Poland's 
interests. It is just a cynical struggle for power. 
  [Socha] In the long run, the prospect of a collapse of the 
government coalition seems to be an increasingly likely 
possibility, does it not? 
  [Goscinski] Pawlak keeps "drawing the bowstring" in an 
attempt to try the SLD and see how much more it is able to 
swallow. If the SLD is pushed too far, it could, in an act of 
despair, leave the coalition. Or, if the SLD puts up too much 
resistance, Pawlak could break up the coalition. A government 
without the PSL but with only the SLD, the Democratic Union, and 
other political groups is not really likely to even be 
considered. It is more probable that, if he has support from the 
president, the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], and a 
proportion of the Democratic Union, Pawlak may form a minority 
government. Then, on the occasion of a major ballot, he might 
be forced to ask for a vote of confidence. It is not clear how 
the Sejm would behave in such a situation and whether the 
president would dissolve it then and announce a new 
parliamentary election. That possibility is still seen as a 
very powerful argument. People will find that they have burned 
their fingers on left-wing administration just as they burned 
them on Solidarity governments. Two years ago, I proposed the 
thesis that we would not really have a true parliamentary 
reflection of the existing configuration of forces in our 
society until the next Sejm. It may be that this existing 
configuration of forces is not ideal, but neither is it the 
worst one we could have. 
  [Socha] Do you believe in society's collective wisdom--that 
is, that we learn things faster than our elected leaders? 
  [Goscinski] Our society already showed us quite a few times 
that it is capable of greater political discipline than we would 
credit it with. Once we finally have a Sejm in which left, 
right, and center are equally represented, Poland will cease to 
be a country classified among hopeless incompetents. And, of 
course, someone else will be president then. It will have to be 
someone who will have the approval of both the left and the 
right side of the political spectrum, perhaps someone from the 
central orientation or even from outside the group of active, 
committed politicians--someone who will have enough common sense 
and be free from all pathological political ambitions.

  [Text] Tirana, April 25 (AFP) -- Albania's last communist 
president, Ramiz Alia, and nine other former top officials are 
to be tried next month for abuses of power under the country's 
former hardline regime, a prosecutor's spokesman said here 
Monday. Alia, 67, and other senior officials are to be charged 
with numerous abuses, including ordering summary executions, 
deportations, and compulsory atheism, the spokesman for the 
Tirana prosecutor told AFP. 
  Appearing alongside the former communist number one will be 
ex- interior ministers Adil Carcani, Simon Stefani and Hekuran 
Isia, former Politburo members Manush Myftiu and Rita Marko, and 
former top secret police and judicial officials, the spokesman 
said. Their trial will start at the beginning of May. If 
convicted, they face up to 25 years in prison. 
  The charges against Alia and his henchmen allege their 
responsibility for the actions of the Sigurimi, the regime's 
secret police. The charges cite the deportation of thousands of 
people, the summary execution of 22 people accused of 
involvement in the 1951 bombing of Tirana's Soviet embassy, and 
the banning in 1967 of all forms of religious activity in 
Albania, the spokesman said. 
  According to the Albanian association of deportees and 
former 
political prisoners, almost 60,000 people were deported or 
imprisoned during the regime in place between 1945 and 1991. 
One of the group's leaders, Kurt Kola, said an estimated 
700,000 citizens suffered varying degrees of persecution during 
that period, while the ex-political prisoners' Liria newspaper 
added that almost 6,000 people were executed. 
  Six other top officials, including former ideology chief 
Foto 
Cami, were sentenced on similar charges in February to between 
five and eight years in jail. Last year Nexhmije Hoxha, the 
72-year-old widow of Enver Hoxha, the founder and long-time 
Stalinist dictator of the post-war regime, was sentenced to 11 
years for embezzling state funds.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tibor Fuzessy, minister without portfolio </F>
and member of the Executive Committee of the Christian 
Democratic People's Party, by Jozsef Szabo Bartha; place and 
date not given: "A Tripartite Government With the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum and the Federation of Young Democrats"] 
  [Text] While the political parties are trying to convince 
the citizens about the correctness of their programs at various 
rallies and other forums, the Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP] gathered its activists, officials, and candidates 
with the same goal in Budapest last weekend. The surprise 
speaker of the meeting was Tibor Fuzessy, minister without 
portfolio and member of the KDNP Executive Committee, who, 
according to several opinions, "outlined a regular party and 
chairman program." The audience thanked him with a standing 
ovation. 
  [Bartha] How different is the KDNP as outlined by you from 
the actual one? 
  [Fuzessy] It follows a much more marked and firm line than 
the Christian democracy, a more Christian-social and 
Christian-socialist line. 
  [Bartha] An unavoidable question nowadays: Who with whom 
and with whom not? Is the KDNP a bride much in demand? 
  [Fuzessy] The KDNP has a lot of suitors. This could even be 
flattering, but the richer and stronger suitors do not take into 
consideration the fact that the bride is not only beautiful and 
honest, but also choosy and priggish. This bride is not lured 
away either by richness or power. If necessary, she is also 
ready to remain a maiden. 
  [Bartha] How do you choose? 
  [Fuzessy] Our Christian and national norms that have been 
formulated more firmly than ever determine whom we consider and 
whom we do not consider. Extremists on both sides are excluded. 
  [Bartha] Where do you put the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz]? 
  [Fuzessy] I have not believed in Fidesz for a long time, and 
I continue to have reservations, but it seems that they are now 
crossing the bridge over the river that separates the national 
trends from the non-national trends, the right from the left. 
If they burn this bridge and have no way back, we might become 
allies. 
  [Bartha] What about the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]? 
  [Fuzessy] In 1990, the SZDSZ was a tough anti-communist 
party calling for a hard change in the regime. A change took 
place in the party after two years, and now it is ready to share 
power with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. I do not use 
the terms "lies and fraud" in political debates. However, the 
people formulate tough things, and they cannot put up with such 
a turnabout, because they feel cheated. I do not believe either 
that the SZDSZ could make itself suitable for cooperation with 
the KDNP in the last moment. 
  [Bartha] What about the socialists? 
  [Fuzessy] There is still no approach between the MSZP and 
the KDNP. I came to know several outstanding people among them 
who did a lot for the change in the regime, and I am also sure 
that they did all that out of patriotism and with patriotic 
conviction. However, these people were forced out of the party 
or were put into a quarantine within the party. They cannot 
assert their voices and opinions. Although in its statute, the 
MSZP also favors the national idea and actions, it nevertheless 
fails to distance itself from those who played a leading role in 
the anti-national policy of the last 40 years, a policy that 
supported foreign oppression. We also miss their distancing 
from those who played a leading role in quelling the national 
revolution [of 1956] and in the ensuing repression. Talleyrand 
used to say about the return of the Bourbons that they did not 
forget anything and did not learn anything. The same applies to 
the MSZP. 
  [Bartha] What about the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]? 
  [Fuzessy] They are not our enemies or opponents, but our 
competitors with whom we must compete in an honest fight. The 
prospects of the KDNP are better in this struggle in the long 
run. Our ideology is clearer and easier to outline and this will 
definitely be felt in four years' time, if not now. 
  [Bartha] What about the Smallholders' Party [FKGP]? 
  [Fuzessy] It is enough to have a tripartite government with 
the Fidesz and the MDF. 
  [Bartha] You have not even considered the possibility that 
the MSZP might also be the winner? 
  [Fuzessy] Nothing is impossible. Then, the president of the 
republic will ask them to form a government. They will return 
this mandate because they cannot form a majority coalition. But 
the second largest party, the MDF, will be able to form a 
majority government with the Fidesz and the KDNP. There are 
real chances for this. 
  [Bartha] There are rumors according to which your 
precondition for a coalition is that your refuse to spend a 
single moment more under the same roof with Tamas Szabo and Geza 
Jeszenszky. 
  [Fuzessy] It is certain that the KDNP will not form another 
coalition like the one in 1990, a coalition formed without any 
guidelines and conditions. Although, as the deputy chairman and 
later the head of the parliamentary group of the KDNP, I 
formulated the conditions and exact rules of coalition 
cooperation at the time, this "work" of mine did not succeed. 
The MDF rejected it, the Smallholders did not even bother to 
give an answer, and I also found myself in minority in my own 
party. I am convinced that this must not be repeated in any 
circumstances. The KDNP can only join a coalition on the basis 
of precisely-formulated and detailed rules. No matter which 
party we are talking about. 
  [Bartha] Many people said about your speech last week that 
it was not only the program speech of the KDNP but also that of 
the party's candidate to the position of chairman. 
  [Fuzessy] It was definitely not meant to be one. My goal 
was to sit down calmly for about two hours in the rat race of 
the election campaign and think our situation over and examine 
our conscience. The decision to call up the national committee 
after the local government elections is still valid, and this 
committee will decide on organizational, statute, and personnel 
issues. It would only be justified to hold this meeting earlier 
if the party failed to achieve the results it hopes for in the 
elections. However, in my opinion, there is no such danger.

<F P=106> [Report by Bogdana Paun: "One More Ethnic Hungarian </F>
Sentenced to Prison After the 1989 December Events To Be 
Released"] 
  [Text] Yesterday in Alba Iulia another court session took 
place in the litigation initiated after the presidential decree 
pardoning eight ethnic Hungarians who were sentenced to long 
prison terms for their involvement in the December 1989 events 
[crimes against policemen] was overruled [by the local court of 
justice] in three cases. 
  The court ruled that Mihaly Balint, of Cristuru Secuiesc, 
should be released from jail. He is to leave prison within the 
next three days, during which the formalities will be completed. 
Otherwise he would have had to serve three more months of 
imprisonment. 
  The other two detainees did not benefit from a similar court 
ruling. Over the next few days they will appeal the ruling at 
the Supreme Court of Justice. The argumentation of the 
[negative] ruling says that one of them participated in an 
attempt to break out of prison, while the other had committed a 
crime that was too serious for him to be pardoned. 
  "This is an anomaly. First because in the prison logbook 
there is no word about any attempted breakout, and second 
because other persons who have meanwhile already been freed were 
sentenced for the same things," Bela Marko, chairman of UDMR 
[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] told us.

<F P=106> [Article by Karlo Jeger] </F>
  [Text] Over a period of five years the combined military 
industry of the confederation of the RH [Republic of Croatia] 
and Bosnia-Herzegovina will exceed that of Serbia! 
  The immense military potential of the former JNA [Yugoslav 
People's Army] provided the main strength for Serb conquest. But 
the Serbs also derived superiority from the military industry 
located in Serbia or on territory under Serb control. After the 
Croat-Muslim conflicts broke out, segments of the military which 
remained under control of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina were by contrast fragmented and 
disconnected, cut off from sources of production supplies and 
energy. That the linkup of these plants into a unified 
technological process is a significant threat for the Serbs can 
be seen from the fact that upon the first indications of 
Croat-Muslim rapprochement, they carried out an air attack 
against the largest factory making artillery guns in the former 
Yugoslavia: Bratstvo in Novi Travnik. 
<H5>  Repair of Supersonic Aircraft! </H5>
  At the same time, the Bosnian-Croatian agreement opens up 
possibilities for setting its own military industry in motion at 
an enviable level. 
  On the eve of the war Croatia had almost no military 
industry 
at all, except for shipbuilding. Within the shipbuilding 
industry we should mention the Skorpik Repair Yard in Sibenik, 
the well-known large shipyards (Split, Rijeka, Pula), and the 
Shipping Institute. Although in the near future it still will 
not be possible to produce a missile-carrying fast attack craft 
or submarine, it will be possible to make smaller vessels. 
Although the public is getting very little information, or there 
is hardly any mention of this at all, it has still been made 
public that the initial phase of production of armament in 
garages and small workshops was accomplished in Croatia long ago. 
  According to officially published data, the infantry weapons 
put into production include industrial production of pistols 
(the PHP, which stands for First Croatian Pistol, patterned 
after the Walter), sniper rifles (12.7 mm and 7.9 mm, and a 
third with NATO caliber), and pirated machine guns, patterned 
after the Israeli Uzi. The Pleter, Sokac, and Zagi were trial 
designs. An improved version of the Kalashnikov, like the 
Israeli 7.62-mm Galil, is also being produced. Various mines and 
explosive devices, mortars of all calibers with corresponding 
mortar shells, even very modern ones, recoilless cannon and 
shells, as well as portable light antiaircraft systems are also 
being produced. 
  The level of production now achieved guarantees successful 
organization of the production of other automatic and 
semiautomatic infantry weapons. Hand grenades are also being 
produced.... 
  Infantry land mines (20 types) are also being produced. The 
repair of supersonic aircraft and engines has also been restored 
in a very short time. The same is true of the repair of cannon 
and howitzers. 
  Nevertheless, the largest plants of the confederal military 
industry possible in the future, already installed and with a 
world reputation, are located in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In Vitez the HVO is supervising perhaps Europe's largest 
factory making gunpowder, rocket propellant, and explosives. The 
Osa Project, whose problem was propellant, becomes realistic 
with the liberation of Vitez. In the untouched plants it is 
possible to begin immediately, without any lag, to produce 
high-quality propellant for all types and calibers of 
multiple-barrel rocket launchers, gunpowder for all types of 
artillery pieces, as well as all types of explosives. Even 
before the Croat-Muslim conflicts, production of gunpowder for 
infantry weapons had been organized in Vitez.... The installed 
capacity for manufacturing propellant for the long-range 
missiles of the Orkan type in and of itself amounts to 2,000 
units a year. 
<H5>  A Factory Worth a Billion Dollars! </H5>
  When the HVO took over the factory, there were about 4,000 
finished propellant charges, which were supposed to be delivered 
to Iraq, stored in the warehouses! 
  The value of the factory in Vitez is estimated at a billion 
U.S. dollars. A complete and usable older manufacturing line for 
the production of gunpowder is stored on the grounds of the 
factory and could be set up very quickly. It is certain that for 
a long time the Serbs will not be able to attain the 
technological level of the factory at Vitez. 
  The HVO is also overseeing the former Soko Aircraft Factory 
in Mostar. Although the Serbs withdrew some of the equipment, 
with certain investments the factory could be outfitted, if not 
for the production of entire aircraft, then at least to continue 
production of parts for large factories in the world and 
high-quality aircraft repair. In addition, many parts are still 
in warehouses all over Bosnia-Herzegovina and could be used to 
assemble aircraft (in Busovaca and near Tuzla...). There are 
also quite a few air-to-surface missiles (RX 57 Lightning) 
stored in Bosnia-Herzegovina which the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was unable to use. 
  The largest factory for cannon and multiple-barrel launchers 
on the territory of the former Yugoslavia is under supervision 
of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Novi Travnik. The RAK-12, a 
copy of the Plamen, is being manufactured in Croatia. Aside from 
repair of all types of artillery weapons, cannon and howitzers 
of all calibers, from the 75-mm hill gun to the 155-mm howitzer, 
were produced in Novi Travnik. The production of very large guns 
is being prepared; equipment has been installed to machine 
203-mm cannon barrels, and all types of mortars and mortar 
shells are being produced. It should be mentioned that the 
production of gun barrels is very important because they are 
used unsparingly, and it is well-known that they wear out. 
Mortars are produced, however, in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Tesanj, 
along with mortar shells. 
  In Travnik the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is also 
supervising 
a large repair plant for infantry weapons. 
  The Slavko Rodic Factory in Bugojno, which is now being 
attacked by the Serbs, produces all types of fuzes, both for 
artillery and also for airborne weapons. Although the Serbs have 
also developed a fuze factory in Valjevo, they have been unable 
to produce the most up-to-date radio fuzes. The Orkan missiles, 
which have been falling around Jastrebarsko, had the poorer 
electronic fuzes, which were manufactured at Krusik in Valjevo, 
by contrast with those from Slavko Rodic in Bugojno. 
<H5>  Ammunition for NATO </H5>
  The Igman Infantry Ammunition Factory is in Konjic, buried 
deep in the ground in the vicinity of an underground command 
center built for the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] Presidency and JNA General Staff. The factory's 
production line is newer than that of its sister, the Prvi 
Partizan ammunition factory in Uzice, and it has a capacity of 
several million rounds per month. The quality of this factory is 
indicated by the datum that it has produced infantry ammunition 
even for NATO. The steel mill in Zenica has begun to manufacture 
105- and 122-mm ammunition using old cartridges.... There is a 
chance that in Novi Travnik the Muslims have succeeded in 
producing even Kalashnikovs, using barrels from the former 
warehouses of the JNA. 
  Gorazde has a detonator factory, the only important segment 
of the military industry which does not have its counterpart in 
Serbia. In Vitkovici, near Gorazde, there is also a chemical 
plant producing components for making explosives. 
  If we also add to the total capacity the former tank 
assembly 
line in Slavonski Brod, the potential of the future confederal 
military industry attains an enviable level! 
  The steel mill in Zenica can produce armor plate, it can 
make 
the turret, and the engine can be bought. But it is still more 
important that it can also produce fast armored vehicles.... 
<H5>  All the Factories in Serbia </H5>
  The voluminous documentation of the UNIS Defense Production 
Institute in Sarajevo has remained under control of the Croats 
and Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, the Serbs razed 
to the foundations the Zrak sighting device plant in Sarajevo. 
  The military industry for the former JNA was designed to 
produce weapons and all supplies necessary for what then was 
nationwide defense, and to do so completely independently and in 
virtually complete isolation. Almost all the plants of the 
military industry were located in the central mountains of the 
former joint state. That location was justified by the strategic 
rationale of waging nationwide defensive warfare, but Serbia 
then became almost completely independent and self-sufficient in 
the production of armament, while the other republics were put 
in the position of depending on one another for technology and 
production. 
  For example, the plastic mounts for rocket launchers and 
motors were produced at Kamnik in Slovenia, gunpowder came from 
Vitez, sights from Sarajevo, rockets from Vogosca.... The final 
assembly took place at Prilep in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia]. 
  The Slobodan Princip-Seljo Explosives Factory in Vitez 
developed a technology for the production of plastic explosive 
and then the entire production operation was moved to Ivangrad 
in Montenegro. Up until 1992 its total capacity was quadruple 
the needs of the rump "Yugoslavia." Until that time the former 
federal army had wherever possible built duplicate production 
facilities on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro. 
  For example, the "mate" of the Explosive and Gunpowder 
Factory in Vitez was Prva Iskra in Baric, Serbia; the Soko 
Aircraft Factory in Mostar had its counterpart in UTVA in 
Pancevo; the Slavko Rodic Fuze Factory in Bugojno had Krusik in 
Valjevo; the Konjic Ammunition Factory had Prvi Partizan in 
Uzice; the Pyrotechnics Factory in Gorazde had Krusik in Valjevo 
and Sloboda in Cacak. The "twins" of FAMOS, the engine factory 
in Sarajevo, were the Motor Industry in Rakovica outside 
Belgrade and FAP in Priboj. 
  The Zrak sighting device factory in Sarajevo was 
supplemented 
by the plants of Teleoptik in Belgrade. 
  The VMA (Military Medical Academy on Banjica) developed 
medical protection, field surgery, protection against all NBC 
[nuclear, biological, chemical] weapons, and all other aspects 
of military medicine to meet the needs of the ground forces. 
  All those institutions had the most up-to-date equipment and 
devices. The centrifuge at Batajnica for testing pilot behavior 
under the most difficult flight conditions alone cost more than 
a million dollars. 
  Prototypes manufactured under license, as well as those made 
in our own industrial plants, and imported weapons, were also 
tested not far from Belgrade -- at the Aircraft Testing Center 
at Batajnica and the Ground Forces Testing Center at Nikinci in 
Srem. What is more, there was also the Technical Test Center on 
Prevlaka, from which the Serbs withdrew the equipment and moved 
it to the Montenegrin side. 
<H5>  Supersonic Plane Out of the Question! </H5>
  The restructuring of the military-industrial complex of the 
remainder of Yugoslavia began in the summer of 1992. But the 
Serbs, although almost completely equipped with the technology, 
still have not managed to restore production of all types of 
weapons. 
  Production of the Orao airplane has been interrupted and is 
no longer even mentioned. Development of a new supersonic plane 
is out of the question. That was too difficult a task even for 
the entire military industry of the former Yugoslavia, much less 
the present Serbian industry. 
  Nor has production of the Gazela helicopter, the SA-341/24L, 
been resumed under French license at Mostar. Informed sources 
say that the Serbs are unable on their own to repair MiG-21's, 
which was done in Velika Gorica although they took away most of 
the machines and special tools. They have completed new 
production buildings three km long at Pancevo and built a new 
runway alongside the factory.... 
  Almost all the craftsmen and engineers with a world 
reputation at Soko, who in addition to meeting the needs of the 
former army also worked for the largest world aircraft 
corporations, like Boeing, Airbus, Dornier... have remained in 
Mostar. The same is true of the repair plant in Velika Gorica. 
  By contrast with them, the greatest attainment of the UTVA 
aircraft factory in Pancevo was the light piston plane, the 
UTVA-75. Nor did the piston trainer Lasta ever go into series 
production, and independent series production of jet planes is 
out of the question so long as the sanctions are in place. 
<H5>  Ships Under a Coat of Rust </H5>
  The Serbs have not even begun to rebuild production to meet 
the needs of the navy. And the ships they have in the Bay of 
Kotor have a heavy coat of rust. 
  To meet the needs of the ground forces, in addition to the 
factories that were already on their territory before war broke 
out, the Serbs have managed to rebuild and replace the factories 
they lost in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most of the Serbian military 
industry is located along the eastern and western Morava and in 
Belgrade, and one portion is in Bosnia under supervision of 
Karadzic's forces. 
  The Crvena Zastava plants in Kragujevac are the largest 
facility of the Serbian military industry. They produce all 
types of infantry weapons and antiaircraft cannon in calibers up 
to 40 mm. Their most recent product is a 9-mm pistol (whose 
production has been transferred to the Sartid 13 factory in 
Smederevo), the 12.7-mm sniper rifle, and the 40-mm infantry 
grenade launcher. 
  The Kragujevac automatic rifle, manufactured under the 
license of the Russian AK-47, which the Croatian fighters called 
the "Gypsy," is also produced there. 
  Krusik in Valjevo produces all types of light armor-piercing 
missile systems as well as the AT-2 and AT-3 guided 
armor-piercing missiles, manufactured under license, and they 
were also planning to produce the AT-4. Before the war they 
produced the Strela 2-M light portable antiaircraft system, and 
production under license of the Igla antiaircraft system, which 
is also light, was also being prepared. 
  The Lightning air-to-surface 128-mm missiles, which are not 
guided, and the BR-1 57-mm rocket launcher are also made in 
Valjevo. 
<H5>  The Serbs Have No More Money! </H5>
  According to unverified information, rockets for the Plamen, 
Oganj, and Orkan multiple-barrel rocket launchers are also made 
there. 
  At Lucani near Cacak all types of infantry ammunition are 
made at Prvi Partizan, and gunpowder for infantry ammunition in 
the plants of Milan Blagojevic. Prva Iskra of Baric is the main 
producer of rocket propellant. 
  The Serbian military factory in Bosnia with the largest 
capacity is in the UNIS plants in Vogosca, where all types and 
calibers of artillery ammunition are produced. 
  According to foreign sources, the Serbs have managed to 
restore production and repair of 100- and 125-mm tank cannon and 
also the repair of all types of artillery pieces. 
  A recent brief communique of the Supreme National Defense 
Council stated that only priority activities of vital important 
to defense of the country would be financed to meet the needs of 
the army, and salaries and pensions of military personnel would 
be paid. All capital investments and new projects are being 
halted. And the recent strike of workers in the special-purpose 
section of Crvena Zastava has shown that it will be difficult 
for Milosevic to fulfill his promise that the Kragujevac 
factories will operate even on three shifts if necessary. 
  By late 1993 total Serbian industrial output had fallen to 
only 30 percent of its prewar level. Half of this consisted of 
wartime production to meet the needs of preserving the territory 
conquered in Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina. Although their 
effect has been gradual, the sanctions have been having a 
disastrous impact, even on the Serbian military industry. 
  The miserly salaries, insufficient even for survival, have 
resulted in large-scale departure of highly trained personnel, 
mainly to countries overseas. Specialists in the numerous 
military engineering institutes and factories have joined the 
people with an engineering education. 
  Another important process is halting the development of 
projects which were almost finalized and the suspension of 
investments to develop new armament technology. Serbia simply no 
longer has the money for that. 
  The immense amount of military-technical documentation 
stored 
in Belgrade will simply go out of date. The large amount of 
knowledge about the production of weapons and military 
equipment, paid for with the money of all the republics of the 
former Yugoslavia, will become utterly unusable.

<F P=106> [Article by Srdjan Radulovic: "Babic's Return to Martic's </F>
Line"] 
  [Text] The entry of Milan Babic in the government of 
"national unity" is not of crucial importance to the section of 
the Krajina political scene that has long reached a party 
consensus on the political status of the Republic of Serbian 
Krajina. However, the support of the deputies of the SDS 
[Serbian Democratic Party] of Krajina to the program and the 
government of the new prime minister, Borislav Mikelic, as 
thought, will affect party relations in the Krajina assembly and 
Babic's future position with regard to both his political rating 
in Krajina and the party that he leads. 
  As stated by Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Serbian 
Radicals, 
by supporting a government that does not include members of the 
SRS [Serbian Radical Party], the second strongest party, Babic 
has "unilaterally broken the coalition alliance." The Radicals 
voted against Mikelic's program. Tomislav Nikolic, vice 
president of the SRS, says that the "Radicals will remain in the 
opposition." 
  Regarding the possibility of the Radicals' entering the 
government (the departments whose officials have not been 
elected yet) and reaching an agreement with Krajina's new prime 
minister, Nikolic said that no agreement has been reached with 
Mikelic, and that Mikelic's recent statements on an agreement 
with the Radicals do not correspond to the truth. "The 
situation in Krajina is becoming increasingly better for the SRS 
and we will be ready for elections, when they are called," 
Nikolic said. 
  What remains to be seen is how the multiparty bloc, which 
will play the role of the ruling authorities in the Krajina 
assembly, is going to function. The SDS of Krajina has the 
largest number of deputies, but without the Radicals, it can no 
longer count on the certain "endorsement" of its policies. The 
"marriage" of convenience between the two parties that until 
yesterday were fierce opponents, the "marriage" in which the SDS 
of Krajina won the greatest number of ministries, does not 
guarantee harmonious relations in the ranks of the ruling 
authorities. 
  If Babic's entry into the government, as thought, represents 
an attempt to resist the pressure on the Krajina's SDS deputies 
(and the Radicals) aimed at forcing the political "transfer" of 
his deputies and breaking the coalition bloc with the Radicals, 
then Babic should explain the reasons for his decision, whose 
consequence is indeed the collapse of the coalition with the 
Radicals. 
  The intention to preserve "peace in the house" with a 
compromise, at the time when the final stage in the denouement 
of the status of the Republic of Serbian Krajina is getting 
closer and closer, cannot be ruled out as having been in Babic's 
mind, but the fact that Babic has assumed a new post and is 
staying in power remains on the surface. 
  Will this adversely affect his political rating? It has been 
unofficially learned that Babic's decision did not enjoy the 
unreserved support of all the deputies, and that it surprised 
members of the SDS of Krajina in Banija, who were against 
Mikelic's nomination for prime minister. According to some 
Krajina sources, an uncompromising faction among the deputies of 
the SDS of Krajina is led by Lazar Macura, who stated at the 
meeting of the party deputy caucus that he would not support 
Babic's decision. 
  In any case, Babic cannot count on the support of the party 
membership that he enjoyed in the past, nor the support of the 
Radicals, considering the way in which he "paid for" his return 
to politics; here, the main creator is Krajina's President Milan 
Martic, who now has his men not only at the helm of the 
government, but also in the important ministries of defense and 
internal affairs.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Kiro Gligorov, president of The </F>
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, by Soren Ostergaard 
Sorensen in Skopje; date not given] 
  [Text] Skopje -- More than any other European country, 
Denmark has defended the new Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] nation and shown greater courage 
and firmness of principle in the country's conflict with its 
southern neighbor, Greece. This lavish praise comes from a head 
of state 2,500 km from Copenhagen. In an exclusive interview 
with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov gave 
the credit to the Danes for the fact that 11 European Union (EU) 
countries have now taken Greece to the European Court and have 
through diplomatic channels been pressing the Greeks into a 
corner to bring to end to the heated campaign against the 
Macedonian Government. 
  The Greeks' blockade is threatening to destabilize not only 
the whole of the southern Balkans, President Gligorov said. A 
destabilization which in the final analysis could lead to a 
bloody new Balkan war. But the present and previous Danish 
governments have been the most active in trying to prevent such 
a development, the president told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in the 
Macedonian capital of Skopje. 
  "Denmark is the most encouraging ray of light in the EU. A 
small country which courageously remains firm on its principles 
and dares voice them internationally. This is something that I 
think will be remembered in the EU and to a special extent here 
in Macedonia. Denmark shows that you should live up to the 
documents you sign, the documents which form the foundation for 
the European architecture. At the same time Denmark's stance is 
a defense of all small countries and therefore also a defense of 
Denmark itself," said Kiro Gligorov, who does not on the whole 
think that the EU has done enough to defend Macedonia against 
its Greek neighbor. 
  "Throughout the lengthy period since the conflict with 
Greece 
started, the EU could have gone to work much more toughly. We 
are after all talking about actions undertaken by an EU country. 
It is a conflict on the EU's borders, and a serious precedent 
will be set if the EU is unable to solve this problem. The 
point has now been reached at which the EU had to intervene and 
take Greece to court. Such a course of action was inevitable and 
hopefully Greece will reach its conclusions and preempt the 
trial by lifting the blockade. We would like to avoid the trial 
taking place. But if this does happen and Greece is found 
guilty, we take the view that the EU must find sufficient means 
to pressurize Greece into lifting the blockade," the Macedonian 
president said, pointing out that the EU also has an economic 
interest in having the blockade lifted as soon as possible, 
because Macedonia will confront the organization with demands 
for compensation for the enormous losses the small nation is 
suffering because of its isolation. President Gligorov 
estimates that the loss of income from trade and the 
repercussions for industry and agriculture amount to $86 million 
per month (more than half a billion kroner). 
  The conflict with Greece still centers on three main 
complaints. The Greeks are demanding that Macedonia should 
change its name, its flag and its national symbols, and its 
Constitution. All of these are symbols which the Greeks fear 
could lead at some later date to the little country's making 
territorial demands on northern Greece. The use of the Vergina 
star in Macedonia's flag which is thought to have been Alexander 
the Great's royal symbol, is viewed in Athens as tantamount to 
the theft of Hellenic culture. That is why Athens is demanding 
that the flag and symbol must be removed before the blockade can 
be lifted. 
  President Gligorov, who is depicted in Greece as a diabolic 
Greater Macedonian nationalist and dictator, sat in the 
presidential palace next to the red-gold flag with the sun of 
Vergina which he is unwilling to abandon to satisfy the Greeks' 
"national hysteria." 
  ``Throughout this process we have shown the greatest amount 
of goodwill vis-a-vis the Greeks' problems. But there has to be 
a limit to how far we can go, if we are not to give up our 
national identity completely. It can be in no one's interest 
that this should happen. It could lead to similar demands from 
other neighbors. It could destabilize not only our own country 
but the whole region and Greece in the process, if we gave in to 
all these demands. We need an agreement which respects our 
national identity and creates a foundation for a permanent and 
peaceful relationship between our two countries. 
  "Here in the Balkans where everything is mixed up in great 
confusion symbols take on very great significance. But many of 
our symbols in this region are common property, and I think that 
it is important that in the future we should view with tolerance 
and understanding the symbols as common property. The Greek 
antique culture is part of the cultural legacy of the whole of 
mankind. If the heated atmosphere in Greece continues and 
national frustrations remain as they are now it will be 
impossible to find a solution," Kiro Gligorov said, stressing 
that Macedonia is the only republic which has left the former 
Yugoslavia without acts of hostility as a result. 
  "Instead of always talking about Macedonia as a powder keg 
which could explode any minute, Macedonia should be seen as 
fundamental pillar of peace and stability in the Balkans. 
Despite all the warnings and threat scenarios we have succeeded 
in creating a stable and peaceful society. If this had NOT 
happened, the war in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina 
would have spread south and would have created an all-embracing 
Balkan war," said Kiro Gligorov, who thinks that the biggest 
external danger to Macedonia is an explosion of the tense 
situation in Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo. If 
it comes to violent clashes between Kosovo Albanians and the 
Serbian authorities, this could trigger a flood of refugees to 
the south which could threaten stability in Macedonia where 
there exists a very fine and difficult ethnic balance between 
the Macedonian majority and the large Albanian minority. In 
such a situation President Gligorov would expect the countries 
of the West to help by taking the perhaps several hundreds of 
thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees. 
  "There is a danger of a destabilization of Macedonia in the 
event of a conflict in Kosovo, and in such a situation the 
refugee problem would probably be dramatic. As a small, poor 
country we will not be in a position to accept a very large 
number of these refugees, quite simply because we cannot create 
a life for them here and because we would not be able to 
guarantee our own internal stability. Our task in such a 
situation would therefore be to collect the refugees at the 
border and have them transported on to countries which have a 
better chance of taking them on and where there is no political 
danger involved in accepting these refugees."

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, April 25 (AFP) -- NATO strategists are 
bracing for a Serb offensive on the Brcko corridor, a finger of 
land in northern Bosnia which joins Serbia to its conquests in 
western Bosnia-Herzegovina, officials said here Monday. The 
area is not covered by a NATO ultimatum on Friday which 
threatened massive air bombing of the Bosnian Serbs if they 
continued attacking Gorazde in eastern Bosnia or threatened 
another four mainly-Moslem towns. 
  The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forced the Bosnian 
Serbs to begin pulling back from the battered town of Gorazde at 
the weekend, after they had mauled it. 
  This means, warned one NATO source, that three brigades -- 
10,000 men or more -- could be looking for a new target, along 
with about 60 tanks and big guns. 
  With Gorazde close to the Serb border, they could easily 
cross into Serbia and travel quickly and safely northwards 
towards Brcko in order to widen and strengthen the corridor, he 
said. The source added that such an attack could provoke NATO 
air strikes if UN personnel were stationed in the area and their 
lives were in danger, even though the area was not included in 
last Friday's ultimatum. 
  Last week the Bosnian Serb chief of staff, General Manjlo 
Milovanovic, said candidly that Serbian territory between Brcko 
and Doboj, the eastern and western ends of the narrow corridor, 
was the next target. The statement was followed by a barrage of 
reports in the Serb press that Bosnian Moslems were attacking 
Serb positions around Brcko. Similar allegations preceded the 
Serb assault on Gorazde which started three weeks ago. 
  But one NATO official said the Bosnian Serbs could not be 
relied on to follow a consistent strategy. "Who knows what goes 
on in their minds?" he said when asked if Brcko was the next 
likely target. The official, who spoke on condition that he not 
be identified, said it was not clear to NATO strategists whether 
the Bosnian Serbs were following a master plan, or even whether 
their generals would follow one if it existed. 
  "There are renegade warlords who owe their power to 
continued 
fighting," he said, adding that the Serbs had a pattern of 
unpredictably hitting wherever their enemies showed signs of 
weakness. 
  But diplomats here are also hoping that the Bosnian Serbs, 
having already conquered large parts of Bosnia, might decide 
that they have won enough to start real negotiations to end the 
two-year war from a position of strength. 
  "There is a lot of war-weariness on all sides," the official 
said. Fueling this thesis is a new concertation by the United 
States, Russia and the European Union to push the warring 
parties towards a settlement. 
  However, Nedzad Hadzimusic, the head of the Bosnian 
Government's mission to Brussels, said the Bosnian Serbs would 
continue to use their military muscle at least until the 
year-end as long as it was not knocked out by NATO. "There is 
going to be another Gorazde somewhere else, perhaps even in 
another safe area like Tuzla," he said. Tuzla, along with 
Gorazde and the other Moslem-held towns of Bihac, Srebrenica and 
Zepa, are protected by NATO's air strike ultimatum issued last 
Friday. 
  But Hadzimusic predicted that the Bosnian Serbs might attack 
Tuzla, which has a strategically-important airport, to test 
whether NATO really does have the nerve to launch massive air 
strikes against them.

<F P=106> [Article by Djordje Milosevic] </F>
  [Text] Moscow, April 26 (TANJUG) -- After quite a few 
sharp, unexpected and contradictory statements, Moscow has 
finally agreed to what it has until recently energetically 
opposed -- to a use of force in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The turnabout which many found quite unexpected, came to 
light in a statement by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev last 
Saturday. He described the NATO threat of air strikes against 
the Bosnian Serbs as an adequate response at the United Nations' 
request. Kozyrev condemned the Serbs, using the words that would 
be used by Washington, Bonn, some Arab capitals or people 
showing open resentment towards the Serbs. 
  Less than a day before, his view was completely different. 
It was then that he told reporters that the NATO decision to 
launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions might prompt 
the conflict to escalate. 
  He said that the NATO military option was not the best 
solution. He added that the air strikes decision would clash 
even with the broadest interpretation of the U.N. resolution and 
could alter the character of U.N. operations in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The following day Kozyrev's statements were different 
altogether. All of a sudden, NATO air strikes were utterly in 
keeping with the U.N. resolution and did not change the 
character of U.N. operations. 
  Political and diplomatic inconsistency had begun earlier, 
when Kozyrev's deputy Vitaliy Churkin at Moscow airport raised 
an outrageous hue and cry against the Serb side alone. He made 
no mention of the Moslem share of the blame, to which he had 
often referred in the past. 
  Moscow analysts believe that NATO air strikes against 
Bosnian 
Serb positions should have been announced first and then given 
the green light. 
  There is a difference in views between Russia's army and 
political-diplomatic leadership. Defence Minister Pavel Grachev 
at a press conference in Moscow has said that he simply cannot 
unilaterally blame the Serb side for the difficult situation 
around Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia. 
  "We have at our disposal complete information on the 
situation in this region of the former Yugoslavia," Grachev 
said, obviously making it clear that the information possessed 
by the army leadership differed from that launched daily to 
serve the interests of the world power wielders. Grachev 
qualified NATO and U.N. decision as imprudent and maintained 
that the air strikes should be abandoned. 
  A sudden swerve in Russia's diplomacy is followed by a 
well-orchestrated campaign to bring Russia in line with the West 
regarding the Bosnian conflict. 
  Analysts say that the situation now was the same as two 
years 
ago when Russia had done its best to make the imposition of the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia seen as absolutely justified.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik by Pavol </F>
Minarik; place and date not given: "We Are Going To Search for 
Friends Abroad, Not Invent Enemies"] 
  [Text] [Minarik] What are you going to do to prevent the 
situation in Slovakia from becoming dangerous? 
  [Moravcik] We are going to continue the political style we 
have decided to adopt. This means to search for constructive 
solutions to the problems and to try to reach consensus with a 
wide spectrum of political parties. The existence of all our 
government is based on this principle. Some of the circles on 
the domestic scene, however, would like to hear declarations 
oriented toward the radicalization of the events. In my 
opinion, there is only one way: not to react to nonsense. 
Regarding foreign countries, we are going to search for friends 
there. We are not going to invent enemies. 
  [Minarik] Slovakia is once again at a crossroads. What 
direction is it going to follow? 
  [Moravcik] We said it, in no uncertain terms, in our policy 
statement. We are going to try to integrate ourselves in 
traditional European economic, political, and security 
structures. Regarding the attitude toward the state, we want to 
renew the trust of the people in state institutions and to 
increase people's feeling of security. This will not be easy. 
We have recorded an obvious increase in the crime rate. We are 
not likely to be able to eliminate this trend, but we would like 
to improve the number of solved cases. We are interested in an 
efficient functioning of our administration, which is to serve 
the people. We also want to stress the importance of individual 
initiative not only in the economic sphere, but also in the 
social one. This means that we are considering giving the 
nonstate organizations, including various foundations, room for 
activity in the social sphere. We are also going to push for a 
bill on conflicts of interest. 
  [Minarik] Last week, parliament approved the policy 
statement, but the new Cabinet does not have enough time left. 
What should you concentrate on? 
  [Moravcik] In the economy, we have to concentrate on 
budgetary discipline. We are going to try to solve, in a more 
consistent manner, the insolvency of our enterprises, which is a 
drawn-out problem of our economy. We believe privatization is 
very important. 
  In its policy statement, the government has unequivocally 
indicated that it has the political will to prepare the second 
wave of coupon privatization, so that it might take place 
immediately after the elections in the fall. We want 
denationalization to become part of our overall economic 
strategy. 
  [Minarik] Are you aware of the risks your government is 
taking on? 
  [Moravcik] A government cabinet that has a limited time span 
for its existence, such as our Cabinet, cannot ignore risks. 
However, there are also some advantages. That is, the 
government is forced to adopt very tough attitudes toward 
fulfilling its tasks. I have the impression that we will be 
able to solve certain long-term problems, particularly in the 
economy. We will have to intervene in the tax system in a way 
that will affect taxpayers. Certain spending from the budget 
will have to be reduced, which also is a risk factor. 
  [Minarik] Are you not afraid that such steps will have a 
negative impact on your further political career? 
  [Moravcik] That is irrelevant. 
  [Minarik] Former Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
members who were in the government before are now acting as a 
shadow cabinet. How do you view their activity and their 
declaration that you are a government of broad corruption and 
trained poodles? 
  [Moravcik] We are carefully watching everything the 
opposition is saying about us, including the shadow cabinet. We 
are going to try to find something positive, if possible, that 
could help solve some of our problems. Anyway, from this 
viewpoint, the opposition is always important because, if they 
are efficient and constructive, they should point to certain 
aspects that the government cannot see. Unfortunately, we have 
not discovered stimuli in the declarations of Meciar's shadow 
cabinet that would make us change our attitude. 
  [Minarik] How is the right-left government of the center 
managing to govern? On what basis do you reach consensus? 
  [Moravcik] I will be sincere: In the course of the 
discussions at the government meetings, it is difficult to tell 
who is the left wing and who the right. The coalition has the 
advantage that it can concentrate fully on solving problems. 
There has never been a confrontation of the left- and 
right-wing concepts. Of course, it is more difficult to reach 
consensus when there are more entities involved. No stumbling 
blocks have appeared yet, however. 
  [Minarik] What chances do you give to your Cabinet after the 
elections in the fall? 
  [Moravcik] We are building on the fact that we are going to 
convince the electorate that our viewpoint and our policy 
represent an alternative for Slovakia, which alternative is 
acceptable to the majority or them. Otherwise, we would hardly 
be able to manage all our problems. I believe that this Cabinet 
has a chance to function even after the elections. 
  [Minarik] Many people in Slovakia are balancing on the edge 
of the sustenance level. They are ill-behaved voters because 
they want an immediate solution. 
  [Moravcik] We want to make the transformation process as 
socially acceptable as possible. This will be very demanding, 
but we must do everything not to increase the number of people 
living below the subsistence level. I admit, however, that this 
is one of the most important problems this government has to 
solve. 
  [Minarik] You are one of the people who knew Vladimir 
Meciar well. Is his position in Slovak politics being demonized? 
  [Moravcik] Maybe it is. To tell the truth, I do not have 
time to think about it too much. I believe that a positive 
program can become an alternative [for Slovakia]. If a certain 
part of society--we will try to make this part as large as 
possible--realizes that there are several alternatives and 
possibilities and that there are different political entities 
that can efficiently execute their powers, is it possible that 
the public will positively appreciate such personalities? 
  [Minarik] Your predecessors from Meciar's cabinet have not 
properly handed over their offices to the members of your 
government. We have even heard about empty shelves in certain 
ministries. How have you solved this problem? 
  [Moravcik] Several weeks have elapsed since then. All this 
is rather grotesque. No unsurmountable obstacles have arisen as 
a consequence of this. 
  [Minarik] Why did the HZDS have difficulties governing in 
Slovakia? 
  [Moravcik] I did not think about it in any specific way. If 
we wanted to point to the core of the problem, we would speak 
about something the public has already forgotten and what I 
pointed to when I was expelled from the HZDS. They have adopted 
two attitudes in politics. The first is exclusivity. Only the 
HZDS is able to govern in Slovakia. The second is the 
confrontational character of their politics. I believe that, if 
the HZDS does not change its policy in both points, it may be 
led to the fringe of the political scene and become an extremist 
party.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Dan Hruby and </F>
Bohumil Pecinka; place and date not given: "I am No Longer an 
Icebreaker"] 
  [Text] Until quite recently, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus (52) was, for the majority of our citizens, rather like an 
icebreaker that assiduously cuts through the ice floes and hauls 
society forward. However, in recent months, he has seemed more 
like a moderate politician, who customarily prefers constancy to 
variety. This is a change. REFLEX asked: Why has it taken 
place? 
  [Klaus] The most important thing of all is the era, which 
has changed considerably. Previously, we were faced with 
fundamental tasks, whereas now we are dealing with far more 
subtle issues. If at one time it was necessary to chop away at 
them with an icebreaker, now we are using far more delicate 
instruments. This is the objective reality of our era. The 
country has moved from the early transformation phase to the 
posttransformation period. During the period of cutting through 
with an icebreaker, there are also far more people on board with 
you. When dealing with more delicate tasks, you notice that the 
concurrent viewpoints on a whole host of issues have factually 
evaporated. The era of the icebreakers has simply come to an 
end. 
  [REFLEX] Does this mean that the era of systemic changes is 
already behind us? 
  [Klaus] It is impossible to say that the era of systemic 
changes came to an end on this or that day. I would use the 
present continuous tense--it is coming to an end. 
  [REFLEX] Then the revolution is also coming to an end? 
  [Klaus] Is the revolution coming to an end? This seems to 
me, in April 1994, to be a somewhat overdue question. 
  [REFLEX] The Democratic Union was formed recently. It 
considers the November revolution to be incomplete and declares 
itself to be a party for your disappointed voters.... 
  [Klaus] From the little I know about this party, I would say 
that it is an eleventh-hour party of permanent revolutionaries, 
a party of people who have not understood the true size of the 
rear-view mirror through which we look at what is behind us. 
Theirs is bigger than the windshield of the car in which they 
are traveling. On the other hand, these are people who have 
obvious personal interests, and they are concealing them 
partially by means of their strong-arm ideology. 
  [REFLEX] What do you say to their claim that the 
establishment of the Democratic Union was brought about by Civic 
Democratic Party [ODS] policy and that you are, in fact, the 
father of this party? 
  [Klaus] By answering these questions, I am already according 
this party more importance than it merits. The main driving 
force behind this grouping is and will be the publisher of CESKY 
DENIK, Mr. Kudlacek. I have to say that his views on our policy 
were absolutely the same four years ago as they are today. The 
ideological gap between us has not increased by a millimeter 
since his first open letters in ANNONCE. Even then, his demands 
were absurd, unrealistic, and oversimplified. I would recommend 
that everyone read Mr. Kudlacek's articles. 
  [REFLEX] The fact is, it demoralizes the citizens when many 
of the former StB [State Security] and KSC [Communist Party of 
Czechoslovakia] top brass are conducting business unimpeded. 
The radicals are even talking about a nomenklatura 
capitalism... 
  [Klaus] I do not want to say that the quite unique 
privatization of our economy, which, in the space of two or 
three years, has gone from nothing to the current level of 
two-thirds of the overall generation of the GDP in the private 
sector, is a painless and idyllic social activity in which only 
the best and most honest have succeeded. Unfortunately. 
However, I cannot imagine this process being carried out in a 
more rational way. Of course, it was possible to postpone and 
slow down privatization. I am convinced, however, that the 
price we would have to have paid for this delay would have been 
infinitely higher. This is clear to see in many postcommunist 
countries, where, as a consequence of hesitation, there has been 
so-called spontaneous privatization and the results are now far 
worse. There is speculation concerning the social groups in our 
country from which successful businessmen recruit. I have to 
say, however, that nothing can be done about this at the moment. 
These people either have the ability of innovators or not. The 
state can do nothing for them. The "Heroes of Our Time" in the 
economic sphere are not the state's civil servants, planners, or 
ministers. The "Heroes of Our Time" are the entrepreneurs, 
managers, and businessmen who come up with the ideas, whether 
these concern a new enterprise, product, or technology. 
  [REFLEX] Many people voted for you because they felt you 
have a clear vision of society's further development. Are you 
not now concerned, when many people are abandoning the 
icebreaker, and mundane problems, including the endless 
coalition disputes, are cropping up that this vision is being 
lost from sight? 
  [Klaus] I would not confuse the clear vision of society's 
development and the everyday political squabbles within the 
coalition. The vision is something infinitely more profound, 
and the political level only forms a small part of it. 
Therefore, I do not believe that our citizens are losing this 
vision. Nothing I see around me bears this out. The period of 
more subtle conflict among the ideas about the future is just 
beginning. This is natural in a pluralist society. In 1990, 
the main conflict was between visions of East and West. The 
basic slogan of these elections was "Back to Europe." Now this 
slogan is trivial. Everyone, so to speak, can ascribe to it. 
People have matured so much that they are able to ask 
supplementary questions. We are no longer asking if there 
should be a market or planned economy here, but we are dealing 
with how interventionist the market economy should be, how it 
should be regulated, and how socially encumbered it should be. 
That is, I do not view today's disputes as a loss of the 
overall vision but as a progression of the pluralist views 
within it. These are simply disputes on one side of the 
barricade. 
  [REFLEX] Despite this, however, these "disputes on one side 
of the barricade"--for example, among the coalition parties--may 
put people off or provoke disillusionment.... 
  [Klaus] I would not be so dramatic. The coalition is here 
so that it can debate in a coalition manner. This is logical. 
If only one party were in power, there would be "coalition" 
disputes among its ranks by way of a change. When I see the 
problems within the coalition governments in Germany, France, 
and Italy, I do not feel that our coalition is in any way 
exceptional. 
  [REFLEX] Does this mean that the citizens should get used to 
the fact that the current situation is quite normal? 
  [Klaus] The citizens should get used to it, and I think they 
have long been used to it. Instead, I would ask reporters to go 
for the facts and not whether this or that coalition politician 
has said something clever or stupid. 
  [REFLEX] The modern history of the Czech lands is associated 
with left-wing traditions, which culminated so oppressively 
after February 1948. You are now coming up with a program for 
complete privatization and economic liberalism; however, these 
very ideas represent a heterogeneous element in our environment. 
Could it turn out that the only political role you and the 
entire ODS will play in Czech history will actually be the role 
of an icebreaker during the period of transitional changes and 
that later you will lose widespread support because society will 
return to its traditional views? 
  [Klaus] The role of a politician must always be far more 
dynamic, and his vision must be far more definitive than the 
average vision of society and than would correspond to the 
actuality of the country in question. If you want to swing the 
pendulum in an attempt to reach the point at which it turns 
back, you have to strike it with far greater force. At the same 
time, it is clear that the pendulum will again fall back a 
little. This is a fundamental dispute that will never end. 
There will always be a constant clash of ideas here when the 
issue involves the side to which the pendulum will swing. So, 
the fact that my ideology is more right-wing than would 
correspond to the traditions of this country is absolutely in 
order. The task of a politician is to hoist and tighten the 
sails and follow the course plotted. 
  [REFLEX] Do you think that this left-wing tradition "in us" 
could be altered by the post-November developments, especially 
mass privatization? 
  [Klaus] Here we must, first and foremost, answer the 
question on the role of tradition in forming political, social, 
and cultural--simply, all--views of the world. Apart from this 
historical vertical axis of traditions, there is also a 
horizontal factor--that is, to what extent events in the 
surrounding world influence us. Let us go a bit further: Is it 
possible to extricate ourselves from this vertical axis of 
traditions and the horizontal axis of external influences and, 
by means of our own shrewd policy, push general views forward? 
This is the third factor that determines society's orientation. 
I personally believe that the past will not pull us back too 
much. The social democratic or pseudosocialist tradition in our 
country was considerably overturned by the advent of communism, 
and it thus suffered far more breaches than in the countries of 
Western Europe. There, this tradition was far from being 
suppressed, devastated, and more or less negated by the 
experiences of the past 50 years. Therefore, I am not concerned 
that our citizens would be too enticed by the socialist ideas of 
the first half of the 20th century. 
  [REFLEX] What, then, are you concerned about? 
  [Klaus] I am a little concerned about the horizontal axis. 
The Western ideological world is positioned a little differently 
than I would like. The gravitational pull to the left will come 
from Western Europe--that is, from our natural environment 
rather than from our own past. 
  [REFLEX] However, you also mentioned a third factor.... 
  [Klaus] This represents everything that we ourselves are 
capable of pushing through, asserting, and emphasizing. I 
believe that we are not helpless against the influences from our 
past and the surrounding world. I am not a pessimist about 
this. We have strength, independence, and reasoning, and so we 
also have hopes of preserving a certain Czech specificity into 
the future. 
  [REFLEX] Specificity in what? 
  [Klaus] Our Republic gravitates more toward the West than 
the other postcommunist countries, but, on the other hand, it is 
more aware of the danger of collectivist theories than Western 
countries. It is in this very area--and I am saying this without 
any arrogance--that I see a certain role for us within the 
Pan-European context. 
  [REFLEX] Do you think it is possible in present-day Western 
Europe to discern any trend that society there would orient 
itself more to the right or to the left? 
  [Klaus] The period of time between an idea being formulated, 
implemented, and, finally, becoming firmly rooted throughout 
society is very long. Despite the fact that the 1960's and the 
1970's saw a marked ideological swing to the right, left-wing 
state interventionism reached its peak during this period. 
Then, at the beginning of the 1980's, politicians like Ronald 
Reagan and Margaret Thatcher grasped the new ideas and began to 
put them into political practice in their countries. However, I 
will not speculate about whether the third phase has already 
been achieved--that is, when these ideas have definitively 
penetrated the citizens' consciousness. Nevertheless, today we 
can all see that, in the ideological sphere, which precedes 
reality, the pendulum in Western Europe is beginning to swing 
back to the left. So, there will still be something to contend 
with in the ideological sphere. 
  [REFLEX] You said that the experience with communism in our 
country has discredited socialist ideas. However, in Poland and 
Lithuania, for example, they have had the same experience, but 
still the postcommunists won the free elections there.... 
  [Klaus] In these countries, compared with the Czech 
Republic, the development of the political system is less 
evolved. The political forces there are still political 
movements that are not ideologically precisely defined. They 
are fronts for something or forums against someone. This means 
that the structure of political life there is proceeding 
otherwise than along a right-left line. In policy, the forces 
there are more rational and less rational, more pragmatic or 
less pragmatic, more or less organized, and these differences 
are more important than right-left polarity. This means that 
the forces that won the elections in these countries may be more 
rational at a given moment and the governments more capable. 
  [REFLEX] Does this also apply to Slovakia? 
  [Klaus] Yes. 
  [REFLEX] We had originally intended this interview to be a 
summary of a specific period. However, it now seems to us that 
this is not the right time to take a look at what has happened. 
For example, the issues of restitution and the senate have not 
been dealt with. When do you think the time will be right to 
take a look at these issues? 
  [Klaus] Any time is right for taking a look around. I do 
not understand, however, why you two should consider the issues 
of the senate and restitution to be the dominant issues facing 
our society. These are absolutely marginal issues that do not 
concern the essence of this country. It is only certain 
politicians that incessantly and artificially drag them to the 
forefront. However, I do not believe that we should write the 
history of this state during the past four years according to 
them. I do not believe that these are the issues that people 
talk about every day over a pint in the pub or around the dinner 
table at home.

<F P=106> [Article by W.K.: "Poland-PFP; We Are Not Taking Part in a </F>
Race"] 
  [Text] The issue of Poland's participation in the 
"Partnership for Peace" [PFP] program was the main subject 
discussed at the meeting between National Defense Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk and representatives of the embassies of the NATO 
states. At the meeting, which was held yesterday in Helenow 
near Warsaw, the National Defense Ministry [MON] head stated 
that on 25 April a delegation of MON and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs would submit a so-called presentation document in 
Brussels. 
  The minister expressed his hope that today the government 
would accept this document. The presentation document should be 
submitted by the states that want to take part in the PFP 
program. 
  Kolodziejczyk stressed that,even though Poland was the first 
state of Central and East Europe to prepare a draft of the 
document, this should not disturb other states of our region in 
their striving to achieve NATO membership. The minister added 
that the document had been discussed with the Visegrad Group 
states. "We are not taking part in any race," he pointed out. 
He also said that, at the meeting, a lot of attention had been 
drawn to the issue of the consultations mechanism included in 
the PFP. 
  In Helenow, the problems of European security, bilateral and 
multilateral cooperation, and the financial aspects of 
participation in the PFP were also discussed. 
  Kolodziejczyk conceded that a weak spot in the structure of 
the Polish Army is the issue of constitutional division between 
the powers of the civilian minister and the head of the General 
Staff. 
  Participating in the meeting were also, among other persons, 
Mieczyslaw Wachowski, minister of state in the President's 
Office, and General Tadeusz Wilecki, head of the General Staff.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- In the speech made 
after the Friday plenum session of the Crans Montana Forum, at 
the workshop devoted to Romania, its economic potential and 
development perspectives, Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu expressed his 
conviction that the Bucharest conference would contribute to 
understanding the evolutions, the options for the present and 
future, the efforts Romania is making in promoting the 
democratic principles on the one hand and in consolidating the 
market mechanisms on the other. 
  The Romanian prime minister expressed the view that in the 
political and economic context of a South-Eastern Europe in full 
integration in the European structures and opening to the 
world's economic circuits, Romania is holding the privileged 
place secured to it by its strategic position and its resources. 
Romania is offering foreign investors a domestic market in full 
development, a ready access to neighboring foreign markets, an 
incentive juridical background permanently improved, a labor 
force capable of complex workmanship. 
  The prime minister of Romania showed that with effect from 
November 1992, the Romanian Government practically made 
effective its ruling programme and the strategy for social and 
economic reform covering the time interval up to 1996, and that 
sectorial surveys plead for continuing the reform in close 
correlation with the real situation of the Romanian economy, and 
with the technological, material, financial, currency and social 
constraints. 
  Premier Vacaroiu stressed that, although carried under the 
impact of negative factors accumulated in the years previous to 
1989 and in extremely unfavorable international conditions, the 
reforms went on in several planes: the reform of prices, the 
introduction of the value-added tax, the enhancement of the 
financial autonomy at local administration level, the initiation 
of the restructuring process, the development of the small and 
medium business sector, the further liberalization of foreign 
trade, the making of the laws apt to support the reform. 
  "The official report of the United Nations Economic 
Commission assessed that, among all countries in transition, 
Romania is the surprise of the year 1993, because it managed 
economic growth (a positive 1 per cent on the gross domestic 
product, plus 1.3 per cent on industrial production, plus 12.4 
per cent on farm production), thus contradicting all Romanian 
and foreign prognoses estimating that economic decline was to go 
deeper by another 7-10 percentage points." 
  Concluding, the prime minister of Romania named among his 
government's actions for an ever greater opening of Romania in 
1994 to the world business spheres those regarding the alignment 
of export/import trade policies proper to market rules, 
attracting direct foreign capital investments by markedly 
liberal regulations and encouraging fiscal policies, improving 
leasing conditions and activating the free trade zones, 
intensifying the relations with the international bodies (IMF, 
EBRD, G-24), as well as actions directed at making progress 
towards Romania's association with the European Union.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/4/1994 -- The Friday evening 
[22 April] debate on peace prospects in the Balkans gave the 
speaker of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase the 
opportunity to say: "I think that the theme we are discussing 
today at the forum is now topical not only for Bucharest, but 
for all capitals of the world. 
  Listing the factors that keep the Balkans under pressure he 
named the troubled historical past of the region, the large 
number of minorities coexisting for centuries in its area, the 
communist totalitarian regimes that concealed the smoldering 
tensions without solving their causes, as well as factors 
extraneous to the region, such as power interests. What should 
be avoided in this particularly complex social and political 
background is the domino effect, he suggested. "We must not 
allow the Yugoslav conflict to spread to other places, so as 
equally dangerous would be the involvement of the great powers 
in this conflict." "The Yugoslav crisis has already put 
international and world organizations to a severe test, (United 
Nations, CSCE, NATO and West European Union). They have some 
merit in keeping the conflict under control, but have also 
displayed serious limitations of their capacity to settle the 
conflict." 
  Speaking of the risk factors in the Balkans, yet without 
ignoring those that prompt the optimistic approach, the speaker 
of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies commended the political and 
diplomatic efforts of the United States and Russia, which have 
led to many important results. 
  Adrian Nastase also referred to Romania as a 
Central-European 
country, as a state that could become an important center of 
stability in the Balkans. "We have a considerable economic and 
military potential if compared to other states in this region, 
and what is more important, we cherish the strong desire of 
contributing to the diplomatic settlement of the conflict." 
  In Mr. Nastase's view, the steps to be taken towards 
normality should be the fortification of democracy and market 
economies in all Balkan states, the development of concrete 
joint cooperation projects regarding their common future, a 
close cooperation between the Black Sea riparian countries, a 
similar scheme among Danubian countries provided the embargo 
against Yugoslavia is ended, the association to regional or 
sub-regional cooperation structures of the newly emerged 
entities in the ex-Yugoslav space, and, of no less importance, 
the initiation of an international conference for a scrutiny of 
all these issues with the purpose of coming up with ideas for 
new projects on peace prospects in the Balkans.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/4/1994 -- Further to the 
dialogue started on the first day of the Crans Montana Forum, 
the plenum session of Friday, 22 April, brought together 
important personalities to discuss about prospects of peace in 
the Balkans. The session was chaired by the speaker of the 
Romanian Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase. The presidium 
included Deputy Prime minister of the Yugoslav Federal 
Government Nikola Sainovic, Bosnian Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic, Croatia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo 
Sanader, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, Russian 
Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mitiukov [name as received], and 
Romania's Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who all presented 
their countries' points of view on the situation in former 
Yugoslavia. 
  They pointed out at the impact the Bosnian conflict is 
having 
on the Balkans and at some of the ways that could help settle 
the crisis. 
  The Yugoslav Federation's viewpoint was that the policy of 
pressure, ultimatum, sanctions and punishment for Serbia and 
Montenegro was not only inefficient and inhuman, but even 
counterproductive, with negative effects both on the Balkans and 
on Europe. "There is no alternative to achieve peace, outside 
negotiations, compromise and equal treatment for all the 
conflicting parties." Nikola Saimovic said, and demanded the 
immediate cease of hostilities on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as the only chance to reach a compromise for 
peace. 
  Bosnia's representative said his country wanted peace, but 
would never accept the dictate. He requested Europe to wake up 
and commit itself more firmly in the crisis so as to protect 
Bosnia against "the imperial ambitions of great Serbia." 
  Recalling the recent signing in Washington of a document for 
the establishment of a Croatian-Muslim confederation, Croatia's 
representatives said that this enabled the settlement of a 
stable peace between Bosnia and Croatia, and expressed his 
country's readiness to normalize relations with the Yugoslav 
side. Ivo Sanader pleaded for a new concept in the Balkans: 
"Scandinavisation", as symbol of stability. 
  Albania's foreign minister demanded that reprisals against 
Albanians in the Kosovo region be stopped and the province 
placed under international guarantees "to avoid having a new 
Bosnia-Herzegovina." 
  Russian Federation envoy Mitiukov reiterated his country's 
option for a negotiated settlement of the Yugoslav issue, and 
proposed an international conference be called for the purpose. 
  Concluding the debates, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor 
Melescanu stressed Romania's major interest that the Yugoslav 
conflict were solved peacefully, and demonstrated the baleful 
consequences the embargo against Yugoslavia has had on the 
Romanian economy, which reports losses of some seven billion 
dollars.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/4/1994 -- "Partnership for 
Peace" [PFP] was the theme of a session held in plenum Saturday, 
23 April, afternoon, during the Bucharest conference of the 
Crans Montana Forum. 
  Chaired by Charles Thomas, ambassador in the United States 
Department of State, and by Jean-Paul Carteron, president of the 
Forum Foundation, the session occasioned a presentation of 
opinions regarding the Partnership for Peace. 
  In his address, Gheorghe Tinca, Romanian minister of 
defense, 
stressed that the Partnership for Peace was the sole initiative 
to start the evolution process that could ensure security in 
Central and Eastern Europe, while Romania's adherence was 
proving the will to integrate within European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures. 
  Approaching the political dimension of the initiative, the 
speaker stressed that the ensurance of indirect guarantees for 
security could eliminate any discrimination among states, but in 
the conditions of tempering integration at various speeds, that 
could lead to new separation marks on the continent, so that the 
security of any country should not be conceived to the detriment 
of other countries participating in the partnership. 
  In the opinion of Petre Roman, president of the Democratic 
Party (National Salvation Front), the Partnership for Peace is a 
serious step towards NATO's widening and consolidation. 
  Stressing from the very beginning on the need for security, 
Jean Freymond, director of the Geneva Center for Practical 
Studies on International Negotiations, assessed that the Eastern 
and Central European countries should not indulge in illusions 
of joining NATO, "illusions that might be turned tomorrow into 
disappointment". 
  The conclusions over the debates were however optimistic, 
the 
Partnership for Peace being viewed as a fundamental contribution 
to the security and stability, to consolidation of democratic 
structures and of the process of transition in Central and 
Eastern European states.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/4/1994 -- The works of the 
Crans Montana Forum conference with "The Emerging Markets" as 
the general theme ended on Sunday, April 24, at noon, in 
Bucharest at the Romanian Parliament Palace. 
  The closing session was attended and addressed by Romanian 
President Ion Iliescu, by the president of the Forum Foundation 
Jean Paul Carteron as well as by Bernard de Montferrand, special 
envoy of the French prime minister. 
  The four-day conference has gathered in plenary or topical 
sessions about 1,800 delegates from all over the world. It was 
an occasion for useful exchanges of opinions with regard to 
current political and economic issues as well as for many 
business contacts. 
  In his address, Crans Montana Forum President Jean Paul 
Carteron expressed his respect and admiration for the Romanian 
organisers of the conference and underscored the "resounding 
success" of the conference which, in his opinion, enabled the 
approaching of several stringent issues of the current economic 
and political international life. The Forum Foundation 
president added that the conference gave also the image of 
Romania as of a country with large possibilities and at the same 
time with a significant role in the international life. The 
hands shaking by 'Arafat, Peres and Iliescu represented 
Romania's come back on the world politics scene, said Carteron. 
If Romania needs the world, now it is clear that the world, 
too, needs Romania, said Jean Paul Carteron. 
  In his address, the envoy of the French prime minister 
Bernard de Montferrand conveyed a proposal by Premier Edouard 
Balladur calling for the achievement of a pact of stability in 
Europe expressing the European countries' willingness to observe 
and promote the values of civilization and the principles of 
freedom which were born on this continent. 
  In his turn, Romanian President Ion Iliescu said that the 
Forum meeting in Bucharest had been a genuine forum of ideas, 
debates, contacts among a large number of politicians and 
personalities of the economic life from all over the world. The 
meeting was a unique experience through the possibility created 
for a large number of political and economic decision-makers to 
have useful exchanges of ideas along the four days of the 
conference, to have contacts and to establish immediate or 
future actions aiming to solve several problems confronting the 
international community, to establish new advantageous 
collaborations, said President Ion Iliescu. Through this 
conference, Bucharest has joined in the system of organising 
international meetings and the decision of establishing here of 
an international conference center confirms this course, said 
President Iliescu.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/4/1994 -- After the final 
session of the Crans Montana Forum conference in Bucharest, 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu commented for ROMPRES the 
problems of the Middle East and the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia from the perspective of the relevant contacts during 
the conference. 
  The works of the Crans Montana Forum conference in Bucharest 
have offered the opportunity for a useful meeting between 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Leader Yasir 
'Arafat and have increased the chances for peace in one of the 
most blood-stained zones of the world, said President Ion 
Iliescu. 
  To a question whether the contacts among the sides of the 
conflict in former Yugoslavia were bringing hopes as much 
encouraging, the Romanian president underlined the fact that 
Bucharest had enabled the Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian 
representatives to get informed with the opinions of the 
international community about this conflict but also to have 
contacts meant to get closer the divergent views. 
  "I had contacts with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic, with the president of the Parliament of Croatia, 
Stipe Mesic and with the foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
Irfan Ljubijankic. I have convinced myself that this conflict 
is not an ethnic conflict and I have made all the efforts to 
convince the sides to sit at the negotiations table. I have 
succeeded to ease way for contacts, except for Stipe Mesic who 
said he had no mandate to meet Jovanovic. The mere fact that 
part of the players on the Yugoslav scene have meet and 
discussed is a gain facilitated by Bucharest for the cause of 
peace in former Yugoslavia," said President Iliescu.

<F P=106> [Article by Christopher Lord, professor of international </F>
politics, Charles University, Prague: "The West Europeanization 
of `Not Western Europe'"] 
  [Text] The following is based on an address delivered 
March 10 at an international conference titled "Civil-Military 
Relations in a Democracy" in the National Assembly of 
Slovenia. 
  First I must excuse my clumsy title. Originally I wrote "The 
Europeanization of the Balkans," which seems on the face of it 
easier to understand. But as I reflected on the problem a little 
more, it occurred to me that this political question affects not 
just the Balkans, but the entire post-Soviet complex of 
countries and territories, some "European," some "Asian" and 
some lying somewhere in between. Many writers these days use 
expressions such as "Central and Eastern Europe" or "Central, 
Eastern and Southeastern Europe," but it seems to me that these 
expressions are actually dishonest. They are used to suggest 
that a place called "Eastern Europe" does exist somewhere or 
other, but that the particular country or countries being 
discussed are not necessarily part of it. 
  The only thing that really unites all the countries we might 
want to talk about is that they are not--not so far, anyway--in 
Western Europe. For that reason, then, I have decided to adopt 
the term suggested by Michelle Bertelli: "Not Western Europe." 
  The difficulty of locating Eastern Europe on a map these 
days--does any country now identify itself as East 
European?--leads me to suspect that "Europe" itself is merely 
the figment of our political imagination. But "Western Europe" 
anyway does seem to have a real meaning, even if the West 
European identity, too, is vague in places. 
  So I hope this is enough to explain my title. What I want to 
analyze is the spread of the political culture of Western Europe 
to countries formerly under Soviet Marxist-Leninist, Titoist, 
Hoxhaist and other so-called "socialist" regimes. 
  As a resident of the Czech Republic and a visitor to 
Slovenia, I am struck by the fact that these two countries both 
now look like very good candidates for integration into Western 
Europe at an early date. This naturally leads to self-satisfied 
self-congratulation from the populations, and also maybe some 
envy from neighboring states. 
  But apart from these emotional reactions--and I would say 
that most of the political rhetoric we hear about "peace," 
"security," "democracy" and so on is in reality merely 
emotional--perhaps we can suggest some objective reasons why 
this might be the case, and this will then help us to understand 
some larger issues. 
  There are, I think, three factors that link the Czech 
Republic and Slovenia. The first is the preservation of the 
broadly liberal intellectual habits of the professional people 
in society; the second is a more or less homogeneous population 
(in terms of national self-identification, anyway); and the 
third is the existence of appropriate borders isolating that 
population from neighboring groups. 
  First, the intellectual culture. It should be obvious to 
anyone with the smallest knowledge of "Not Western Europe" that 
only a few people had any serious involvement in its political 
structures. While many people felt compelled to use Party 
jargon, and maybe attend some "political" social and sporting 
events, most people simply tried to get on with their lives and 
pursued private interests. For educated, professional people, 
these interests were reading, writing, playing chess or a 
musical instrument, visiting the theater, the ballet or the 
opera--the kind of intellectual interests, in fact, that sadly 
have decayed in the West. Now, these people, who are mostly 
still just trying to get on with their lives and struggling to 
make sense of the chaos of transition, represent a reservoir of 
civilized values that is crucial for the process of cultural and 
political regeneration we can call "democratization." 
  Without naming names, countries that abandon these values 
and, instead of preserving some version of this intellectual 
culture, seek to set up some more fanatical, extremist set of 
values, are not likely to be accepted into Western Europe. So 
this is one factor. 
  The second and third factors are related to the idea of the 
nation-state. Countries hoping to join Western Europe will have 
to resemble West European countries first. And to do that they 
need to fulfill two conditions: have a homogeneous population 
and be isolated in their own territory. This is a 
political-cultural demand made by the West European countries, 
which are apparently not able or willing to deal with other 
countries on any other basis. 
  France is the territory where the French people live; 
Portugal is the land of the Portuguese. And Western Europe as a 
whole, with a common political-cultural origin in the successor 
state of the disintegrated Western Roman Empire, is now 
searching blindly for its own reflection in the turbulent waters 
of the very large and very chaotic political-cultural complex on 
its eastern border. 
  According to these criteria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia 
come out pretty near the top of the list--though, of course, we 
can add some remarks and qualifications. Czech bourgeois 
intellectual values look as solid as ever. The Czechs tolerate 
some political extremism, certainly, but this is a sign of 
political maturity and not of failure or incompetence. There is 
a characteristic style of skeptical intellectualism which, 
whatever other defects it might have, is unlikely to provide a 
basis for ideologies of hatred and fanaticism. 
  The territorial question is closely bound up with the 
"divorce" with Slovakia. This was accepted, in the end, as a sad 
necessity, though it disrupted life for many people. It was most 
difficult for those caught on the "other side," but now that the 
situation is more or less stable, we can say that the Slovaks 
now living in the Czech Republic are living as Czechs--either as 
actual Czech citizens, or at least as permanent members of the 
Czech population. Since they share a common recent history and 
Czechoslovak political culture, this means that the criterion of 
homogeneity is more or less fulfilled--adding the qualification 
that the smaller populations of Romanies, Germans, Poles and 
others are not numerous or well-organized enough to have a 
material effect on political life. 
  The same thing cannot be said for Slovakia, where there is a 
large and politically active Hungarian population. The division 
of Czechoslovakia has created an imbalance as far as my two 
criteria are concerned--and so we see that the Czech Republic is 
closer to integration, for these objective reasons, than the 
Slovak Republic. The mismatch between borders and populations 
means that Slovakia will have to solve its problems with Hungary 
before it can look like an acceptable nation-state as far as the 
West is concerned. 
  Hungary is locked in a similar situation with Romania, and 
other countries meshed into this "Not Western Europe" type of 
cross-border politics will find it significantly more difficult 
to reorient themselves to the political-cultural values of the 
West. 
  Slovenia is also in a "proto-nation-state" condition, but 
for 
very different reasons. Having escaped the Yugoslav wars by a 
whisker, the Slovenes now find themselves in a state of their 
own. There are no significant enclaves of "foreign" populations 
inside Slovenia and no significant exclaves of Slovenes outside 
the country. Business seems to be booming, even if most of it is 
probably black (or at least dark gray), and the language of 
everyday politics is calm and professional--definitely not the 
case in some other former Yugoslav republics one could mention. 
  To take the argument a little further, let's look at 
Kazakhstan, the only post-Soviet state in which the titular 
population, the Kazakhs, is actually a minority. The approximate 
figures are 40 percent Kazakh, 38 percent Russian and 22 percent 
others, including 5 percent Germans and, bizarrely, a small 
minority of Czechs. Although the borders of this very large 
country (2.7 million square kilometers) may roughly correspond 
to the boundaries of the territories over which the originally 
nomadic Kazakh tribes once roamed, the territory is not at all 
homogeneous, since in many areas Russians and Kazakhs live 
separate if parallel cultural lives. 
  Kazakhstan is very far from being a "nation-state." And if 
we 
put Kazakhstan at the far end of the spectrum of integration, we 
can at last compare the prospects of the various candidates for 
West Europeanization according to objective criteria. 
  Estonia, say, despite its very civilized population, must be 
placed closer to the Kazakh end of the spectrum. Its territory 
is at present also home to a large population of Russians, most 
of whom are certainly not living as Estonians, but still enjoy 
the vodka-and-misery lifestyle of the dear old USSR. 
  If we want to find another country to put somewhere near the 
top of the list, Poland looks like a good bet. Its population is 
pretty much homogeneous, but it doesn't quite fulfill the border 
requirement, since a significant number of Poles reside in 
neighboring countries. This problem is most serious in 
Lithuania; but while this makes Polish-Lithuanian relations a 
bit sticky it does not actually create any serious international 
difficulties for Poland. 
  By the same logic, we could put Hungary and Albania on the 
list, but significantly lower down, because of the difficulties 
experienced by Hungarians and Albanians living in other states. 
Readers will be able to fill in the names of whatever other 
states they may be interested in. 
  What are the consequences of this analysis for practical 
policy? Let's take a look at two other countries with extremely 
serious and difficult problems: the Russian Federation and the 
rump Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
  It is quite clear that these tow countries at present fail 
to 
fulfill our three criteria, and by wide margins. In the case of 
Russia, though, I think we must still be patient, since it is 
still in a phase of transition, and the wide swings in Russia's 
internal politics illustrate the instability of its general 
situation. The populations and borders bear little relationship 
to one another, and due to the enormous expansion of the various 
incarnations of the Russian state, there are many enclaves of 
other populations still living on their ancient homelands within 
what we tend to think of as "Russia." Add to this mix the 
effects of the large population movements of the Soviet period, 
and the result if a Russian-speaking federation that is actually 
polycultural and polynational. 
  I would like to draw one important conclusion from this in 
connection with the rump Yugoslavia. In the USSR, there was an 
attempt to create a synthetic Homo sovieticus Soviet 
nationality; Marshal Tito made a similar effort with the 
so-called Yugoslavs. When the Yugoslav Federation began to break 
up, under complex and tragic circumstances, the West, in a 
political reflex action, tried to find a Yugoslav nation-state 
to bargain with. This had the immediate effect of giving 
international legitimacy to the factions in the Yugoslav 
People's Army and elsewhere who were soon to bring the phrase 
"ethnic cleansing" to the ears of a horrified world. 
  It would be too much to suggest that the West is responsible 
for the wars of the former Yugoslavia; but the blind policy of 
seeking West-European-type nation-states where none existed 
before has definitely contributed to the tragedy. 
  What is the alternative? It is to deal with states and 
populations as they actually are, and not as we might like them 
to be in some "European" fantasy world. The fact that 
Kazakhstan, for example, does not have the population structure 
of a West European nation-state does not mean it should 
automatically and permanently be excluded from the political, 
cultural and economic life of the international community. 
  What right do we have to penalize states just because they 
are culturally pluralistic? We should develop a political 
culture sophisticated enough to deal with the objective 
complexities of the problem concerned. 
  And lest anyone think this is just a theoretical or abstract 
problem, let me leave you with this thought: 
  The political and cultural structure of Yugoslavia had many 
things in common with that of the USSR, to the point that many 
analysts speak of Yugoslavia as the USSR in miniature. Apart 
from differences of scale, though, there is also the difference 
that the former USSR still has a formidable nuclear arsenal at 
its disposition. If the Soviet successor states, by the same 
logic, and supported by an indifferent "Europeanizing" Western 
policy, begin to follow the same path of expulsion and genocide 
in the name of national purity, then I for one will be moving to 
Africa.

  [Text] Tirana, April 22 (ATA) -- The Tirana district 
attorney has sent the case of Ramiz Alia to the court for trial. 
To be tried along with Alia are former government officials 
Adil Carcani, Manush Myftiu, Rita Marko, Simon Stefani, Hekuran 
Isai, Aranit Cela, Zylyftar Ramizi, Rrapi Mino, and Veiz Haderi. 
The pre-trial investigations have lasted nearly a year. 
  The accused are charged with conspiracy leading to the 
misappropriation of state property in the amount worth 2,883,502 
leks. They are also charged with abuse of office and violation 
of the fundamental rights of citizens resulting in economic 
damages of 484,778 leks. 
  The results of the investigation are held to show that these 
crimes were committed while the accused were serving in high 
government and party posts in deliberate violation of judicial 
norms and laws in force at the time. 
  Among the acts constituting the violation of the civil 
rights 
of citizens were the execution of 22 persons without trial in 
1951 and the subsequent falsifying of court records. 
  Other former high officials of party and state shown by the 
investigation to be involved in planning and carrying out these 
criminal acts were: Enver Hoxha, Mehmet Shehu, Kadri Hasbiu, 
Beqir Balluku, Nevzat Haznedari, Edip Cuci, Shuaip Panariti, 
Vangjel Kocani, and Siri Carcani. These persons will, however, 
not be tried because they are dead or missing or the statute of 
limitations has expired. 
  The evictions and dislocations of thousands of people were 
carried out in illegal fashion by special administrative organs, 
when these actions were used as forms of punishment for various 
civil acts. 
  These activities by the former organs of state security were 
approved by the Politburo and carried out in secret in violation 
of the Constitution and other laws in force. These practises 
resulted in a pattern of continuous, systematic abuses of the 
inviolability of the person (including loss of life) and 
property of the citizen and the violation of his fundamental 
rights including freedom of speech, assembly, press and other 
forms of communication. 
  The accused are charged with complicity in the 1990 killing 
along the state borders of persons held to be committing treason 
by illegally trying to leave the country. To the charges of 
murder in these cases has been added that of the desecration of 
the bodies in order to create an atmosphere of intimidation 
among the population. 
  Finally, the indictment holds the accused responsible for 
the 
anti-constitutional acts during 1967-1976 of forbidding the 
practice of religion and the destruction of religious properties 
of great historical and cultural value.

<F P=106> ["Albania Continues To Suffer Economic Damage Due to the </F>
Embargo on Former Yugoslavia" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, April 23 (ATA) -- Albanian Government's 
observation of the embargo on former Yugoslavia has seriously 
damaged the mineral industry in the northeastern zone of 
Albania. The mine of Kam, Tropoje district, is mostly suffering 
the consequences of the embargo. Its productive activity is 
almost suspended. 
  Earlier, the mine exported chrome ore for the enriching 
factory of "Deva" of Gjakove in Kosova. Due to the application 
of the embargo for 1992-1993 alone, about 60,000 tons of mineral 
were not exported causing an economic damage of about 2.7 
million dollars. Three productive sectors have been closed and 
about 250 workers are on assistance. Annual production has 
dropped about 17,000 tons from 60,000 tons it was earlier. So 
far, the respective structures of the United Nations 
Organisation have not done anything to compensate the damage 
caused by the implementation of the embargo on former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Tirana, April 23 (ATA) -- "The recent detention by 
the Ministry of Public Order are not and has not been done on 
basis of nationality but according to their citizenship," the 
spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday, 
commenting on the detention for keeping arms without permission, 
drugs and criminal anticonstitutional activity. 
  The spokesman said that the Ministry of Public Order 
possesses incontestable proofs and will make them available for 
any international investigating commission interested in them. 
"Each Albanian citizen is equal before the law and the 
intervention of any state for protecting them is unacceptable. 
Such acts violate the sovereignty of the Albanian state," the 
spokesman concludes. 
  Some 11 persons have been detained for keeping arms without 
permission and many criminal anti-constitutional documentations 
during a control made recently by the Ministry of Public Order. 
The documentations proves the Greek expansionist intentions 
against Albania and the Greek flagrant endeavour to Hellenize 
the Albania's southern territories.

  [Text] Tirana, April 24 (ATA) -- The Constitution of the 
Republic of Montenegro recognizes the right of the use of the 
two languages, but this right has been not applied for the 
Albanians. The inscriptions and names of places in the Albanian 
language are disappearing with each passing day. Albanian 
toponymy is in the objective of destruction and with thus 
eliminating the traces of civilization and the presence of the 
Albanians as well. Wherever you are in Ulqin, you could hardly 
understand where you are. Everywhere you can read ULCINJ, 
according to a report in RILINDJA. The Albanian names of the 
places have been changed in order to eliminate the Albanian 
identity of the toponymy. Changes of the pure Albanian names 
have been also made in the official administration and they are 
now being applied in the schools and even in the diplomas of the 
Albanian students who have attended classes in Albanian schools.

<F P=106> ["Bulgaria Keeps Neither Its Own Nor Somebody Else's </F>
Chemical Weapons, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Says" -- BTA 
headline] 
  [Text] Sofia, April 25 (BTA) -- "Bulgaria keeps neither 
its own nor somebody else's chemical weapons. We are absolutely 
clean in this respect," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav 
Daskalov today told Mr. Ian Kenyon, Executive Secretary of the 
Steering Committee for the setting up of an organization seeking 
a ban on chemical weapons, who is now visiting Bulgaria. BTA 
learned this from a Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  Mr. Daskalov reportedly briefed the guest on an April 11 
cabinet decisions providing for the introduction at parliament 
of a bill on the ratification of the chemical weapons 
convention. The convention was signed by the foreign ministers 
of 126 countries, Bulgaria including, at a 1992 Paris meeting, 
to introduce a ban on the development, production, piling and 
use of chemical weapons and provide for their destruction. 
  Foreign Minister Daskalov stressed that the forthcoming 
ratification of this convention is consistent with Bulgaria's 
interests. Joining the European structures, which is this 
country's major aspiration, entails accession to all 
international accords pertaining to the arms control and 
particularly the control on mass annihilations arms, Mr. 
Daskalov also said. 
  The talks stressed that Bulgaria has an advanced chemical 
industry and is therefore a potential producer of chemical 
weapons, this Foreign Ministry spokesman also said. For this 
reason, and under the clauses of the effective international 
agreements, this country is liable to international control. 
The committee will undertake the training of Bulgarian experts 
in this sphere. 
  Asked whether the talks touched upon the possible use of 
chemical weapons by any of the sides involved in the 
Yugoconflict, this spokesman answered in the negative. However, 
Mr. Daskalov reportedly expressed Bulgaria's stance, that "being 
situated in a highly neuralgic area, it is interested in finding 
a complex solution to the problem pertaining to the ban and 
destruction of mass annihilation arms".

  [Text] Sofia, April 25 (BTA) -- A Bulgarian-Iranian Joint 
Committee on Economic and Technical Cooperation today started a 
sitting here. It was opened by Bulgarian delegation head 
Transport Minister Kiril Ermenkov and his Iranian counterpart 
Transport Minister 'Ali Akbar Torkan. The sitting was also 
attended by Iran's Ambassador here Mohammed 'Ali Kormi Nuri. 
The sides were unanimous that the business and economic 
contacts between the two countries of the past 2 or 3 years are 
not at the desirable level. According to them, this situation 
was brought about by the reforms under way in Bulgaria and the 
plummeting international oil prices. 
  The joint committee will sit in separate groups in charge of 
industry, agriculture, trade and banking, oil and gas, transport 
and communications, technical and scientific cooperation. The 
Bulgarian side is expected to raise the issue of overdue 
receivables of Bulgarian companies for a total of about $27 
million. 
  The Iranian delegation, including 20 business circles 
representatives will hold talks at the Council of Ministers and 
meet National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB) Governor Prof. Todor 
Vulchev and the ministers of trade and industry. The guests are 
planning tomorrow to visit Burgas to consider the possibilities 
for joint exploitation of transport technologies. They are also 
expected to visit the Port of Burgas. Meeting with Bulgarian 
President Zhelyu Zhelev is also on the agenda, the Transport 
Ministry Press Office said. The joint committee is expected to 
end its work with the signing of four bilateral accords and a 
concluding document. 
  Bulgaria has longstanding relations with Iran. The Bulgarian 
companies Agrocomplekt, Balkancar, Balkancarpodem, Machinoexport 
and Electroimpex have established stable positions in Iran. 
According to 1993 customs figures, Bulgarian exports to Iran 
amounted to slightly over $18 million, of which metal processing 
equipment, unprocessed zinc, minerals and chemical fertilizers 
have the greatest share. Bulgaria has imported some $149 
million-worth goods from Iran, of which crude oil and lubricants 
accounted for 97.5 percent. In January 1994 the two countries' 
foreign ministers signed an agreement on economic and business 
cooperation which has yet to be endorsed by the two parliaments. 
Agreements on double taxation avoidance and reciprocal 
investments protection and promotion are currently being drafted. 
  The previous sitting of the Joint Committee on Economic and 
Technical Cooperation was held in Iran in October 1993.

  [Text] Sofia, April 22 (BTA) -- "I am happy that my 
appointment as Macedonia's first ambassador to Bulgaria 
coincides with the visit by Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov, 
which is an expression of the highest degree of good relations," 
the newly appointed Ambassador of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] to Bulgaria, Georgi Spasov, told 
a news conference today. The president of Macedonia will pay his 
first official visit on April 25-26 this year at the invitation 
of Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  "The presidents of Bulgaria and Macedonia will consider the 
situation in the Balkans after NATO's military intervention in 
Bosnia Herzegovina and the acceleration of economic ties between 
Bulgaria and Macedonia," Mr. Spasov said. In his opinion, there 
is a high degree of agreement between Bulgaria and Macedonia 
about the problems of all-Balkan policy. Asked about his 
opinion on the idea of an all-Balkan peace conference, Mr. 
Spasov stated that the peace conference idea is acceptable for 
Macedonia, provided all the Balkan countries take part in it. 
  "The Macedonian president will come to Sofia accompanied by 
the two vice presidents, Jovan Andov and Riste Ivanov," Mr. 
Spasov said. "As the time for arranging the visit is short, the 
experts will not be able to prepare the agreements on the 
encouragement of investments and the avoidance of double 
taxation for signing at a governmental level," he explained. In 
Mr. Spasov's view, although the agreement on the construction of 
a railway line between Bulgaria and Macedonia as part of the 
East-West trans-Balkan highway will not be signed too, its 
construction is expected to begin in May and be finished in 
about a year. There is no railway between Bulgaria and 
Macedonia, they are connected only by three motor roads. 
  Bulgaria and Macedonia raised their diplomatic relations to 
the level of embassies in December last year. Until then they 
had consulates general in Sofia and Skopje respectively. 
Bulgaria was the first country in the world which recognized 
Macedonia's independence in February 1992.

  [Text] Sofia, April 25 (BTA) -- The present state of 
bilateral relations and prospects for their development, the 
conflicts in the Balkans and in Transcaucasia were the main 
issues which Armenian Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan, who 
arrived on a three-day visit this morning, discussed with 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. They signed an 
agreement on cooperation in culture, science and education. 
Later on Papazyan and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Trade Valentin Karabashev signed a trade and economic 
cooperation accord. These are the first bilateral documents 
signed by Bulgaria and Armenia. 
  "I believe the two agreements would provide the legal 
framework for the relations which Bulgaria and Armenia are 
willing to develop on the basis of their historical links", 
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov told reporters. 
He was optimistic about the relations between the two 
countries. His view was shared by his Armenian counterpart. 
"Considering the historical relations between our countries, we 
must promote our relations at all levels", Mr. Papazyan said. 
  The two foreign ministers agreed to start preparations for 
the signing of an agreement on friendship and cooperation 
between Bulgaria and Armenia. Mr. Daskalov has already received 
Armenia's draft agreement. The Bulgarian proposal is also under 
way and the agreement will be signed as soon as the experts are 
ready with it, Mr. Daskalov told reporters. The two foreign 
ministers exchanged information about the situation in the 
Balkans and the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the two countries' 
relations with the neighbouring countries and the priorities in 
the foreign policies of Bulgaria and Armenia. 
  Mr. Daskalov and Mr. Papazyan discussed the possibilities 
for 
activating the economic contacts which are now hampered by the 
regional conflicts in the Caucasus. They discussed the 
possibilities for joint actions within the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation, for promotion of relations in culture, art and 
education. 
  The promotion of bilateral relations in the economy was high 
on the agenda of the talks between Papazyan and Bulgarian Trade 
Minister Karabashev. Under the trade and economic cooperation 
accord, Bulgaria and Armenia grant each other a most favoured 
nation status in tariffs, indirect taxes and other charges on 
imports, payments and in the sales, shipment, storage, etc., of 
goods on the domestic market. The accord expires in five years 
and can be automatically extended. It provides for the exchange 
of economic information and the establishment of an 
intergovernment committee on trade-economic and 
scientific-technological cooperation. 
  Papazyan and Karabashev shared the view the level of 
bilateral trade is far lower than what it can be. Trade in 1993 
amounted to $1.5 million, down from $3 million in 1992. "We 
coordinated a programme for further cooperation", the Armenian 
minister said after meeting with Karabashev. A package of 
economic agreements is to be prepared and is expected to be 
signed within a few months. "Such a package is a must, as we 
should lay the legal groundwork of our relations", said the 
chief Armenian diplomat. 
  The promotion of relations was further discussed at 
Papazyan's meeting with National Assembly Deputy Chairman Yordan 
Shkolagerski. "There have never been any problems between the 
Bulgarian and Armenian peoples", said Shkolagerski. About 
20,000 Armenians live in Bulgaria and they are well-integrated 
in public life here, according to him. Papazyan and 
Shkolagerski committed themselves to establishing friendship 
groups in the two parliaments. 
  Papazyan will tomorrow visit Plovdiv and meet in the evening 
with representatives of the Armenian community in Bulgaria. On 
Wednesday he will be received by President Zhelev.

  [Text] Blagoevgrad, Rozhen Monastery, April 23 (BTA) -- 
Acting on an order by the governor of the Sofia region and a 
directive by the regional prosecutor in Sandanski (southwestern 
Bulgaria), the police took measures to prevent an assembly of 
the Ilinden United Macedonian Organization (OMO) from taking 
place near the Rozhen Monastery today. 
  In a press release the regional directorate of the interior 
in Blagoevgrad said the assembly intended to mark the 79th death 
anniversary of Yane Sandanski (a prominent figure in Bulgaria's 
struggle against Ottoman rule) was against the law and 
anti-Bulgarian in orientation. The public was advised against 
travelling in the vicinity of the Rozhen Monastery. The 
regional directorate also warned that it would take the 
necessary lawful measures to prevent events violating the 
Constitution. 
  Blagoevgrad police had an anonymous call last night warning 
that unless the ban on OMO Ilinden's assembly was lifted, a shop 
in town would be blown up. The threat was a hoax. 
  Some one hundred OMO Ilinden followers gathered at the most. 
At the same time, day trippers from Sofia, Gabrovo and other 
parts of the country visited the Rozhen Monastery. Believers 
lit candles and laid bunches of lilac at the grave of Yane 
Sandanski. Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev today visited the 
monastery. 
  "OMO Ilinden has not formally asked permission as required 
under the law for the assembly near Rozhen on April 24, 1994; 
therefore, the Ministry of the Interior will take measures to 
maintain law and order in the area," Interior Minister Viktor 
Mikhaylov told reporters a week ago. He denied that members of 
the organization have been ill-treated or barred from 
employment, as Ilinden representatives alleged at a recent news 
conference. 
  OMO Ilinden has been denied court registration in Bulgaria 
because its "actions, rules and programme contravene the 
Constitution," which prohibits organizations that "act to the 
detriment of the country's sovereignty and national integrity, 
or the unity of the nation, or that incite racial, ethnic, or 
religious hatred" and forbids the formation of political parties 
"along religious, ethnic, or racial lines."

  [Text] Prague April 25 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel writes in the European Union (EU) magazine EVROPA that 
Europe cannot be built up according to beforehand known and 
tested prescriptions. The first issue of the magazine, a 
bi-monthly which already appears in EU member states and is a 
forum for debate about EU issues in all spheres, comes out in 
the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary in their 
national languages for the first time today. 
  Reflecting upon the reasons which have prevented Europe from 
becoming a continent of peace, cooperation and equal chances for 
all and from establishing the feelings of certainty, trust and 
peace after the fall of communism, Havel says that the dramatic 
changes of the past years and the resurfacing of spectres of the 
past challenge some not much direct and sometimes cheap 
optimistic concepts. 
  But Havel says he still believes there is a chance for 
Europe 
to gradually become a large community based on the principle of 
"unity in diversity." It is natural that there are also 
skeptical moods and disappointment over the pace of changes and 
that the new democracies even feel "abandoned" by the others, he 
says. 
  In conclusion, Havel stresses that he personally supports 
European integration which he sees as the only road not only for 
Europe, but for the whole of the world. 
  Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec says in an interview 
for the magazine that Europe would not be complete without the 
Czech Republic. He points out that Europe has been living 
together with the other nations (now EU members) for centuries. 
"I do not think that Germany should be Europe's border," he says. 
  Zieleniec says that European integration is sometimes viewed 
as a historical opportunity to build Czech-German relations, 
which have always been close, but from time to time tragical, on 
new bases as was the case of other small nations such as the 
Netherlands and Belgium. 
  The Czech Republic's integration into the EU together with 
free movement of people and capital could make a full stop after 
some problems at last. "Both countries have re-evaluated their 
own history and searched for a new future," Zieleniec stresses. 
  He says that the Partnership for Peace plan is much more 
interesting from the political than military point of view. 
Zieleniec says that it would not matter if the Czech Republic 
was the first Central European country admitted into NATO, but 
it does not want to be left alone. "It is in our best interests 
that our neighbours be in the same military bloc as we. It 
would be unfortunate if Slovakia, Austria or any-one else became 
part of another security grouping than we," Zieleniec stresses.

  [Text] Prague, April 23 (CTK) -- The situation in the 
former Yugoslavia was one of the main themes of his 
conversations with French Defence Minister Francois Leotard, 
Czech Defence Minister Antonin Baudys told journalists on his 
return from France this evening. 
  He said Friday's NATO ultimatum was a stepping up of 
pressure 
on the Serbs to abandon their war attempts and to allow the 
situation to be settled by diplomatic negotiation. 
  A new element in the ultimatum, he said, was that it no 
longer referred to a single war area but was extended to all the 
other areas mentioned in the relevant UN Security Council 
resolutions. 
  Another of the main themes of his talks was the role of 
Russia in contemporary Europe, Baudys said. The Czech Republic 
had to be interested in the question, because Russia was still a 
military superpower. They had talked about several features of 
Russian military doctrine, and Leotard had told him about his 
recent talks with Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev. 
  None of the information recently spread in the Czech media 
that the smallpox virus had been stored in the Czech Republic 
had been shown to be correct, Baudys said. However, he admitted 
that a small quantity of the variola minor virus had been 
stored. Variola minor causes an illness which is very close to 
smallpox (variola maior), but which can have an easier course. 
  Baudys said that the spreading of such information, which 
was 
not based on the truth and yet concerned the credibility of the 
state or created the impression of high insecurity was not 
proper.

  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- Various political parties 
have recently stepped up their activities in the security 
sphere, obviously in connection with the (forthcoming) local 
elections, Czech Interior Minister Jan Ruml said at a press 
conference today. 
  "I think it would be rather unfortunate for the security 
sphere to become a political battlefield. The theme is too 
serious. On the other hand, of course, we welcome suggestions 
from various political parties, and deal with them with all 
earnestness," Ruml said. 
  Many measures have been taken to regulate mainly common and 
economic crime. Certain positive trends can already be 
registered, Ruml said. 
  The Interior Ministry has been dealing with organized crime 
within a long-term program. "We have no experience of our own 
with the broad organized crime, and we are only beginning to 
register some displays of it. We must be seeking our own 
solution to this sort of problems...," Ruml said, adding that it 
was not possible to copy the legislation of other countries 
automatically. 
  Ruml said experts were considering whether it would be 
expedient to pass a separate bill on fighting organized crime, 
or merely to amend some provisions of the Penal Code and the Law 
on the Czech Police. He gave examples of possible security 
measures to be taken, such as the checking of suspect shipments, 
confiscation of property originating from organized crime and 
its possible use in fighting crime, as well as the detention of 
a thing for a certain time if there exists suspicion that the 
thing was stolen. 
  Police experts have been carefully considering the 
establishment of institutions of "latent investigators" and the 
possibility of a legal provocation of crime, Ruml said. 
  The protection of personal documents against counterfeiting 
is to be an important measure to prevent car thefts. The 
ministry has been preparing a new type of certificate on the 
technical condition of a vehicle, and evaluating proposals for 
the production of personal documents that cannot be 
counterfeited, Ruml said. He pointed out that the main problem 
in car thefts is that false documents are procured immediately 
and the cars are smuggled abroad. 
  Ruml dismissed the Czech Army's possible assistance in the 
struggle against organized crime. The Army is being built for 
another purpose, he noted.

  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- An inter-departmental 
commission will be set up to draft a law ending abuse of the 
legal host requirement for citizens from Russia, Ukraine, 
Romania, and Bulgaria seeking to reside in the Czech Republic, 
Interior Minister Jan Ruml announced at a press conference 
today. The law should also make regulatory measures more 
effective in relation to citizens from countries with which the 
Czech Republic has an agreement waiving the visa requirement, he 
said. 
  The inter-departmental commission is to be composed of 
representatives from the ministries of the interior, foreign 
affairs, and the economy. 
  Ruml said some 100,000 foreigners have long term residence 
in 
the Czech Republic. Stricter requirements are under preparation 
which will lead to only those who have a genuine interest in 
working or studying in the Czech Republic being granted 
residence permission, he said. 
  Legislation is also being prepared whereby a Czech citizen 
who invites a foreigner who later undertakes criminal activity 
will have to pay the cost of his expulsion. Ruml said he 
expected the bill to find support among members of parliament. 
  The commission will also consider raising the charges 
related 
to the invitation of a foreigner. In Slovakia, Ruml pointed 
out, the charges have already risen to 1,000 crowns (about $30).

  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic's 
Nuclear Safety Office imposed a fine of 500,000 crowns (over 
$17.200) on the Czech Power Company (CEZ) for breaching an 
Office regulation concerning the nuclear power plant now under 
construction in Temelin, south Bohemia. 
  Under the regulation, the assembly of the equipment at the 
first bloc of the Temelin project was to be halted until certain 
shortcomings were removed, Miroslav Kejval from the Green Party 
(SZ) said at a press conference today. 
  CEZ spokesman Miroslav Novak said the fine was imposed on 
CEZ 
as early as last September in punishment [for] not removing 
waste from a "clean" assemblage, despite a warning from the 
Nuclear Safety Office. The fine was lowered to 300,000 crowns 
after all circumstances were clarified, he explained. The 
shortcomings unveiled by the Office were promptly put right and 
construction continued, Novak said. 
  If the district authority in Ceske Budejovice believes a 
change in the automatic command system at the Temelin station to 
be essential, the project's construction would have to undergo 
new approval procedure, according to Kejval. The procedure 
could be initiated by the Environment Ministry, district 
authority or mayors of towns standing to be affected by a 
Temelin accident, Kejval said. The SZ, along with their 
colleagues from Austria and Germany, were to initiate the 
procedure because they viewed the above change as fundamental, 
he added. 
  It is impossible to speak about any new license for the 
construction of the whole Temelin station, Novak stressed, 
saying any new approval procedure would concern only the 
essential changes themselves.

  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- Completion of the south 
Bohemian nuclear power plant at Temelin is not questioned by the 
Czech Government or any other institution, Trade and Industry 
Minister Vladimir Dlouhy told journalists today. No new law is 
necessary to allow the Temelin's completion. The plant's 
construction continues as scheduled, Dlouhy said. 
  Frantisek Benda, the Czech Minister for the Environment, 
said 
in early April that Temelin could not be made operational before 
a so- called "nuclear law" was adopted. He added at the time 
that unless such a law were passed, he would not give his 
go-ahead for Temelin's operation. 
  The Ministry for Trade and Industry is responsible for work 
on a bill on peaceful use of nuclear energy and ionizing 
radiation that should thoroughly integrate regulations in the 
sector. 
  The present legislation is adequate, Dlouhy said. A nuclear 
law will come to be needed mainly when the Czech Republic has 
two nuclear power plants (in Temelin and Dukovany, South 
Moravia) producing 40 percent of the Czech power output. 
  The government has unanimously agreed on Temelin's 
completion. The plant's repercussions on the environment were 
discussed at the time when planning permission was issued and 
again after 1989, Dlouhy said, adding that changes in the 
plant's project which came out of the discussions would increase 
the plant's safety and lessen its impact on the environment.

  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The Privatization 
Ministry will not allow the National Property Fund (FNM) to 
liquidate any of the companies designated for the second coupon 
privatization wave before the wave has been completed, Deputy 
Privatization Minister Roman Ceska told CTK today. He admitted 
that some companies will probably go bankrupt when the wave has 
been completed. 
  "The ministry wants to keep the companies at least until two 
months after the shares have been issued to coupon holders, so 
that the new owners would get a chance to take a stance on the 
situation," Ceska said. 
  The FNM's Executive Committee decided on April 18 to propose 
the liquidation of Zemedelske Stavby of Zatec and that it be 
excluded from the list of companies designated for the second 
wave. FNM's Chairman Tomas Jezek said Friday [22 April] that a 
similar fate was awaiting other companies earmarked for the 
second wave. 
  Ceska admitted today that the list of companies designated 
for the second wave includes also "bad companies where 
bankruptcy is being considered." He added that the Privatization 
Ministry had no signs that some of the companies were "bankrupt" 
before their inclusion in the second wave was set. Analyses of 
some companies only indicated a decrease in their capital stock. 
  Ceska rejected Jezek's idea that a company proposed for 
liquidation would be excluded from the list for the second wave 
and the points returned to investors, saying it was unfeasible. 
The commission which stipulates the prices of companies for 
individual rounds has no means with which to return points which 
have already been invested. 
  Ceska is convinced that liquidation of a company after the 
end of the second wave does not necessarily mean a loss for the 
investors. "A liquidation does not mean that a shareholder 
cannot acquire anything at all. There may be left over capital 
which at a certain price rate can be more interesting than 
shares of the best companies," Ceska said. 
  Jezek said on Friday that one of the reasons why the FNM 
wanted to speed up liquidating bad companies was "unfairness" to 
investors. When liquidating a company, creditors are satisfied 
first and the remainder is what is left when the company's 
obligations have been settled, he said.

  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The method of 
privatization of the Czech petrochemical industry will be 
determined at a meeting of economic ministers within two to 
three weeks, said Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy 
today. Regardless of their decision, the following requirements 
will be upheld, said Dlouhy. 
  1.) There will be no quotas or other trade barriers set for 
petrochemical products and oil imported into the Czech Republic; 
  2.) Certain uniform direction of the two main petrochemical 
enterprises, Kaucuk Kralupy and Chemopetrol Litvinov, must be 
ensured; 
  3.) The decision reached at the ministerial meeting on May 
4, 
1993 concerning the separation of refineries from petrochemical 
producers and the creation of one Czech refining company will 
have to be re-assessed and possibly revoked. 
  The first possible method for the oil industry's 
privatization involves the international consortium of Agip, 
Conoco, Shell, and Total, who are interested in Kaucuk and 
Chemopetrol. The second method is the "Czech way," according to 
which the Czech refining and petrochemical industry will remain 
in Czech hands, provided 27 billion crowns be made available for 
its current needs. The latter method would lead to oil being 
imported mostly from Russia, whereas the consortium would import 
oil from other sources as well, said Dlouhy.

  [Text] Prague April 26 (CTK) -- "For the time being, it 
will probably be more useful not to push for the principle of 
exclusive membership -- allowing citizens to be members only of 
a single party -- to be embedded in the law on political 
parties, as time will surely solve this question," the 
right-oriented daily TELEGRAF writes today. 
  Besides the question of the financing and income of 
political 
parties and the possible suspension of their activities, 
exclusive membership is likely the most controversial issue 
linked to the bill on people's associating in political parties 
and movements, which is to be debated in the parliamentary 
session which begins today, the daily states. 
  Coalition deputies insist that exclusive membership be 
included in the bill, while the opposition opposes the idea, 
arguing that the principle would violate the Charter of Human 
Rights and Freedoms, TELEGRAF reports. 
  The new bill is likely to eliminate the possibility of 
collective membership of political parties, which enabled 
political entities to circumvent electoral law, especially 
regarding the minimum percentage of votes required for an 
election coalition to be represented in parliament, the daily 
explains. It gives an example of the Liberal Social Union 
(LSU), which acquired parliamentary seats in the last elections 
though it associated four political entities and its share of 
the vote only slightly surpassed 5 percent. 
  In the last elections, held in June 1992, 5 percent of votes 
were required by law for a party to be represented in 
parliament, while a coalition had to receive 7 percent of the 
vote and more, according to the number of entities associated. 
  Government coalition deputies are afraid that if the new law 
on political parties does not embed exclusive membership, 
electoral law might be circumvented again. "Members of political 
parties wanting to create a latent election coalition, will 
become parallel members of a sort of an umbrella party to 
compose a joint list of candidates," the paper writes. 
  Moreover, the advocates of exclusive membership argue that 
it 
would be "absurd" if one could be simultaneously a member of 
such different parties, as the (extreme-right opposition) 
republicans, the communists and the (government coalition) Civic 
Democratic Alliance (ODA), TELEGRAF notes. 
  However, the Constitution clearly states that people can 
freely associate in any groups, the number of which is 
unlimited, the paper writes. 
  It is not necessary to re-interpret the Constitution and 
push 
for exclusive membership, as time will solve the question. "Now 
most citizens are already reasonable and would not strive for 
membership of two parties. In future, voters will prefer a 
party with a clear structure which could embed exclusive 
membership in its own statutes, to a party trying to gain 
parliament seats at any cost, through various latent 
coalitions," the paper concludes.

  [Text] Budapest, 24 April (MTI) -- "Such a rapid decline of 
the former Soviet Union, the Balkan war, the drought that 
afflicted the country, and the global economic recession could 
not have been predicted," Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross 
said on Sunday [24 April] evening. 
  "However, even amidst such circumstances, Hungary was able 
to 
transform its industrial structure, halt inflation, and the 
government has taken successful steps to find markets for the 
changed agriculture", he added. 
  Speaking at the election rally of the Sopron (western 
Hungary) local organization of the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
[MDF], Boross, who is the prime minister candidate of the MDF, 
pointed out: 
  "Although we have made many mistakes, we have confessed to 
these and have learned from them." 
  Boross voiced the hope that the Hungarian Democratic Forum 
will achieve good results in the May parliamentary elections. 
  "I would like to serve on as prime minister for another four 
years," he said.

  [Text] Budapest, 23 April (MTI) -- The Chairman of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], Ivan Peto, and the Chairman 
of the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ], Viktor Orban, 
agree that the current government coalition will be overthrown 
following the parliamentary elections in May. 
  They said the main question of the elections will be whether 
the citizens will want to replace the coalition with the 
socialist, or with the liberal parties. 
  Both chairmen have high hopes that the four-party liberal 
bloc (SZDSZ, FIDESZ, Entrepreneurs Party, and the Agrarian 
Federation) will score good results in the elections. However, 
while Orban would, in the interest of an election victory, be 
ready to state that the liberal parties would only govern 
together, Peto did not consider this justified. 
  According to the SZDSZ chairman, a government should 
definitely be formed to replace the current one following the 
elections, as otherwise new elections would have to be 
announced, and this would mean that the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum-led government would continue to lead the country until 
January. 
  Peto also denied that the SZDSZ is holding any kind of 
coalition coordination talks with the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP]. 
  The evaluation of the Socialist Party was one of the main 
issues of the remarks made by the two politicians at the 
national meeting of liberal groups in Budapest. 
  Orban again excluded cooperation between the FIDESZ and the 
MSZP, partly because, in is view, the change in generation has 
not taken place within the MSZP.

  [Text] Budapest, 24 April (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] is to decide about participation in a 
government coalition at a delegates assembly following the 
parliamentary elections in May. Until then, it will concentrate 
on achieving a good result at the elections. 
  This earlier decision was confirmed on Sunday [24 April] in 
Budapest, during a meeting by the party's National Council. 
  SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar reported about the 
meeting 
at a press conference. He said that if the SZDSZ achieves a good 
result at the elections, that will imply a guarantee for 
replacing the current government coalition, and for forming a 
new government. Magyar also said that the chances of the SZDSZ 
are now better than ever before, and the party will most 
certainly be a political factor to be reckoned with when forming 
the new government. 
  SZDSZ prime minister candidate Gabor Kuncze briefed 
journalists about his participation in the founding session of 
the Democratic Union of Slovakia, in Bratisla on Saturday [23 
April], and his talks with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik, 
who was elected chairman of the union. 
  Kuncze said the good will exists in Slovakia to settle 
bilateral relations and uphold the dialogue.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 23 -- Industry Minister Marek Pol 
suspended on Friday night [22 April] his decision concerning the 
preparations for the restructuring of the brown coal mining 
sector and appealed to striking miners to end the strike and 
start negotiations immediately. 
  The minister's decision of March 23, 1994 concerned the 
organization of work designed to set up holdings in the power 
engineering sector. Under the decision, the minister appoints 
commissioners for the organization of holdings, establishes task 
teams and defines their competences. The decision provides for 
the establishment of 3 holdings, namely, the Belchatow holding, 
the Konin-Adamow power engineering and fuel holding, and the 
regional Turow brown coal power engineering. 
  The striking miners decided to continue their protest until 
the decision was annulled and not temporarily--as they describe 
it--suspended. 
  Having in mind the existing threat to Poland's power 
engineering security, Minister Pol sent a letter to chairmen of 
the brown coal mining trade union organizations in which he 
informed them that he had suspended the decision. 
  Pol told a press conference on Saturday that "if there were 
no breakdowns in power plants, on Saturday and Sunday there 
should not be any problems with supplies of energy for industry 
and individual customers." The minister added that there might 
be certain restrictions on Monday but the government would try 
to minimize their effects. 
  The minister explained that the decision made on Friday to 
dismiss Deputy Industry Minister Eugeniusz Morawski was caused 
by the "improper implementation of the decision of March 23." 
Pol did not explain what mistakes Morawski had made and added 
the decision to dismiss him was taken by Prime Minister Waldemar 
Pawlak. 
  On Saturday afternoon, the striking miners sent a letter to 
Minister Pol in which they asked him to precisely define whether 
his decision was still binding. In their opinion, the 
suspension of the decision does not mean its annulment. The 
miners decided to continue the strike action. 
  The government press office issued a communique on Saturday 
which said that the suspension of the decision was not accepted 
by the strike committee. 
  In connection with this, the government press office was 
authorized to report that any further decisions by the industry 
minister concerning the issue were not possible without talks 
and exchange of views between the two sides. Minister Pol was 
ready to hold talks concerning industrial questions, the 
communique stressed, adding that other issues should be 
discussed with the Labour Ministry and the tripartite 
commission, the meeting of which would be held on April 29.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 24 -- Lignite miners continued their 
protest action on Sunday [24 April] requesting that the demands 
of the Solidarity trade union and these concerning their branch 
be implemented and the decision on restructuring the lignite 
mining industry be revoked. The strike that started on Thursday 
is to be staged until further notice. 
  In view of the strike adversly affecting the country's power 
resources, Director of the National Power Control Centre Jerzy 
Tabaka on Sunday resolved that radio communiques reporting about 
the power supplies for industry and inhabitants would be resumed 
after a two-year break. 
  Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol appealed to the miners 
to stop their action and start negotiations but the miners 
refused to start talks with the government claiming that the 
decision on the restructuring of lignite industry had not been 
revoked. 
  "Determination among the striking miners is growing and the 
protest action may escalate, leader of the national protest 
action headquarters of the lignite mines Solidarity Union 
Zdzislaw Boksa told PAP on Sunday afternoon. [no closing 
quotation mark as received] 
  Minister Marek Pol confirmed Sunday that he had suspended 
his 
decision concerning transformations in the lignite industry 
until the time the way of transformations is worked out by 
representatives of the government, trade unions and employers. 
  Under Minister Pol's decision the existing lignite mines and 
power engineering plants were to be transformed into three 
holding companies. 
  Head of the National Commission of the Solidarity Trade 
Union 
Marian Krzaklewski said that the government was recognizing the 
strike as a "trial of strength." 
  The striking miners are providing power generating plants 
with only enough fuel to keep the furnaces just operating. 
Officials at the Industry and Trade Ministry responsible for 
the power engineering sector were put on "alert" in connection 
with the strike, Grazyna Lewandowska, spokeswoman for Industry 
and Trade Minister Marek Pol, said Sunday afternoon. 
  She explained that talks with the striking miners can be 
started any time and added that Minister Marek Pol, who had been 
out of Warsaw for personal reasons, would come to the ministry 
on Sunday night. 
  The strike in lignite mines proved to be profitable for hard 
coal power generating plants which say that due to limitations 
in lignite-generated power they are able to sell larger amounts 
of their product. 
  "We are able to satisfy the country's demand for power for a 
certain period of time," Wladyslaw Wojcik from "Siersza" power 
generating plant in Trzebinia, Katowice Province, said. 
  He added that due to the existing situation the plant can 
work "at full steam." The problem is that power generated from 
hard-coal is more expensive due to the costs of hard-coal 
extraction.

  [Text] Kalisz, April 25 -- The All-Poland Strike Committee 
of the brown coal mines addressed a letter to the prime minister 
expressing the hope that the stand of the industry minister 
Marek Pol did not represent the position of the government, 
press spokesman of Solidarity's strike committee at the "Konin" 
mine Zdzislaw Stasiak announced on Monday. 
  We are expecting the prime minister to immediately lift the 
decision concerning the restructuring of the brown coal mining 
industry, Stasiak said. According to him, the responsibility 
for the further development of the situation now rests entirely 
on Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Stasiak added that since the 
industry minister's messages fail to propose any new solutions 
and only increase tension among the strikers "There is no need 
to further exchange correspondence with him".

  [Text] Belchatow, April 25 -- "Even if the government 
withdraws or annuls the decision concerning transformations in 
brown coal mining and establishment of three holdings, the 
Solidarity strike committee of the brown coal mines will not end 
the strike but will only suspend it," Jozef Polkowski, a member 
of the strike committee, told a press conference at the 
Belchatow mine on Monday [25 April]. 
  This would mean an increase of coal deliveries to power 
plants which now receive only strategic amounts of fuel 
necessary to keep them going. 
  Polkowski added that after the decision has been either 
suspended or annulled, the strike committee might start 
negotiations concerning nation-wide demands of the trade union.

  [Text] Katowice, April 25 -- Chairmen of Solidarity hard 
coal workplace committees decided here on Monday [25 April] to 
start a "rotary and indefinite-time" strike in hard coal mines 
on Monday night, head of the Solidarity black coal section Karol 
Luzniak said on Monday. 
  Luzniak stressed the strike would be legal as Solidarity has 
entered into a collective dispute with the government. 
  Meanwhile, 50 Solidarity factory committees confirmed their 
participation in a two-hour warning strike, to be held in 
Poland's central-eastern region on Tuesday, secretary of the 
region board in Lublin Waldemar Dudziak said in Lublin on Monday.

National Power Distribution Office said on Monday [25 April] 
that a planned strike by hard coal miners would not disturb the 
production of electricity, at least for some time. Dobroczek 
said that production of electricity could be continued as power 
plants have stocked enough hard coal.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 25 -- The Solidarity power industry 
section decided Monday evening [25 April] in Belchatow, Piotrkow 
province, to expand the strike action on power plants operating 
on hard coal. 
  The National Power Distribution Centre limited power 
supplies 
to industrial enterpises. Power is being imported from the 
Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary as of Monday. 
  The chairman of the Solidarity national commission of hard 
coal mining said in Katowice on Monday that "a rotation protest 
action will start in hard coal mines on Monday night and will be 
staged until further notice." 
  Andrzej Dobroczek of the National Power Distribution Centre 
said Monday that the strike by hard coal miners would not 
disturb the production of electric power, at least for some 
time, as power plants had stocked enough coal. 
  In a letter sent Monday to Waldemar Pawlak, the national 
protest committee of lignite mines charged the prime minister 
with responsibility for Poland's security in the field of power 
reserves. The committee expects the prime minister to 
immediately revoke a decision of Industry Minister Marek Pol on 
transformations in lignite mines. 
  The unionists also recognized that further correspondence 
with Industry Minister Marek Pol is useless. 
  "Even if the government withdraws or annuls the decision 
concerning transformations in lignite mining, the Solidarity 
protest committee of lignite mines will not end the strike but 
only suspend it," Jozef Polkowski, a member of the strike 
committee, told a press conference at the Belchatow mine on 
Monday. 
  This would mean an increase of coal supplies to power plants 
which now receive only strategic amounts of fuel necessary to 
keep them going, he said and added that after the decision has 
been either suspended or annuled, the strike committee might 
start negotiations concerning nation-wide demands of the union. 
  At a press conference on Monday afternoon, Minister Marek 
Pol 
said that he has been inviting the protesting unionists for 
talks with representatives of the government and employers for 
three days and that he has been waiting for a signal from them. 
He added that the ministry defined no pre-conditions and 
repeated that the validity of his decision concerning 
transformations in lignite industry expired at the moment he 
said it was suspended. 
  The Solidarity Mazowsze region announced on Monday it would 
stage a strike in all enterprises of the region except for 
public sector and, perhaps, municipal enterprises on Thursday, 
Deputy Chairman of the Mazowsze Region Ewa Lewicka said Monday. 
Also "Sendzimir" steel works in Krakow announced a strike alert. 
  Apart from the demand to halt transformations in the lignite 
industry the miners request that the government stop work on the 
new wage control law and immediately implement the "pact on 
state enterprise" and related laws.

  [Text] Katowice, April 26 -- Coalminers of nine Silesian 
collieries went on strike during night shift on Monday [25 
April], according to reports sent to a state coal mine agency in 
Katowice on Tuesday. 
  Striking miners in the "Turow" brown-coal mine in Turoszow 
deliver some 2,500 tonnes of coal to the "Turow" power plant to 
keep it going. Four of the power plant's eight power units 
work, the strike committee said. The power plant had provided 
ten percent of Poland's power supplies before the strike began. 
  The National Power Distribution office (PDM) announced tenth 
degree of power supply in Poland starting from 0830 hours, shift 
manager Andrzej Dobroczek said on Tuesday. 
  Brown-coal mines started its sixth day of strike protesting 
against the government plan to restructure the industry. They 
decided to leave the power plant with enough fuel to keep its 
furnaces going. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski said 
that the strike "will end if legal decisions come into force."

  [Text] Piotrkow Trybunalski, April 26 -- The All-Poland 
Strike Committee of the brown coal mines agreed on Tuesday [26 
April] to deliver coal in quantities sufficient to generate some 
25 percent of the energy generated by individual power plants. 
The decision was announced following industry minister's 
declaration during talks with union leaders here that he is 
cancelling orders concerning the restructuring of the brown coal 
sector. 
  Spokesman for Solidarity's national commission said that the 
decision on resumption of coal deliveries will be lifted at 2000 
hrs on Thursday if the government side fails to adopt a 
time-table, approved by Solidarity, of dealing with the demands 
put forward by the union.

  [Text] Warsaw, April 25 -- The visit to be paid by 
President Lech Walesa to Lithuania on April 26-27 will close the 
process of normalisation of Poland's relations with her closest 
neighbours. Lithuania is the only country with which Poland has 
not signed a new treaty so far, Presidential Spokesman Andrzej 
Drzycimski said Monday [25 April]. 
  The presidents of Poland and Lithuania will sign a treaty on 
"friendly relations and good-neighbourly cooperation" on the 
first day of the visit. The visit is also important because of 
its psychological aspect: it is to overcome the domination of 
the past and history over the present and future relations 
between the two countries," Drzycimski added. 
  "The treaty is an expression of a compromise and political 
realism of the two sides. Poland and Lithuania found themselves 
in a new world, a new Europe and a new geopolitical situation. 
Good relations are necessary for both sides. The treaty 
carries the hope and awareness that cooperation will bring 
benefits and perhaps will help avoid potential threats," head of 
the presidential political office, Andrzej Zakrzewski said. He 
added that Lithuania, which strives to cooperate with the 
Visegrad Triangle and feels to be a part of central Europe, 
needs Poland. Likewise, Poland needs Lithuania, Zakrzewski said 
and stressed that "this is a strategic foundation of a new 
geopolitics of the regions of the two countries." 
  According to the Polish Foreign Ministry, the 
Polish-Lithuanian treaty creates a solid foundation for the 
normalisation of mutual relations also as regards the issue of 
minorities. Also, by signing the treaty with Lithuania Poland 
will be included in a network of regional links creating new 
political and economic prospects. 
  Stefan Meller of the Department of Europe at the Polish 
Foreign Ministry claims the treaty is concordant with respective 
international standards. Under the treaty, both signatories 
have the duty to respect human rights. 
  Meller said that the implementation of the treaty might call 
for changes in the internal legislation of the two states. 
  The text of the treaty continues to arouse controversy both 
in Poland and Lithuania, but nobody in Lithuania denies the fact 
that the two countries need the document of this rank and that 
the Polish president's visit to Vilnius is much desired, PAP 
correspondent in Vilnius, Alina kurkus wrote. 
  Economic problems are also to be tackled during the visit. 
After a dramatic collapse of economic relations between Poland 
and Lithuania, caused by the systemic changes in the two 
countries, economic contacts at present aim at normalisation. 
Poland is 6th among Lithuania's trading partners, and the value 
of the Polish-Lithuanian turnover during 10 months of last year 
ammounted to some 100 million dollars. According to Poland, 
there are possibilities to increase mutual turnover, expecially 
in agriculture, the construction and timber industry and 
maritime economy. 
  during his 32-hour stay in Lithuania Walesa will meet twice 
with President Algirdas Brazauskas. He will also meet with 
Chairman of the Lithuanian Sejm (parliament), Ceslovas Jursenas, 
and Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius, and address the Sejm on 
Tuesday. A joint press conference of the two presidents is 
scheduled for Wednesday.

  [Text] Bratislava April 22 (CTK) -- Doubts about 
Slovakia's orientation towards the West, which surfaced during 
Vladimir Meciar's premiership, are unsubstantiated, Slovak 
Premier Jozef Moravcik told CTK today. 
  He said Slovakia's place in Europe was illustrated by the 
agreements the country had signed, for instance the Association 
Agreement with the European Union (EU). He reiterated that 
Slovakia was seeking EU membership. 
  Asked whether Meciar's premiership had led the West to 
rather 
overlook Slovakia in assessing countries most fit for 
integration, Moravcik said: "It's more a question of the style 
of politics and the creation of guarantees for the development 
of the institutions of parliamentary democracy. It is a 
domestic policy question, which in my view will have less and 
less importance. I wouldn't overestimate that." 
  He confirmed that cooperation within the Visegrad Group -- 
Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary -- remained 
attractive for Slovakia. Its importance resided principally in 
accelerating admission to the EU. If the Group did not achieve 
that it would become senseless, he said. "I, however, am 
convinced it still is meaningful," Moravcik said.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 22 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik remains ready for a meeting with Hungarian Premier 
Peter Boross if the meeting contributes in some way to solving 
mutual problems, Moravcik told CTK today. 
  On Thursday [21 April] the Hungarian Foreign Ministry 
expressed regret that Slovakia appeared to have no interest in a 
working meeting of the two premiers. Ministry Spokesman Janos 
Herman said Bratislava had set unacceptable conditions for such 
a meeting. 
  "We specified no conditions for the meeting with Premier 
Boross," Moravcik said today. "We were interested in a 
communique being issued. It would be enough for us if the 
Hungarian side expressed the political will to accept our 
request: To explicitly confirm the pledge to guarantee present 
borders," the Slovak Premier emphasized. 
  The form of the expression was open, and Slovakia was keen 
to 
accept even the loosest formulation, he said. He said he felt 
the guaranteeing of borders was self-evident and could not cause 
anybody a problem. 
  He rejected the claim that Slovakia had decided to wait 
until 
the September elections were over before contemplating a meeting. 
  "From the point of view of solving our problems we do not 
regard parliamentary elections as an obstacle. We don't attach 
special significance to them. Whatever happens in the elections 
in Hungary or here, the governments on either side still have to 
resolve existing problems, which are of vital importance to both 
sides," Moravcik said. 
  "Both countries want integration in the European Union. But 
no international community is going to gladly grant membership 
to states between which some open questions exist," because 
those imported problems might stir trouble within the 
association, he said. Slovak-Hungarian talks were in the 
objective interests of both sides and would also develop 
bilateral trade, he said. 
  Slovakia and Hungary have not signed a treaty guaranteeing 
the inviolability of present state borders and the status and 
rights of the Hungarian minority. Another difficulty is the 
opening of new border crossings, which Bratislava thus far has 
made conditional upon the signing of a readmission treaty 
returning illegal migrants. 
  Furthermore the states have taken their quarrel over the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric project on the Danube to the 
International Court of Justice at The Hague, and the two 
countries have still not reached agreement on the division of 
the Danube waters between the old river course and the Gabcikovo 
canal.

  [Text] Budapest, April 23 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik is prepared to meet his Hungarian counterpart Peter 
Boross at any time, either before the Hungarian elections or 
after them, Moravcik says in an interview for the Hungarian 
daily NEPSZAVA today. 
  A possible meeting before the Hungarian elections in May was 
cancelled after the two sides failed to agree on whether a joint 
communique should be issued after the talks. Hungary accused 
Slovakia of showing a lack of interest in the meeting. 
  "Of course, no-one wants these meetings to be nothing more 
than visits out of politeness," Moravcik says, adding that both 
sides had to bring something. 
  He says there are three specific problems in 
Slovak-Hungarian 
relations, and if these are solved "an atmosphere of trust would 
start to reign." 
  The first problem is that of the inviolacy of borders 
between 
Slovakia and Hungary, Moravcik says, pointing out that many 
Slovaks, with or without justification, are afraid of the 
borders changing in a way unfavourable to Slovakia, and this is 
a "disturbing element" in bilateral relations. Slovak leaders 
are aware that the Hungarian Government and realist Hungarian 
politicians are not putting forward any territorial claims on 
Slovakia, but in the interest of strengthening trust there is a 
need for the Hungarians to issue a concrete declaration 
confirming the current borders. 
  The second question concerns national minorities. "The 
difference between the Slovak and the Hungarian standpoint is 
only really apparent when it comes to collective rights," the 
Slovak premier says. From the Slovak point of view there exists 
only areas with a mixed Slovak and Hungarian population, and 
therefore "a solution to the problem using collective rights 
would not be proper." He adds that the Slovaks are naturally 
willing to negotiate on "certain individual rights in such a way 
that all citizens, regardless of their nationality can fully 
realise their identity and cultivate their language and national 
culture." 
  Moravcik says Slovakia is prepared to fulfil the 
recommendations of the Council of Europe concerning the official 
use of minority-language names and bilingual signs for towns and 
villages. Everything is already prepared and it is just a 
question of time before the relevant laws are passed, he says. 
  The third problem is the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric 
project. Both the Hungarians and Slovaks should listen to the 
opnions of experts more, and should try to depoliticise the 
whole affair as much as possible, Moravcik says.

  [Text] Budapest, April 25 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik will probably not take part in an international 
conference on liberalism in Central and East Europe, being 
organized by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation this Saturday in 
the Hungarian town of Visegrad, Gergely Prolle from the 
foundation told CTK today. 
  Moravcik has been invited to attend the conference both by 
the foundation and leading representatives of two Hungarian 
liberal parties -- the Union of Free Democrats and the Union of 
Young Democrats. 
  Prolle said that Moravcik had excused himself, citing the 
lack of time, already last Friday. On the other hand in an 
interview with representatives of Hungarian liberal parties in 
Bratislava Moravcik has allegedly made it clear that he would 
attend the Visegrad meeting of Central European liberal 
politicians if possible. 
  Liberal politicians and representatives of liberal parties 
from all Central European countries and some Western politicians 
are to take part in the conference. It is expected that 
Chairman of the Liberal International Otto Lambsdorff will also 
take part. Representatives of some liberal parties from the 
Czech Republic have also been invited, organizers said.

  [Text] Bratislava April 22 (CTK) -- The cancellation of the 
planned meeting of Slovak and Hungarian premiers should not 
obscure the atmosphere ruling between the two countries, which 
has recently been improved, Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan 
said at a press conference today. 
  "According to us, the premiers' meeting should produce some 
positive result, not only improve the atmosphere. The meeting 
did not promise it, and therefore was not feasible," Kukan said. 
  The meeting was canceled after Budapest had rejected 
Slovakia's demand that a joint communique on the inviolability 
of the Slovak-Hungarian border be released after the talks. 
  It is inappropriate to dramatise the situation and "get 
scared", Kukan said. "I think we will find other ways of 
further strengthening the improving atmosphere," he added. 
  Nevertheless, he said he did not suppose he would meet with 
his Hungarian counterpart, Geza Jeszenszky, before the Hungarian 
elections to be held in May. 
  Asked if he did not consider the opening of a new border 
crossing between the two countries, Kukan said that concessions 
and accommodating attitudes were necessary on both sides. 
  Referring to another case of omission of Slovakia as an 
applicant for membership of NATO and the European Union by 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, this time during his visit to 
Budapest, Kukan said that in the nearest future he would meet 
with his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkel, to discuss the issue. 
  Kukan also confirmed he would meet with Austrian Foreign 
Minister Alois Mock, who was to attend Saturday's [23 April] 
conference of the Christian Trade Unions in Casta-Papiernicka 
near Bratislava. It will be an introductory meeting focusing on 
bilateral relations, he said.

  [Text] Bratislava April 22 (CTK) -- Premier Jozef Moravcik 
told CTK today that his government was preparing no shock 
therapy for the Slovak economy, though it wanted to accelerate 
changes to bring the country to prosperity and to keep the 
budget deficit under control even at the cost of unpopular steps. 
  "There will be no return to shock therapy because the 
prepared measures do not have the nature of a shock," Moravcik 
stressed. 
  He said the planned increase in the value-added tax imposed 
on some kinds of food and reduction of subsidies to farming 
should not "affect citizens markedly," but the lower-income 
strata might be affected. They would get compensation in order 
to ensure the transformation's social tolerability, Moravcik 
said. 
  The government will try to "maintain the deficit on an 
acceptable level so that we do not run into problems similar to 
last year's. The deficit of the state budget then was almost 
twice as big as the level acceptable from the point of view of 
our ties with international financial institutions," Moravcik 
said. In consequence the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has 
postponed the signing of an agreement on a new loan for Slovakia. 
  Moravcik recalled that the IMF would not grant Slovakia a 
loan unless it keeps the deficit below 4 percent of its gross 
domestic product. 
  Slovakia had a deficit of 23 billion Slovak crowns (about 
$696 million) or 6.8 percent of the GDP last year. 
  The state budget is also burdened by the 5.8 billion Slovak 
crowns deficit on the clearing account used in trade with the 
Czech Republic, and by debts in the health, education and other 
spheres which altogether exceed 6 billion crowns. 
  According to the Moravcik government's programme statement 
the government sector's net debt had risen to 60 billion crowns. 
  Moravcik said the government wanted to take further steps to 
remedy the Slovak economy. "First of all we would like to 
markedly accelerate privatisation. During the six months of our 
tenure (the government was appointed on March 16 and early 
elections are to be held on September 30-October 1), we want to 
create the conditions for (a second wave of) coupon 
privatisation so that it can be launched after the elections. 
At the end of the second wave, more than half of state property 
could be in private ownership," Moravcik said. 
  The first wave of coupon privatisation was carried out still 
within the Czechoslovak Federation and ended in January 1993, 
shortly after the country split. 
  "Concrete measures will not probably be reflected in the 
economic sphere and in our citizens' living conditions within 
the six-month period. Nevertheless we would like to push 
through steps to give a new dynamic to Slovakia's economic life. 
But their effect will probably be evident in its entirety only 
after the elections," Moravcik said.

  [Text] Bratislava April 22 (CTK) -- Former Premier 
Vladimir Meciar is still the most popular politician in Slovakia 
with 26 percent of favour among would-be voters, a poll 
conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office in early March 
revealed. 
  He is followed by President Michal Kovac and current Premier 
Jozef Moravcik (25 percent each). Moravcik's rating improved 20 
percent over the last two weeks, the poll showed. 
  Then follow: Peter Weiss, Chairman of the Democratic Left 
(SDL) with 13 percent, Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic with 
10 percent and Deputy Premier Roman Kovac with seven percent. 
  No politician is trusted by 25 percent of those polled, 
which 
is a marked decline in comparison with February when the figure 
was 41 percent.

  [Text] Bratislava, April 23 (CTK) -- A new political party 
-- the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) was founded today 
through a merger of the Alternative of Political Realism (APR) 
of Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik and the Alliance of Slovak 
Democrats (AD) of former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko. The two 
parties' delegates agreed to the move at a merger assembly in 
Bratislava. 
  Moravcik has been proposed DEUS chairman, Knazko is likely 
to 
become the first deputy chairman. Other deputy chairmen would 
be Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus, 
and Viliam Vaskovic, vice-president of the presidium of the 
National Property Fund (FNM). Voting on the above candidates is 
planned for the afternoon. 
  DEUS intends to push for the interests of people who want to 
live in a civic society, which respects civic freedoms, 
pluralist democracy, the market economy and freedom of trade. 
  According to a recent poll, the APR and the AD together have 
9 per cent of electoral preferences, and are the third strongest 
political grouping in Slovakia, after the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Democratic Left Party (SDL).

  [Text] Bratislava, April 23 (CTK) -- "We favour 
negotiations on the creation of pre-election blocs. However, I 
think that the forming of a political party from in the long 
term and from the viewpoint of the stabilisation of the 
political scene is more important than a pre-election campaign," 
Chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) Jozef 
Moravcik told journalists today. 
  Moravcik, who is also Slovak premier, was speaking after the 
assembly where DEUS was established through a merger between 
Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism (APR) and the 
Alliance of Slovak Democrats (AD) of former foreign minister 
Milan Knazko. 
  Knazko, who was elected first deputy chairman, said that 
DEUS 
was oriented towards Liberal International and hoped to become a 
full- fledged member in a short time. DEUS' closest partners in 
the Czech Republic are the Free Democrats (SD) of former 
Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier, he added. 
  Today's merger conference was attended by leading 
representatives of Slovak political parties with the exception 
of the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and 
the Slovak National Party (SNS). The conference was also 
addressed by representatives of liberal parties from Hungary, 
Poland and Austria. 
  Moravcik said that in connection with the agreement that no 
political leaders would be represented in the coalition 
government, the DEUS statutes say that during his time in the 
government he would be represented in the leadership of DEUS by 
Knazko. 
  Asked if DEUS would adhere to the screening law while 
composing its election list of candidates, Moravcik answered 
that an amendment to the law had been initiated. This would 
concern people who were forced to sign collaboration agreements 
with the StB secret police due to their profession, though they 
did not operated in the section aimed "against domestic 
enemies". As an example, Moravcik gave workers in the arms 
industry. "If the screening law is valid, we will observe it," 
he added. 
  The screening law, adopted by the Czechoslovak Parliament in 
1991, bans people linked to the former communist-run StB secret 
police, high Communist Party officials and members of People's 
Militia from high government and economic posts until 1996.

  [Text] Bratislava April 25 (CTK) -- The government 
Coalition Council must discuss soon Premier Jozef Moravcik's 
election chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) 
which is at variance with the principle that the leader of a 
coalition party cannot be a government member, Peter Weiss said 
today. 
  Asked whether Moravcik's election was in breach of the 
coalition agreement, Weiss, chairman of the coalition Democratic 
Left Party (SDL), said the agreement did not suppose the 
cumulation of political and government posts. 
  DEUS was formed on Saturday by a merger between the 
Alternative of Political Realism (APR) and the Alliance of 
Democrats of Slovakia (AD). 
  Moravcik said on his election that in compliance with the 
DEUS statutes, during his premiership he would be represented as 
DEUS leader by First Deputy Chairman Milan Knazko.

<F P=106> [Article by Jana Dorotkova: "Meciar's Corrupt Legacy"] </F>
  [Text] In the end, it was President Michal Kovac's damning 
revelations of Vladimir Meciar's blatant abuse of state 
ownership for political gain that pushed Parliament to toss the 
perpetually staggering ex-boxer out on his ear. 
  After the president's March 9 speech, a seemingly shocked 
Parliament agreed--for the first time in more than 12 months of 
loose talk--to hold a no-confidence vote. Two days later, Meciar 
was dethroned from his three-headed job as premier, 
privatization minister and chair of the National Property Fund, 
leaving in his wake an internationally discredited 
decentralization process that has been more of an exercise in 
power than an instrument of reform. 
  Through Valentine's Day of this year, Meciar's government 
had 
managed to privatize just 108 companies (91 through public 
tender, 17 through direct sale) since the June 1992 elections 
swept his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) into power. 
  The ex-factory lawyer's oft-repeated claims to be making the 
privatization process more "transparent" were widely interpreted 
by reform advocates as a more palatable way of saying 
"nonexistent." 
  Then Feb. 15, on the eve of what was expected to be a 
no-confidence vote in the next day's Parliament session, 
Meciar's government suddenly approved a whopping 27 direct sales. 
  As Parliament deputies were tossing in their sleep, deciding 
whether or not they should chuck Meciar's minority government, 
the Privatization Ministry was working around the clock, selling 
off chunks of the state-owned sector. 
  "I always stay here this late," insisted deputy 
Privatization 
Minister Ivan Lexa at 11:30 p.m. Feb. 15. Lexa's secretary and 
the secretary for the ministry's economic director both said 
they never worked that late, but didn't want to be quoted. 
  When the dust cleared Feb. 17, with the opposition once 
again 
failing to unify and set a date for new elections (which would 
have paved the way for a no-confidence vote), the disheartened 
deputies began to question just what had happened on the night 
of Feb. 15-16. But HZDS deputies and the handful of Meciar 
loyalists from the splintered Slovak National Party (SNS) saw 
nothing abnormal in the sudden massive activity. 
  "You blame us because we speeded up privatization at the 
last 
Cabinet session? You've been asking for it, you've been 
criticizing us for slow privatization," said then Environment 
Minister Jozef Zlocha. 
  The opposition was sufficiently alarmed to launch an 
investigation Feb. 18 and ask the Prosecutor General to rule on 
the legality of two of the 27 sales. 
  Ivan Miklos, the pre-HZDS privatization minister, said the 
privatization projects approved during the Feb. 15 fire sale 
fell far short of meeting the basic requirements mandated by 
law, such as approval by the Anti-Monopoly Office. 
  While the ministries that owned the properties (which makes 
them responsible for initiating privatization) in many instances 
recommended public tenders, the government ignored their 
requests and sold off the businesses to pre-selected people, 
Miklos said. 
  Former Economics Minister and ex-SNS Chair L'udovit Cernak, 
who resigned from Meciar's government a year ago, summed up the 
prevailing view on the Parliament floor Feb. 17: "What else but 
a plunder can we call the process going on here these days?" 
  "The fact that the Privatization Ministry worked all night 
from Feb. 15 to Feb. 16 suggests a lot about the way Vladimir 
Meciar's government approves direct sales," said Miklos, once a 
member of the now-defunct Public Against Violence, the broad 
movement that spearheaded the 1989 revolution in Slovakia. 
  During Miklos's last six months in office, the Slovak 
government approved a total of 676 projects (181 direct sales, 
eight public tenders and 407 in coupon privatization). After 
HZDS took over, Meciar vowed to improve on Miklos's record. 
  "The government will push through legislative changes to 
speed the process and dampen the negative side effects...and 
will give preference to competitive principles in order for 
privatization to be more transparent," he promised. 
  But in three times as long, Meciar's government privatized 
less than one-sixth as many companies as its predecessors. 
Coupon privatization, a runaway success in the Czech Republic, 
was dropped because the Slovak government said, it couldn't 
provide the cash infusion necessary to revive Slovakia's 
suffering economy. 
  HZDS Vice Chair L'ubomir Dolgos resigned as privatization 
minister in June 1993, accusing the government of deliberately 
stalling the decentralization process because it was unwilling 
to give up power. In place of Dolgos, Meciar nominated his close 
ally Lexa, but President Kovac refused (he had previously 
rejected Lexa to head the Slovak Information Service, the 
country's intelligence agency). So Meciar himself took the helm 
of both the Privatization Ministry and the National Property 
Fund. 
  "Privatization, warped beyond recognition by Meciar's 
ambition to shape the new market economy, has ground to a halt," 
wrote Chandler Rosenberger, an American journalist who lived in 
post-revolution Bratislava for three years, in the fall 1993 
issue of WORLD POLICY REVIEW. 
  Meciar's "scheme," Rosenberger and a chorus of observers 
say, 
had much more to do with leverage and power than concern for the 
economy. "Deputies from the [SNS] and Meciar's own [HZDS] drove 
an efficient privatization program through a meat grinder of 
special interests," wrote Rosenberger. "Meciar's coalition is a 
clumsy alliance of special interests and privilege. Meciar's 
success depends not on enforcing open competition between 
companies, but rather on managing a vast array of alliances, 
information and threats." 
  Kovac's dramatic allegations March 9 on the Parliament 
floor--all of them hotly denied by Meciar--stated the equation 
in simple terms: Meciar saw privatization as a way to stuff 
HZDS's campaign war chest, and that's why he wanted his good 
buddy Lexa running the Ministry of Privatization. 
  "His reasons were that HZDS had no money even for salaries, 
that early elections would probably happen soon, and that HZDS 
just needed money," Kovac said. "He further said that no one but 
Lexa could provide him with that service." 
  International financial institutions have taken notice. Both 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
and the European Union have recently come out with reports 
slamming Meciar's mishandling of the economy. 
  The premier's penchant for flexing the state's muscle to 
keep 
the media in line has attracted even more international 
headlines. Several critical individuals have been removed from 
state-owned television, radio and print media; privatization of 
the newspaper printing and distribution monopolies were put off 
indefinitely; state subsidies to publications have been openly 
based on editors' political stances. 
  "Over the past year, the government has shown a strong 
propensity to hold on to whatever control it has over the 
media," wrote Jeremy Druker in a July 1993 report for Freedom 
Forum. 
  The Feb. 15-16 deal that raised the most eyebrows was the 
cheap sale of the successful Skloobal Nemsova, a glass bottle 
producer where Meciar worked as company lawyer from 1974 to 
1989, to its current managers. 
  Last year, Skloobal had profits of 22.2 million Sk ($700,000 
US), according to the Slovak economic weekly TREND. Its assets 
were estimated at 726 million Sk ($23 million US), including 66 
million Sk ($2 million US) in the bank, according to government 
documents. 
  Since there was no public tender, a competing privatization 
project that had lined up foreign investors from Italy, France 
and Germany, was left out in the cold. Skloobal management, 
under the name Obalsklo Ltd., purchased 67 percent of the 
company for 120 million Sk ($3.7 million US). 
  Under the purchase agreement, the company management must 
pay 
the government 27 million Sk ($850,000 US) the first year, with 
the rest spread out in installments over the next 10 years. 
Obalsklo was asked to invest 500 million Sk ($15 million US) by 
January 1995, but the agreement was written without any 
provisions for penalizing the company if it doesn't live up to 
its end of the bargain, TREND reported. And the conditions for 
further payments have not yet been set. 
  So, essentially, a bunch of Meciar's old comrades privatized 
a profitable company for less money than the company itself has 
in its bank account. 
  "That is not just a handout of state property, it is the 
liquidation of all the competitors," wrote TREND deputy editor 
in chief Oliver Brunovsky in a commentary. "The privatization 
projects of last week revealed the true privatization policy of 
the HZDS." 
  Privatization has been at or near the center of the manifold 
political dramas that have rocked Slovakia into its current 
status: a 15-month-old country with a troubled reputation, a 
grim economic outlook and a populace that has faith in neither 
its elected officials nor the concept of market reform. 
  Meciar's demand that Lexa be appointed as part of a November 
1993 HZDS-SNS coalition and Kovac's angry refusal launched the 
power struggle between the country's top two officials which the 
president eventually won. 
  The opposition complained for months that the minority 
government spelled instability for the country, but actual 
gridlock did not occur until Feb. 2, when Meciar loyalists 
stormed out of Parliament to protest an opposition bill that 
would have given the legislature oversight of the privatization 
process. (The law passed, but Meciar refused to sign it.) From 
then on, the only real debates Parliament held dealt with the 
questions of early elections, referendums and no-confidence 
votes. 
  Through it all, Meciar has convinced many people that he is 
the only man with enough moral purity to ensure that the 
privatization process--and government as a whole--will be run 
cleanly. The premier has waged public campaigns against 
corruption (accusing, for instance, at least three political 
parties of trying to bribe him), while privately saying that 
political support is best won through state gifts. (In December, 
for instance, Meciar bragged of giving the 600-million-crown 
Neografia publishing house to the nationalist organization 
Matica Slovenska for just one crown. "They won't support anyone 
else but HZDS anywhere," he said. "They gave us this promise.") 
  When campaigning against the "federalists" of Jan 
Carnogursky's pre-HZDS government, Meciar pounded home the 
lasting image of a corrupt government selling off the state 
interests of the Czech Republic. 
  "Those who own companies will decide the fate of Slovakia. 
Will it be the unbribable and honest Meciarist entrepreneurs or 
the corrupt Czechoslovakist Mafia?" asked Jan Smolec, editor in 
chief of the government-owned nationalist daily REPUBLIKA in a 
Feb. 15 open letter to Carnogursky, who chairs the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH). 
  "The only party with anything resembling a sensible economic 
program is [KDH]," Rosenberger argued in his WORLD POLICY REVIEW 
article. "But it labors under the weight of false but effective 
rumors that Carnogursky's family, prominent on the Slovak 
political scene for most of the 20th century, is corrupt." 
  Meciar remains convinced that his ear for what Slovaks want 
to hear will deliver him once again to the promised land. "Those 
of you who are even slightly realistic," he told Parliament 
shortly before getting the ax, "you know we will win those 
elections."

  [Text] Bratislava, April 25 (CTK) -- "A series of 
ill-conceived and wrongly timed decisions" of the previous 
government (of Vladimir Meciar) have brought the health sector 
to the brink of collapse, Slovak Health Minister Tibor Sagat 
told CTK today. 
  He also mentioned unqualified changes in hospital management 
and the halt of health insurance transformation as causes 
leading to the present state. 
  He said the different development of the Czech and Slovak 
health sectors after the 1993 split of Czechoslovakia were the 
result of the "better running of the Czech Health Ministry which 
could project its needs and support them with hard evidence." 
  "Unfortunately, we failed to do likewise in this country," 
he 
added. 
  The health sector's budget was not a priority under the 
previous government, resulting in health services being as much 
as 50 billion crowns ($1.5 billion) in debt, Sagat said. He 
added that this year the 15.7 billion-crown health sector budget 
was 5 billion crowns short of the requirement. 
  He said extra money would have to come from national 
reserves, causing a deepening of the budget deficit, or from 
foreign loans. It is hoped that a foreign loan decision would 
come by the end of June since his ministry plans changes in the 
financial management of the health services to take effect as of 
July 1, Sagat said. 
  A foreign loan is to be managed by health insurances as 
their 
"starting capital," since the hitherto "irregular and variable" 
insurance revenue has left them unable to cope with service 
costs, Sagat said, adding that the government would have to back 
the health sector more effectively. 
  Health and social insurance funds would have to be separated 
as the past six months' performance of the mixed National 
Insurance showed it to be falling behind expectations. The 
separation of the two funds looks likely to happen, Sagat said.

  [Text] Prague, April 25 (CTK) -- The problem of quality 
certification for food stuffs required at the Slovak-Czech 
border will be debated in Tuesday's [26 April] session of the 
Slovak Government, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik told Czech 
Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy today. 
  Moravcik telephoned Dlouhy after no progress was made on 
this 
issue in today's session of Customs Union representatives at the 
deputy ministerial level, a ministry spokesman announced. 
  Chairman of the Czech Office of Standardization, Measures, 
and State Testing Michal Tosovsky told CTK last Thursday [21 
April] that problems could arise at the border with Slovakia 
because from May 1 Slovakia was again to recognize only its own 
food quality certificates. Czech certificates are considered 
unacceptable by the Slovak customs authorities. 
  The Customs Union decided at its last session to work out an 
agreement, to be approved by both parliaments, that would allow 
each country to recognize each other's certificates. On 
Thursday Slovakia announced, however, that it would be 
impossible to get an agreement on the issue approved in the 
Slovak Parliament before the September elections.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, April 27 (AFP) -- The Russian and 
French foreign ministers Wednesday called for a rapid 
ministerial meeting to examine a new international peace effort 
on Bosnia, and renewed their calls for a summit on the conflict. 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his French 
counterpart Alain Juppe spoke after meeting at the Russian 
embassy here as part of the new four-sided contact group formed 
in London Monday [25 April] to coordinate policy to end the war 
in Bosnia- Hercegovina. 
  The two ministers said the "ministerial meeting should be 
held as quickly as possible" after the contact group submits its 
report on Bosnia, which they said was due a week from now. The 
contact group comprises representatives of the United States, 
Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. 
  "We must not let this opportunity go by. We have agreed that 
the contact group has one week to submit its report which is to 
be examined as quickly as possible during a ministerial 
meeting," Kozyrev said. 
  "We must act quickly, we must step up pressure to hold this 
ministerial meeting and a summit that Russia and France have 
called for," said Juppe at a joint press conference. 
  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who met here 
with 
Kozyrev on Tuesday, said afterwards that members of the contact 
group would be in Sarajevo on Thursday and Friday to meet with 
Moslem and Serb officials on resurrecting peace talks. 
  Juppe and Kozyrev -- who heads on to Bonn Thursday for talks 
with German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel -- said Wednesday they 
felt a European-brokered peace plan for Bosnia was still valid. 
But they said that if the belligerents could not agree on how 
to divide Bosnia, the contact group would present "its own 
proposal" for the country's division. [passage omitted] 
  Christopher and Kozyrev had stressed after their meeting 
that 
Washington and Moscow were pursuing joint aims in Bosnia and 
shared the view that the trouble there cannot be solved 
militarily. [passage omitted] 
  Russia has been fiercely critical of any use of NATO air 
strikes in Bosnia, but has conceded that from now on such 
"extreme measures" would be justifiable for major problems. It 
has insisted however on the necessity a political solution to 
the conflict. 
  Kozyrev told the press conference Wednesday that the use of 
force "depends on concrete situations." "When the fighters 
transgress international norms by shelling hospitals and 
villages," it would be justified, the Russian minister said.

  [Text] Brussels, April 27 (AFP) -- NATO is standing firm 
after expiry of its ultimatum to Bosnian Serbs to pull back 
heavy weapons from the eastern town of Gorazde but is not 
sabre-rattling, British envoy John Weston said here Wednesday. 
  In comments to journalists on the Bosnian Serbs' apparent 
compliance with the NATO ultimatum, under threat of air strikes, 
the ambassador said: "We're very pleased, yes, but there is no 
gung- hoism in this alliance. We're firm but not gung-ho." The 
sequence of events showed that the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization could make a contribution to the United Nations in 
Bosnia when required "and do it properly and effectively," 
Weston said. 
  Asked about air strikes on other UN protected zones, he 
refused to spoeculate, adding: "I just hope the lesson has been 
learned. I think we're building on the valuable experience of 
Sarajevo. If it's working also in Gorazde, so much the better." 
  "By 2:01 Brussels time (0001 GMT), when the deadline for the 
withdrawal of Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons from the 20 
kilometers (12-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde expired, 
there was evidence of compliance with the NATO ultimatum," A 
NATO spokesman said early Wednesday. 
  As a result of this evidence, NATO southern commander 
Admiral 
Leighton Smith and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] "have agreed 
that airstrikes are not necessary for the moment," the spokesman 
added. "We will however remain vigilant and we reiterate our 
determination to conduct airstrikes in coordination with 
UNPROFOR if Gorazde and other safe areas in Bosnia are attacked 
or existing exclusion zones are violated".

  [Text] At the start of the news I will read to our 
listeners an announcement we received a few minutes ago from our 
government reporter, Kalina Stancheva: 
  At the start of today's cabinet session Valentin Karabashev 
submitted to the prime minister his resignation from the posts 
of trade minister and deputy prime minister. He said that he 
does not accept as well-founded the attacks that Prime Minister 
Berov made in his parliamentary statement yesterday against his 
work as minister of trade and deputy prime minister, accusing 
him of forgetting about privatization and failing to provide 
assessment reports on the work of the Trade Ministry. He said 
that the cabinet changes envisaged by the prime minister did not 
coincide with his own views. 
  These in short seem to be the motives for Karabashev's 
resignation, which will take effect if it is accepted by the 
National Assembly. 
  In this connection, National Assembly Deputy Asen Michkovski 
announced that he will propose to the New Alliance for Democracy 
parliamentary group to start collecting signatures for a 
petition asking for the parliamentary Easter vacation to be 
curtailed. In Michkovski's view, the fact is that we are in a 
government crisis and the National Assembly should be reconvened 
as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Kalina Stancheva on the 28 April </F>
session of the Council of Ministers in Sofia -- live] 
  [Text] The Council of Ministers has received two notes 
from the U.S. Embassy dated 11 April, requesting permission for 
six U.S. Air Force F-16 combat aircraft to transit Bulgarian 
airspace today, and for a further four fighters to do the same 
tomorrow. The planes will fly to the (?Incirlik) air base, and 
will not carry ammunition on board. They will be used to patrol 
the no-fly zone in northern Iraq. 
  The Bulgarian Army General Staff finds no reasons to object 
to the requests, but as a result of a vote by the individual 
ministers, the government unanimously decided to refer the 
request to the National Assembly. 
  The National Assembly is also expected to make a decision on 
another problem submitted by the cabinet. Three hours ago 
Valentin Karabashev, deputy prime minister and trade minister, 
submitted his resignation from both his posts. He asked for 
space to be made on the agenda for him to present his statement. 
The statement mentions serious differences within the 
government that have developed since mid-1993 regarding the 
amendments to the Privatization Act, the military-industrial 
complex, the energy industry, and the privatization of hotels. 
The statement also refers to the lack of confidence and the 
administrational chaos created by the combining of the deputy 
prime ministers' functions since the fall of 1993. Among the 
motives pointed out, the statement mentions the prime minister's 
attempts to circumvent government decisions and to promote his 
own personal ideas about privatization, and the major attacks in 
his statement yesterday, which Karabashev regards as unfounded. 
He considers the assessment of the work of the Trade Ministry 
as based on intrigues and denunciations. 
  The Alternative Social Liberal Party [ASP] backs Valentin 
Karabashev's decision and, as the members of its leadership 
stated, if the decision is made for the ASP to withdraw from the 
cabinet, they will recommend that Minister Bikov resign as well.

  [Text] In an interview on Khorizont's "Konkurenti" 
[Competitors] program this morning, National Assembly Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov said that the only way out of the political 
situation that is developing is to hold early parliamentary 
elections. He described everything else as halfhearted, 
obscure, and vague. The country needs a government that has the 
will to push the reform through, the speaker of parliament 
stressed. He pointed out that the present problems are 
connected with the policies of the majority, to which he himself 
does not belong, so his conscience is clear. 
  Aleksandur Yordanov revealed his conviction that it is now 
the turn of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] to make a move. 
He said that the BSP should either commit itself more firmly to 
the Lyuben Berov cabinet or it should withdraw its support, 
pointing out that the BSP is waging a losing battle in either 
case.

  [Text] Prime Minister Lyuben Berov met with Aleksandur 
Tomov, leader of the Civil Alliance for the Republic [GOR], on 
26 April and discussed with him the upcoming structural changes 
in the government. 
  Aleksandur Tomov described the meeting as a normal and 
routine meeting. He said that he opposes the attempt by certain 
political forces to utilize the grave economic situation in the 
country to put pressure on the government. According to 
Aleksandur Tomov, to prevent the emergence of a vacuum in the 
government and economic stagnation, the political forces must 
reach a consensus on the issue of what changes are needed by 
Lyuben Berov's government. The GOR has serious opinions on the 
cabinet's economic team, but it will not participate in 
political haggling over ministerial posts or propose ministers, 
Aleksandur Tomov said.

  [Text] At the invitation of the President of the Republic 
of Bulgaria Zhelyu Zhelev, the President of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Kiro Gligorov arrived on a two day official visit to Sofia 
yesterday, heading the Macedonian delegation. 
  The official welcoming ceremony with all state honors was 
held at the "Hall 1" of the residence "Boyana." After the 
intonation of the hymns of both countries, President Gligorov 
addressed the honorary guard. Immediately following this, the 
talks between the two presidents, in four eyes [as published], 
began. That same afternoon, the talks between the two 
delegations also began. After the talks, the two presidents 
gave short statements for the press: 
  "I feel that what was written in the press, that a historic 
meeting should not be expected, was not confirmed. I believe 
that this meeting is of historic character," Bulgarian President 
Zhelev said. "Not only because this is the first official visit 
of President Gligorov, but also because this visit opens a new 
era in the development of relations between the two countries." 
The Bulgarian President assessed the talks as fruitful, as 
"there literally is not one field in which the two countries 
cannot cooperate." Reminding that there is excellent 
cooperation in the sphere of economy, Zhelev said: "If we sign 
an agreement on mutual cultural cooperation, it will be even 
better." 
  On the same note as President Zhelev, President Gligorov 
said: "We also discussed many other questions of bilateral 
character, for example, the linking of the energetic systems, 
the gas line, etc." Gligorov informed that military issues, that 
is, military cooperation was also included in the talks, adding 
that the two defense ministries might soon sign an agreement. 
They also discussed the connection in the processes of European 
integration and initiative, the NATO "Partnership for Peace" 
project, for which Macedonia is showing particular interest, and 
the two sides exchanged views on issues of international 
character, particularly the Balkans and the Bosnian crisis. 
President Gligorov insisted on the definition of the principles 
of good neighborly relations, as, according to his estimation 
"Macedonia's independence is connected with the identity of the 
people." 
  The two statesmen also talked about the problem that 
developed with the failure to reach the agreement on scientific 
cooperation between the two countries. According to reports, 
the Bulgarian side says that it was emphasized during the talks 
that conditions for a bilateral agreement had been created. It 
was even proposed for this agreement to be expanded and to 
encircle certain open questions, which would finally be solved. 
The Macedonian side accepted this idea. However, no details 
were mentioned in the talks. 
  According to protocol, today morning President Gligorov is 
expected to meet with Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. However, as 
it has been found out, due to the health condition of the prime 
minister, Gligorov will most probably be received by his deputy 
Evgeni Matinchev.

<F P=106> [Speech by Kiro Gligorov, president of The Former Yugoslav </F>
Republic of Macedonia, to the Bulgarian National Assembly in 
Sofia -- live, in Macedonian] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. Chairman, esteemed Deputies, ladies 
and gentlemen: 
  It is a great honor and a responsibility to have the 
opportunity today to address you, the people's representatives 
of the Republic of Bulgaria, to speak at this loftiest 
institution, the National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria, 
and to address the Bulgarian people and all the citizens of your 
land through you. 
  I would like to convey to you the greetings of all the 
citizens of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia], the greetings of all Macedonians, 
Albanians, Turks, and members of all the nationalities who live 
in our land. I convey to you their warm greetings and best 
wishes for the prosperity of your country and for the well-being 
and success of all your citizens, as well as for success in your 
responsible work. These greetings also signify full support for 
your efforts for the democratic transformation of Bulgaria in an 
historic period of transition. 
  On the other hand, it also means support for your efforts 
for 
peace, understanding, and good-neighborly relations between the 
Macedonian and Bulgarian peoples and among all Balkan nations 
and states. 
  These greetings also express Macedonia's striving to 
develop, 
on the broadest possible basis, good-neighborly relations and 
mutual selfless cooperation with Bulgaria at all levels. 
  In this context, I would like to say that Bulgaria being the 
first to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia 
was an act of great historical importance. [applause] This not 
only opened a new era in neighborly relations and cooperation, 
but also was a major contribution to future cooperation between 
the Bulgarian and Macedonian peoples. Furthermore, this was a 
major contribution to peace and stability in the southern 
Balkans. 
  Adhering to political realism has proved to be the best 
means 
of overcoming various historical elements of distrust, 
frustrations, and unfortunate oversights between the Macedonian 
and Bulgarian peoples. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, the great changes that have taken 
place 
in the last few years on the territory of the former SFRY 
allowed the Republic of Macedonia finally, after a long 
struggle, to achieve its total independence as an 
internationally recognized legal entity. This was an expression 
of the century-long striving of the Macedonian people for their 
own state, created by peaceful and democratic means, with the 
maximum participation of the widest people's initiative on a 
political and pluralistic basis. As a result of the referendum 
and the free elections, for the past four years our country has 
been steadily constructing a political, social, and 
parliamentary democracy of a modern European type. Conditions 
are being created for establishing and activating the market 
economy. The free creative initiatives of the people are being 
released in the economic and other spheres. Thus the political, 
economic, and social character of the country is being changed. 
This is a precondition for constructing the Republic of 
Macedonia as a stable and democratic European state, a land of 
free people and citizens, regardless of their ethnic, social, 
national, religious, or any other affiliations. 
  Within this framework we have created new space for the 
development, expression, and affirmation of Macedonian 
creativity, science, and culture. Drawing from their ancient 
national, cultural, and political traditions, personnified today 
by the free Macedonian state, and in cooperation with the other 
Balkan, European, and non-European nations, the Macedonian 
people are today discovering broad prospects for effecting a 
comprehensive national and social upsurge. 
  Our country, like many others at the present time, is 
experiencing a difficult period of transition, with many 
inherited and newly emerged difficulties of an internal and 
international character. We are committed to a peaceful policy, 
exclusively based on peaceful and democratic means and 
cooperation and conducted through a dialogue of a bilateral and 
broader international nature. How do we see Macedonia? 
Independent Macedonia is a peaceful and stable Balkan state 
with a European orientation. It is a factor for comprehensive 
peace and stability in the Balkans. It is a state with open 
borders and an affirmed policy of good-neighborly relations. 
  Unfortunately, we live in a region where a tragic war is 
being waged in our immediate vicinity. We witness daily this 
war's horrible repercussions, the ethnic cleansing, 
international and interreligious hatred, the encroachment of 
borders by force, all of which brings back our fresh memories of 
the totalitarian and quasi-democratic systems in the Balkans, 
the ideological confrontation of the Cold War, and the division 
of the region into blocs. Unfortunately, Balkan history is full 
of wars, clashes, international hatred, and nationalistic 
deceptions. Therefore, today we all must draw lessons from 
history and utilize them to the benefit of free men and our 
nations, and with a due sense of responsibility, now more than 
ever before, for turning the present world into a good place in 
which we should all learn to live together. Everyone should 
live his own life, but each one of us alongside the other, with 
each helping the other. 
  Factors such as good-neighborly relations and confidence 
could be the key to achieving peace and stability in the 
Balkans. In addition, it is especially important to adhere to 
the principle of respect for the existing borders between states 
and the rights of minorities, resolving all problems through 
political and peaceful means. In our country, we are trying to 
improve relations among peoples and international relations 
alike. In this manner, we managed to stay out of the war and 
make a contribution to peace and stability in the region. In 
this enterprise, we were guided by the lasting interests of the 
Macedonian people and all our citizens, as well as their 
striving to live in conditions of peace and good-neighborly 
relations in the Balkans and Europe. We are convinced that this 
is also in the interest of others, including the Bulgarian 
people and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria. It is 
our duty to express this interest in material form on the basis 
of total neighborly trust, friendship, and cooperation between 
us and our peoples. In this way, all of us together could turn 
the Balkans into a region of peace, freedom, and cooperation. 
  In this context, I would like to impart my belief that only 
in this manner will we be able to combine most effectively the 
processes of European integration, of the large, so-called 
European home, and extend this home into the Balkans. The 
Republic of Macedonia is firmly following this road and is 
prepared to cooperate with all Balkan and European countries. I 
would venture the belief that within this context Bulgaria and 
Macedonia have identical views, interests, and methods of work. 
  Because of the policy that our country has been following, 
within a brief period of time we have achieved broad 
international recognition and affirmation. We became a member 
of the United Nations and of a large number of international 
organizations. We established friendly and diplomatic relations 
with dozens of European and non-European countries. We 
cooperate for achieving peace with all members of the 
international community and are striving toward our integration 
in the European structures. 
  From a domestic viewpoint, we are preoccupied with adopting 
measures for economic stabilization and strengthening the 
institutions of power. In this context, I can say that while 
all this is being effected under very difficult conditions of 
transition and external pressure, we have succeeded in creating 
a rule-of-law state and a parliamentary democracy. 
Simultaneously, precisely like Bulgaria, many of our 
difficulties result from the strong effects and the consequences 
of the international sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. 
The Macedonian economy is suffering great losses because of 
these sanctions. So far, these losses amount to about $3 
billion. However, this is not everything. 
  For two months now, Macedonia has been exposed to the 
unjustified and unilateral measures of the Greek Government. A 
strict embargo on our exports and imports was established. Our 
country was almost hermetically sealed off. Because of this 
embargo, our economy is incurring direct losses of more than $60 
million every month. The embargo has grave consequences not 
only for our economy but also for our country's social life. 
However, with great economic sacrifices we are resisting this 
situation. According to the IMF, we are conducting a successful 
struggle against inflation. We became a member of all 
international financial institutions. We began to 
systematically resolve all problems related to privatization and 
to intensify the process of privatization and transformation of 
the larger economic systems. For this purpose, we need various 
kinds of economic aid. 
  We attach special importance to developing our 
infrastructure and our relations with our neighbors in this 
context. We regard the construction of the East-West main 
road-rail link, to which Macedonia, Albania, Turkey, and Italy, 
as well as other international institutions, have committed 
themselves, as an investment in developing the whole of 
southeast Europe. 
  The construction of the railroad, which will connect our two 
countries for the first time, will become a new, important 
factor of great significance for developing Bulgarian-Macedonian 
economic and other cooperation more successfully. 
  Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, we live at a time of great 
changes. Therefore, we all bear a great responsibility to our 
peoples, while at the same time we are trying to resolve 
problems of vital importance for present and future generations. 
Speaking about Macedonia, I can say with a full sense of 
responsibility that we are firmly determined to direct 
peacefully all our strivings and efforts toward strengthening 
the free and independent status of the Republic of Macedonia. 
We assumed such a commitment to our people through the 
independence referendum. This commitment also stems from our 
Constitution, which stresses that the Macedonian nation is based 
on the principle of self-determination, an aspiration that our 
people expressed in the referendum on the establishment of the 
independent Republic of Macedonia. We view this as a historic 
task and a responsibility toward our people. Simultaneously, we 
feel a sense of responsibility to the historic heroism of our 
ancestors, who for centuries struggled for their Macedonian 
national name and dignity. We are also responsible for the 
future of the younger generation, which should enjoy a better 
life than us. With democratic means and the criteria of modern 
times, we will create both the present and future life. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, dear Bulgarian friends, Macedonia 
adheres to the principle of good-neighborly relations. Being 
situated in the very center of the Balkans, at the very 
crossroads, Macedonia has the privilege of having four different 
borders with four nations and states, with which it has been 
destined to share both good and bad. The history of relations 
with the Balkan states and peoples is a long and complicated 
one. It is full of many conflicts and misunderstandings, which 
often related to Macedonia or neighboring territory. 
  Unfortunately, we are witnesses of the fact that problems 
still exist among the individual Balkan states. We too are 
involved in serious disputes, such as the one with our southern 
neighbor. However, past experience shows that when each state 
strives to resolve the problems on the basis of equal dialogue 
the danger for the Balkan region can be eliminated. Even the 
most complex problem can be resolved by peaceful means. 
Neighborly trust can be directly and responsibly established as 
a precondition for resolving any problem. This is an instrument 
that can eliminate all sources of conflicts and instability in 
the Balkan region. 
  The international community, through the documents of the 
United Nations and the CSCE, has created powerful instruments 
for establishing relations between states based on confidence 
and respect. Thus, a powerful basis for respecting human 
freedoms was also established. 
  In Macedonia, the democratic foundation for respecting human 
rights is very firm. This includes the rights of members of the 
ethnic minorities. We incorporated these minorities by 
establishing our state upon the principles of modern 
civilization. In effecting peaceful coexistence within our 
country, we are actually working for stability not only in our 
country but also in the entire region. This is our contribution 
to peace, good-neighborly relations, and cooperation in the 
Balkans. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, National Assembly representatives, in 
conclusion please allow me to say a few more words. I would 
like to express my great pleasure at being invited by President 
Zhelev to visit your country. I had the opportunity to have a 
broad exchange of views on the most important issues of 
Bulgarian-Macedonian relations and cooperation. I am convinced 
that, as a result of the talks that I had with President Zhelev 
and other Bulgarian politicians, our relations will obtain new 
positive stimuli, from which we will both benefit. We have 
reason to look forward to fruitful cooperation in all spheres 
and to open borders between our countries, based in law, as it 
should be between two equal and sovereign states. I believe 
that we have contributed to developing good-neighborly relations 
between our two neighboring states and mutual friendship between 
the Bulgarian and Macedonian peoples, as two kindred peoples. 
There are prospects and possibilities for even closer 
cooperation in the future. You and the Macedonian 
parliamentarians must make joint efforts to establish friendly 
and fruitful Bulgarian-Macedonian relations. 
  During those two days, we also had the opportunity to 
continue our dialogue on the most important international 
issues, especially those of a regional character. I noted with 
satisfaction a great coincidence of our assessments of the war 
in Bosnia, namely that it is possible to resolve the conflict 
through a peace treaty and by respecting the rights of all the 
peoples that live in this state. No one dares to support this 
war. We noted the vital interest of both Macedonia and Bulgaria 
in ending the war, something that will facilitate the progress 
of both countries. We reached an agreement to consult one 
another on resolving other open issues in the region, as a step 
toward building a new Balkan house of European prominence, one 
that is attractive to all the Balkan peoples. 
  Finally, Mr. Chairman, please allow me to thank you once 
again for the opportunity to address you from this lofty 
rostrum. I wish you, all the National Assembly representatives, 
and all the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria, much success 
and prosperity. [applause]

  [Text] The Yugoslav embargo and its consequences for 
Bulgaria and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], a more rapid association of the two 
countries with European structures, and a more active 
development of economic relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia 
were the topics that Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov 
discussed with Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and 
National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov today. 
  The Macedonian head of state and President Zhelyu Zhelev 
gave 
a concluding joint news conference. The historic character of 
the visit was stressed again. Here are some excerpts from the 
statements made by President Zhelev and President Gligorov 
during the news conference. 
  [Begin Zhelev recording] We established diplomatic relations 
with the Republic of Macedonia first at the level of consulates 
general and afterward at the level of a diplomatic mission, in 
other words, an embassy. Trade and economic relations have 
developed rapidly. I will allow myself to recall that at the 
beginning of 1991 trade between the two countries amounted to 
$90 million, but by 1993 it had reached $290 million. The 
dynamic and irrepressible development of trade and economic 
relations shows, among other things, that our official 
interstate relations are lagging behind the natural process of 
development. [end recording] 
  [Begin Gligorov recording, in Macedonian] I must say that we 
have had a good and serious exchange of views with the Bulgarian 
leadership on international issues and on cooperation in the 
United Nations and other international organizations, which are 
matters of common interest, and that signs of full trust and 
sincere cooperation are more and more evident. [end recording] 
  The anticipated signing of documents between Bulgaria and 
Macedonia during this first official visit by the Macedonian 
president to our country was postponed because of a language 
problem that was raised by the Macedonian side. 
  The official ceremony related to the departure of the 
Macedonian president began at the Boyana residence. The 
Macedonian head of state will depart from Bulgaria shortly.

  [Text] Two agreements were signed during the first day of 
the official visit of Albanian President Sali Berisha to 
Bulgaria. The first was an agreement on trade and economic 
cooperation and the second was an agreement on the mutual 
protection of investments. The agreements were signed by Selim 
Pelurtaja, Albanian minister of economy and trade, and Bulgarian 
Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev. 
  In brief statements after the official ceremony to sign the 
agreements, Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev and Albanian 
President Sali Berisha expressed their satisfaction with the 
development of relations between the two countries. They pointed 
out that this tendency was confirmed by the two documents, which 
regulate bilateral cooperation between Bulgaria and Albania. 
  Presidents Zhelev and Berisha had a 45-minute face-to-face 
talk, but refused any statements before the joint news 
conference scheduled to take place on 29 April.

<F P=106> [Speech by Albanian President Sali Berisha to the National </F>
Assembly in Sofia -- live, in Albanian with simultaneous 
translation into Bulgarian] 
  [Text] Your Excellency Mr. President Zhelev, esteemed 
National Assembly Chairman, esteemed Deputies of the National 
Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria, ladies and gentlemen: 
  It gives me particular pleasure to greet the lawful 
representatives of the friendly Bulgarian people from this 
platform. Permit me to express my gratitude to you for this 
meeting today and to offer my thanks to President Zhelev, who 
invited me to make this visit, which I hope will be of service 
for cooperation, drawing together, and friendship between our 
two countries. 
  History and joint coexistence in our region have been 
associated with numerous friendly links between our two peoples. 
The Albanians do not forget that in times of great difficulty 
for them, they were able to set up colonies here in Sofia, which 
were powerful centers for our national rebirth. Enlighteners 
and eminent Albanian revivalists who lived and worked in Sofia 
organized associations which published books and newspapers that 
cleared the path for our nation to advance toward independence. 
Leaders of the Albanian bands fighting for freedom also found 
support in Bulgaria. The Bulgarians helped the Albanians to win 
their independence, and we experienced a feeling of true 
friendship. 
  When Albania won her independence, this was welcomed with 
immense joy by our people. The Albanians should have confidence 
in our support for ensuring that their state remains free and 
independent -- this was stated in the greetings telegram from 
the Bulgarian state in connection with Albania's independence. 
  The new atmosphere that has been created in the countries of 
Eastern Europe following the overthrow of the dictators' 
regimes, which oriented Albania and Bulgaria toward the 
universal democratic values and integration into Europe, has 
indubitably opened up broad horizons and new prospects for 
developing comprehensive cooperation and friendship between us. 
  The visits to Albania by President Zhelev, National Assembly 
Chairman Yordanov, Foreign Minister Daskalov, and other 
Bulgarian ministers, as well as the visits to Bulgaria by 
Albanian Parliament Chairman Arbnori, Prime Minister Meksi, and 
Albanian ministers, helped us to establish closer cooperation 
and to sign agreements of mutual interest to both states. Among 
these agreements I would like especially to mention the signing 
by our two presidents in Tirana of the Treaty on Friendship and 
Cooperation Between Albania and Bulgaria. I am glad that during 
this visit we also signed an agreement on economic and trade 
cooperation and an agreement on protecting and stimulating 
investments that will directly help us to increase economic 
production-sharing between our two countries. 
  Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, many times in the course of 
past centuries our two peoples overcame difficulties and 
troubles. However, I do not want to dwell on history now, but 
merely to stress that during the second half of the 20th century 
the communist regime was an immense common drama that we both 
experienced, but the liberation from totalitarian domination 
clearly demonstrated that the Albanians and Bulgarians can be 
bent but never broken. 
  At the moment, Albania and Bulgaria are committing their 
utmost efforts to realizing the wishes of their peoples, 
expressed by their free vote, to build a society on the basis of 
a rule-of-law state, with due respect for the liberties and 
rights of man, to build a market economy, and to achieve their 
integration into Europe and the international community. 
  Permit me to pay my respects to this parliament in 
recognition of its exceptional work in replacing the legislation 
of a dictatorial society with the laws and norms of a free 
democratic society. [applause] 
  I take pleasure in being able to inform you that Albania is 
strongly committed to the same transformation. During the last 
two years, to overcome the legacy, certainly the most bitter one 
of all the legacies in Eastern Europe, we chose the fast track 
for implementing in-depth legislative, social, and economic 
reforms. This course is probably the most painful one; it 
requires the most sacrifices, but on the other hand most quickly 
produces visible results. The Albanian Parliament passed 
hundreds of laws meeting European standards, the most important 
of which are a Charter of Human Rights and difficult 
constitutional laws that correspond to the European Human Rights 
Convention. In two years, all our institutions have undergone 
profound transformations. In the economic field, we privatized 
the land, housing plots, road transportation, trade, and 
services. We have privatized over 1,000 enterprises during the 
last eight months alone. 
  In 1994 we will continue the privatization of medium-size 
and 
large enterprises. The have liberalized prices and foreign 
currency exchange, and the results were not slow in coming. The 
stores are full, the long lines have disappeared, and our 
currency has stabilized and, in practice, is convertible. Last 
year annual inflation fell to 30 percent from 400 percent prior 
to the elections on 22 March 1992. In 1993 Albania reported the 
greatest economic growth in Europe, a growth of 10 percent in 
the GNP. 
  Despite all this, Albania remains the poorest country in 
Europe, with an infrastructure of a Third World country, with 
obsolete technologies, and a high rate of unemployment that 
varies between 14 and 18 percent. These factors hamper our way 
forward. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, our two friendly countries, as well as 
the other countries of the Eastern Europe, have liberated 
ourselves from communist dictatorships and chosen the road of 
freedom [applause], the market economy, and the rule-of-law 
state, a road that they do not expect to be strewn with flowers. 
However, as well as the immense natural difficulties of the 
transition, of orientation toward the market economy, we have 
encountered unexpected problems and even unforeseen dangers. 
The dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain are 
naturally immense achievements of mankind as a whole and of 
Western society in particular. Their replacement with a 
financial wall, barriers of a different psychological nature, 
and ultranationalist and racist obstacles constitute an immense 
threat, not only for our countries but also for our continent. 
The removal of the Iron Curtain was not only accompanied by the 
liberation of the dozens of countries and hundreds of millions 
of people from one of the most cruel dictatorships that mankind 
has experienced, but we have to admit that it was also 
accompanied by dangerous phenomenons: the Bosnian syndromes, 
the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon [applause], the Serbian aggression, 
and its exacerbation by various forms of nationalism, 
ultranationalism, racism, and so on. 
  Before the specter of communism had fully disappeared, other 
ghosts from the near and more distant past today pose a threat 
to peace, security, and democratic values on our continent. 
Taken together, all of them hamper and interrupt the process of 
integration that is vitally important and crucial for both the 
fate of democracy in our countries and the whole of Western 
mankind, and intensify confrontation. Therefore, today more 
than ever, the consolidation of bilateral and regional 
cooperation is of particular importance for our present and 
future, for our children. [applause] 
  Mr. Chairman, our peninsula has been plunged into in a 
profound and dangerous crisis. The war in Bosnia is the 
greatest human drama that Europe has experienced since the time 
of World War II. This war, if the aggressor is allowed to get 
away with it, is only the prelude to a regional war waged on a 
broader scale, the consequences of which cannot be described. 
[applause] 
  First, the war in Bosnia is the result of the decision of 
the 
communist dictatorship in Belgrade to create a Greater Serbia by 
aggression and in conformance with the memorandum of the Serbian 
Academy of Sciences that envisages the ethnic purging of more 
than 40 percent of the population inhabiting this territory, on 
the sole ground that it is not Serbian. 
  Second, there is an exacerbation and encouragement of this 
aggression by other nationalist Balkan -- and not only Balkan -- 
countries that believe that, following the Serbian model, they 
can satisfy their own chauvinistic and ultranationalistic 
ambitions. [applause] 
  Third, it is more than naive to think that a Greater Serbia, 
if established, could establish peace, stability, and 
equilibrium in the Balkans. In practice, this idea is just as 
dangerous as the previous two, and would have graver 
consequences. This is so because first, it accepts the 
alteration of borders by force, and second, it supports the 
ridiculous thesis that the Serbian people should dominate in the 
Balkan peninsula, when it makes up no more than 7 to 8 percent 
of the population of the Balkans. Believing in this viewpoint 
is tantamount to aiding the long-term destabilization of the 
region, because history has clearly confirmed on numerous 
occasions that a Greater Serbia was always a transitory and 
unstable structure and lead to war, conflicts, instability, and 
aggression. [applause]. 
  It is a fact that a Greater Serbia always represents a 
direct 
danger for the Bulgarians, Albanians, Macedonians, and other 
peoples. We believe that the aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, a sovereign state and a member of the United 
Nations, and its dismemberment by force of arms set a question 
mark over the common and individual security of the countries in 
our peninsula. We are seriously worried about the continuous 
degradation of the situation in Kosovo, where 2 million 
Albanians live on a compact territory, making up 90 percent of 
its population. In the former Yugoslavia, Kosovo was an 
autonomous province and enjoyed almost all the rights of the 
former Yugoslav republics. Kosovo had its own state, economic, 
and cultural institutions, whereas today Belgrade denies these 
human and national rights, rejects dialogue with them, and is 
creating in Kosovo an explosive situation that may easily blow 
up. 
  Albania declares that it opposes changing borders from a 
position of force. It insists that if Belgrade transfers the 
conflict to Kosovo, it will bear the total responsibility for a 
regional war. The prevention of this war is an important and 
permanent priority for Albania, Bulgaria, and other countries 
interested in peace and stability. I consider that, under these 
conditions, bilateral cooperation -- political, economic, 
cultural, and military -- between Albania and Bulgaria, and also 
within the multilateral framework of the European institutions, 
the Partnership for Peace initiative, and the Black Sea Economic 
Zone initiative are of immense importance for peace and 
stability in our region. 
  By their policies, Albania and Bulgaria have provided and 
are making an important contribution to preserving peace and 
preventing conflicts. In this context, I would like to stress 
that Bulgaria's refusal to take part in the trilateral summit in 
Athens is of immense importance for reducing and restraining the 
expansionist ambitions of those who consider that they can 
implement them by forming aggressive axes and alliances. 
Furthermore, although it maintains that the Albanian question 
is the chief one in the Balkans, Albania does not want borders 
to be changed by force. It stands for a democratic region in 
which respect is shown for the human and national freedoms and 
rights of the Albanians in the place where they live. 
  Our two countries recognized The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia and regard its stability as a condition for preventing 
a conflict in the southern part of the Balkans. [applause] 
  Ladies and gentlemen, I am an optimist regarding the 
development of the spirit of understanding, cooperation, and 
friendship between Albania and Bulgaria. Albania attaches 
particular importance to its friendly relations with the 
Republic of Bulgaria because it is convinced that this 
corresponds to the political, economic, and cultural interests 
of our two nations, and also contributes to expanding a climate 
of defusing tension and cooperation in our region, the Balkans. 
I consider that bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the 
Balkans is a crucial factor for the process of the integration 
of our countries and peoples into Europe. 
  I express my wish for the traditional friendly cooperation 
between Albania and Bulgaria and the multilateral cooperation to 
develop even further. May God help Albania to develop and 
speedily advance along the road of progress, states the 
greetings telegram that I quoted at the start of my speech. I 
would like to conclude by offering the same good wishes to you. 
[applause and cheers] 
  May God bless our countries and peoples, and the friendship 
and cooperation between them! Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Interview with ex-King Mihai I by Liviu Valenas in Versoix, </F>
Switzerland; date not given: "I Hope People Will Not Lose Their 
Courage"; broadcast on Deutsche Welle on 6 April] 
  [Excerpts] [Valenas] Sire, three years ago you granted an 
interview to our radio station, Deutsche Welle, and here we are 
again after three years, resuming the discussion that we 
interrupted then in Paris. Now we are in Versoix, Switzerland, 
the place of your residence in exile, if I may say so. I would 
first like you to talk about the award granted last year by the 
Yad Vashem organization to your mother, Queen Mother Elena. 
  [Mihai I] It was a great pleasure for me that they did that, 
and I interpreted this move as a reparation of a big injustice; 
namely that not one single word was said about the Jewish people 
in Romania and those deported in Dniester, and now, luckily, in 
the past three years, all kinds of research has been done and 
memoirs and documents have been consulted to reestablish the 
truth. Finally, this year, this organization accepted the fact 
that my mother's righteousness should be recognized. On her 
behalf, I received a medal and a document, in which everything 
she did for the Jews in Romania was recognized. [passage omitted] 
  [Valenas] Sire, how would you characterize the current 
Romanian Army? 
  [Mihai I] In the past three years, I have realized that the 
Army has regained its so-called independence from the political 
vicissitude of the past years. The army is at the disposal of 
the country and is ready to commit itself for the security of 
the country. All attempts to take away its fundamental role 
could only provoke a crisis within the army. The Army is there 
to serve the Romanian people and our homeland, not the policies 
of others. All officers and soldiers know what the Army means 
and what our traditions are. However, just like other armies 
throughout the world, attempts are made to politicize an army, 
remove it from its own duty toward the country, and provoke 
qualms. 
  [Valenas] How do you explain that there are still 
sympathetic 
feelings toward you among the Romanian officers? 
  [Mihai I] Whether I completed my military training in 
Romania or whether I was an officer in the Romanian Army still 
plays a role in this respect, and I do not know why because so 
many years have elapsed. I have often said there is a soft spot 
in my heart for the Romanian Army. Considering that I went went 
through military training in our country, I feel very close to 
our Army and, as a matter of fact, I believe the Army should 
return to its old traditions. 
  [Valenas] Do you believe it is appropriate that at the helm 
of our Army there should be a civilian who used to work at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, about whom, as a matter of fact, 
the Romanian press published conclusive data that he used to be 
an employee with the rank of colonel in the former Foreign 
Information Directorate of the Securitate? 
  [Mihai I] Again, here is a case in which all kind of things 
are said, but in our country the minister of war [as published] 
has always been a military person. To what extent his name is 
appreciated in Europe or in the West, or whether he is a 
civilian or an army person, is their business. Our business is 
to preserve our tradition as it has always been. I do not think 
that such a thing would have been easily accepted in our army. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Valenas] Sire, how would you assess the current situation 
in Romania from a social, political, and maybe even moral point 
of view? 
  [Mihai I] As far as I know, there are two moral issues: the 
people's morale is very low, as is morality. The finances are 
still state-owned, the economy is destroyed, and people do not 
have any money. It is a very difficult situation. I cannot 
tell you much more than that. I can only say that the situation 
is very difficult. [passage omitted] 
  [Valenas] Sire, at the end of our interview, what would you 
recommend to the Romanian people? 
  [Mihai I] For the immediate future, I hope the people will 
not lose their courage and look a little forward, and not just 
to everyday difficulties, which are very big indeed. However, 
people should not lose their belief in God and their hope in the 
future.

<F P=106> [Report by Radu Tudor and Daniel Capatos: "Yevgeniy </F>
Primakov, Head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, Visited 
Bucharest Yesterday"] 
  [Text] At the invitation of Virgil Magureanu, SRI 
[Romanian Intelligence Service] director, Yevgeniy Primakov, 
chief of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service [SVR], made a 
24-hour visit to Romania on 22 April 1994. The distinguished 
Russian guest did not meet with President Ion Iliescu. 
  Primakov's visit again finds Magureanu again in a state that 
has had precedence: The head of the Romanian 
counterintelligence service holds discussions -- in an 
unexplainable way -- not with his counterpart in the Russian 
Federation but with the head of the Intelligence Service in 
Moscow. 
  Among the issues discussed, one can note Russia's 
involvement 
in the conflict in Bosnia and its repercussions on Romania. 
Other issues discussed by Primakov and Magureanu were 
terrorism, drug smuggling, and a relative "nonaggression treaty" 
between the SRI and the SVR. 
<H5>  The Military Air and Naval Attache of the Russian Federation </H5>
in Bucharest, Colonel Yevgeniy Smirnov, Declares That He Did Not 
See Yevgeniy Primakov Yesterday 
  Confidential sources reported that on 22 April the lack of 
Primakov-Talpes and Primakov-Iliescu meetings raised certain 
already existing problems to the level of diplomatic 
difficulties. Yevgeniy Primakov's visit was in response to the 
visit recently paid by Virgil Magureanu to Moscow. Thus, it is 
certain that as a result of this visit there will be more 
evident disputes between Ion Iliescu and Virgil Magureanu. 
  Last night we contacted Colonel Yevgeniy Smirnov, air and 
naval military attache of the Russian Federation to Bucharest, 
who said that he personally had not seen the SVR chief yesterday 
and that he represents the Russian defense minister and not 
Moscow's civil intelligence service. 
  Yesterday, the only flight from Moscow that arrived at 
Otopeni Airport was the regular Aeroflot flight, which landed at 
0930 and then took off at 1150. No other special plane arrived 
from Moscow yesterday. 
<H5>  AFP Promptly Reports That For the First Time Since </H5>
Ceausescu's Fall, a Head of the Russian Secret Services Visits 
Romania. 
  Only two hours after the national news agency ROMPRES 
announced that the head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service 
Yevgeniy Primakov paid a flash visit to Romania, AFP took the 
piece of news and disseminated it together with its normal news 
items. 
  The news item broadcast by AFP mentions that Yevgeniy 
Primakov's visit was made at the invitation of SRI Director 
Virgil Magureanu and that this is the first such visit since 
Ceausescu's fall in December 1989. 
  "The talks focused on the issue of fighting terrorism and 
organized crime" read the text of the official release, as is 
usually the practice in case of such meetings.

<F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Peter Zwack, chairman of the </F>
Liberal Civic Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party; place and date not 
given: "List Leaders Give Interviews -- Zwack: The Party of 
Economic Conscience"] 
  [Text] In our election series, the list leaders of parties 
that set up national lists are giving interviews on the typical 
program points and concepts of their parties. In reply to our 
question, Peter Zwack, chairman of the Liberal Civic 
Alliance-Entrepreneurs' Party [LPSZ-VP], said that they would 
like as many entrepreneurs as possible to get into parliament 
because it is impossible to base a successful economic policy on 
ideologies. 
  [Zwack] We want to represent the interests of small and 
medium sized enterprises. Initially, our organization was 
called Entrepreneurs' Party and we later added the name Liberal 
Civic Alliance to this. This expresses our intention also to 
open toward the intellectual entrepreneurs, namely lawyers, 
doctors, and so on. At the moment, Hungary does not have a 
strong middle class, therefore, the LPSZ-VP mainly deals with 
economic issues. This party is something unique to Hungary, we 
could call ourselves the party of economic conscience. We 
intend to help as many entrepreneurs as possible into 
Parliament. We would be happy to end our operation in eight to 
12 years' time if the economic processes get to a level where 
our party is no longer needed. 
  We find it unfortunate that the current coalition was 
organized on an ideological basis and the professional 
viewpoints were pushed into the background. The Christian and 
popular-national way of thinking is respectable but an economic 
policy cannot be based on this. In our view, the serious 
economic crisis is partly due to the fact that the government 
did not have a clear economic policy that could have been 
followed. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to create 
enterprises. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The LPSZ-VP is part of the four-party 
liberal cooperation. In view of the various polemic statements, 
how stable do you think the liberal bloc is? 
  [Zwack] The alliance is more stable than the media often 
allows people to believe, although arguments certainly do exist 
between the leaders of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
and the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ]. Prime Minister 
Peter Boross is applying clever tactics when he says that a 
contest of the left wing and the coalition can be expected at 
the elections. In contrast to this, the experience of setting 
up the candidates shows that the liberal bloc is so strong that 
even if it does not reach 50 percent, it will be able to choose 
its coalition partners. As a matter of fact, in my view, a 
responsible prime minister cannot state that the country will 
not have a stable government unless the current coalition wins. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What are your views on your party's election 
chances, with special reference to the fact that, according to 
the surveys, the LPSZ-VP's current support does not reach the 5 
percent necessary to get into Parliament? 
  [Zwack] It is unfortunate that we did not manage to set up a 
list in Budapest in the end. At the same time, we put up 69 
individual candidates and we have regional lists in 14 counties. 
We are doing all we can to get into Parliament, but even if we 
do not succeed in this, our party will play a more important 
role in the future than now. Our link with the entrepreneurs 
may upgrade our role, among our allies are those liberal parties 
that we hope will be determining forces in the next government. 
We will suggest the establishment of an economic top ministry, 
an advisory body for the future prime minister, which will 
consist of small and medium entrepreneurs, and the introduction 
of a two-chamber parliamentary system. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If the parties of the liberal bloc do not 
reach 50 percent, you will have to think about the potential 
coalition partners. It is obvious that two alternatives exist: 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] or the current coalition 
parties. Has the LPSZ-VP formed its stance on this? 
  [Zwack] Not yet, and this issue was not discussed at the 
latest meeting of the four liberal parties, either. We will be 
able to decide with whom to form a coalition when the election 
results are known. We agreed that we will do all we can for the 
best possible election performance of the liberal bloc and that 
we will begin coordination talks on the future government 
program. We can be certain about one thing: The better our 
results are at the elections, the fewer compromises we will have 
to accept when the coalition is formed.

  [Text] Foreign policy is an area that did not much divide 
the parliamentary parties after the change of the regime. After 
1990, it was almost fashionable to talk about foreign policy as 
a kind of success story and to refer to the foreign policy 
consensus between the parties. However, by now, this consensus 
is almost entirely broken and foreign policy has become an 
organic part of the election campaign. In fact, disagreements 
can be suspected in the approach to certain issues within the 
coalition and within the opposition parties. Regarding major 
foreign policy goals, the political parties tend to agree; 
however, there is a sharp debate among them on the order of 
priorities and the means to implement these goals. In our 
report, we investigated how the current and possible future 
parliamentary parties would form foreign policy in the next 
governmental cycle. 
<H5>  Federation of Young Democrats: Foreign Policy Triangle </H5>
  The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] has formulated 
its 
concept as a foreign policy triangle that coincides considerably 
with the line followed by Hungary since the change of the 
regime, Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the party's National 
Committee, told MAGYAR NEMZET. Szajer said that this triangle 
consists of European integration, national minority policy, and 
regional and neighborly cooperation, three factors that are 
closely interrelated. The Young Democrats believe that, for 
Hungary, there is no alternative to integration and gaining 
membership of the European Union [EU], because the cost of 
staying out of it would be much higher than the possible costs 
of joining. 
  The Fidesz believes that drawing up the program of domestic 
preparations is the most important element of membership, namely 
forming the real mechanisms of market economy in a way that will 
also conform to the EU's conditions. The Fidesz also considers 
legal harmonization necessary, which presumes social and 
economic decisions that may cause serious problems and can even 
attract heavy burdens. Therefore, the Fidesz believes that the 
aim has to be that this preparedness can be proved when the 
conditions of joining are set out. 
  In the case of a nation a third of which is living outside 
the borders, the national minority issue will always be a 
fundamental and central element of foreign policy, Szajer said. 
Neglecting this can cause serious domestic political problems 
both in Hungary and in the neighboring states. Therefore, the 
Fidesz believes that it has to have a very circumspect policy, 
bearing in mind the sentiments of national minorities and of the 
majority nations. They see the Antall government's national 
minority policy as basically correct, but they found it lacking 
empathy with the nations of the neighboring countries. 
Hungarian leaders have made statements on a number of occasions 
which were ambiguous and did not improve the relationship 
between the minority and majority; however, in terms of deeds, 
the government has not made any serious mistakes in the past 
period, Szajer said. In addition to all this, the Fidesz feels 
it necessary to improve communication with the leaders of the 
neighboring countries, and considers the continuation of 
dialogue very important even if it does not lead to early 
results. The long-term solution of the national minority issue 
presumably depends on the development of economic cooperation, 
which in turn can be very positively influenced by 
intergovernmental dialogue. In connection with signing the 
basic treaties, Szajer said: If these documents lay down 
national minority protection guarantees -- which are essential 
for the region's stability -- then the Fidesz does not see any 
obstacles to this "symbolic decision." At the same time, they 
feel that the basic treaties have to be based on already 
functioning economic, cultural, and church agreements. 
<H5>  Christian Democratic People's Party: A Quicker Way to Europe </H5>
  For us, of primary importance is to live in peace with 
neighboring states, which in turn have to respect the rights of 
the Hungarian minorities. It is important to accelerate our 
approach to Europe. In the interest of strengthening our 
security, we believe that NATO should give certain guarantees to 
Hungary even before we become full NATO members, was how Laszlo 
Varga, deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP], summed up the party's foreign policy goals. 
  Talking about relations with our neighbors, he said that the 
UN decision of 19 December 1992 clearly laid down the rights of 
the national minorities. According to Varga, there is no point 
again including the border issue in the basic treaties to be 
made with our neighbors because this issue was clearly settled 
by the Helsinki Final Act: The borders of countries cannot be 
forcefully changed, but it would be a mistake to surrender the 
possibility included in the Final Act on facilitating certain 
changes through peaceful means and negotiations. 
  Varga also said that our neighbors should realize that the 
Hungarian minorities do not threaten their statehood and 
territorial integrity; therefore, it is pointless raising 
anxiety and fears. According to Varga, the settlement of the 
national minority issue might be advanced by the fact that, 
after the emergence of the south Slav crisis and the critical 
areas in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the 
West has also recognized the importance of this issue. 
  Talking about our approach to Europe, Varga explained that, 
according to their experience, our membership request that was 
submitted at the beginning of April has the support of all the 
EU member states, and our efforts are viewed with sympathy; 
therefore, it would presumably be possible to accelerate our 
process of gaining membership, which might, in an optimal case, 
lead to membership in 1998 or 1999. 
<H5>  Hungarian Democratic Forum: European Integration and </H5>
Hungarians Beyond the Border 
  The foreign policy priorities of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF] can be summed up as two points: European 
integration and Hungarians beyond the border, Gyorgy Csoti, 
foreign affairs spokesman of the MDF, told MAGYAR NEMZET. These 
two elements of the foreign policy program are inseparable and 
neither can be placed above the other. Good-neighborly 
relations have a basic importance and they are in the interests 
of Hungary and of the Hungarians living beyond the border, 
while, at the same time, they are inseparable from the situation 
of these Hungarians. Good-neighborly relations can only be a 
result of the settling of the problems of minority Hungarians 
because this is virtually the only reason for our tense 
relations with the neighboring countries. According to Csoti, 
it is inconceivable for the Hungarian Government first to form 
good relations with the leadership of the neighboring countries 
and then the situation of the Hungarians beyond the border to 
improve as a result of this. He pointed out that, in the 
history of the past 74 years, none of the governments was able 
to resolve this issue; in fact, although interstate relations 
were excellent, the situation of the Hungarians beyond the 
border has continued to deteriorate over the past 45 years. 
According to Csoti, the situation of the minority Hungarians is 
most critical in Romania. Owing to the new Moravcik government, 
the prospects are better in Slovakia, and in Serbia, too. 
  Csoti denied that the MDF's foreign policy has changed in 
connection with Yugoslavia. A year and a half ago, the 
Hungarian Government said that limited military intervention can 
curb the violence and the escalation of the war, and, at that 
time, a chance still existed for this. However, these constant 
threats that are never implemented will lose their credibility, 
and even if Belgrade takes them seriously, they are having a 
decreasing effect on the events. By now, we probably have a 
Lebanon-style crisis that can only be handled in the long term. 
For this very reason, certain doubts were raised, among other 
things, in connection with the fruitless embargo. Csoti 
believes that it has to be reassessed, rather than discarded. 
It has to be eased, or made total, even together with military 
actions, in the interest of an early result, because it is 
untenable since a long drawn-out embargo is also a burden on 
other countries of the region. However, on the embargo issue, 
the MDF is not in favor of unilateral Hungarian measures; UN 
decisions have to be observed even if Hungary, as a badly 
affected country, raises doubts. 
  Csoti also denied that, even initially, the government had 
tried to keep distance from the region of the former Soviet 
Union. The initial difficulties can be explained through the 
completely collapsed economies and the approximately $2 billion 
debts of Russia, Ukraine, and the other former Soviet republics. 
However, the Hungarian Government immediately stood by 
Gorbachev and Yeltsin when anti-democratic coups were attempted 
against them, and it was Budapest that first made an agreement 
with Russia and Ukraine. However, according to the MDF, Hungary 
cannot commit itself to any of the major powers even if, for 
historical reasons, relations with certain countries are closer 
than with others. 
<H5>  Hungarian Socialist Party: To Reestablish Consensus </H5>
  It is the responsibility of the future governing parties to 
change the perception of consensus and to reestablish it by 
including the opposition in foreign policy decisions that affect 
the country's fundamental interests, and by acquiring for these 
the support of the broadest possible public, Laszlo Kovacs, 
chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, said 
for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], also using this as an 
argument for his party's proposal to confirm our EU and NATO 
membership in a referendum. In his view, the major directions 
of foreign policy that were contained in the 1990 government 
program accepted by Parliament have to be preserved: close ties 
with the West, normal relations with the neighbors, and support 
for the assertion of the rights of Hungarians living beyond the 
border. These major directions follow from Hungary's interests 
and circumstances, and from the international conditions, and 
the parties have had a consensus on these issues. However, 
Kovacs believes that, owing to the "government's clumsiness," we 
have not managed to get as close to these goals as was possible; 
in fact, relations with our neighbors have deteriorated -- "with 
some of them expressly" -- which, together with other factors, 
has damaged Hungary's foreign image and limited the 
effectiveness of Hungarian foreign policy, including the 
efficiency of efforts made in the interest of Hungarians living 
beyond the border. 
  In his party's view, the relationship between the major 
directions of foreign policy has to be changed. A balance has 
to be established because these three directions are closely 
interrelated and if we try to assert any one of them to the 
detriment of the other two, this will have a negative effect on 
the whole foreign policy. The foreign policy attitude also 
needs to be changed. We cannot start from a sense of a mission, 
and foreign policy cannot be based on historical grievances or 
merits, on desires or assumptions. Foreign policy has to be 
based on interests, mutual interests of Hungary and the partner 
states have to be found, or the opportunity has to be 
established to coordinate these interests, Kovacs emphasized. 
He also said that we have to take international realities as a 
basis, and we have to keep assessing them and gauging the 
changes. We have to start from the "actual support" for the 
country's international efforts, and we "must not overestimate 
Hungary's international importance and role." 
  The MSZP would also like to change the foreign political 
instrument system and the style of foreign policy. It would 
stop the practice of trying to "exert pressure" on our neighbors 
as this has not been successful in the past four years, either. 
The restriction of relations cannot be a foreign policy 
instrument, either, because none of our neighbors needs 
cooperation as much as we do; and we must not try to isolate any 
of our neighbors and hinder their access to international 
organizations. 
  At negotiations, the partner must not be treated in a 
condescending manner or lectured, not even on Hungarian history. 
It is not the task of Hungarian politicians to make up for the 
deficiencies, for example, of Western history education, Kovacs 
says. On the other hand, we have to initiate 
confidence-building gestures. In politics, we need "to 
understand the partner's way of thinking," and it is very 
important to remove the possibilities of misunderstandings and 
misinterpretations. This is one of the reasons that respect for 
expertise in foreign policy has to be restored, and the practice 
that "ambassadors and diplomats, fearing their positions, report 
what they believe the government or the Foreign Ministry 
leadership would like to hear" has to be stopped. 
<H5>  Workers' Party: Opening Also to the East </H5>
  A serious party cannot ignore the European directions of 
development; therefore, the Workers' Party is in favor of 
developing extensive relations in all directions, including the 
East, Joachim Vasas, member of the party's Executive Committee, 
emphasized. However, a referendum will have to decide on EU and 
NATO membership. It is essential that the integration processes 
are not implemented to the detriment of the country. Up to now, 
the agricultural sector and industry have been sacrificed at the 
altar of EU membership and the market of Hungarian goods in 
Hungary and in the neighboring countries has been destroyed. 
The country will continue to be waiting for EU membership for 
years to come because the European Union always backtracks, 
shuts itself off, makes conditions, and dictates. For 
professional and political reasons, the Workers' Party does not 
support NATO membership, because this is against Hungary's 
elementary national interests. Yugoslavia, Romania, or Ukraine 
are unlikely to become NATO members, and a Hungarian membership 
would only increase distrust, further annoy our neighbors, and 
damage the situation of Hungarians living there. We must strive 
for normal and balanced economic and political relations with 
the neighboring countries, Vasas continued, because this 
establishes the basis for improving the situation of Hungarian 
minorities living there. As a matter of fact, the Hungarian 
Parliament, by denying the right to the national minorities 
living in Hungary to set up independent electoral lists, has 
lost its ground to speak up for the Hungarians living beyond the 
border in a credible way. 
<H5>  Alliance of Free Democrats: Small Steps Toward Our Neighbors </H5>
  The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] starts from the 
premise that the three major foreign policy areas, namely 
European integration, relations with neighboring countries, and 
the problem of Hungarian minorities living beyond the borders, 
need to be handled together, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, foreign 
affairs spokesman of the SZDSZ, told MAGYAR NEMZET. As for the 
Europe policy, it is the party's strategic goal that membership 
of the European Union must follow adequate preparations. This 
foreign policy task also has many domestic political 
implications, mainly in the area of the economy and legal 
harmonization, and the necessary institutions will have to be 
established to coordinate the preparations. 
  Rather than the time of membership, they consider it vital 
that the process actually begins and talks on membership are 
started as soon as possible. Until then, the SZDSZ advocates 
that cooperation with the European Union should be increasingly 
diverse. At the same time, in the area of foreign and security 
policy, they wish to ensure an earlier participation of Hungary 
in European institutions, and they would also like to achieve 
our participation in the work of the important European 
decision-making bodies with consultative rights before full 
membership is achieved. 
  As for neighborhood policy, according to Szent-Ivanyi, this 
is the weak side, the most vulnerable part of Hungarian foreign 
policy at the moment. While there is a general consensus of 
goals on Europe policy, the approaches fundamentally differ on 
neighborhood policy. We must not set ideological-style 
conditions; rather, our interest lies in the ability to make 
progress concomitantly in two closely related areas, namely in 
ensuring the rights of Hungarians beyond the border and 
improving bilateral relations. In the area of neighborhood 
policy, the politics of small steps is important to make various 
economic agreements and strengthen cultural links, and it is the 
SZDSZ's goal that we contribute to the improvement of the 
situation of Hungarians beyond the border through these links, 
too. As for the possible signing of the basic treaties, the 
SZDSZ starts from the premise that these treaties are a means 
rather than an end: A means to settling the existing problems. 
Therefore, they advocate such basic treaties that can 
contribute to easing the disagreements. They do not reject that 
issues considered important by the partners -- including the 
border issue -- can be part of these treaties; however, they 
only see any point in this if the treaties can also resolve the 
issues considered important by Hungary. 
  In the SZDSZ's view, security policy is inseparable from 
foreign policy. They consider Hungary's NATO membership a 
strategic goal. They hope that this can be achieved in a 
foreseeable period, within a few years. Until then, it is 
necessary to prepare the proposal that outlines Hungary's tasks 
within the "Partnership for Peace" program as soon as possible. 
<H5>  Independent Smallholders Party: Turning Toward Asia </H5>
  Although the traditional directions of foreign relations 
have 
to be maintained, instead of the "one-sided foreign policy 
orientation," the Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] wishes 
to lay emphasis on areas hitherto neglected. The party led by 
Jozsef Torgyan would conduct a foreign policy that also 
considers our economic interests and would pay more attention to 
Europe, and, for example, to the Scandinavian region. An 
orientation toward Asia is marked in the party's foreign policy 
program, they would a "give new meaning" to our policy on this 
region, mainly to cooperation with India and China, and they 
would also lay more emphasis on relations with Japan and the 
"Asian tigers," including Taiwan. 
  On the issue of Hungarians living beyond the border, the 
FKGP intends to form good-neighborly relations with all 
neighboring countries, but a triple autonomy, namely cultural, 
personal, and territorial autonomy, is a condition for this. 
According to the FKGP, collective rights, self-determination, 
and autonomy are the three basic pillars of the rights due to 
Hungarians living beyond the border. 
<H5>  Hungarian Justice and Life Party: National Interest Comes </H5>
First 
  The Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] considers 
European integration important but this cannot enjoy priority 
over national interests, MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath said. 
The MIEP feels that Hungarian foreign policy's lukewarm 
attitude to the national minorities is due to the fact that, in 
the interest of European integration, its politicians are trying 
to give the impression that Hungary would even be prepared to 
abandon the interest protection of its own national minorities 
in the interest of gaining membership. From the Hungarian 
security point of view, it would be good if NATO accepted it as 
a member, but we have to be aware that, through the peace 
partnership, NATO has actually rejected Central Europe, so we 
have to organize our security policy cognisant of this fact. 
Only a referendum can decide on possible membership. 
  The fate of the national minorities living beyond the border 
has a definite priority within the MIEP's policy. It is 
important to build good relations with the neighboring countries 
but this cannot depend on basic treaties, and certainly cannot 
be a repeat of the formula laid down in the basic treaty with 
Ukraine. In the spirit of the Helsinki Accord, the MIEP is 
against the forceful alteration of borders but, apart from this, 
it is totally unnecessary to lay down these principles again. 
This would be a gesture submitting ourselves to the will of 
others, which cannot be accepted by a proud nation.

  [Text] The number of Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
supporters increased by 4 percent in April; therefore, some 24 
percent of the population that is eligible to vote support the 
Socialists. The voters of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] increased by 2 percent, which is not statistically 
significant, but it means that they have caught up with the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]. In the case of the 
other parties, the changes are even smaller. Support for Fidesz 
and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] has not 
changed (9 and 5 percent), while support for the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Independent Smallholders Party 
[FKGP] increased by 1 percent (to 7 and 6 percent). Based on 
public opinion polls of recent months, it can be said that the 
leading group of parties has become stabilized. The six parties 
that gained seats in parliament in 1990 also have the biggest 
chance to do so in 1994. The support level for the non- 
parliamentary parties is around 1 or 2 percent -- such as, the 
Workers' Party, the Agrarian Federation, the Entrepreneurs' 
Party, the Repbulic Party, the Hungarian Justice and Life Party 
[MIEP], and the United Smallholders Party [EKGP] -- or does not 
even reach this minimum -- for example, the National Democratic 
Federation [NDSZ] and the Social Democratic Party of Hungary 
[MSZDP]. More people became certain about their preferences as 
the parliamentary candidates became known, party lists were 
published, and the campaign became more intensive. While in the 
second half of March, 40 percent of the citizens could not or 
did not want to vote; this went down to 34 percent in April. 
  At the moment, 64 percent of the electors promise definite 
participation, and a large majority of them also named the party 
they would probably vote for. In the month before the 
elections, we can attribute major importance to this group. 
They are the most likely participants of the 8 May elections. 
(These people say they would vote for a party or deputy "this 
Sunday.") At the moment, 49 percent of the adult population 
belongs to the group of potential voters, 5 percent more than in 
the second half of March. The members of this group have a 
higher than average schooling level, and most of them are 
middle-aged rather than young or old. In this group, the MSZP 
has a large advantage; it enjoys almost four-tenths of the 
support of active electors. It is the SZDSZ that managed to 
increase the number of its voters among the potential voters, 
thus claiming second place, while the MDF has the third largest 
active support. 
  At the moment, 15 percent of the electors -- more than 1 
million people -- consider themselves definite voters but do not 
know which party to vote for. Elderly people and Budapest 
citizens are more typical among them than the average. The 
parties can still increase their number of voters from this 
group; however, we can only approach their electoral orientation 
indirectly from their negative sentiments. It follows that 
those parties have a smaller chance of gaining the support of 
these people, for which more of them show antagonistic feelings. 
In this sense, the MDF can be the most pessimistic because 
antagonistic feelings are shown toward this party by most people 
(21 percent). Quite a few people also spoke negatively about 
the FKGP [11 percent). From the group that is certain about 
participating in the voting but uncertain about the choice, 7 
percent named the Workers' Party and the MSZP as parties worth 
voting for, and 5 percent mentioned MIEP. An increasing number 
of the population believes that, according to the political 
power structure, the MSZP has the biggest chance to win the 
elections. At the end of March, every fourth elector assumed 
that the Socialists would win the elections and every third 
believed this in April. 
  The survey was carried out 8-18 April 1994. One thousand 
people who represent the country's population over the age of 14 
were questioned. Of the 1,000 questioned, 936 are eligible to 
vote. The group to be examined was Hungarian citizens over the 
age of 18 who have a permanent address in Hungary. The 
structure of this group and that of the surveyed people 
correspond in age, gender, and type of dwelling. 
  The data received in the public opinion survey can at the 
most deviate by 4 percent if every citizen who is eligible to 
vote had been asked; however, the results arrived at in the 
survey have the biggest likelihood.

<F P=106> [Article by "(bog, mh)": "Jozef Moravcik Has Been Elected </F>
Chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava--Delegates to the amalgamation 
assembly of the Alliance of Democrats of Slovakia [AD SR] and 
the Alternative for Political Realism (APR) elected Jozef 
Moravcik chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) on 
Saturday [23 April]. Milan Knazko was elected first deputy 
chairman, and Roman Kovac and Viliam Vaskovic were elected 
deputy chairmen. 
  Rudolf Filkus was also a candidate for the post of deputy 
chairman, but he did not gain the required number of votes. The 
proposal submitted by E. Bartosova that the number of deputy 
chairmen be increased to four to include J. Budaj was not 
passed. The delegates elected a 50-member DEUS Republican 
Council. R. Filkus and J. Budaj are members of it. Following 
Saturday's assembly, DEUS has 18 deputies in parliament. 
  In the morning, each entity held a separate meeting, at 
which 
its delegates voted for the merger. We have learned that, 
shortly after the AD SR meeting, one of its delegates, Jozef 
Olejar, walked out. In response to a question from SME on the 
reason for his departure, M. Knazko said at a news conference 
that he was "not informed about it." According to him, Mr. 
Olejar probably "drew the conclusions for himself" from the vote 
on the merger. The joint meeting of the two entities was then 
held. 
  At the beginning, 133 of the 140 delegates (70 each from the 
AD SR and APR) agreed with the merger, six abstained, and one 
was against. 
  According to its adopted program, DEUS would like to 
represent a broad spectrum of liberal political views and values 
that express the idea of citizen-community-state. The program 
considers the most important objectives in the economic sphere 
to be ongoing support for the economy's restructuring and 
modernizing and speeding up privatization and making it more 
transparent so that the majority of state property becomes 
privately owned as soon as possible. DEUS wants to support the 
citizens' individual responsibility for their own social 
situation, and the priority in the foreign policy sphere is the 
Slovak Republic's orientation toward European integration. 
  J. Findra, head of the Office of the President, read out to 
the assembly a letter of greetings from the president of the 
Republic. In it, the president emphasized, among other things, 
that politicians should set an example of correctness, 
tolerance, and polished manners. "Let us show that crudeness 
and demagoguery have no place in our politics. Let us show that 
decency and understanding are the characteristic traits of the 
citizens of our country and not big gestures and intolerance." 
DEUS Chairman J. Moravcik said after his election that the one 
failing of the Slovak political scene is its atomization. 
  After the assembly, Deputy Chairman M. Knazko said the 
following in connection with speculation that a second Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] has been formed by the merger: 
"Do not speak of the devil; one is enough." He emphasized that 
"this merger was not short-term and purpose-oriented but was 
proceeded by a natural process from the Public Against Violence 
Movement via the HZDS." In response to a question from SME on 
whether representatives from all of the political parties were 
invited to the assembly and why a representative from the 
Christian Social Union [KSU], which is holding talks with the 
HZDS about a preelection coalition, was invited, Knazko said: 
"We invited the chairmen of both the HZDS and the Slovak 
National Party, but, to everyone's disappointment, they did not 
attend the assembly. The KSU, yes; we invited all of the 
parties that are mentioned in public opinion polls and may 
become our partners." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Jozef Moravcik, chairman of the Democratic </F>
Union of Slovakia, by Maria Hluchanova and Jana Pankovcinova; 
place and date not given: "The Fulfillment of Tasks Is More 
Important Than a Dynamic Appearance"] 
  [Text] We asked to interview Jozef Moravcik, who was 
elected chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) on 
23 April. 
  [SME] Do you consider your being elected chairman as just a 
formality, inasmuch as the first deputy chairman is to lead the 
party? 
  [Moravcik] No, I believe it a very prudent technical 
solution to the problem we encountered. 
  [SME] Why did the Saturday merger assembly decide on this 
step? 
  [Moravcik] We felt that such a solution could be acceptable 
to the coalition partners, and it guarantees efficient control 
of the party. 
  [SME] By this measure, you have probably denied the 
philosophy, according to which political leaders were not to be 
in the Cabinet, on the basis of which the coalition government 
was formed. 
  [Moravcik] Because I am not going to actually work as 
chairman of DEUS, I consider it an acceptable compromise, even 
with respect to this philosophy. 
  [SME] How are you going to explain to the voters that almost 
the entire executive of the new party worked for a while at 
Meciar's side in the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia? 
  [Moravcik] If we peruse the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia program from the time the movement emerged and consider 
the people who created the movement, we cannot ever have such 
feelings because the present Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
is something altogether different from the movement we then 
organized. 
  [SME] How do you explain the increase in your popularity to 
25 percent? 
  [Moravcik] I would understand it unequivocally as a 
government preference. It means an endorsement of the idea with 
which we formed the government. We will try not to disappoint 
this confidence. 
  [SME] You have defined yourselves as a liberal entity. What 
do you intend to do to succeed, and does a liberal party have 
any chance in the context of what the Slovak voter has 
experienced over the past five years? 
  [Moravcik] The emphasis on being a liberal party is not 
important to us. The important part for us is that we promote 
the program we call liberal and submit it to the voter for his 
own assessment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Privatization Minister Milan Janicina by </F>
Igor Zvach in Bratislava; date not given: "We Have To Take a 
Chance on Privatization"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Perhaps nothing of late has led to such 
contradictory polemics as the decision by the provisional 
government to again prioritize the coupon method of 
privatization in the second privatization wave. 
  We discussed this issue--why, even at the cost of certain 
known risks or disadvantages of this method--with Milan 
Janicina, minister for the administration and privatization of 
national property. 
  [Zvach] So, Mr. Minister, why? 
  [Janicina] The main reason is that we do not have the 
domestic financial resources, including credits, which are very 
hard to get. Moreover, the influx of foreign capital is not as 
great as we would wish, for reasons I do not want to go into 
now. Set against this, there is the need to privatize a certain 
amount of property. And so, coupon privatization really seems 
to be the most viable starting point. In addition, this is, in 
fact, the most open and clear method of privatization, and many 
people are calling for openness. Quite simply, it is very 
difficult to "procure" property here for a "party" friend. This 
leads to one thing--to again place this method on a par with the 
others. 
  [Zvach] But this will not solve the lack of capital.... 
  [Janicina] It is necessary to realize here that the aim of 
coupon privatization is not to gain capital but to transform 
ownership. However, a certain percentage of the shares, which 
will be earmarked for sale, will bring capital to a specific 
interested party. 
  [Zvach] There is still some anxiety that certain investment 
funds may, because of a lack of money, follow the path of 
foreign loans and so, in the end, a considerable proportion of 
our enterprises may end up uncontrollably in the hands of 
foreign owners. Has the government considered this risk? 
  [Janicina] We know about this risk. Capital is, however, 
international, and every economy faces a similar risk. This is 
really a matter of the seriousness or lack of seriousness of the 
approach of the individual funds. It cannot be ruled out, but 
we must take this chance if we want to proceed. We cannot talk 
ad infinitum about how and why something will not work. We 
simply cannot turn Slovakia into a fortress that could survive 
on its own. 
  [Zvach] Incidentally, the risk is the same with any influx 
of foreign capital, including direct capital. It is always 
possible to consider whether the foreign partner is, let us say, 
merely interested in gaining control of our markets and 
destroying domestic production. Is it ever possible to 
completely eliminate these risks? 
  [Janicina] Absolutely completely not. This is always 
connected with the appropriate agreement and the competence of 
the people who conclude it. We must never view an agreement 
only through the promises or obligations a foreign partner takes 
upon himself. The most important thing is to specify precisely 
these obligations in the agreement and then discuss exactly the 
sanctions that will be imposed if these obligations are not 
adhered to. If we proceed in this fashion, and, moreover, if we 
verify the seriousness of our partner beforehand, the risk, if 
not ruled out, is at least minimized. 
  [Zvach] In conclusion, something that perhaps interests the 
citizen most. Do you have any specific ideas yet about the 
price the citizen will pay for a coupon book and about the time 
frame for coupon privatization? 
  [Janicina] All of this will be discussed at the next 
government session on Tuesday, 26 April. 
  I am personally of the opinion that the price of a coupon 
book should not be higher than in the first round--that is, 
1,000 korunas. In my view, there are even sufficient reasons 
for the price being lower. We will not itemize now. As far as 
the dates are concerned, according to our proposal, the 
registration of citizens should begin on 1 September 1994. The 
registration of investment privatization funds should also begin 
on the same date. The subsequent preliminary round--that is, 
ascribing the investment coupons to the funds--could begin on 3 
October 1994, and the second round could begin on 2 January 
1995. We are allowing for a total of five rounds; the last one 
should begin on 1 May 1995. So, in essence, we would like to 
complete the entire process within a year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brigita Schmognerova, deputy prime minister </F>
for the economy, by Ivan Stulajter; place and date not given: 
"We Must Proceed in a Manner Ensuring That Extremism Does Not 
Prevail"] 
  [Text] [Stulajter] It seems that Slovakia is 
significantly nearer to receiving a stand-by loan from the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF). In your opinion, what was 
the difference between the negotiations conducted with the IMF 
by Vladimir Meciar's government and the negotiations carried out 
a few days ago by Jozef Moravcik's government? 
  [Schmognerova] In the way the negotiations were conducted. 
When I was appointed, I was in the United States and I had the 
opportunity to speak with senior officials from the World Bank 
and the IMF. The upshot of this was that, immediately following 
our request, missions from these institutions came to Slovakia. 
As opposed to the previous negotiations, the government 
submitted its own concept for economic policy. Apart from this, 
we submitted an analysis of the risks facing the state budget 
and also an analysis of the measures for counteracting these 
risks. In the past, the approach at the negotiations was that 
the IMF drew up the basis for a memorandum on economic policy 
and the government then approved it. Our approach was much more 
active. 
  [Stulajter] Were there any differences between the IMF and 
government representatives? 
  [Schmognerova] Not in the aims we are pursuing. The IMF had 
pointed out in the past that transformation is slowing down 
significantly. Then, there was no certitude that the loan would 
be paid. We announced unequivocally that the transformation 
process will be speeded up. 
  [Stulajter] This is true, but the former government also -- 
in its declarations -- expressed its support for transformation. 
Deeds are important. What will the government's first steps be 
to improve its credibility vis-a-vis the IMF? 
  [Schmognerova] Before the end of the month, the government 
will submit to the National Council of the Slovak Republic draft 
laws on value-added tax, consumer tax, and child allowances. 
  [Stulajter] The draft law on value-added tax will obviously 
proceed from the addendum to the memorandum on the government's 
economic policy, which talked about amalgamating the rates for 
this tax... 
  [Schmognerova] This step has been prepared for a long time; 
the difference, however, will be that the rates will not be 
amalgamated, but that some items from the 6.0-percent tax 
bracket will be regrouped into the 25-percent bracket. It 
should transpire that the government will have the possibility 
to determine by law which products will be burdened by the 
higher rate. It will be far more flexible this way. 
  [Stulajter] Can you tell us which products will not be 
affected by the higher value-added tax? 
  [Schmognerova] Basic foodstuffs and medicines. 
  [Stulajter] By how much will the state budget's revenue be 
increased? 
  [Schmognerova] It could amount to around 3.0 billion 
korunas. 
  [Stulajter] What about the child allowances? 
  [Schmognerova] The child allowances should be more targeted, 
depending on the minimum subsistence multiple. However, no 
decision has yet been made on the size of this multiple. 
Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no supplementary social 
system on whose basis we could categorize the claims for payment 
of these benefits. If we were to take twice the minimum 
subsistence level as the borderline for being able to claim 
family allowances, then child allowances would be paid to almost 
88 percent of families. If there were a supplementary social 
system, this percentage could be lower. If there were social 
difficulties in families that lost their claim to these 
allowances, this situation could be remedied by a form of 
targeted assistance, for example, by various social stipends to 
support education in high schools and universities and so on. 
  [Stulajter] Will budget savings be the outcome of targeting 
the payment of child allowances? 
  [Schmognerova] This is our aim; however, it will not be 
achieved since there are no supplementary systems. In any case, 
this is the first step toward transforming the social sphere. 
  [Stulajter] In connection with minimizing the budget risks, 
the government says in its policy statement that it wants to 
concentrate on unfreezing outstanding claims and on reducing tax 
and customs evasion... 
  [Schmognerova] These are measures intended to give one-off 
assistance to the state budget. Tax collection can only be 
improved to a certain extent, then the efficiency of the 
appropriate measures becomes depleted. In principle, the same 
applies to unfreezing outstanding claims; but, this is 
implemented over a longer time frame. The decisive thing in 
this regard, however, is whether the decline in the economy has 
been halted or at least slowed down considerably. 
  [Stulajter] This is in fact an issue associated with the 
development of the gross domestic product. In this context, 
what do you intend to concentrate on? 
  [Schmognerova] Definitely on developing the private sector, 
on small and medium-size enterprise, on halting the decline in 
the enterprise sphere, and on exports. 
  [Stulajter] As far as exports are concerned, what kind of 
pro-export measures can the government take? 
  [Schmognerova] We would like to expand activities associated 
with providing insurance and possible credit for exports, as 
long as the resources are found. It will be necessary to 
improve the information available to our entrepreneurial sphere 
on the possibilities for exporting. In this context, the 
government has made it its goal to conclude bilateral agreements 
to create a good foundation for conducting trade. 
  [Stulajter] How do you intend to proceed with regard to 
Russia? 
  [Schmognerova] I discussed this with the Russian 
Federation's ambassador. The question of a link to the gas 
pipeline that will lead from Russia across Poland is still open. 
There is great interest in this project and there will be a 
certain amount of competition among the interested parties. The 
Russian side would be glad if Slovakia were to hold its ground 
in this competition. At the moment, we are looking very 
intensely at the options for financing this project. The 
options are also being outlined for Russian help in completing 
the Mochovce nuclear power plant. 
  [Stulajter] Why would the Russian side be pleased if 
Slovakia were to hold its ground in this competition? 
  [Schmognerova] This is what the ambassador said. 
  [Stulajter] A link to the gas pipeline is one issue, another 
is Slovak exports to the Russian market... 
  [Schmognerova] The demand for agricultural products has 
declined and, for this reason, our export potential is limited. 
In addition, what we are able export comes up against strong 
competition from the European Union where foodstuffs are heavily 
subsidized. The situation is similar with regard to exports of 
engineering equipment. Western exporters receive very 
advantageous export credits, which Slovakia cannot afford. 
Despite this, Slovak enterprises should try harder to penetrate 
into this territory. It is often emphasized that Russian 
enterprises have payment problems; this is only part of the 
truth, however. There are also solvent partners there and it is 
necessary to make contact with them. 
  [Stulajter] The issue of the insufficient ability of Slovak 
products to compete on world markets is closely associated with 
the lack of foreign capital, which would bring advanced 
technology and know-how. What can the government do to increase 
the flow of foreign capital to Slovakia? 
  [Schmognerova] The entry of foreign capital, compared with 
the Czech Republic or Hungary, is rather minimal. For example, 
in 1993, the growth of foreign capital in the Czech Republic was 
four times higher than in Slovakia during the same period. 
Moreover, we also included capital from the Czech lands in 
foreign capital. Everyone knows this, but somehow does not 
think it through. If the political situation here is not stable 
and predictable, "decent" capital will rarely come here. 
Foreign investors are alarmed by the confrontational statements 
with regard to the Hungarian minority and the extensive 
personnel changes throughout the state administration following 
the government changeover. 
  [Stulajter] The issue does not merely involve the 
replacement of civil servants, but the way it is being done. 
  [Schmognerova] Yes, it involves the overall style. 
  [Stulajter] What is your opinion of creating advantages for 
foreign capital by means of various kinds of tax relief? 
  [Schmognerova] I would not overestimate this. If there is 
political instability in a country, tax holidays mean little to 
foreign investors. After all, what guarantees do they have that 
they will not be canceled? 
  [Stulajter] That was direct investments; what is your view 
of the entry of foreign capital into privatization? Some 
warnings are being issued about selling off national property 
cheaply, about the Slovak market being bought out. 
  [Schmognerova] We certainly have to be careful. However, 
the risks will be reduced in the sense that we will base our 
decisions on the advice of well-known and reputable consultancy 
companies and privatization will take place in the form of 
competitions. I want to emphasize that we are very interested 
in foreign investors who have development plans and know-how. 
However, we are not interested in laundering dirty money. 
  [Stulajter] Has there in fact been money laundering? 
  [Schmognerova] Yes, several cases are being investigated. 
  [Stulajter] The government has conceived a very broad 
program. It is even being said that some of its intentions go 
beyond its six- month mandate. On the other hand, who continues 
this program after the elections is important. If we had 
thought in 1990, 1991, and also partly in 1992 that the 
initiated reforms were irreversible, then the government of V. 
Meciar -- to say the least -- cast doubts on this conviction of 
irreversibility. This is a political commitment for the parties 
that currently make up the coalition. 
  [Schmognerova] Naturally, each of these parties has the 
ambition to continue this program after the elections. As an 
economist, I am very well aware of how much time has been 
wasted. I entered the government knowing that I did not want 
there to be any more wasted time. I realize that if, after the 
elections, those political forces that were in power previously 
get into government once more, then the reforms would again be 
slowed down considerably or even halted. Therefore, the present 
government has to try to find a way of establishing development 
tendencies in the economy and, at the same time, of not 
forfeiting the people's trust. 
  [Stulajter] Fine, but there is a real possibility that 
those forces you mentioned will return. The government is now 
faced with the task of bringing Slovakia's economic -- and 
social -- life out of the considerable influence of the state, 
where political power is concentrated most intensively. Quite 
simply, it is vital not to give the state a chance to turn into 
a dictatorship... 
  [Schmognerova] I do not think we are able to "catch" all the 
risks. Incidentally, there is a risk of undemocratic 
development in every society. Take a look at history. There 
were states that had very advanced democratic institutions, but 
change still occurred in them. From the point of view of the 
current government, it is important that the measures in 
economic and social policy are such that no prerequisites are 
created in Slovakia for a victory by extremists. 
  [Stulajter] In this context, however, the government will 
win the citizens' trust by means of visible acts carried out in 
the present as measures that will bear fruit at some distant and 
unspecified future time. After all, who else here cares about 
the future? 
  [Schmognerova] We are working on using the foreign aid that 
was and is earmarked for Slovakia. I received an analysis drawn 
up by the Foreign Ministry on the utilization of foreign aid in 
the second half of 1993. You would be surprised at the amount 
of money we had at our disposal and how little of it was used. 
At the same time, these are not loans. 
  [Stulajter] In view of the fact that you only have six 
months, and to make sure that the government's work bears 
visible fruit now, it is perhaps necessary to ask: What do we 
not want to do? Not because the government would lack 
sufficient will, but because not very much can be done in such a 
short period and the government may pay dearly for a too 
widespread span of activities. 
  [Schmognerova] I have not thought about it like that; but I 
will contemplate it. I know one thing, however. The government 
will not prevent the liquidation of inefficient and heavily 
loss- making state enterprises. It will only prevent this in 
cases where -- from the point of view of employment in the 
region -- it would involve a major enterprise. Such a measure 
will only be taken when alternative employment has been found.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Strasky, minister of transportation and </F>
deputy chairman of the Civic Democratic Party: "The Czech 
Republic: A State of Regions, Communities, and Citizens"] 
  [Text] The search for the role, shape, and organization of 
the state's participation in its administration is older than 
civic society itself. It ensues neither originally nor today 
from the citizen's interest, which is why this argument should 
not be overestimated or misused. It originates--and this origin 
can be felt to this day--from the conflict between the interest 
of the center (the king, the president, the assembly, the 
parliament, the government, or a conqueror or occupier) to 
enforce central power uniformly, effectively, and with the 
requisite dose of integrity, irrespective of how the wielders of 
the central power took hold of that role (whether by conquest or 
by means of democratic elections) and the interests of citizens 
with ambitions who are convinced that they have less 
administration (power) than they should. 
  Experience confirms that, on the one hand: 
  --Mistakes, errors, or weaknesses of the center influence 
the 
stability of the whole and have often been an important or even 
the decisive cause of its demise (because they always get into 
contact, often clash, and occasionally get into conflict with 
neighboring wholes). 
  --No reform of the whole's arrangement is permanently 
satisfactory because it is not and, by its very nature, cannot 
be perfect. 
  --The only thing that is constant and permanent is the 
incessant reform of administration and the endless search for a 
perfect model, even if this search always moves within bounds 
that are very inaccurately labeled as centralization and 
decentralization. 
  On the other hand, experience shows that, no matter how 
praiseworthy the intentions to transform the administration 
organizationally may be, they always produce a provisional 
arrangement and not "the final word," from which follows, on the 
one hand, that there is no need for any overhasty action and, on 
the other (or on the same?), that it is necessary to responsibly 
and conscientiously consider what is really unbearable and what 
is functional about the administration, for whose reform one is 
calling. 
  The risk in giving such advice is that you can be 
immediately 
asked, as minister and as deputy chairman of the party that at 
the moment has the greatest share of power in this state, in 
whose interest you are cautioning restraint. The only thing I 
can say in response--because I will not furnish a single piece 
of evidence to back this up--is that it is my right as a citizen 
of this country, one, moreover, with a lifelong career as a 
civil servant. I admit thereby, seemingly at variance with my 
introductory words, that, in a civic society, the organization 
of the country's administration does affect the citizen: He 
wants to be represented and "served" by good, accessible, 
intelligible, and competent bodies that are not too costly to 
run. The target of a civic society (which we carry in our heads 
and against which we gauge the attained reality) is the idea of 
a sovereign citizen who decides, precisely in the interest of 
his individual sovereignty, to tolerate, by means of indirect 
(representative but controllable) democracy, only as much power 
above himself as will allow him to be a sovereign citizen and 
individual in this world. 
  The formation of lands (regions) is laid down in our 
Constitution and the current dispute concerns only their size 
and role. The fact that any internal state arrangement is 
unsatisfactory--for which there are authentic as well as 
demagogic arguments--permanently exerts an influence. We have 
no shortage of ambitious people (which is so good that, as is 
often the case, it becomes bad at times). We all speak from 
positions in which we find ourselves and in the name of the 
chances that present themselves. What unites us is the 
experience and conviction that the state administration can and 
must be better than it is now. And because there does not exist 
a single solution to this task, politics gets a hearing. 
Personally, I do not believe that it is in the citizen's 
interest to have above himself more, rather than fewer, tiers of 
power, that it is in the citizen's interest to have a weak 
state, and that, under Czech conditions, having a large region 
is a suitable way of bringing the state and the citizen closer 
to each other and the best way of bringing the country's 
administration closer to the citizen. 
<H5>  State and Communities </H5>
  The territory of the Czech Republic is administered by the 
state and by the communities. The state is represented by the 
head of state, parliament, government, the heads of central 
bodies of state administration who are not headed by a minister, 
the heads of bodies of state administration who do not operate 
nationwide (such as the director of the Labor Office, the 
Agriculture Ministry's Regional Department, or the Road 
Administration and Maintenance Authority), and the chairmen of 
district offices as the "uniform" body of state administration 
in a given territory. Communities are administered through 
their elected representatives, besides which they perform, with 
their staff, some duties of state administration in their 
territory (the so-called authorized communities perform these 
duties on the designated territory of several communities). 
  There are many reasons for the citizen to administer and to 
be administered by only the community and the state. The 
"dividing line" is visible and historically stable here, 
although I hasten to add that even here it is not beyond 
dispute. It is not only changing but also oscillating [prolina 
se], most probably in mutual interest. 

<H5>    Size of the Communities </H5>
  For the division of administration between the state and the 
community to be balanced, competent, and, hence, satisfactory to 
the citizen, the community should be of a certain size that will 
guarantee its qualification potential [kvalifikacni potencial] 
and, last but not least, also the necessary financial resources. 
This prerequisite is not met in our conditions. This inevitably 
complicates and restricts a uniform and broad delineation of 
communities' powers (the sole authentic bringing closer of the 
administration to the citizen). It is extremely difficult 
uniformly to devolve the widest possible powers to communities 
with a population of more than 100,000 (of which we have seven 
in the Czech Republic) and, simultaneously, to communities with 
a population of under 200 (of which we have 1,621 in the Czech 
Republic, which is 26 percent of all communities). Of the 6,196 
communities in the Czech Republic, 4,946--that is, a full 80 
percent--have fewer than 1,000 inhabitants (do not let these 
communities be angry with me, but, personally, I would regard 
this number as the absolute minimum). Without discounting the 
"Moravian issue" and the traditionalists' argument of a return 
to the land arrangement [zemske usporadani], I personally 
believe that the project of regions--that is, the idea of 
inserting a regional tier between the state and the 
community--is to a large degree a result of the large number of 
small communities in the Czech Republic. The large number of 
small communities makes administration solely from the level of 
the state and the community more controversial and the need for 
a regional tier more urgent and justifiable. At the same time, 
it is evident that changing this situation cannot be an 
ephemeral administrative ambition but a matter of long-term 
development. 
<H5>  Why Region </H5>
  There are at least two reasons for the citizen to administer 
and to be administered by not only the tier state and the tier 
community, but also the tier region. The outcome of the 
discussion on regional arrangements depends on which viewpoint 
we prefer and which is stronger and more urgent. 
  The first argument is based on the assertion that the state 
(the government, the parliament) is too remote from the 
citizens, who live in diverse (mutually unrelated) conditions, 
for it to be able to fulfill so many of its powers "from 
Prague." It is being said, in support of this argument, that 
even today the state is addressing this problem by establishing 
outlying regional workplaces of individual central bodies of 
state administration, whose task is to perceive and respect 
local conditions and local differences more distinctly than the 
center can. A subject of polemics is whether there should be 
more such "feelers" at the "regional" level (that is, whether 
there should be about 10 of them) or at the "district" level 
(that is, whether there should be several dozen of them). My 
reply in this respect is unequivocal: Because the main burden 
of state administration is carried by the district office and 
the other special (not uniform) local bodies of state 
administration (regardless of whether their number exceeds, or 
falls short of, the number of districts) are only a divergently 
justified supplement, the district represents even today the 
prevailing local dimension of state administration. Therefore, 
we should base our considerations on the assessment of the 
functionality of this tier (and its size). 
  The second argument is that the community is too remote from 
the state. The idea of a citizen deciding by his (electoral, 
civic) vote who will administer Zadni Lhotka with its 60 
residents and the Czech Republic with 10 million inhabitants 
(and nothing in between) is a strong motive for the 
establishment of regions. The citizen's interest undeniably 
reaches beyond the borders of (particularly small) communities. 
If a citizen is to entrust the administration of everything 
"beyond the community" to the state, he is raising the, in my 
opinion justified, question of whether the "power above him" is 
not too far away and too insensitive to his civic situation, to 
which belong "everyday issues" such as transportation to the 
nearest city, the retail network, health-care establishments, 
higher-level schools, and so forth. The community (in its Czech 
shape) is mostly too small to ensure his needs and demands, 
while the state is too big and too remote to ensure them with a 
feeling for local conditions. 
  The attentive reader will surely have noticed that, 
actually, 
we are not dealing with two problems but with two views of the 
same problem, according to the example of the "half-full" or 
"half-empty" glass: A view "from the center," which is "only" 
being decentralized and parceled out with the establishment of 
regions and the view of the citizen (community), who (which) 
feels the need to influence matters "beyond the community" more 
directly than through the medium of the government or 
parliament. A solution to this "clash" has lain thus far, above 
all, in the district office (a small government with limited 
powers, whose application is restricted to a certain territory) 
and the district council (an assembly of representatives of 
communities of a given territory), which is, in my opinion, the 
most controversial element in the present system of 
administration of the Czech Republic, an element that is the 
furthest from the ideal of functional perfection. 

<H5>    What Is a Region? </H5>
  It is time to try to express wherein the planned regional 
arrangement differs (of course, according to the ambitions of 
individual proponents) from today's district-based 
administration of the country. This is difficult because, 
according to the final shape chosen, it can differ from it 
either in quantitative terms only (that is, the decisionmaking 
horizon of the region in the sphere of administration would be 
expanded) or in qualitative terms as well (that is, 
decisionmaking would differ from region to region). We might 
call the first option, rather imprecisely, decentralization 
(decisionmaking according to, and within the framework of, 
uniform rules, while paying heed to local conditions), while the 
other comes close to the term parceling (decisionmaking 
according to different rules). The prevalent idea is that the 
regional body (unlike today's district office) would not decide 
at the state's behest (that is, according to uniform, centrally 
controlled and sanctioned rules), doing so only with greater 
sensitivity [than the district office] (that is, with greater 
ability to differentiate between specific situations), but that, 
within the framework of jurisdiction that will be vested in 
regions by law, it will decide with irrevocable and specific 
powers. This idea arises from the thesis that the region will 
also have its own property--that is, that, apart from state, 
community, and private ownership, there will also be regional 
ownership. 
  This can best be illustrated by an example coming, as in 
most 
cases, from transportation. Should the law on regions transfer 
into regional ownership--for example, today's state third-class 
roads and local railroad tracks--regional bodies will decide 
which of these roads and railroads will be abolished, which will 
be built anew, which will be repaired today and which later. I 
have deliberately chosen a (seemingly) politically neutral 
example, one that is realistic and even probable (incidentally, 
in the sphere of road repairs we almost find ourselves in this 
situation already). Nevertheless, from the national point of 
view (from the point of view of the citizen of the Czech 
Republic), even this example is not free of risks. The decision 
to abolish (or even only temporarily close) roads because the 
region does not have the money to repair them right now will, to 
a greater or lesser extent, also influence the transportation 
possibilities of the inhabitants of other regions. Let me point 
out that I do not cite this example as an argument against 
regions but exclusively for the sake of illustration. 
  A region--let us attempt a nontraditional definition--is a 
partial territory of the state, with its own administration in 
designated areas, above which are the laws of the Czech Republic 
(of course, these laws must not be in conflict with the regions' 
powers; on the other hand, the regions' legislative initiative 
is foreseen--that is, the possibility for them to submit draft 
laws to parliament). In conformity with the regions' powers 
must be, self-evidently, also their responsibility and financial 
provisions. Let me cite an example regarding responsibility: 
If responsibility for transportation services on their 
territory is vested in regions (that is, responsibility for 
citizens being able to use public transport to get to work, 
school, the doctor, and so forth), something the new law 
transfers to district offices (in their capacity as state 
bodies, however, and not as bodies of regional administration), 
no one should any longer address any complaint to the president 
or the minister of transportation that some bus route has been 
abolished because, in a consistent regional arrangement, neither 
of them can do anything for the citizen in this matter. The 
complaint will have to be addressed to the appropriate regional 
"minister of transportation" and regional deputy. 
  However, for the region to be able to bear final powers and 
responsibility (independent of the state and the community), it 
must avail itself of a firm and stable flow of financial 
resources. There is, however, one snag in this, the preservation 
or elimination of which must be thought through very 
consistently: If a uniform nationwide system of taxation, 
coupled with the necessary flow of resources into the budgets of 
communities, regions, and the state, is to be preserved, this 
can only be accomplished by means of "apportionment" (percentage 
share) of taxes according to fixed rules and a uniform 
nationwide tax policy. Otherwise (for example, in the event of 
regionally divergent taxes being levied in the interest of 
ensuring the region's autonomy), the "solidarity principle" 
(responsibility of the rich for the poor) would be abandoned 
within the framework of the state and replaced by citizens of 
the region [sentence as published]. A citizen of the Ostrava or 
Most area (should they become regions) would have to pay more in 
taxes than a citizen of the Pardubice region, for example, so 
that his "regional government and parliament" can live up to 
their responsibility for the region, even if those "needs of the 
region" came about as a consequence of activities (such as coal 
mining) benefiting the state as a whole. Those who consider the 
claim exaggerated that the regionalization of the Czech Republic 
beyond a certain very fragile limit amounts to the parceling of 
the Czech Republic with all its consequences are not playing 
fair with the citizens of the Czech Republic. 
  To claim that the regionalization of the state is not 
possible and that there exist no reasons in its favor would be 
equally insincere. Quite the contrary, there do not exist any 
absolute reasons for, or obstacles to, any solution whatsoever; 
what exists, however, are absolute consequences arising from 
every solution. After decades of centralist obfuscation, the 
idea of "introducing transparency" is only understandable, 
justified, and popular. Its immediate and definitive 
realization is naive, however, and, what is more, dangerous. We 
can let ourselves be inspired today by the regionalization of 
Austria, U.S. federalism, or the territorial division of Great 
Britain. In all of these cases, we encounter long strings of 
historical events that led to the situation that exists today. 
These examples confirm that everything is possible when it is 
necessary for historical reasons. They do not confirm, however, 
that all "models" are equally beneficial. The exact opposite is 
the case. These models are the consequences of historical 
development, which have retained up to the present a certain 
strength that needs to be respected. 
  From this viewpoint, only "Moravia" has any certain 
legitimacy in our conditions. Because of the subtlety of this 
issue, however, I do not want to assess it in this place. I can 
only say that Rajhrad [in Moravia] is as dear to me as Svata 
Hora [in Bohemia] and Wallachia [Moravian region] as dear as 
Sumava [Bohemian region]. The legitimacy of the Hradec 
Kralove-Pardubice, Zatce-Louny, or (to stick to my Sumava) 
Prachatice-Vimperk rivalries is not, historical reminiscences 
notwithstanding, of such a nature as to warrant the formation of 
regions. The legitimacy of the South Bohemian or the West 
Bohemian Land is nonexistent, in my opinion, and almost 
grotesque. While Carinthia or Bavaria are historical phenomena 
that, for reasons that I am unable to assess, are reflected in 
the regional arrangement of Austria or Germany, the lands of the 
Czech crown are a phenomenon that will not be negligible even in 
the third millennium. When contemplating the possible 
uniformity of a united Europe, we do not express our 
apprehensions as West Bohemians or as Central Europeans--and, as 
far as I am concerned, I am not expressing these apprehensions 
as a West Bohemian by birth, a Praguer by residence, or a South 
Bohemian by sentiment--but as citizens of the lands of the Czech 
crown. with our legacy, historical burdens, and inspirations, 
with which we want to enrich Europe while preserving ourselves 
as a single and differentiated whole, as a Europe of Greeks, 
French, Scots, and Norwegians, but not, for God's sake, a Europe 
of East Bohemians and South Moravians. 
<H5>  What To Do With the Regions Today </H5>
  We live in the year 1994. We are winding up the 
transformation of our economy and want it to hold its own in 
contemporary Europe. Our citizens are exposed to changes that, 
in some social groups, are at the edge of tolerability. We want 
to turn slaves of communism into proud and honest entrepreneurs, 
duped workers into self-confident authorities in their 
respective fields, kolkhoz farmers with no responsibility into 
efficient providers of food for the nation, and servile (and 
unpopular) bureaucrats into kind administrators of this country. 
  I am convinced that, in the effort to tackle the issue of 
the 
country's regional arrangement too rashly and radically, we are 
taking upon ourselves a disproportionately heavy burden. 
Insufficient preparation, ambition-filled impatience, and 
short-term political calculations are driving us into 
conventional solutions following up on the "traditions of 
regional national committees." Because we will probably not find 
the courage (apparently by right) to abolish districts, a costly 
three-tier system will come into being. This system had been 
challenged (in my opinion rightly) even under totalitarianism 
(under conditions of the much larger Czechoslovak Socialist 
Republic, where three tiers were more appropriate than in 
today's Czech Republic). Even without regions, owing to the 
influence of the new roles of the state in a democracy and in 
the period of transformation, the state administration employs 
more people now than it did before November [1989]. 
  In spite of this, I am convinced that both conditions and 
reasons exist to take the first step toward regionalization, a 
step that, on the one hand, would lead to decentralization (the 
bringing of the state administration closer to citizens) and, on 
the other, to the "de-etatization" of some decisions, with the 
aim of greater respect for local conditions and differences, 
without at the same time exceeding the tolerable extent of 
risks, to which I have attempted to draw attention, and without 
causing an excessive growth of costs. 
  The solution lies in today's district arrangement. Next year 
should be used to amend this system. At some places it appears 
to be appropriate to merge districts and in other places to 
partition them. The extent of corrective action should not 
cause a "great shock." 
  1. In the first step, the territory of the district will 
become a region. 
  2. A law will define the regions' powers, which should be 
broader than those of today's districts. 
  3. The subsequent year will be devoted to the practical and 
organizational preparation, to adjustments to the system of 
taxation, the budget system, and so forth. 
  4. The elections of 1996 will establish regional 
self-administrative bodies with, let us say, seven to 20 
regional deputies. 
  The adoption of this proposal is based on two prerequisites: 
  a) The large number of regions, which is evidently in 
contrast with the idea laid down in the Constitution. 
  b) The perception of the region as an entity centering on 
the 
regionally warranted allocation of mostly centrally acquired 
(that is, acquired according to uniform rules) financial 
resources. 
  I regard the first point as a serious problem--the large 
number of regions will not do away with the problems of 
management. A solution would lie in a reduction of the number 
of regions to approximately a third. This, however, cannot be a 
realistic task for a year or two, if we do not want to put off 
regionalization completely. It can, however, lead to another 
step, which, in my opinion, will depend on whether it will be 
accompanied by the concentration of communities. Such a 
concentration would simultaneously make it possible to expand 
community administration. Objections to the second point can be 
expected only from those who suffer from the illusion that the 
region can be not only an independent administrative entity but 
also an independent economic entity, which spends on its 
territory resources that it itself has generated. Small regions 
expose the naivete of such an expectation more than big ones. 
There is no room here for a more comprehensive argumentation 
against this idea. The disruption of the "solidarity 
principle," on which the state is based (as is, in the 
"downward" direction the community, and in the "upward" 
direction Europe), is not only selfish from the human point of 
view but also dangerous from the point of view of the state's 
integrity. It follows from the perception of the first 
regionalization step that the region would allocate resources 
rather than own and dispose of regional property. 
<H5>  In Conclusion </H5>
  The train of regional euphoria has been set in motion, and 
it 
is difficult to jump onto it while it is moving. It already has 
its political dimensions, with risks of labeling, and is driven 
by a certain distribution of political forces. It could really 
happen that we will be parceled out and will engage in disputes 
about connecting the East Bohemian and North Moravian highways, 
in the same way as we are currently engaging in a dispute about 
a bypass around Plzen. I would only like to protest 
emphatically against the view that the formation of large 
regions will bring the administration of the country much closer 
to the citizen. Plzen bureaucrats and West Bohemian deputies 
are as far away for the inhabitants of Kvilda or Bozi Dar as are 
Prague bureaucrats and Czech parliamentary deputies. I concede, 
however, that the perspective from Plzen, Pardubice, or Olomouc 
may be different. By pointing out that the reform of the 
territorial and administrative arrangement is not a "task to be 
resolved before the next elections," but an eternal task, I 
wanted to call for circumspection and for the phasing [fazovani] 
of all amassed ambitions.

<F P=106> [Article by "zd": "The French Will Exercise in the Czech </F>
Republic"] 
  [Text] Prague/Paris--At the beginning of June, military 
exercises will be conducted with a French company in the Czech 
Republic and at the same time a Czech company in France. It is 
also expected that French experts will be commissioned to Czech 
military schools. That is one of the results of the three-day 
visit by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys to France. The 
delegation also met with the representatives of a leading 
electronic concern, Thomson-CSF, that was seriously interested 
in Pardubice Tesla once. Minister Baudys admitted the 
possibility of cooperation with this firm in the development of 
the electronic equipment for the Czech light multipurpose L-159 
aircraft currently in the works, the modernization of air 
defense, and the T-72 tank. After the talks, Baudys confirmed 
that the Czech Republic enjoys great credibility in the 
industrial world. This fact, according to him, makes it 
possible for the Republic in the modernization of the Army not 
to purchase only finished products but rather opt for supplies 
of state-of-the-art technology and utilize the capacity and 
possibilities of the Czech firms.

<F P=106> [Article by "sta" on introductory remarks by and interview </F>
with Defense Minister Antonin Baudys at a news conference on 6 
January; place not given: "Clear Reports Regarding the Future"] 
  [Text] Information from the news conference that took 
place on 6 January 1994 was published in the last issue. Today, 
we are returning to additional important items mentioned in the 
second part of the introductory remarks made by the minister of 
defense of the Czech Republic, Antonin Baudys. 
  Without a doubt, everyone is interested in what is 
actually facing the Ministry of Defense this year. Certainly, it 
will be a time of further progress regarding deep changes of its 
entire organism. Toward that end, the minister of defense said 
the following at the news conference: 
<H5>  In the Army of the Czech Republic </H5>
  The decisive phase of transforming the Army of the Czech 
Republic [ACR] will be realized with the reorganization of the 
Western Military Command and the Central Military Command into 
army corps commands, the transfer of the 4th Division into a 
brigade-type structure, and the creation of two tactical- and 
transport-aviation bases. 
  The establishment of a rapid-deployment brigade will be 
finalized, as will the establishment of additional (a total of 
11) territorial defense brigades. 
  There will be a fundamental melding of the newly organized 
staffs and military units, their personnel stabilization, and 
improvements in training. 
  The military railroad components will be eliminated. 
  Legislative, organizational, and social conditions will be 
created to facilitate the essential increase in the number of 
professionals, particularly among the group of so-called career 
soldiers. 
  A military strategy for the defense of the Czech Republic 
will be worked out and a concept for the development of the ACR 
through the year 2000 will be prepared. 
<H5>  In the Realm of Personnel Work and Education </H5>
  Principal attention will be concentrated on personnel 
support 
for the transformation of the ACR, accompanied by the assertion 
of principles of the concept of personnel and social policy of 
the Ministry of Defense. 
  The personnel policy and social support for military 
personnel will be legislatively assured. 
  There will be a transformation of the military education 
system and a gradual realization of the concept of scientific 
work within the ACR. 
  Attention will be focused also on assuring quality training 
for the Army sports representatives at the XVII Winter Olympic 
Games (ZOH). 
<H5>  In Terms of Financing and Logistics and Ministry of Defense </H5>
Economics 
  The following principal tasks evolve from the concept of 
transforming the ACR and the method involved in the introduction 
of the PPBS [Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System]: 

  -  Preparation of the budget for 1995 in its program 
composition. 
  -  Definition of decisive acquisition 
projects. 
  -  Transition to double-entry bookkeeping, with a 
deadline for realization of 31 December 1994. 
  -  Creation of 
military financial offices and logistics structures, including 
appropriate information systems. 
  -  Consistent adherence to koruna 
controls during the transition period. 
  -  Working out a uniform 
materials catalogue, working out standards and financial 
standards. 
  -  Disestablishment of military construction 
battalions. 
  -  Privatization of state enterprises. 
  -  Transformation 
of military spa and recreational facilities. 
  -  Transformation of 
the military-scientific base. 
<H5>  In Matters of Civil Defense </H5>
  The reorganization of control organs of civil defense, of 
civil defense formations, will be finalized, as will the 
integration and material support of executive elements of civil 
defense into regional and local rescue systems; a civil defense 
logistics base will be created. 
  Principles of a civil defense law will be worked out for 
discussion within the government, and appropriate standard 
operating procedures for directing civil defense will be worked 
out as well. 
  Cooperation with neighboring countries in resolving civil 
defense problems and the elimination of the consequences of 
disasters and catastrophes that transcend national borders will 
be assured. 
  The establishment of an information system for civil defense 
as a component of the national information system will be 
finalized. 
<H5>  In the Area of Foreign Relations </H5>
  The principal tasks in 1994 will be concentrated on the 
following activities in solving tasks in collaboration with the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 

  -  Actively participate in the NATO Partnership Program for 
Peace and still further deepen the bilateral contacts between 
the ACR and NATO member countries and neighboring countries; set 
priorities for ACR collaboration with specific armies. 
  -  Prepare a 
proposal for the concept of ACR participation in peaceful 
operations sponsored by the United Nations and the CSCE, to be 
submitted for discussion to the government and the parliament of 
the Czech Republic. 
  -  Prepare directives, regulations, and 
international ministerial agreements for the realization of 
military exercises at the international level, for the 
establishment and training of units preordained to participate 
in peaceful operations (this stems from the agreement on the 
Partnership for Peace and from the establishment of so-called 
standby forces of the United Nations). 
  -  Prepare courses for 
military inspectors of verification centers at Komorni Hradek 
and an international NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council] 
for members of peacekeeping forces at Cesky Krumlov. 
  -  Prepare to 
mount a UN peacekeeping battalion for Yugoslavia and carry out 
its rotation in April and November. 
  -  Support the training of 
military observers, their rotation in existing missions, and 
their dispatch according to the requirements of the government 
(Ministry of Foreign Affairs). 
  -  Fulfill tasks stemming from the 
realization of the KOS [expansion unknown] agreements in Europe 
and the treaty on open skies. 
  -  Improve the quality of language 
training and specialized training for members of the ACR. 
  -  Work 
out annual exchange and statistical information according to the 
KOS agreements, the VD-92, and the treaty on open skies and the 
newly adopted recommendations stemming from the meeting of 
foreign ministers of countries that are signatories to the CSCE 
in Rome. 
  -  Continue active participation in negotiations of the 
CSCE, the KOS agreements, negotiations regarding open skies, and 
in other international security forums. 
<H5>  In the Area of Command and Control </H5>
  Stabilize the new system of control at the level of the 
Ministry of Defense and the ACR, clearly outlining jurisdictions 
and personal responsibilities and creation of the necessary room 
for initiative solution of tasks at all levels of command. 
  Deepen the effectiveness of control, focused from the level 
of the Ministry of Defense, on the course of the transformation 
of the ACR; adherence to basic human rights and freedoms with 
respect to soldiers and focused on economic control. 
  In the legislative area, focus on working out proposals for 
laws that were begun in 1993, bringing them to the level of 
principles, and focus on reevaluating internal ministerial 
standard operating procedures in harmony with the changes that 
have occurred within the ministry. 
  In military counterintelligence, orient activities toward 
specifically improving intelligence protection for the ministry 
as well as the Army, concentrate on improving the results of 
work and on personnel and technical support for this service. 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  At the press conference, the minister of defense also 
responded to questions by journalists. We present two of them 
below: 
  [Journalist] In recent times, I have noted that not only 
journalists, but also professional soldiers are expressing high 
criticism with regard to the situation in the Army.... 
  [Baudys] I believe that it is not abnormal for me to be 
criticized by professional soldiers. This tends to indicate that 
something is beginning to be in order within the Army. The Army 
is not such an organization in which a subordinate officer could 
not criticize a superior. You obviously have in mind the more 
extensive article written by Colonel Stetka in CESKY DENIK; if I 
disregard NECENZUROVANE NOVINY, I know of no other public 
criticism. A number of the remarks made by Col. Stetka are 
relevant, but, as far as criticism of General Nekvasil is 
concerned, I am afraid it is not based on objective facts. I do 
not reject criticism by soldiers, no matter what rank they may 
be--I would be opposed to myself. My effort is to have the Army 
be functional, and that is why I must listen to all voices. 
  [Journalist] A year ago you stated that those officers who 
agreed with the occupation by the Soviet military on our 
territory had committed treason. Do you still hold that opinion 
today? If so, how did that view manifest itself in the 
directives governing the extraordinary evaluations, as well as 
in their practical implementation? 
  [Baudys] I have not changed my view. However, the facts are 
such that not all dossiers contain supplemental biographic data 
that contain this fact. Taken through to its consequences, I 
would most likely, or rather certainly, have to say that, as of 
5 January 1993, we are dissolving the Army and are beginning to 
create it completely anew. Those who did not agree with the 
occupation represent a negligible quantity. Your question, which 
is put in a highly categorical manner with a great deal of moral 
conviction, could thus have only a single consistent answer--the 
dissolution of the Army. But it is a question of discussion as 
to whether we would be capable of creating a new functional army 
within such a historically short period. If someone signed to 
indicate he agreed with the occupation, this does not mean that 
he is not prepared to defend his country despite the fact that, 
from a moral standpoint, I continue to believe that this was 
treason. I did not decide to dissolve the Army; after all, it is 
not even within my jurisdiction to do so--and, consequently, it 
was not even reflected in the appropriate order.

<F P=106> [Article by "dz": "The Government Approved 1993 Budget </F>
Closing Statement"] 
  [Text] Prague--In its session yesterday, the government 
approved the draft 1993 government budget closing statement. 
The statement shows a surplus of 1.1 billion korunas. 
According to Deputy Prime Minister Josef Lux, 200 million of 
this surplus is to be used for the region program, 87 million 
for additional payments on the Bilina mine credit, 339 million 
for the internal revenue computer system, and 454 million to 
increase reserves for dealing with social problems. The 
government described last year as successful. "It was the first 
time that a growth of labor productivity could be registered--by 
3.1 percent--and the foreign currency reserves reached their 
maximum in the history of our state--$6 billion," Lux 
emphasized. The government acknowledged the Czech National Bank 
report on the balance of payments and monetary development for 
1993. "The debt of the Czech Republic increased by $1.8 billion 
to $8.7 billion, 76 percent of which are long-term obligations. 
Overall, we are creditors, but a great part of our claims is 
difficult to collect," Lux commented.

<F P=106> [Czech Statistical Office report: "Prices in the Production </F>
Sphere Stagnated in March"] 
  [Text] Price indexes of all groups of goods virtually 
stagnated in the production sphere in March. Prices for 
industrial products increased slightly--0.2 percent (against 
February)--and prices for construction work increased 0.1 
percent. Other indexes in the production sphere remained on the 
level of the preceding month. 
  The price growth since the beginning of the year (March 
against December 1993) was moderate--2 percent. Prices charged 
by industrial producers and for construction work and materials 
and products consumed in the building industry increased 3.2 
percent. Prices for domestic cargo transportation (without 
automobile transportation) rose 8.3 percent, and prices for 
water (drinkable water and sewage water) rose between 14 and 15 
percent due to price changes in January and February of this 
year. Since the beginning of this year, prices for 
communications services and pipeline transportation stagnated. 
  Compared with the same period last year, the smallest price 
increase in March was in prices for agricultural products and 
products consumed in the building industry--between 5 and 7 
percent. Prices for construction work increased 15.8 percent. 
Prices for communication services increased significantly--by 28 
percent--and prices for domestic cargo transportation (without 
automobile transportation) and for water increased 40 percent 
(due to price changes in the preceding periods--since April 
1993.) 
  The average yearly increase in prices (the average over 12 
most recent months against the average of the preceding 12 
months) was 7.9 percent in case of agricultural products (plant 
produce 13.3 percent and animal products 4.2 percent). 
Industrial manufacturers charged 11 percent more, and prices 
for construction works increased 23.2 percent. In 
communications services and domestic cargo transportation prices 
increased (impact of one-off changes) between 26 and 28 percent. 
Prices for water and pipeline transportation increased by 
approximately 70 percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jiri Hanak, president of the Sellier and </F>
Bellot management board, by Zdenek Hoffmann; place and date not 
given: "We Are at the Center of Intelligence Games"] 
  [Text] [Hoffmann] Apart from drugs and pornography, the 
trade in arms and ammunition is at the center of interest to 
organized crime and illicit dealers. Has it ever happened to 
you that you received a suspicious order? 
  [Hanak] This is not something that happens every day, but it 
does happen. When trading in this kind of product, the 
principles fixed by the law and international treaties must be 
respected. We respect them. We are not interested in damaging 
the reputation of our firm and the Czech Republic. We cooperate 
with state bodies and the licensing department of the Ministry 
of Industry and Trade. This ministry verifies the authenticity 
of the documents and the customer. This is how we try to 
prevent a possible misuse of our products. 
  [Hoffmann] So, you have not encountered problems like those 
in the French film "Three Men to Kill"? 
  [Hanak] We have had instances where firms and also 
individuals wanted to purchase ammunition for strange purposes. 
Such cases are reaching an increasingly professional level of 
deception. They are transparent attempts at making a deal. 
They also include lobbying and attempts to influence the 
management of the company. We even have information that we are 
at the center of professional intelligence games. We also have 
reports that pressure is exerted on members of the management of 
the company, but they have to resist it because they want to 
stick strictly to the law. 
  [Hoffmann] Most dirty deals in the world are about military 
weapons and ammunition. How much of your production enters them? 
  [Hanak] We export ammunition to about 60 countries. Some 98 
percent of the ammunition that we manufacture is designated for 
hunting and target shooting; the rest is military. However, it 
is difficult to tell how many of the bullets--for example, 
pistol bullets--are really used for target shooting and how many 
for training security firms or for other purposes. The bullets 
are usually the same. 
  [Hoffmann] Recently, there was a report in the press that, 
at the IWA, the international exposition in Germany, you 
concluded a deal for ammunition sales amounting to half a 
billion korunas. Is such a deal usual in your business? 
  [Hanak] No, it is not. We held business talks at the fair, 
during which previously placed orders were discussed. We had 
anticipated these deliveries. Nevertheless, I believe this is a 
great business success. 
  [Hoffmann] You are engaged in a lucrative business with 
ammunition. Is your conscience clear when you read in papers 
about murders or about cases where someone has lost his life? 
  [Hanak] If the Czech firms stop delivering weapons and 
ammunition, others will deliver them. Foreign competition would 
like to enter the Czech market and take over our positions 
abroad. I cannot imagine that hunters would go back to using 
bows and arrows or that police could do without firearms when 
chasing criminals. 
  [Hoffmann] In the West, they use rubber bullets that do not 
kill. Can you, too, produce them? 
  [Hanak] We have developed cartridges with rubber bullets and 
lead shot. We can supply them to the Czech police, if they show 
an interest. Apart from that, we manufacture cartridges with 
steel shot, which are used not to kill but to get quickly into a 
building through a closed door. 
  [Hoffmann] For three years, you have not delivered anything 
to our Army. The Army was responsible for almost half of your 
production. Your economic results show that you have managed 
this. 
  [Hanak] The establishment of the shareholders' company in 
May 1992 was followed by the arrival of new management. This 
management adjusted very quickly to the market conditions, and, 
within several months, Sellier and Bellot went from a loss to a 
profit. Our first goal was to secure the economic stability of 
the company and to keep the employees on. We have succeeded in 
both. 
  [Hoffmann] The stock quoted on the stock market is a sure 
reflection of the company's prosperity. Sellier and Bellot 
shares are priced at 2,000 korunas. Does this correspond to the 
economic situation in the company? 
  [Hanak] We are very happy with the stock market's objective 
appreciation of our work. I believe that the price could be 
even higher. 
  [Hoffmann] Where have you found the competent people? 
  [Hanak] We found them among our own people and in other 
enterprises. For our foreign trade activity, we have used the 
experience of former employees in foreign trade organizations. 
It paid off to stick to the principle that we should select our 
people in a way beneficial to our society and to the reputation 
of the Czech industry. We rejected certain tendentious 
criteria, which did not have anything in common with real 
qualifications. The economic results of the company testify 
that we made a good selection. Apart from that, several 
domestic and foreign organizations have shown interest in our 
experience. Representatives of investment funds come here 
asking us for advice on how to organize foreign trade, the 
management of the company, and the company's internal bank. I 
have received two invitations to lecture abroad. They are 
interested in our experience with the transition from a 
centrally planned economy to a market economy. The first 
invitation is from a consortium of banks in Great Britain; the 
second is from Sweden. 
  [Hoffmann] Do you believe that your experience can be 
generalized? Enterprises are complaining that it is impossible 
to do business in the Czech Republic. 
  [Hanak] This is the excuse of incompetent management. The 
conditions for running a business in the Czech Republic are not 
ideal, but, to good management, they allow the securing of the 
prosperity of the enterprise. 
  [Hoffmann] You have begun to produce projectiles with the 
same caliber as NATO's. Are you counting on selling them to the 
Czech Army and increasing your arms production? 
  [Hanak] We are following the trend whereby our Army's 
weapons will be replaced and the Army will join NATO in the 
future. This is our small contribution to supporting our 
government, which made this decision. Moreover, we will prove 
that Czech industry is capable of manufacturing the same 
products as Western industry. 
  [Hoffmann] You have launched a new line of production, but 
the decision on the replacement of the weapons of our Army will 
be made in the summer, and it will take years before individual 
steps are implemented. Does that mean that the production of 
the ammunition with NATO calibers will be suspended until then? 
  [Hanak] We are negotiating several orders for abroad. 
  [Hoffmann] Are you not afraid that, when the decision on 
replacing the weapons of our Army is made, your company will be 
forgotten and ammunition will be imported from abroad? 
  [Hanak] Such considerations are premature. Even if there is 
no direct decision that we are to supply the Czech Army with 
projectiles, we are going to win the competition because our 
offer is more advantageous than that of our foreign competitors. 
  [Hoffmann] In other countries, do they prefer domestic firms 
to foreign ones when supplying their armies? 
  [Hanak] In some countries, they buy weapons and ammunition 
exclusively from domestic companies. There are countries in 
which there are tenders for part of the deliveries. In 95 
percent of cases, they are won by domestic companies. 
  [Hoffmann] You would certainly welcome it if Czech companies 
participated in the replacement of the weapons of our Army in 
the future. Are you as great a patriot as you are a hunter? 
  [Hanak] I use Sellier and Bellot bullets, a shotgun from the 
Brno Arms Factory, and a hunting gun and rifle from the Cesky 
Brod Arms Factory.

  [Text] On 31 March 1994, the number of job seekers 
totalled 184,466, which represents a decline of 12,100--i.e., 
6.16 percent--from the end of February. 
  The same number of jobs seekers were newly registered during 
the month of March as in February, i.e., 29,600 persons. A 
total of 41,700 people were removed from the register (i.e, 
9,700 more than in February], 31,500 of whom (75.7 percent) 
found application on the labor market. For reasons of 
noncooperation with the labor offices, 3,800 persons were 
deregistered, and 6,300 persons were removed from the register 
because of maternity leave, retirement, etc. 
  The number of districts in which an unemployment increase 
was 
registered substantially declined in March in comparison with 
February. With the exception of four districts--Teplice 
(increase of 3.31 percent), Most (2.62 percent), Prague-East 
(0.25 percent), and Kladno (0.15 percent)--all districts of the 
Czech Republic registered a decline in unemployment of between 6 
and 18 percent. The relatively largest drop was recorded in the 
districts of Prachatice (18.0 percent), Tabor and Uherske 
Hradiste (12.9 percent), and Ceske Budejovice (12.8 percent). 
In 11 more districts, the drop was larger than 10 percent. 
  Women had a larger share of the total unemployment (55 
percent) than men, and also the rate of unemployment of women 
was higher (4 percent) than of men (3 percent). At the end of 
March, there were 101,524 women registered at the labor offices, 
which is 5,000 more than in February. 
  Unemployment benefits were paid to 91,500 job seekers in 
March, which is 49.6 percent of all people registered. 
  The rate of registered unemployment, calculated on the basis 
of labor available on 31 December 1991, also marked a decline 
and decreased from 3.73 percent in the previous month to 3.5 
percent. At the same time, the interdistrict differentiation 
continues. The highest rate of unemployment is maintained in 
the districts of Bruntal (8.74 percent), Novy Jicin (8.56 
percent), Znojmo (8.09 percent), and Louny (8.04 percent). A 
rate of unemployment higher than 5 percent was registered in 
another 16 districts of the Czech Republic, which is four 
districts fewer than in January and February of this year. On 
the other hand, a rate of unemployment lower than 1 percent was 
registered only in the Cheb district (0.85 percent) and the 
capital of Prague (0.30 percent). 
  The number of vacancies reported by employers and registered 
at the labor offices rose by 5,600 from the end of February. 
There were 66,300 vacancies at the end of March. Of the total, 
22.3 percent (14,800) was registered in Prague. Among the 
vacancies, the blue-collar jobs continue to dominate (66 
percent). On 31 March, there were an average of 2.8 job seekers 
per vacant position. 
  Similarly to the rate of unemployment, there are also 
significant interdistrict differences here. While the demand 
for labor force exceeds supply--there are almost seven vacancies 
per applicant--in Prague, in the districts of Bruntal, Novy 
Jicin, Karvina, and Frydek-Mistek, there are on the average 
approximately 11 to 17 job seekers per single vacancy.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav 
Government's committee for cooperation with the U.N. Protection 
Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) on Tuesday said the 
U.N. peace-keepers coming from the countries with which 
Yugoslavia has agreements on the elimination of visas would not 
need visas to enter Yugoslavia as of May 15. The Yugoslav 
Government had introduced entry visas and stay permits for all 
UNPROFOR members in mid-April. The government committee for 
cooperation with UNPROFOR took the stand that the mid-April 
decision did not pertain to the above specified cases, and 
instructed the Foreign and Interior Ministries to take the 
necessary steps. 
  The Yugoslav Government also decided in mid-April that its 
prior approval would have to be obtained for the entry and 
movement of UNPROFOR transportation vehicles on Yugoslav 
territory, and that UNPROFOR personnel carriers would have to 
use only the roads designated by Yugoslav authorities. The 
committee, for its part, decided that UNPROFOR in future pay for 
all services on Yugoslav territory, including the use of 
facilities, which Yugoslavia had covered so far.

  [Text] Podgorica, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia [FRY], created two years ago, is no new state; its 
creation merely confirmed the will of the Serbian and 
Montenegrin people to set up their own state in a new way, FRY 
President Zoran Lilic stated today in an interview to Radio 
Montenegro. He said the current Yugoslavia "emerged under 
domestic and international conditions of general chaos." The 
creation of the FRY was a rational response by the Montenegrin 
and Serbian people to this chaos, Lilic stressed on the occasion 
of two-year anniversary of formation of the common state of 
Serbia and Montenegro. According to him, the founding, 
preservation, and strengthening of the FRY are values of such 
importance that their full meaning will only be able to be 
assessed in retrospect. Lilic also said that it is very 
important to preserve continuity in relation to the former 
Yugoslavia "both because of specific international rights, which 
will have to be recognized, and for the sake of the interests of 
parts of the nation outside the FRY." 
  Most political parties, according to Lilic, have understood 
that they cannot disregard the will of the people when it comes 
to the reasons for the founding and preservation of the FRY, and 
its prospects. The FRY president stated that "sporadic 
disagreements" between the two federal units are only a 
consequence of the difficult economic blockade and other 
unfavorable circumstances. According to him, "the Montenegrin 
people have stoically suffered many trials and tribulations" 
over the past two years. Lilic said the harsh blockade had 
interrupted many positive processes in the FRY. However, even 
in these conditions many changes for the better have been 
achieved. "During two years of condensed history the hardened 
forces have maintained themselves and will be ready for the time 
when the sanctions are lifted," Lilic stressed, expressing the 
hope that this would happen soon. 
  The FRY president on this occasion also repeated his view 
that a peaceful resolution of all the conflicts on the territory 
of the former Yugoslavia remains the only constructive option 
and firm orientation.

  [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. sanctions 
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have brought to the 
brink of social poverty at least 1.5 million citizens by forcing 
them to seek Red Cross humanitarian aid. One of the parameters 
of the drastic overall impoverishment of the Yugoslavs, either 
left jobless by the sanctions or with considerably lower 
salaries, is the fact that 95 percent of parents of under-age 
children are unable to provide school snacks. Regular check-ups 
in Belgrade schools alone have shown that as many as 1,100 
children suffer from undernourishment and aenemia, while many 
cases of fainting from hunger have been recorded. This is why 
the Red Cross of Belgrade last month began distributing meagre 
snacks to all pupils in Belgrade which has the biggest number of 
schools in the country. 
  Over 500,000 families, i.e. at least 1.5 million people, 
have 
so far registered for relief aid with the Yugoslav Red Cross. 
This is a drastic rise in the number of socially threatened 
citizens compared to two years ago, when the U.N.imposed 
sanctions against Yugoslavia and when 62,583 families (or 
142,608 people) had asked for humanitarian aid. Demands for 
opening soup kitchens are arriving from all parts of the 
country. Owing to the efforts of the International Conference 
of the Red Cross (ICRC) the Yugoslav Red Cross managed to set up 
some one hundred soup kitchens which distribute 4,500 meals each 
day. 
  Today Yugoslavia has over one million unemployed, and those 
who have work cannot secure the minimum living conditions for 
their families. Monthly wages are barely sufficient for ten 
days as the price of the consumer basket by far exceeds the 
monthly earnings. 
  On January 24 the Yugoslav Government introduced a new 
economic program of monetary reconstruction and economic 
revival. In the two months of its implementation, the living 
standards of the citizens gradually began growing and the 
hyper-inflation, which had soared to world record highs, has 
been stemmed. Despite this, the U.N. sanctions have put the 
majority of Yugoslavs, even those who are still employed, in the 
category needing humanitarian aid.

  [Text] Belgrade, 26 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received a delegation of Russia's State 
Duma headed by General Nikolay Maksimovich Bezborodov, deputy 
president of the State Duma defense committee. 
  In their open and cordial talks with Slobodan Milosevic the 
representatives of the Russian parliament expressed support for 
Serbia's peace efforts and voiced their unanimous stand that 
economic sanctions against the FRY should be lifted 
unconditionally, according to a statement released by the office 
of the Serbian president. These sanctions are essentially an 
expression of discriminatory policies, something that is at odds 
with the principle of equality in international relations. The 
economic blockade of the FRY imposed by the international 
community is in deep contravention of modern and democratic 
commitments to integration in the worldm, since it is one of the 
most inhumane actions taken against a people at the end of the 
20th century, it was said at today's meeting between President 
Milosevic and the Russian parliamentarians. 
  In the opinion of the members of the Russian parliament, 
Russia should help, with its principled and objective attitudes 
to the parties in the Yugoslav crisis, to find a just political 
solution, something that is totally incompatible with the 
continuation of the unreasonable economic blockade against the 
FRY. Stressing that Serbia holds in high regard Russia's 
balanced and impartial attitudes, as well as its peace efforts 
aimed at bringing an end to the civil war in 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible and establish a just 
and stable peace in these lands, President Milosevic pointed out 
that in this context it is of great importance to restore the 
impartial role of the United Nations in the peace process in 
ex-Bosnia-Herzegovina and to abandon the policy of pressures, 
threats, and imposed solutions on the part of the international 
community. During the talks it was stressed that Serbia 
advocates an end to all hostilities and a political solution 
secured through a negotiating process. 
  FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also took part in 
today's talks between President Milosevic and the Russian 
parliamentarians.

  [Text] Podgorica, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- Montenegrin President 
Momir Bulatovic announced today that a Greek consulate would 
open in this Republic. 
  "In the course of a visit by Greek Minister of Foreign 
Affairs Karolos Papoulias some time ago we accepted with 
pleasure an offer by our guests to open a Greek consulate in 
Montenegro," Bulatovic said, adding that according to what he 
had learned, the Greek parliament has approved such a decision. 
  Replying to a question on the possibility of the opening of 
the consulates of other countries in Montenegro, Bulatovic said 
at a news conference that there was also interest in the opening 
of an Albanian consulate. Unfortunately, he added, "because of 
the current political situation, this idea has not yet reached 
the phase of realization." 
  The Montenegrin president stressed that the foreign policy 
orientation of the government and the leadership of this 
republic is "to accept offers and set up a consular network", 
which would also make the entire diplomatic communication of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia more efficient.

<F P=106> [Interview with Danuta Waniek, newly appointed deputy </F>
minister of national defense, by Aleksander Frydrychowicz; place 
and date not given: "A Crazy Idea of Aleksander"; last four 
paragraphs attributed to "ALF"] 
  [Excerpts] [Frydrychowicz] How did it happen that a 
candidate for the government's plenipotentiary for women's 
affairs became deputy minister at the most masculine ministry? 
  [Waniek] It was the crazy idea of Olek [Aleksander] 
Kwasniewski. He came up with this idea as the ultimate method 
of winning on a flank that was not easily accessible. I 
received the first nomination among the candidates for deputy 
ministers in the "presidential ministries." 
  [Frydrychowicz] Were you happy to move from one ministry to 
another? 
  [Waniek] This is a much more difficult task than my previous 
position. I have had an idea for several years of how the 
Office of the Plenipotentiary for the Affairs of Women, Family, 
and Young People should be organized. I fought for the 
implementation of this concept with consecutive governments. 
  The post I am taking over today is something new in a way. 
There are certainly people in the Ministry of National Defense 
[MON] who have also dealt with these matters so far; however, my 
task lies in steering a ministerial structure the position of 
which will be different from the position to date. 
  [Frydrychowicz] What will be the range of your duties? 
  [Waniek] I will be the ministry's liaison with parliament 
and the spokesman for civil rights. I will deal with the issues 
of military courts and prosecutor's offices. The section dealing 
with interventions will also be subordinated to me. However, I 
must still thoroughly study the list of duties that has been 
handed to me along with the nomination. After skimming it, I 
can say that I will have certain remarks to make. I suppose 
that I will have to hold some minor talks with Minister Piotr 
Kolodziejczyk. 
  [Frydrychowicz] Is this a matter of broadening or narrowing 
your powers? 
  [Waniek] It is a matter of making them more specific. I 
would prefer to do this right at the beginning so that I will 
not encroach upon anyone's powers and no one will encroach upon 
mine. [passage omitted] 
<H8>  * * * </H8>
  "At the motion of the minister of national defense, on 26 
April 1994 I hereby appoint you to the post of under secretary 
of state in MON." Such a letter, dated 22 April, was signed by 
Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak late on the evening on 25 April. 
On the following day, Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk presented it 
to Democratic Left Alliance Deputy Danuta Waniek. 
  Asked by journalists whether, as a woman, she "feels the 
military issues," Danuta Waniek replied: "I have had no 
relations with MON; however, many males are in the same 
situation." 
  Even though she was appointed deputy minister, Danuta Waniek 
has no intention of giving up her activities in the 
parliamentary women's group. 
  At a press conference, the newly appointed deputy minister 
said that she had qualifications to fulfill the present 
function. She is a doctor of parliamentary and constitutional 
law and a graduate of a political science department in Vienna.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Deputy Defense Minister Danuta Waniek </F>
by Luiza Kowalska; place and date not given: "More Women Will 
Also Have To Be Included in Polish Defense Ministry"] 
  [Text] [Kowalska] Have you had any prior contact with the 
Army? 
  [Waniek] No. (After a moment). Oh, I am sorry--I did go 
through military training at the university, and, while I was in 
high school, I took a course entitled "Defensive Adaptation." 
An excellent teacher happened to teach the class in my school, 
and he was the one who shaped my sympathetic attitude toward the 
Army. 
  [Kowalska] How do you intend to go about achieving authority 
with the military cadre, which is so conservative that it 
sometimes even has a hard time accepting the supervision of 
civilian males? 
  [Waniek] I am not really sure about this whole conservatism 
thing. I have been asked about this for several days now, but I 
have to see for myself first whether the cadre is really that 
conservative. Besides, our Army is making efforts to be 
included in European structures. So it follows that the Army 
must modernize its organizational structures, the same way it is 
happening all over the world. More women will have to be 
included in our Ministry of National Defense [MON]. 
  [Kowalska] There are some who fear that your nomination may 
make it difficult to make attempts to increase parliamentary 
supervision over MON. Right now, the dispute is taking place in 
the area of disciplinary internal regulations because the 
military does not want a civilian supervisor to be able to 
discipline it, even if the supervisor is a minister. What do 
you think will be the reaction of a general with years of 
experience when faced with the prospect of being disciplined by 
a woman? 
  [Waniek] That is a very difficult problem. One must have an 
understanding of the Army. I can understand the resistance, 
even though I watched the dispute from a distance. Perhaps a 
more comprehensive debate on the issue will allow both sides to 
elaborate on their positions regarding Army issues. I have 
always greatly respected those who serve in the Army because 
they have devoted their entire professional lives to the 
military. I have been in MON for three days, and it would be 
hard to say that my whole life was associated with the Army, as 
opposed to a majority of officers. So there must be a 
difference between us. Of course, I am referring to the 
advantage of a professional military. 
  [Kowalska] What is your assessment of the changes that are 
taking place right now in MON, aimed at moving many powers from 
the "civilian" sector to the General Staff? 
  [Waniek] One must somehow find a middle-of-the-road 
solution. I do not think that the Army's isolation from the 
environment in which it functions--which, after all, is a 
civilian environment--could possibly be to anybody's advantage. 
I think the trend to open armies up to the civilian world, 
which has been observed throughout Europe and in Poland for four 
years now, is probably the right trend. The Army will always 
retain its specific nature, and I do not think anyone has to 
fear its being otherwise. Taking up defensive positions is not 
necessary. At the same time, I do not think a distortion of a 
balance between MON's civilian and military employees should be 
a danger right now. 
  [Kowalska] Minister Kolodziejczyk has admitted in the Sejm 
that there have occurred cases in the Army of forcing soldiers 
to perform religious practices. Being famous for your fights 
for the state's philosophy-of-life neutrality, do you intend to 
prevent such phenomena from occurring in the future? 
  [Waniek] These issues are within the powers of another 
deputy minister and I have no intentions of interfering with his 
powers. My views on these issues are well known. Field 
ordinariates are in operation, but I think that availing oneself 
of their presence should be voluntary. We have received reports 
of soldiers being forced to take part in religious ceremonies 
and that should, of course, be viewed negatively. 
  I would like some guarantees against such cases of coercion 
to be included in a Charter of Soldier Rights. We plan to 
prepare such a charter in connection with European and UN human 
rights conventions. The military has up to now been functioning 
primarily on the basis of order and discipline. Soldiers' 
rights have always been regarded as being of the last order of 
importance. If the MON leadership thinks that these 
relationships can be changed, that is a very good trend. This 
applies in particular to soldiers serving in the basic service, 
for whom human rights in the Army will be of particular value. 
Thanks to the Army, they will be able to understand what civic 
rights are all about. 
  [Kowalska] The issue of your nomination was settled within a 
matter of hours, which is in contrast to Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, 
the previous candidate put forward by the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD]. How did that happen? Were you a less 
controversial candidate? 
  [Waniek] They said on television that I was the most 
controversial candidate of all those proposed to MON, the 
Foreign Ministry, and the Internal Affairs Ministry. But I 
think the issue is really about something else. The candidacy 
of Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, whom I respect and like very much, 
emerged in the atmosphere of a public conflict between the SLD 
and the Belweder. It was the same case with Professor Dariusz 
Rosati, who was our candidate for the post of finance minister 
and deputy prime minister. Both of these candidacies were 
excellent, but they came about at the politically wrong time. 
  [Kowalska] What does the SLD gain by introducing you into a 
ministry that is headed by a minister put forward by the 
president? 
  [Waniek] One of the advantages is precisely the fact that an 
SLD representative is included in a "presidential" ministry. 
That was not so obvious not so long ago. We have been 
implementing a plan of our Sejm deputies club--gradually, but 
with obstacles--for the governing coalition to actively 
participate in the activities of the three ministries, given 
that the coalition is taking upon itself the responsibility for 
the ministries' functioning. The situation up to now was 
abnormal. There was talk of a coalition consisting of two 
parties, but, actually, it was a trilateral SLD-Polish Peasant 
Party-Belweder coalition. 
  [Kowalska] The range of your powers at MON is not too 
comprehensive, and, most probably, few of the ministry's 
decisions will be left entirely up to you. But, at the same 
time, it is you who will have to stick your neck out for the 
entire ministry in parliament. 
  [Waniek] I do not think it will be that bad. I can resist 
attempts to shift the burden of someone else's decisions onto me.

<F P=106> [Article by Janina Paradowska: "Following President-SLD </F>
Battle: Fluctuations of Tension"] 
  [Text] Finales are always of the same nature as the 
battle itself. The president's battle with the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD]--I am saying that because it was SLD that was 
really the opponent and not the Sejm as such--was ugly, with the 
finale being not much prettier. 
  Difficult political issues should not be resolved at 
rallies, 
whereas Lech Walesa's meeting with the SLD Parliamentary Club 
was mainly just that, a rally. One must admit, by the way, that 
both sides felt quite good in each other's company, and they 
tried to equalize the level of both the questions and the 
answers. 
  In any event, the stakes at the meeting were not too high. 
The presidential idea of dissolving parliament made it possible 
to make up scenarios based on fantastic stories: "Consider 
yourselves dissolved," the president could say. "We absolutely 
do not consider ourselves dissolved," the members of parliament 
would most probably reply. What next? "Consider yourself 
recalled, President!" "I absolutely do not consider myself 
recalled, and I am staying on at the Belweder." At this point, 
the problem of the way of eviction could emerge--I mean both the 
eviction from the building on Wiejska Street [Sejm headquarters] 
and from the Belweder. The problem of eviction has so far not 
been successfully resolved in Poland, so, one way or another, 
there will be a deadlock. 
  The outcome of the exchange of blows at the top of power 
that 
went on for several days is not entirely clear. We do know that 
Minister [presidential aide] Lech Falandysz will have less spare 
time because he will resume attending sessions of the National 
Assembly's Constitutional Commission. SLD Sejm deputies are 
bound to withdraw a draft law intended to restrict presidential 
powers, even though, for the time being, they are trying to 
temporize and wait for Lech Walesa to make the first move. If 
there are supposed to be no changes in the Constitution, let 
there be no changes whatsoever. Most probably, a draft law on 
amending the law on the Constitutional Tribunal will fall victim 
to that--it was submitted on the president's initiative and 
envisages that the tribunal's verdicts shall be final. Quite 
unexpectedly, it is going to be Professor Andrzej Zoll, the 
tribunal's apolitical chairman, who will have to take upon 
himself the burden produced by the politicians. Zoll has been 
unsuccessfully calling for a second reading of the law for a 
long time. 
  The SLD will not appoint Dariusz Rosati deputy prime 
minister 
and finance minister, which was known a long time ago, but it 
will introduce its ministers into the so-called presidential 
ministries. Because decisions regarding specific people were 
made somewhere behind Waldemar Pawlak's back, this will 
definitely greatly improve the frame of mind of the prime 
minister and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], and it will also 
greatly improve the process of building mutual confidence 
between the distrusting partners. 
  After the fight, the participants did not look happy. The 
first round--everybody knows there are more to come--ended in a 
draw, with a slight advantage for Aleksander Kwasniewski. The 
president announced he will stir up more conflicts, after which 
he left for Szczecin with the goal of building the Non-Party 
Bloc in Support of Reforms wing, which is supposed to be a 
pillar on the road to his reelection. But, for the moment, the 
wing is very weak indeed, while the way the president is trying 
to make efforts to be reelected seems just too unconventional, 
even for Lech Walesa. 
  One can, of course, ask: Did we really need all this? If 
the president was after creating a conviction among a wide 
audience that the new authorities are also predisposed to 
political brawls and to taking part in wars at the top, one must 
admit that he was largely successful in achieving the goal. The 
SLD took an amazingly easy-going position while going into this 
battle. I am not quite sure whether the cracks in the SLD's 
public image--which did emerge, there is no doubt about it--are 
really worth the posts of three under secretaries of state. I 
am also not sure whether, even if the PSL manages to score very 
good results in the self-governmental elections, that could 
compensate for the view that has been spreading more and more, 
that the prime minister just chooses too often not to have a 
view on important issues. After all, we live in times of having 
to make decisions--and not the easiest ones, either. 
  But one must admit that the period of increasing political 
disorder was utilized by some in an extraordinarily useful way. 
Take the foreign economic cooperation minister: While not 
involving himself in ambition-driven fights, he, assisted by his 
legal experts, searched peacefully for gaps in the legal system, 
with the goal of establishing quite an interesting holding with 
a substantial contribution of budget monies. So the minister 
succeeded in demonstrating to his colleagues completely new 
prospects and an unconventional way of performing one's duty. 
Up to now, ministers tended not to involve themselves in 
looking for gaps in the legal system. Not so long ago, Leszek 
Balcerowicz even faced the prospect of being brought in front of 
the State Tribunal for his failure to get rid of some gaps in 
time, which resulted in an alcohol affair. As can be seen, we 
are at a completely new stage of building capitalism, and 
Professor Balcerowicz should start taking lessons from his 
younger, cutting-edge colleagues. 
  So, looking at the recent events from a certain historical 
perspective, one must conclude that the old is fighting the new. 
In terms of the old, we have definitely preserved our 
attachment to wars at the top, while the new cannot be described 
by any clear-cut terms yet, even though the term "interest" is 
appearing somewhere in the background and the term's 
associations with the interests of the state are not yet 
completely clear. 
  Meanwhile, we have reached an electricity-generating factor 
of 20, and it looks like power was taken over by the miners 
guarding conveyor belts in brown coal mines. The war has moved 
from the top down. It may now turn prove ruthless than the 
games over who should nominate a minister.

  [Text] [Announcer] Let's try again to get through by phone 
to our reporter Ernest Zorzun in Belchatow: 
  [Zorzun] I am speaking from Belchatow, bringing the latest 
news. Solidarity has called a nationwide general strike for 28 
April. The national protest action staff have stated that this 
action is being taken after today's talks with the industry 
minister and the fruitless wait for the government to implement 
the trade union's demands. The action will be continuous strike 
action and is aimed at putting pressure on the government in 
order to force it to quickly present a timetable for 
implementing the demands of the national trade unions. Minister 
Pol was urged (?to do this) during this morning's talks, Marian 
Krzaklewski stated. We have no other way, Krzaklewski added, at 
the end of a hastily organized news conference. 
  [Announcer] Thank you. I remind you that the government is 
meeting just now to discuss the strike situation.

  [Text] Olsztyn, 26 April--In a conversation with a PAP 
journalist on 26 April, Ewa Spychalska, chairwoman of the OPZZ 
[National Trade Union Alliance], ruled out the possibility of 
the OPZZ joining in the Solidarity strike action but did not 
rule out cooperation under conditions that will be determined by 
the presidium. She announced that if the strike wave did not 
stop by noon on 27 April, the OPZZ Presidium would make a 
decision about what the union will do in the prevailing 
situation. 
  Spychalska believes that the demands put forward by 
Solidarity during the strikes are "in general compatible with 
those put to the government by the OPZZ." She has doubts about 
the "road chosen by Solidarity." "I cannot imagine the OPZZ 
choosing a paralysis of the country as its objective," she 
added, asked by the PAP journalist to comment on the strike 
action. On Tuesday, Spychalska took part in a precongress 
meeting with OPZZ members in Olsztyn. 
  According to Spychalska there are more and more flashpoints 
between the government and the OPZZ. The greatest controversies 
are aroused by the government draft labor code and the trade 
union acts, which, she said, "push the unions into a corner." 
Speaking about this, she did not rule out the possibility of 
the OPZZ leaving the coalition. 
  According to the OPZZ chairwoman, after four years of 
Solidarity in power, the situation in Poland is "critical," 
while that union was striving for "confrontation and 
overthrowing the government," disregarding the results of the 
last elections.

  [Text] Warsaw, 27 Apr--According to Marek Pol, minister of 
industry and trade, the miners' strike is politically motivated. 
The condition for the strike to be discontinued was the 
annulment of the decision on the transformation of mines into 
holding companies. This had taken place, but the strikers had 
put forward further demands, Pol said on Polish Radio Three on 
Wednesday. 
  The industry minister stressed that he had decided to annul 
Decision No. 30 [on setting up holding companies] after talks 
with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who shares his opinion that 
transformations to modernize the economy are necessary. The 
minister also hopes that the workforce in the striking mines 
will come to this conclusion. 
  Marek Pol said that it was not possible to prepare a 
schedule 
for resolving strikers' demands in 48 hours. The fulfilment of 
the demands from the mining sector by the government would mean 
that the state is being run by the trade union, and "such a 
situation is not considered normal anywhere in the world." 
  The minister blamed the union for causing the deterioration 
of moods among the miners because the unions passed on 
incomplete information to the workforce of the mines about the 
conditions for transforming the industry. According to Pol, 
information about conditions should reach each miner 
individually.

Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Industry Minister Marek Pol, the 
Trade Union Federation of Brown Coal Mining said that its 
members are suspending their participation in the strike and are 
ready for negotiations with the government on demands put 
forward by the union. 
  "Because Decision No. 30 has been annulled, the federation 
strike committee is suspending its participation in the strike 
and obliging enterprise commissions to withdraw from strike 
committees in enterprises after internal demands are met. When 
the strike has been suspended, we are open to negotiations with 
the government on the union's demands", federation miners said.

  [Text] Gdansk, 27 Apr -- Solidarity leader Marian 
Krzaklewski has ruled out the possibility that the national 
strike called by Solidarity on Tuesday could turn out to be a 
"damp squib." 
  "At the moment, 120,000 people are already on strike, and 
the 
strategic effect of the strike has been practically achieved," 
he said today at a news conference in the Gdansk headquarters of 
Solidarity's National Commission. 
  "I expect that in the first two days there will be a lot of 
warning, two-hour actions, and some of the plants will begin a 
continuous strike. There will certainly be more than 100 plants 
protected by the Solidarity strike fund," he added.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 27 Apr--Out of a sense of responsibility 
for the country and the success of the Polish reforms, the 
Council of Ministers deems it essential to take up a position on 
the wave of strikes currently being organized. Society must 
know that the strikes in the brown coal mines constitute a 
threat to Poland's power supply, and the spread of strike 
actions can ruin the chances of economic development, a 
Government Press Bureau communique on 27 April states. [passage 
omitted] 
  In the government's assessment, their are no substantive 
grounds for reaching for the strike weapon. The strikes are 
continuing in spite of clear assurances that the reform of the 
brown-coal mining industry depends on an earlier agreement with 
the trade unions and in spite of the annulment by the industry 
minister of the instruction concerning changes in this sector of 
the economy. The response to the decision by the minister of 
industry and trade was more demands and attempts at diktat. The 
readiness for talks is being ignored. Such a reaction proves 
unambiguously that, for the strike organizers, the content 
itself of the demands and negotiations is of lesser importance. 
Unrest and tensions themselves are what count. 
  The leaders of the Solidarity trade union have made a 
nervous 
attempt to force decisions by the state's constitutional bodies 
and to restore a situation guaranteeing Solidarity a privileged 
position vis-a-vis the other trade unions. To achieve these 
aims, it is deceiving the working milieux by disseminating 
untrue reports of mass redundancies being prepared. 
  The government is open to talks with the trade unions, 
employer representatives, and local self-government leaders. 
[passage omitted] 
  Such talks are already under way. It is Solidarity that has 
refused to take part in them. [passage omitted] 
  The organizers of the strike bear responsibility for 
diminishing chances for development. The effect of their deeds 
is that we in Poland see, with each passing hour, a 
disorganization of the economy, a smaller cake to share, and 
less to satisfy the needs of the population. 
  These strikes have no legal basis nor any substantive, 
rational justification. Enterprises have every right to seek 
compensation from the strike organizers for losses incurred, we 
read in the communique of the Government Press Office. 
  The government is taking essential steps to limit the danger 
to the security of the country and to lessen the extent of 
economic losses and the inconvenience caused to Polish families 
by strike actions. Unfortunately, should restrictions in the 
production of electricity be protracted, periodic power cuts in 
homes will become inevitable. 
  The Council of Ministers expresses its trust that the Polish 
people will not surrender to the blackmail of strikes. While 
keeping its open-minded attitude toward substantive 
negotiations, the government declares that it will decisively 
oppose any anarchy in economic life and work for the security of 
the citizens. 
  Negotiations need an atmosphere of cooperation and not one 
of 
threats and irresponsibility. Participation in the strike is 
like voting for destabilization and for hindering any chance of 
social demands being implemented. The prime minister has 
empowered Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol to hold talks on 
demands made by different sectors of industry. As far as issues 
concerning the whole of society are concerned, such a remit has 
been entrusted to Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social 
policy. 
  A meeting of all the trade unions that belong to the 
Tripartite Commission will take place on 29 April. 
  According to the prime minister, there is no basis for 
calling a national strike, states the communique.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 27 Apr--[passage omitted] The president 
gave a news conference lasting a dozen minutes or so at Okecie 
Airport. 
  To the comment that Solidarity had called a general strike 
for 28 April and was demanding the withdrawal of the so-called 
neopopiwek [wage control tax], the president said: "Let's not 
allow ourselves to be driven mad; I think common sense will win 
in the end. After all, there is no popiwek for the time being. 
I have not made a statement on this matter, and I think that 
everything will turn out well." [passage omitted] 
  Asked what he would say to the miners, Walesa replied: "I 
would say that the reforms are very difficult, that in the 
center of Europe we must change the representatives of the law, 
but we must respect the law. Imagine that somebody in Poland 
starts driving on the left-hand side, not obeying the law. 
Imagine what would happen in Warsaw. It is the same with other 
rules." 
  If you were a worker now, would you go on strike? the 
president was asked. "It would depend on what factory I was in: 
in one yes, in another no. But I would not overturn the entire 
law. That would be going a bit too far," he replied. 
  Would you be able to create a minority government with the 
Polish Peasant Party, based on the Belweder? 
  "Based on the Belweder, it depends. If somebody said that 
only people from the Belweder (were to go) into the government, 
then no. But if it were a question of being based on the 
Belweder, which appoints (a government), then I am ablebecause I 
have a good understanding of circles. Of course, I do not have 
a spare set of ministers at the Belweder. We are not talking 
about a political government; we are talking about a government 
of experts," Walesa replied. 
  Asked if he would support Grzegorz Kolodko, the Left's 
candidate for deputy prime minister and finance minister, the 
president said that he had no reservations up to now, and the 
candidacy would probably go through. He added that he had no 
formal proposal on this matter. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] This is a horrid document, written in the 
language of totalitarian power on the subject of strikes in the 
'80's, we were told by Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski, 
who was commenting on the text of the communique from the 
Government Press Office regarding the strike situation in Poland. 
  In a communique published today, the government stressed 
that 
strikes in brown coal mines were a threat to the power supply of 
Poland and that any spreading of the strike action could wreck 
any chance of economic development. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Maciej Jankowski, leader of Solidarity's Mazowsze 
region, who was guest of the "Sygnaly Dnia" [Signals of the Day] 
morning program on Polish Radio's First Program, said that 
today's strike is nationwide but not general because public 
services are not joining the strike. Maciej Jankowski added 
that the strike should not interrupt everyday life in towns and 
cities. 
  [Begin recording] [Jankowski] I suppose that about 1,000 
enterprises will join the strike. In Warsaw alone, all of the 
big enterprises expressed readiness and are prepared for it. 
These are: the FSO [small car plant], the Warsaw steelworks, 
Elemis, the Wola-Rawar arms enterprise, and Ursus [tractor 
enterprise], as always. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Is this a classic strike?. 
  [Jankowski] Yes, a strike including the halting of 
production. In tens of enterprises, sirens will be sounded, 
flags displayed, and rallies organized. All large leading 
enterprises have stopped because there is no other way. [end 
recording] 
  According to Maciej Jankowski, the strike was announced 
because there was no will on the part of the government to 
implement solutions put forward by the Solidarity and approved 
by specialists. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Marian Krzaklewski, chairman of the </F>
Independent Self-Governing Trade Union Solidarity, by Piotr 
Adamowicz; place and date not given: "We Are Ready for a 
Compromise"] 
  [Text] [Adamowicz] Minister Pol has reminded all of us 
that last fall Solidarity ["S"] declared that it would strive to 
overthrow the new government by all available legal means. 
  [Krzaklewski] It was the government that came up with the 
notion that the current strikes are of a political nature. What 
the government is saying is false; we have not put forward any 
political demands. It is possible that the coalition fears 
that, if it does not manage to act on the compromise, the 
consequences will be very bad. It is worth recalling that "S" 
demands the implementation of solutions that were agreed upon a 
long time ago. The strikes are legal because we are in 
collective bargaining with the government concerning the 
following: compensation for increased maintenance costs and 
nonimplementation of the "Pact on Enterprise." 
  The new governing elite is arrogant, displaying 
democratic-hegemonic tendencies. Minister Pol says that he will 
not yield to any pressure because the government has a definite 
majority in the parliament that was elected in parliamentary 
elections. He forgets that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
and the Polish Peasant Party were supported by 20 percent of the 
people. All the same, he speaks of a majority. He is delaying 
the implementation of the "Pact on Enterprise" because he does 
not want clear rules of the game with the union, he does not 
want to have a strong partner. The introduction of the 
principle of the representatives of the unions would prove that, 
for most enterprises, the representative union is "S" and not 
the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement. The government is 
violating the law; it does not want to admit that the union is 
right because such an admission would be an "S" success, which 
is not a desirable thing for the government. The coalition 
accepted the doctrine of a fight with the union; it says "Let 
them bleed until the end." I know about direct pressure by the 
prime minister and the ministers, who insisted that such and not 
other information on the union's activities and on the strikes 
be broadcast on television and radio. A few days ago, an 
interview with me was not aired on the first program of the 
Polish Radio Network. 
  [Adamowicz] It seemed that you were understood by Prime 
Minister Pawlak. 
  [Krzaklewski] I am wondering whether Prime Minister Pawlak 
is playing a game or if he is unable to implement certain 
solutions because of the opposition of the ministers and the 
SLD. When we are talking, the prime minister declares 
understanding, he states that he accepts our demands. Experts' 
committees work on the schedule of the implementation of the 
demands. It must only be approved by the government, which 
delays things. However, I do not speak with the prime minister 
in a cafe, but in the Office of the Council of Ministers. 
  Then we sign a joint communique. Therefore, I am wondering 
whether the prime minister is playing a game or the SLD and the 
ministers are forcing him to give up his promises. This would 
mean that his position is weak. 
  A day before the strike at Belchatow, I spoke with the prime 
minister. I said that, if the government submitted ways of 
resolving the demands, the strike might be expected to be 
suspended at the rally. Then the prime minister signed a very 
general letter, which was hooted. 
  [Adamowicz] Do you predict a black scenario? 
  [Krzaklewski] We are ready for a compromise! We are waiting 
for the reply until 2000 on Thursday [28 April]. The Council of 
Ministers is convening; let them say what the scenario of our 
further demands will be like. The government cannot say that we 
are placing it on the wall! It has known our demands since 
November. "S" has displayed its ability to reach a compromise 
by increasing coal supplies to the power plant. When the 
Council of Ministers gives a specific answer on the schedule, a 
mixed government-union commission may convene that will work out 
the details and the demands of the branches. 
  [Adamowicz] However, a compromise requires both sides to 
make concessions. 
  [Krzaklewski] So far, the government has not proved that the 
implementation of some demands is impossible because of the 
economic capabilities of the state. If it proves this, we will 
accept it. We can speak about deferring the implementation of 
some of the demands. However, we will not give up the 
priorities: curbing the decrease in families' incomes--that is, 
lowering the energy prices, introducing a profamily tax system, 
and abandoning the new popiwek [tax on excessive wage 
increases]. We will still demand immediate implementation of 
the "Pact on Enterprise" and the giving of ownership rights to 
citizens. Because the government is speaking about a strong 
coalition, because the new popiwek law was adopted within a 
half-hour, it may take the coalition 48 hours to adopt the 
"Pact," which was prepared a long time ago. 
  [Adamowicz] In the meantime, the new popiwek law has gone to 
the senate. 
  [Krzaklewski] If the senate adopts this law, it will limit 
the room for compromise. "S" will turn to the Constitutional 
Tribunal because the law will be violated. The law cannot be 
retroactive; the unions were not consulted on the bill; it is 
also contrary to Article 68 of the Constitution, which pertains 
to the relationship between the wage level and the quantity and 
quality of work, where the principles of social justice should 
be taken into account. We will also ask the president not to 
sign this law. The president seems to be seeking closer 
relations with the union. Therefore, he will have a chance to 
show his attitude toward the problems of employees and "S." 
  [Adamowicz] Unless the government submits the schedule, "S" 
threatens a general strike. Opinion polls suggest that the 
popular acceptance of strikes is poor. Even the greatest 
radicals, such as Maciej Jankowski, stated two weeks ago that 
"there is no atmosphere for strikes." 
  [Krzaklewski] A general strike is possible when the 
authorities start shooting at people. It will be a strike of 
the nationwide union organization. We conducted referendums in 
several thousand enterprises, and our action is legal. The 
active strike will be joined by the enterprises of the 
metallurgical, arms, and cement-and-lime industry, as well as 
mines and railways. I am not saying that the action will be 
unlimited because, if the government does not submit a clear 
schedule of the implementation of our demands, it will mean that 
it is a fight for months or even years.

<F P=106> [By Graham Brown] </F>
  [Text] Brussels, April 27 (AFP) -- NATO said Wednesday it 
was satisfied with the Bosnian Serb withdrawal from Gorazde, but 
remained poised to use its bombs in defence of the town and 
another five "safe areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. A North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation spokesman said here that NATO and 
UN forces were conducting a "robust reconnaissance" in the 
exclusion zone around Gorazde to check for any remaining Bosnian 
Serb heavy weapons there. "If any (heavy weapons) are 
discovered, they must be removed immediately or they will be 
subject to air strikes," he warned. 
  Earlier, NATO announced that the Bosnian Serbs had generally 
complied with NATO's ultimatum that they withdraw all their 
heavy weapons from a 20-kilometre (12.5 mile) radius around 
Gorazde by 0001 GMT Wednesday. 
  The chairman of NATO's military committee, British 
Field-Marshall Sir Richard Vincent, said: "There are no major 
incidents to report." He told a press conference at NATO 
headquarters here: "The freedom of movement for UN personnel 
(into Gorazde) has for the most part been restored." But, 
speaking after a meeting of NATO's military committee, Vincent 
reiterated the alliance's determination to bomb the Bosnian 
Serbs if they attacked Gorazde or any other UN-declared "safe 
areas" in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  A parallel meeting of the North Atlantic Council comprising 
ambassadors from NATO's 16 members called on all sides to avoid 
all "provocative actions" and warned the Bosnian Serbs against 
any hostile actions directed at UN personnel. But Vincent 
acknowledged that NATO had no authority to stop the Bosnian 
Serbs using the weapons withdrawn from Gorazde in attacks on 
other Bosnian Moslem positions not defined as "safe areas". 
  Military strategists have warned that the Bosnian Serbs 
could 
turn their artillery next on Moslem and Croat positions near the 
narrow "Brcko corridor" in northern Bosnia linking Serbia with 
its conquests in western Bosnia. Vincent acknowledged the 
danger of such a redeployment. "We need to keep track of it and 
we shall do so," he said. But the field-marshal added: "It is 
not NATO's business to take international law unto itself and go 
stamping around in other people's territory." 
  NATO could do nothing outside the "safe areas" to oppose 
Bosnian Serb assaults unless the UN Security Council expanded 
its air strike mandate, Vincent said. The alliance said earlier 
that its air strike threats aimed at underpinning current 
efforts by the United States, Russia, the European Union and the 
United Nations to bring the combatants in Bosnia back to the 
negotiation table. "The (North Atlantic) Council welcomed in 
particular the constructive engagement of Russia in the search 
for a negotiated settlement," the spokesman said.

  [Text] Brussels, April 27 (AFP) -- NATO and United Nations 
forces are combing the exclusion zone around the Bosnian town of 
Gorazde for any remaining Bosnian Serb heavy weapons, the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organisation said here Wednesday. A NATO 
spokesman said a "robust" reconnaisance was still in progress 
and warned: "If any (heavy weapons) are discovered, they must be 
removed immediately or they will be subject to air strikes." He 
also reiterated NATO's determination to bomb the Bosnian Serbs 
if they attacked Gorazde or any other UN-declared "safe areas" 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The spokesman was speaking after a meeting of the North 
Atlantic Council, comprising the ambassadors from NATO's 16 
member countries. "The council was encouraged by signs that its 
objectives of lifting the strangulation of Gorazde has been 
achieved," he said. 
  Current information indicated that the Bosnian Serbs had 
generally complied with NATO's ultimatum that they withdraw all 
their heavy weapons from a 20-kilometre (12.5 mile) radius 
around Goradze by 0001 GMT Wednesday. "This development gives 
hope for the future. Nonetheless the alliance emphasises that 
the ultimatum remains in force and that it will continue to 
monitor the situation with the utmost vigilance," the spokesman 
said. 
  NATO called on all sides to avoid all "provocative actions" 
and warned the Bosnian Serbs against any hostile actions against 
UN personnel. It also warned that freedom of movement should be 
unimpeded at Gorazde and at the other UN-declared "safe areas" 
covered by NATO's air-strike umbrella -- Sarajevo, Srebrenica, 
Tuzla, Bihac and Zepa. "The council reiterated its 
determination to conduct air strikes in coordination with 
UNPROFOR (UN Protection Force) if Gorazde and other safe areas 
in Bosnia are attacked or exclusion zones violated," the 
spokesman said. He stressed that NATO's air strike threats were 
intended to underpin current efforts by the United States, 
Russia, the European Union and the United Nations to bring the 
combatants in Bosnia back to the negotiation table. "The 
council welcomed in particular the constructive engagement of 
Russia in the search for a negotiated settlement," the spokesman 
said.

  [Text] Erfurt/Sarajevo (DDP/ADN) - Serb infantry is still 
within a three-kilometer radius of the Bosnian enclave of 
Gorazde. This was stated by Bosnian Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic in a telephone interview with Thursday's edition of 
the THUERINGER ALLGEMEINE, which is based in Erfurt. Silajdzic 
thus rejected UN statements that the Serb troops had largely 
withdrawn from the town. Silajdzic called upon NATO to "take 
its own ultimatum seriously." The UN should make use of its 
possibilities for calling air strikes. The Serbs had withdrawn 
heavy artillery from the 20 km radius around Gorazde, as asked. 
However, now the same situation was developing as after the 
ultimatum in Sarajevo, Silajdzic said. "If the movement of these 
weapons is not stopped, in five to ten days time we will have 
the same situation in northern Bosnia as we have in Gorazde," 
the Bosnian prime minister warned. The places around the 
Posavina area in Bosnia or the towns of Brcko, Maglaj and Konjic 
were in particular jeopardy.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 27 (AFP) -- The United Nations said 
Wednesday [27 April] it was against moving Gorazde residents out 
of the Moslem enclave, which has been overrun by Serb troops. 
"Our view is that the refugee population of Gorazde should be 
allowed to return to their villages" in the pocket, said the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman in 
Sarajevo, Peter Kessler. "For the moment there has been no 
official suggestion of a forced displacement of population," he 
said. UN Protection Force spokesman Eric Chaperon said the idea 
of a movement of population was an "unfounded rumour." 
  Earlier several humanitarian sources said a movement of up 
to 
20,000 refugees in the Gorazde pocket was being discussed. 
  "We know that discussions are under way to open up a passage 
through Serb-controlled territory for refugees from Gorazde," 
one said on condition of anonymity. "They are talking about up 
to 20,000 people, crossing the mountains on foot, within the 
next two weeks," the source said. 
  UN officials say two-thirds of the Gorazde enclave's 
territory is occupied by Bosnian Serb troops who have imposed a 
stranglehold after a fierce offensive that began in late March. 
The town of Gorazde itself swelled with Moslem refugees. Serb 
forces pulled heavy weapons outside an exclusion zone Wednesday 
under threat of NATO air strikes, and the fighting has largely 
subsided. But Kessler said the enclave's civilian population 
was going to need "a permanent life support system" as the Serbs 
appear bent on making the region unlivable for the Moslems. He 
said one example of this was the Serbs' destruction of Gorazde's 
water processing plant as they pulled out of the town over the 
weekend. Humanitarian sources said that Serb psychological 
pressure on the Moslem population was such that many would 
accept an opportunity to leave. 
  A similar idea was floated last April at Srebrenica in 
eastern Bosnia after Serb forces succeeded in eliminating the 
enclave's defences, but local authorities opposed the move, 
saying it would aid the Serb campaign of "ethnic cleansing." 
  The Bosnian government has consistently opposed forced 
movements of population.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 27 (AFP) -- The eastern Bosnian 
enclave of Gorazde could become a Moslem ghetto as two thirds of 
its territory is occupied by Bosnian Serb troops who have 
imposed a stranglehold on the region, UN officias said. The UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cannot condone the 
creation of another Moslem ghetto in eastern Bosnia like 
Srebrenica," UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said. "That is 
unacceptable, and that is the issue we should be looking 
carefully at." He said the enclave's civilian population of 
about 50,000 is going to need "a permanent life support system" 
as the Serbs appear bent on making the region unlivable for the 
Moslems. He said one example of the Serb resolve was their 
destruction of the town's water processing plant during 
three-weeks of shelling that only stopped after NATO threatened 
airstrikes. 
  Several relief officials here speaking on condition of 
anonymity said plans were "actively" underway for the possible 
evacuation of 20,000 people from the enclave. Meanwhile, 
Kessler said that UN efforts to provide assistance to the town 
residents have been hampered by Serb delaying tactics. 
  Eric Chaperon, the UN Protection Force spokesman, said that 
the the Serbs on Tuesday prevented a UN convoy carrying building 
material from reaching the town. Kessler said the convoy should 
reach Gorazde Thursday adding that "the delays imposed by the 
Serbs are a violation of freedom of movement." He said that in 
order to survive, the enclave's residents would need "at least 
one convoy a day" and that refugees must be allowed to return to 
their homes.

  [Text] Zvornik, April 28 (TANJUG) -- Ill and wounded Serbs 
who were evacuated from Gorazde in two U.N. helicopters on 
Wednesday say that the remaining Serb population is exposed to 
unheard of Muslim terror and atrocities. Eight sick and nine 
wounded Serbs were airlifted to the village of Sokolac, 
northeast of Sarajevo within the Bosnian Serb Republic (RS). 
  The Gorazde Muslim authorities abused the town's status of a 
U.N. safe area and before the very eyes of the U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) killed, tortured and harrassed in various ways 
the remaining several hundred of Gorazde's 12,000 pre-war Serb 
inhabitants. The Muslims even desecrated the Serb cemetery and 
pulled down the 700-year-old St. George church. 400 Serbs 
remain trapped in the part of the town controlled by Ferid 
Buljubasic, one of the biggest Muslim fundamentalists in Bosnia. 
That part of Gorazde also contains camps for Serbs, such as the 
one in the suburb of Vinarici, and `Stamparija' and 'Cementara' 
in Vitkovici, close to the town, where hundreds of Serb men and 
women were tortured and killed. 
  The truth about Muslim atrocities against the Serbs began to 
come out only after the Bosnian Serb army neared Gorazde in a 
counterattack to the Muslim offensive launched from this town -- 
a U.N.-designated safe area which should have been demilitarized 
last spring. Over the past few days the French media cited 
several UNPROFOR members who admitted that the number of wounded 
in the battle for Gorazde was inflated at least threefold by the 
Sarajevo Muslim propaganda machinery. This was revealed only 
after the evacuation of the wounded from Gorazde. Following the 
collapse of the Muslim offensive, which was carried out before 
the very eyes of the U.N. peacekeepers, the Muslim authorities 
planted dead and butchered Serbs and presented them to the 
foreign media as the victims of `Serb shelling and snipers.'

<F P=106> [By Bernard Estrade] </F>
  [Text] Sarajevo, April 26 (AFP) -- Humanitarian 
organisations overstated the number of victims caused by Bosnian 
Serb shelling of the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, UN and aid 
groups said here Tuesday. The office of the UN High 
Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] had earlier spoken of 715 
killed and 1,970 wounded. Of these, 600 were said to be 
seriously hurt and required immediate evacuation. But UN and 
humanitarian organisation officials here said the toll should 
probably be divided by three. The actual number of those killed 
in the three-week Serb offensive against the eastern Bosnian 
enclave was at most 250 and the number of those wounded 600 to 
700, they said. 
  Monday evening, some 200 seriously wounded patients had been 
helicoptered out of the Gorazde hospital which was now "empty", 
officials said. UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler acknowledged on 
Tuesday that casualty figures earlier given should be "scaled 
down" and "are perhaps not all serious." Obviously embarrassed, 
he said that it was impossible for the time being to say by how 
much figures had been exaggerated. "We are in a war situation 
and in a war everybody uses propaganda," he said. "All the 
figures we gave were based on reports from our representatives 
in the field," a UNHCR official, who wished to remain anonymous, 
said. "What we did not know, and what they did not tell us, was 
that information given originated with Bosnian authorities in 
Gorazde and that they had not checked it themselves," he added. 
  The UNHCR team and that of Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors 
Without Borders) were in shelters and had little opportunity to 
move around town, notably during the last week. "It was the 
same for UN military observers," according to an officer at the 
headquarters of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) here. The 
first doubts regarding the reported number of casualties emerged 
on Sunday when UN troops first arrived in the town after NATO 
had threatened to bomb Bosnian Serbs if they did not stop their 
bombardment and withdraw from around the city. 
  Those evacuated, according to officials here, have been 
mainly soldiers. Monday evening, a senior UNPROFOR officer was 
busy asking: "Where are the wounded? We're looking for them..."

  [Text] Belgrade, April 26 (TANJUG) -- Jovan Zametica, 
spokesman of Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) President Radovan 
Karadzic, described Tuesday [26 April] as another in a series of 
propaganda fabrications of the Bosnian Moslems the story about 
the alleged thousands of wounded and hundreds of killed in 
Gorazde. Gorazde is a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia and the 
site of almost a month of heavy fighting of the Moslem and Serb 
forces. After ceasefire accord was reached, evacuation of the 
wounded with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] helicopters ensued 
on Sunday. Zametica's statement, sent to TANJUG, says that "at 
the height of the Gorazde hysteria, it was claimed that there 
were 2,000 Muslims wounded and 700 dead. "However, U.N. medical 
evacuation helicopters have to date brought out only 170 
persons, many of whom have been patients for months and could 
not have been the casualties of the recent fighting," says 
Zametica and warns that on Tuesday, "two evacuation helicopters 
returned empty". 
  "The pattern is very clear for those who want to see it: the 
Muslims manufacture or exaggerate a crisis, international 
organizations on the ground either say nothing or openly take 
the Muslim side, and the world media uncritically swallow 
everything," says he. Zametica claims that "a high-ranking 
UNPROFOR official confirmed to us that international 
humanitarian organizations had deliberately engaged in a 
campaign of lies and disinformation concerning the extent of 
casualties in Gorazde." In conclusion, Zametica recalls the 
"case with the `breadline massacre' which was staged by the 
Muslims, but the Serbs got the sanctions (i.e. F.R. Yugoslavia). 
With the market place massacre, again staged by the Muslims, 
but the Serbs got the ultimatum. And now with Gorazde, with one 
ultimatum on top of another." He adds that "the world diplomats 
and decision-makers should ask themselves whether they can allow 
their policies to be so easily dictated by the world media which 
in turn report lie after lie after lie." 
  A French television Channel One reporter in Bosnia admitted 
Tuesday that the numbers about hundreds of killed and wounded 
Moslems in Gorazde were "blown-up" by the Moslem sources, 
different humanitarian organizations and Western media. The 
answer to the question where have several hundred wounded and 
killed Moslems in Gorazde disappeared could not be supplied, as 
the TF-1 reporter said, by either UNPROFOR or representatives of 
humanitarian organizations.

  [Text] Sarajevo, April 28 (AFP) -- UN Protection Force 
[UNPROFOR] chief General Michael Rose was only "theorising" when 
he appeared to accuse Bosnian defences in Gorazde of collapsing 
too early and wanting to drag the United Nations into a war, a 
spokesman said Thursday. Rose was talking "soldier to soldier" 
in a private conversation, held during a visit to the town 
Wednesday, that "should never have been released," UNPROFOR 
spokesman Eric Chaperon said. The UN commander had been 
discussing theories for the Bosnian collapse, and the view 
expressed was only one of several possibilities raised, the 
spokesman said. He stressed that the remarks did not represent 
the UNPROFOR position on the issue. Rose intended to explain 
his position at greater length later Thursday, Chaperon said. 
  A video tape presenting the conversation was broadcast on 
BBC 
television late Wednesday. Chaperon said he did not know how 
the tape came to be passed to the BBC and broadcast. In the 
tape, Rose said that Bosnian Government forces "think we should 
be fighting the war for them... they basically turned and ran 
and left us to try and pick up the bits." 
  UNPROFOR Sarajevo sector commander General Andre Soubirou 
meanwhile told reporters Wednesday that he had found the 
collapse of Bosnian defence lines "difficult to explain," and 
said that they "could have done better." 
  Serbs, who attacked Gorazde at the end of March, had 
withdrawn their heavy weapons outside a 20-kilometre (12-mile) 
exclusion zone around the town by late Wednesday, the UN 
peacekeeping force said. NATO has given the Serbs an ultimatum 
to lift their siege of the town or face aerial bombardment of 
their positions.

  [Excerpt] As suddenly as he had arrived in Gorazde, General 
Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, left the town. 
During his stay, Gen. Rose had a very brief meeting with Ferid 
Buljubasic, commander of the Bosnian Army's eastern Bosnian 
operational zone in Gorazde. After being told by the Gorazde 
commander that UN forces have not yet fulfilled their duty 
regarding the setting up of a demarcation zone 3 km from the 
town center, Gen. Rose briefly said this was not right and cut 
short the conversation. After this, Gen. Rose visited the almost 
destroyed hospital in Gorazde and the UN members in the town. 
  During Gen. Rose's stay in Gorazde, people from the nearby 
villages started gathering outside the UN headquarters. This 
protest meeting is still under way, and over 2,000 residents of 
Kazagici, Zupcici, Bare, Ugarak, Kokino Selo, [words indistinct] 
are demanding to return to their homes as soon as possible--the 
homes they left at the height of the chetnik offensive on 
Gorazde. This protest meeting--these people here--are yet 
another of many proofs that the chetniks have not withdrawn 3 km 
from the town center, because that is where the aforementioned 
villages are situated. [passage omitted]

  [Text] United Nations, April 26 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
will not hesitate in calling air strikes if Bosnian Serbs do not 
remove all heavy artillery within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of 
Gorazde, U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said Tuesday 
in Barbados. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has 
threatened to bomb Serb positions if the equipment is not 
withdrawn from around the Moslem enclave by 0001 GMT Wednesday. 
"If they don't withdraw, then we will use air strikes against 
them without any hesitation," he said in a press conference in 
Barbados broadcast at the United Nations. 
  NATO and the United Nations have several times threatened 
air 
raids to protect Bosnian Moslems in UN-declared safe areas but 
never actually carried them out except for two strikes two weeks 
ago to protect UN peacekeepers. 
  "I am hoping that the Serbs will comply with the different 
resolutions which have been adopted by the UN and that they will 
leave Gorazde and that we will not be compelled to use air 
strikes," he said. 
  UN forces in the former Yugoslavia have said that the heavy 
weapons are being withdrawn as the deadline approaches. 
  The secretary general has been in the Caribbean island of 
Barbados since the weekend to open a world conference for 
sustainable development for small states.

  [Text] Zagreb, April 26 (AFP) -- The United Nations 
suspended Tuesday all aid convoys inside Bosnia-Herzegovina, a 
spokesman said here. Manoel de Almeida, a spokesman for the UN 
High Commissioner for Refugees, said the convoys had been 
suspended on security grounds. Serb forces face a 0001 GMT 
deadline to pull their heavy weapons away from Gorazde or face 
NATO air strikes. All active convoys in the war-torn former 
Yugoslav republic returned to their bases by mid-afternoon 
Tuesday in line with the directive, which the spokesman 
described as a "completely normal procedure." 
  De Almeida said an aid convoy which left Belgrade Tuesday 
morning for the battered eastern Bosnian enclave of Goradze -- 
the third to set out for the town -- returned to the Serbian 
capital later in the day after being blocked by Serbian forces 
at the border. An earlier convoy from Belgrade which had been 
blocked by Serb forces arrived Tuesday morning in Gorazde, said 
the UNHCR's spokesman in Serbia, Lyndall Sachs. The first 
convoy to reach Gorazde after Bosnian Serb forces eased a 
three-week siege of the town arrived there Sunday.

  [Excerpts] Zvornik, 27 Apr (TANJUG) -- General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, the chief of the general staff of the republic of 
Srpska army, told TANJUG's correspondent this evening that 
General Michael Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, had violated the Belgrade agreement in 
the most blatant way. The UNPROFOR abused the agreed procedure 
regarding flights to Gorazde and sent to this enclave four 
helicopters that did not land in Sokolac. At the same time, 
taking advantage of the permission obtained from the Serb side 
for two helicopters that were checked in Sokolac, another four 
helicopters with unidentified cargo took off for Gorazde in 
their radar shadow using the same corridor. [passage omitted] 
  At 1000 today, Gen. Milovanovic was told over the telephone 
that the UNPROFOR did not want a check in Sokolac on its way to 
Gorazde. The chief of the general staff of the republic of 
Srpska army disputed this, stressing that it would be a serious 
departure from the negotiated agreement. At about 1230, General 
Rose announced his departure for Gorazde, on condition that the 
helicopter did not stop in Sokolac. However, UNPROFOR's 
(?helicopter) squadron commander arrived in Sokolac with a 
Serbian inspection team to allegedly clarify the disagreement. 
When the Serbian side rejected the squadron commander's 
explanation he agreed to send two helicopters to be checked in 
Sokolac. 
  Taking advantage of the permission granted by the Serbian 
side to allow the two helicopters through, four other 
helicopters took off for Gorazde in their [radar] shadow using 
the same corridor and time slot, bypassing Sokolac. The same 
happened on their way back.

  [Text] According to the [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] 1st 
Corps Information Service, the aggressor has stepped up 
activities recently regarding movements and regrouping of men 
and weapons around Sarajevo. The chetniks have taken the 
artillery that was under UN control and positioned it in 
Vranjes, on Mt. Trebevic, and in Grbavica. Several explosions 
have been heard in (Demino Brdo) [words indistinct] at Hrasno 
Hill, Dobrinja Five, the Zeljo soccer stadium in Grbavica, the 
ministry of internal affairs school in Vrace, and [word

accompanied every day by sporadic and provocative small arms 
fire aimed at the defense lines of our city.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 28 April carries in its 
regular 10-minute newscast three reports on the current 
situation on the fronts in the republic. 
  The Brcko correspondent Hamid Deronjic reports that "last 
night, at 1800 the chetniks launched a fierce tank and infantry 
attack on the region of Boderiste which lasted until 2200. The 
destructive tank and artillery fire was supported by fierce 
antiaircraft guns and small arms' fire. Our reconnaissance 
units' reports abound with information on the influx of fresh 
Serbian reinforcements on the Brcko front. The chetniks are 
placing artillery in almost all strongholds around the free 
Brcko territory, while the enemy manpower is concentrating in 
front of the positions of the 100th Motorized and 100th Infantry 
Brigades in the areas of Vranovaca and Boderiste. At the same 
time, the chetniks are reinforcing their positions around 
Djukici and Boderiste with armored-mechanized hardware. Such 
elaborate preparations for the continuation of the chetnik 
offensive, whose first phase lasted a full 14 days, imply that 
the future chetnik attacks on the free Brcko territory will be 
fierce. However, it seems that not all Serbs in Brcko are ready 
to continue the war against their former fellow citizens of 
Muslim and Croatian nationality. Namely, this morning, at 
around 0800, the Serbian Consultative Council clearly and 
decisively rejected the criminal policy of the Serbian 
Democratic Party." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation in the Bihac area 
and says that "the joint attacks of Karadzic's fascists and 
Abdic's rebel paramilitary forces continued overnight and this 
morning on the free part of the Bihac commune. Indiscriminately 
and at various times, the chetniks targeted the defense 
positions on the Buzim, Bosanska Krupa, and [name indistinct] 
part of the front. They continued using antiaircraft weaponry 
on the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau [words indistinct]. There is 
no peace on demarcation lines with Abdic's paramilitary forces. 
Provocations are registered continuously along all the defense 
lines." 
  Correspondent Izudin Durakovic reports from Gracanica and 
says that "in the early morning hours, the chetniks began their 
attacks on the defense lines in the theater of operations of the 
109th Doboj and 111th Gracanica Brigades. Using weapons of all 
calibers from the well-known chetnik strongholds -- Sjenina, 
Paleznica, Skipovac, Rajcevac, and Kostajnica -- the chetniks 
fired the greatest number of shells at Obric, Vukovac, and 
(?Banjik). This shelling is just preparation for the [words 
indistinct] enemy infantry attacks [words indistinct]. Since 
the enemy is not choosing his targets and shells are landing on 
the town of Gracanica, a general alarm has been in effect since 
0800 this morning. All the attacks over the past few weeks 
imply that the chetniks have drawn up new borders and that this 
explains the relentless attacks on the Doboj-Klokotnica, 
Sjenina-Obric, and (?Tanjik)-Hukovac routes."

<F P=106> [7th Corps Information Service report] </F>
  [Text] After the days-long futile attempts of Karadzic's 
army to capture our defense lines on the Vlasic plateau, a part 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 7th Corps elite units, in a strong 
counteroffensive, this morning managed to break through the 
Chetnik lines and capture the wider area of Mt. Neokrnje located 
in the triangle between the Travnik, Teslic, and Skender Vakuf 
communes. 
  Our defenders' action has significantly expanded the free 
territory on the Vlasic plateau. Dozens of Chetniks have been 
killed and we have captured a nice collection of material and 
technical equipment [words indistinct] -- a 105-mm howitzer, a 
Praga antiaircraft weapon, a SAM-110 vehicle, 120-mm mortar, a 
antiaircraft machine gun mounted on a tractor, (?several pieces) 
of small caliber weaponry, and a substantial quantity of 
ammunition and military equipment. As we file this report, the 
members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 7th Corps have captured 
the mountain resort on Mt. Neokrnje which the Chetniks used as 
quarters for manpower and hardware during battles.
